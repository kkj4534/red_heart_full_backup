      "description": "Basically, my brother (16) was playing on his PS4 still at 4 am while talking to someone through his headset. It woke me up so i went to his room and asked him to stop talking as me and my parents were all sleeping (or well, trying to). He got into a rage and yelled at me to fuck off and get out of his room. \n\nAs his PS4 is connected with a cable to the router in my room, i told him if he didnt stop talking i’d cut his internet off. Not even 5 seconds later he was talking loudly again so i cut all the internet to his room off and went back to bed. He stormed into my room yelling like a psycho telling me to put the internet back on ‘or else’. I told him no as its 4 am and everyone wants to sleep. He got so angry that he threw his playstation controller and his phone on the floor (which are both broken now). This also woke up our parents who got mad at me for ‘being dramatic in the middle of the night’\n\nSo, who is the asshole here?",

      "title": "AITA for hating when my mom tells me other people’s business?",
      "description": "I have a stressful relationship with my mother, it’s somewhat of a situation where I grew up being treated like her therapist through listening to her marriage issues, thinking it was cool I was “best friends with my mom.” She tends to guilt trip and results majorly to emotional manipulation tactics to make us all feel like shit instead of telling us what’s wrong.\n\nThat being said, she tells me way too much about other people.\n\nIf she hears something personal from a “friend” at work (I can’t tell if she hates everyone she’s “friends” with or not) she will tell me. It’s not my business, and it makes me incredibly angry. I’m talking things like her friend catching her very young daughter watching porn, she will tell me every detail. At this particular instance I asked her if her friend wants her going around telling people about this incident, and she didn’t have an answer beyond “well, I have to talk to SOMEONE.”\n\nShe blew up recently when she told me about a very close family member having an abortion that no one knew about. It doesn’t change my opinion of this family member, not at all, but it infuriates me that she was trusted with this secret and spouted it off to me. There was no reason for her to tell me or anyone else. I told her as such. I don’t want to hear things about other people that aren’t my business. She went on this whole rant about how she’s all alone, she has no one to talk to, and everyone hates her. \n\nClearly, her rant was a guilt trip, I’ve grown up with her emotional manipulation and it doesn’t affect me to an extent, but it has me wondering if I’m being an asshole for not letting her “rant” or whatever.\n\nBut is it wrong that I don’t want to hear stuff that wasn’t meant for my ears? I understand sometimes needing to talk to someone, but when she’s actually venting it’s usually about my dad, which isn’t something you go to your kid about, and it fucked me up when I was younger.",

      "description": "First, some background.  I'm a pretty laid back guy and generally I don't let things bother me.  My wife, however, is more sensitive to how other people treat her.  I have 2 kids and my brother has 1.  My mother DOTES on the one child (my brother's), and to some extent ignores my children.  When my children excel at something, there is usually a comment about how the golden child can do that easily or how that thing is actually not very hard.  The golden child is showered with gifts, while my children are lucky if my mom remembers their birthday.  Oh, and my mother takes care of the golden child (babysits daily, drives him to classes, pays for classes) and maybe sees my children once a month.  This is partly because my brother is a single parent and doesn't really take care of his kid.  In general this has not bothered me, but my wife doesn't like the fact that my mother is not treating all her grandchildren equally.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few years and all this behavior continues.  My mom then falls and breaks her hip and requires surgery.  When we are looking where she can go recuperate, I tell her she can't come to my house to recuperate. She likely wanted to come to my house because my wife is a stay at home mom and thus would be around all the time to help her out.  I can't recall the excuse I used but the real reason was my wife didn't want the stress of 1) being told her children are not as good as the golden child and 2) having the golden child now babysat at our house because that's where my mother would be and 3) seeing that differential treatment in her face on a daily basis.  She returned to her own house for recuperation.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo was I an asshole?  \n\n  ",

      "description": "Sorry for the format im on mobile.\n\n\nSo today I had class and my roomate (lets call him tom) too, we finished class at the same time ans headed home only to realize we forgot our keys. Since we're in school dorms, there's always a person in charge of the dorms that has a spare key. I proposed we go and see that person, but he refused to do so because be was scared that we'd look stupid. So I told him that I won't be going for him (he's the type of guy that will let people do the work for him if the occasion presents itself) and that I would appreciate it if he came with me instead of sitting sround on his ass, because let's keep in mind this is a spare key and I have to return it immediately after im done using it. Knowing him, he probably would of told me like \"im not returning it\" or \"gove him tomorrow. \n\nWhile all that was happening my other roomate (jerry) asked me if i found a way in (i texted him that we got locked out) and i replied \"no, but tom is being a fcking kid he doesnt want to go see the person for the dorms, im not going for him im fucking tired of always doing everything)\n\nSo he texted our third roomate (jerry) and asked him for his keys, but he was at the gym. So tom texts one of our friends and asks him for a lift to the gym so he can get jerry's keys. The friend accepted and we headed to get jerry's keys.\n\nWhen we arrived, my roomate jerry was coming out of the gym, we told him that we needed his keys. He asked us if we went and see the person in charge lf the dorms and Tom replied no.\n\nSo jerry got pissed and I got out of the car to talk with him, he told me \"why is tom such a fucking child, why do you have to take my keys? You could  went and got the other key\"\n\nHe then gives me the key, i thank him and get back in the car. And tom heard everything and tells me \"wtf you told him i disnt want to go see the dorms person, you guys always tell each other secrets and shit\"\n\nSo that's pretty much it, AITA because i didnt want to go get/and return the spare key for him.

      "title": "AITA for not inviting a girl I’ve been seeing over for Christmas with my family.",
      "description": "I apologize in advance for the length. There is a tl;dr at the end.\n\nA little background: I’ve been seeing a girl, let’s call her Sarah, for about seven months now. We aren’t dating, at least it’s not official and know she’s gone on dates with other guys and I’ve gone on dates with other girls during that time period. Although, she recently admitted she only wants to be with me. I told her I’d rather keep things casual, so we agreed I wouldn’t sleep with other girls while we’re together. In turn, I can still hang out with other girls. \n\nI like Sarah, we have a great time together. She’s intelligent, witty, and can make me laugh so much I’m sore the next day. We have similar interests, the same music, similar hobbies, ect. But in contrast, the girl has no filter. She will bring inappropriate topics during conversations they have no place in. I constantly have to keep telling her not to talk about certain things. A few examples are topics like what what drugs we took at music festivals, our sex life in detail, lots of personal things I’ve told her I don’t want broadcasted to the world. \n\nI brought her out with some coworkers for drinks one night. I manage a small team of individuals, and  they were giving me shit about much of a hardass I can be. One of them said I should smoke some weed, and she announced I already do smoke. Made some really out of place jokes, honestly could have cost me my job if someone in the group decided to tell HR. \n\nNow getting the main point here. Sarah doesn’t have any family out here. She comes from a broken home, her mom killed herself, and her dad raised her and her brother alone. Put them both through college. On the 15 year anniversary of her mother’s suicide, her father killed himself. \n\nMy family in contrast is completely different. My dad is an incredibly successful business man, and not very open minded. My mom is a kindergarten teacher with like 4 degrees in education. My sister and brother both have their PHDs, and great jobs. All of them are incredibly conservative people, and very hard on each other especially people we date. All they want to talk about are their careers, politics, and sports. They know nothing about the partying I do, the people I associate with - and god forbid they found out about the life I was living. My parents would disown me.\n\nMy previous relationship was four years long and they adored her. We broke up because we felt we were better as friends than in a relationship. But now anyone I bring someone home, they criticize the shit out of them and are generally outright rude. \n\nI’ve told Sarah all of this. She doesn’t understand, she thinks she can handle being around them. If I bring a smartass girl with green hair, a bunch of piercing, over to my parents place they are going to judge her immediately. And as soon as she starts talking I know something incredibly inappropriate or personal is going to come up. I told her a firm no, she cannot come. She started crying and left. \n\nShe took all of this really hard. In her mind, I am ashamed of her and embarrassed by her. And to a degree she is not wrong, in certain situations she can embarrass me. I don’t want to be ashamed in front of my parents, more-so I don’t want to deal with the fallout. \n\nShe told me she really doesn’t want to be alone for Christmas. Told me how much she misses her parents. She cried and screamed at me. Called me a bunch of names, told me she wasting her time trying living up to my standards. That’d she’d never good enough. I told her she should find someone else if that’s how she really feels. Then I tried to call myself and her down, I said we should both take some time to think things through because we weren’t being rational. \n\nWe haven’t talked for five days and she’s ignoring me. Her friends have sent me some particularly rude texts. \n\nI know what I did was incredibly insensitive. Everyone I’ve told said I was a dick, except a couple of my close friends who have actually met my family. \n\nTl;dr - smartass alternative girl I’m seeing is going to be alone for Christmas because I don’t want her around my family. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So I’ve been wanting to get my own dog for a while now. I want a dog that will be just my dog, not a family dog so I can take it with me when I move out of my parents house after finishing college. I’m 20, have volunteered hundreds of hours at animals shelters and have worked with dogs since I was 16. I’ve also grown up with dogs my entire life. I want to buy a purebred, AKC registered pup as my first dog. I want that because there’s a specific breed that is well suited to my life style. I also want to know the dog’s entire history, and can be present in my dog’s life from the very beginning. \n\nMy family has frequently mentioned that I’m selfish for buying a dog instead of adopting. They say I’m encouraging puppy mills (which isn’t where I’m getting the dog from). They tell our currents dogs that I’m “shopping for a shiny new replacement dog”. It’s starting to get to me so I’m just curious if this makes me an asshole. I fully understand that there’s tons of dogs that need a home, but for my first dog I want to eliminate as many unknown factors as possible. When I feel more equipped to handle a shelter dog with many gaps in their history, then of course I would adopt a dog. \n",

      "description": "Am I the asshole for joking about my GF’s parents being involvement in MLMs?\n\nSo I’m 18, and I’ve been dating GF for over a year now. And while we’ve been dating for a substantial amount of time, there’s still a lot I don’t know about her family (especially her parents) because they don’t fully support our relationship nor do they care to know much about me. \n(That’s another story within itself but nvm for now. My relationship with her folks is \nsemi-friendly)\n\nAnyways, I’m on YouTube and out of random curiosity I decided to look up my girlfriend’s parents because I know they make YouTube videos for fun. I honestly expected to find some embarrassing family videos about my GF and maybe some clips of family reunions or something. I don’t really know, I was just bored. I ended up finding her mom’s YouTube account and while I’m scrolling through her old videos I See a thumbnail with GF’s mom holding up\nA bottle of vitamin supplements and essential oil‘s. \nNow, I don’t know much about MLM’s, in fact the only times I hear about them is on Reddit’s r/antimlm so already my opinion of their business practices are bias. I click on the video and sure enough it’s of GF’s mom trying to convince the viewers that they need to invest in her MLM. I found it funny because her mom has always seemed like that type of person to push an MLM and get sucked into that type of industry and I could imagine her shamelessly promoting these products to everyone. \nSo, I’m checking out a couple other MLM videos made by my GF’s mom and at the time I laugh and think that this will be a funny/lighthearted Conversation to talk to my girlfriend about. \nBoy, was I wrong...\n\nMy GF ends up calling me while I’m going through some other videos her mom has made, and eventually we get to the subject of her mom’s MLM videos. She tells me that she’s familiar with their business practices and that they’ve actually made some money from it. \nI joked around saying that “ it must be hard for them to sell miracle tonics in this Day and age” because in my head, essential oil‘s are a complete scam in regards to what they claim to do for you. I go on to joke about the shameless marketing tactics I could imagine her parents pulling in order to sell their essential oil‘s (Sharing it to every one they know, and putting it on all their social media’s etc).\nGF realized that I was making fun of her parents and their MLM and she shifted into a more hostile tone. \nRealizing this, I back off and say that I’m only poking fun because I’ve heard about the more questionable side of multilevel marketing businesses, but she wasn’t having it. \nMy GF told me that she’s 100% positive that her parents I have made a lot of money from these companies and that a lot of her childhood was centered around her parents pushing these products (essential oils, etc). \nI didn’t know that she felt so strongly towards the subject and I begin to genuinely apologize for hurting her feelings, When she hangs up on me.\n\nAm I the ass?",

      "description": "Background: I ordered a cable online on a Monday for first class delivery, expected Wednesday. It’s an official Apple cable so yknow, it’s moderately expensive as cables go. Wednesday comes and goes, by Friday there’s still no update on the tracking since Tuesday so I ring up the delivery company, famed delivery-dodgers Royal Mail. They can’t tell me anything and tell me to speak to Apple.\n\nSo I speak to Apple and their customer support people can’t get any extra information on it either, so they say they’ll send another one out as it seems this one has gotten lost. They say if it does eventually arrive I can send it back “if I want”. I ask at the time to explicitly clarify and they tell me I can keep it if I want, or I can send it back, in the eventuality I end up with two cables.\n\n(Btw, I asked not because I want two of these cables but because I don’t want the hassle of packaging, labelling, and going to the Post Office to return it. That seriously messes with my lazy, deliveries to my door, not leaving my house lifestyle)\n\nOne of my friends had recently mentioned that they were going to get one of these cables so I joke with them that they can have it if it turns up (although I am convinced it is lost forever in one of the many black holes I assume Royal Mail’s facilities are riddled with).\n\nThe second one that got sent out got delivered on Monday (thank you DHL and thank you Apple for sending it courier). Fast forward to today, Wednesday, and wouldn’t you know it but the first one arrives too (just one week late, 9 day delivery for 1st class post, good work Royal Mail!)\n\nI mentioned to my girlfriend that I’ll be giving it to my friend. She asked why I’m not selling it. I explained that I thought that would be immoral, by rights I only paid for one cable and the other was sent out assuming the first was lost. I know Apple said I can keep it, but I’m only doing that out of laziness - if I wasn’t too lazy to go to the Post Office and ship it, I should send it to Apple rather than whoever buys it off me on eBay.\n\nShe thinks it wouldn’t be wrong to sell it, that Apple gave me the second cable to reimburse me for the hassle of not getting what I paid for (the cable by the specified date), the inconvenience of not having it when I needed it, and having to contact them to get things sorted. Apple told me I could keep it so both cables are mine, to do what I want with.\n\nSo, help me out here Reddit. Would I be morally wrong if I sold that cable, or am I entitled to?",

I've told him the key is playing what you want and with a personality and backstory you enjoy, but the advice seems to go on deaf ears.\n\nHe wants to make a halfling monk. Originally he wanted no personality and to just be a boring person who hits bad guys, a parody of Kenshiro from fist of the north star. I told him not to because it'll get boring fast, so now he wants to make this halfling a former slave, named Garbage, who is an urchin and adherent to Ilmarter.\n\nI tell him that Garbage is a bad name. And then how he should pick a name his character would be proud of. After this becomes a heated argument of me picking apart is backstory, he accuses me of constantly putting down his ideas, that im selfish, and want everything to be about me. And that i make dnd unfun to play. Granted this is after a week of him asking for my help, only to throw away the advice i give because it doesn't fit his idea.\n\nAm i the asshole for trying to dictate what is and isn't good in my brothers character?

      "description": "trying to not make this long. I've known him since I was 9. Never liked him. Didn't like his jokes, had obvious favorites when it came to me and my siblings, always contradicted my mom (she would say no, and he would say yes, blatantly playing \"good cop\"), never grounded my brother for anything wrong he did and as a result my brother's a bitch, and I guess in part I resented my mom for seemingly needing a man by her side. in my mind, if she wasn't with my dad, then she shouldn't be with anyone (selfish of me, ik). I sort of got over it. I tolerated him. But then (2016) he came and tried to \"lecture\" me for fighting with my brother, saying how he's much bigger than me and he could kill me (exaggerating). This pissed me off and I told him why wasn't he telling him anything. What made me mad was that he was just telling me instead of both. You know, I like fairness. I didn't think it was fair. So I stopped talking to him completely. To this day I still don't acknowledge his presence. What kills me is that I'm truly sorry, but I don't know how. I already tried in the past but he ignored me (maybe bc I tried playing it off like nothing happened and just out of nowhere one day said good morning). I didn't know apologizing was such a difficult thing to do. He has done a lot for us, like taking us in, and trying not so much to be a father figure but a friend at the very least. So I rlly feel like an ungrateful bitch. Not so much but I know I am. It's a fact. I'm moving out soon and I plan to try my best to say sorry and thanking him for everything. So AITA? I already know the answer and it's yes. This was mostly to vent.",

(Fake names) I’ve been seeing Jen for a year and a half. Jen comes over 1 or 2 times a week and sometimes we go out to eat or drink also. We’ve gone on a few weekend getaways together within a few hour radius also. We’ve agreed that we both don’t want a relationship with each other and not to be exclusive, but there’s clearly some feelings on her side. However she insists on continuing on. She also knows of  the other girl I’m seeing. \n\nNow the other girl Sam. We’ve been seeing each other about 6 months. She sleeps over about once a week. Sometimes we go to dinner. There’s a good chance we’d be together if she wasn’t leaving for law school in a few months. We both like each other a lot but agreed to not be bf/gf or exclusive (although this happened months ago and hasn’t been brought up again).

      "description": "This is a post about shit, but it's not a shitpost. A while back I was at my parent's place with some friends playing Knights of the Old Republic 2 when another friend of ours showed up. He came in, we all said hi and he walked through the room and past us towards the hall. A few minutes later he comes back and asks if the toilet works. I tell him oh no, it doesn't - it's clogged and the plumber's not coming for a few days, so don't use it. He says he already did use it, he took a shit and now it won't flush.\n\nWe all debate for a while what to do. I admit that I should have noticed he was probably going to the bathroom, and should have told him the toilet doesn't work, but I was really engrossed in the game and he didn't say he was going to the bathroom. We can't keep the shit in there; the bathroom already smelled bad because the toilet wasn't working and that would make it unusable for a few days (there was another one upstairs, for context). \n\nUltimately we decided that, although it wasn't his fault per se, my friend had to fish his shit out of the toilet and dispose of it. We all figured it's just two much to ask me to clean up his shit. A little backstory on this guy - he is \\*\\*extremely\\*\\* grossed out by shit and shitting. Obviously it's gross in general but this man is especially and unusually weirded out by feces. So he kind of panics and throws a little tantrum about it, but ultimately agrees to do it. I give him a ladle and some gloves and he gets it done. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas I the asshole? I won't lie, we kind of teased him about it before and after, although we abided by his request not to watch him while he was doing it. ",

      "description": "I live in a house at school with 4 other people. So a few months ago this guy moves out and gets this girl to move in. We all had to sign a form for her to move in which one of us did not since he did not want her moving here. The people who run the place let her move in anyways, however she does not inform them that she has a dog (having a pet requires an extra monthly fee).\n\nAnyways I find out recently that her dog is left in a cage for 10 hours a day almost every day while she is at work. After some research I learn that her type of dog requires lots of time to run around and things to do otherwise it can develop destructive habits and psychological issues. On top of this I have also noticed that he has no sunlight in the room, and his water dish had no water (so I gave it some).\n\nSo this morning she sends me a text belittling me since the sink was full of dishes (I and my friend who lives here are the only ones who have ever done it and she has not done it once). Eventually I say ok, I will do it, but you need to give your dog something to do all day. I told her she should get a walker or something, and also offered to take it out during the day myself. She basically told me it was her dog and that she knew what was best for it and that I should mind my own business.\n\nWe end up informing the main office about her dog and how we were not comfortable with how she was treating it. They said that she was in violation of her lease by not telling them she had a dog and that she will be relocated. I know she’s tight on money and she may not be able to afford the fine that’s coming to her, but this may mean that she has to send her dog back to her parents or something and it won’t be suffering any more. I know it may not be “my business” what’s happening with this dog, but it’s an intelligent, living thing, living in our house, so I felt like I had to do something.",

      "description": "This was a while back but I went to some swanky bar in San Fran and this cute girl started talking to me. She was a little bit forward, which was somewhat unsettling.\n\nBut we went back to my place and things got weird from there. She started demanding that I order pizza because she was hungry. And then she grabbed my laptop and put on some really obscure movie. When the pizza got here, she started jamming it into her face with no plate or anything. On my bed. \n\nThe next morning I offer to buy her breakfast. Really I just wanted to get her out of my apartment because I was becoming increasingly unattracted to her. \n\nProblem was that every restaurant was closed. So after about the 3rd restaurant she started saying that I could just take her home. So I agreed and started headed to the next block over where my car was parked. She must have liked me and been nervous. But the stuff she was saying was just... weird.\n\nI tried to blow it off but then she said words I'll never forget, \"What kind of car do you have? If I like it I might just have to steal it!\"\n\nI mean. Of course. Of course she's kidding. Right? \n\nBut it was the maniacal cackle that followed that made me start thinking. What if she liked me and I didn't like her back...how would she handle that? \n\nI nervously decided against bringing her to my car. I just didn't like the idea of night after night having my car parked out on the street completely vulnerable. \n\nInstead of bringing it up, my instinct was to think of some way out of this. \n\nI was spinning myself up thinking of all the crazy horror stories I've heard on Reddit. That's when I resorted to drastic measures. \n\nI kept insisting that I treat her to breakfast. That it was the right thing to do. Wouldn't take no for an answer.\n\nMy plan was to invite her to sit down, go to use the men's room, and then simply never return to the table. I didn't know what else to do. \n\nBut after literally the 8th restaurant we went to was closed (wtf), I began to panic. How was I going to get away from this woman without taking her to my car?\n\nThat's when I saw the shining beacon. A tiny convenience mart. I walked in, grabbed a frozen steak sandwich, some kinda potato, and an orange juice. I told her to get whatever she wants and I set my stuff on the counter. \n\nShe was in back of the store. I was in the front. I put my index finger up at the clerk to signal like I just received a phone call. I held my hand over the phone and said, \"gotta take this, put everything on my tab.\" He looked confused. I didn't care. \n\nI walked out slowly. As soon as I was out of sight, I shoved my phone in my pocket and ran faster than I ever ran before. \n\nI heard her call after me like 30 seconds later. She said, \"wait, where are you going!?\"\n\nWithout looking back or slowing down I yelled, \"it's an emergency!\"\n\nShe was pissed. Started sending me angry texts. I just apologized and said it was a personal emergency. \n\nBut at least she doesn't know what my car looks like. ",

      "description": "\n\nMe and A started being friends in 6th grade. We were both dorky middle schoolers who liked videogames and were pretty much like brothers throughout middle school and high school.\n\nDuring highschool, I became friends with B, his current girlfriend of around 2 years now. We were never super close but we talked a lot and became good friends for about a year.\n\nI had a falling out with B between high school and college because she was telling her group of friends (who I really, really don't like, and vice versa) really personal things about me regarding my insecurities and feelings towards other people. We had always talked to each other about pretty heavy stuff, so understandably I was pretty upset and cut her off for a long time.\n\nDuring the period of time me and B were not talking, she became friends with A and eventually they started dating. During the early stages of their relationship I eventually came back around and became friends with her for the sake of peace between me, A, and her.\n\nThis started to fall apart over time because B started talking to me about the issues she was having in their relationship; really personal shit like issues with their sex lives and her jealousy towards other girls he was friends with. When I told her I didn't want to know this information, she would get mad at me and go to A and say that I was trying to \"undermine their relationship\" by \"getting involved\" even though she was the one that was giving me this information. She eventually got so mad at me that she screen capped a dirty joke I made about someone we don't like and sent it to the person that the joke was about, trying to soil my reputation.\n\nThis caused issues between me and A, as he was now stuck between tension between his best friend and his girlfriend. Me and him eventually worked through it, and were fine with each other but there was still tension present and over time we have kind of stopped talking. Me and B are still acquaintances, and she has attempted to try and start conversations with me but I have been short with her and purposely kept contact to a minimum.\n\nI miss the relationship me and A had but the conclusion I've arrived at is that I can't trust him so long as he is with B. I don't want to continue being friends and seeking emotional support from a guy who is dating someone who has repeatedly abused this information in the past.\n\nI don't want to throw away a friendship of almost 10 years, but I don't see a future where I can be around him so long as he is intimate with B. I don't like her as a person, and as they get closer and more serious I don't think it's worth the risk anymore.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hello everyone I’ll try to make this short. My [F27] mom [F50’s] and i planned a girls trip to universal studios this past Monday and yesterday she surprised me with tickets to Disney as well. It’s been amazing spending time with her and bonding since we haven’t in a while now that I moved across the country. We are set to go home today. Yesterday, we met two really nice people— they are siblings and we all got along so well and spent the last part of our night riding the rides with them. \nWe all laughed harder than we had all day and they begged us to stay an extra day. Now I am having a really hard time making friends where I live now and it’s been over a year that I actually hung out with people my age. \nMy mom can’t stay an extra day because she has to work and I have the entire week off for spring break. If we go back to my mom’s  house ( which is 4 hours away in car) I would just be sitting at the house waiting until my flight back home for Saturday. I don’t have any friends back where my mom lives. I really want to live in the moment and do something fun but I would never want to hurt my mom in the process. We both looked forward to this trip so much. My mom would also drive back on her own or fly back. Which she already said she would do but I feel like she may just be saying that. Help please?",

      "description": "Hello, Reddit. 17m here. I’m a senior in high school, coasting for the last few months as I’ve already gotten into college. What you are about to read happened in my 0800 AP Lit class. \n\nSome background: Depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD have all spawned in my brain from numerous traumas in my life. I’ve also been bullied in school constantly since sixth grade. As such, school is a terrifying environment for me. \n\nAs such, I sit in the back in every class because people used to throw shit at me and I hate the feeling of people looking at me from behind/being behind me in lines, lecture halls, etc. \n\nSo yesterday, I walked into 0800 AP Lit, planning to sit in my Back Row Seat. \n\nNo such luck. Blonde Girl (BG) was in my Back Row Seat, smoothie and math binder spread out over the two-person desk. Keep in mind, this is AP Lit. \n\nMe: That’s my seat. \n\nBG: Does it really matter?\n\nNow, Reddit, I was a little high. Yes, I am underage and in school, but I had a rough morning and, as such, took one (1) hit off my dab pen before walking into class. Sue me. The unfortunate effect of this, however, was that my normally witty and loquacious mind was dampened by wondeful cannabis indica. I stared. \n\nMe (after a noticable stoner pause): Um. No, I guess. I just thought-\n\nBG: I can move (in a tone that implied “If you make me move, I will hate you”)\n\nMe (high, tired, non-confrontational): Okay. I’ll just sit here then. \n\nI sit in the nearest seat, which is not a back row seat. After two minutes, I get really twitchy as my anxiety starts acting up, and I grab my stuff and move to the back row. A few minutes later, BG’s friend Popular Boy (PB) walks in and sits next to her. They talk and are generally disruptive for the whole lesson.\n\nFlash forward to today.\n\nReddit, I walked into 0800 AP Lit to find BG not only sitting in my Back Row Seat but plopping her purse on the seat next to her, obviously saving it for PB. \n\nMe: I’d like my seat back, please. \n\nBG: I have to talk to PB. \n\nI just stare at her. She gets up and moves to another seat. Then, what she said kicks in. \n\nMe: You hAvE to talk to PB?!\n\nBG: Don’t mock me. \n\nMe: I have to sit in the back because of my anxiety disorder. But if you hAvE to talk to PB...\n\nShe just snorts and tosses her hair, then takes out her laptop to do work for another class. As soon as PB arrives, he sits next to her; she immediately starts bitching to him about me. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for what I said/did?\n\n\n",

      "description": "So a few months ago I had to do some major work on my motorcycle. My mate offered to lend me his hoist which is specifically designed to make the job I was doing much easier.\n\nIt is a pretty big bit of equipment and they are generally fairly expensive to buy so while I was grateful for the assistance, once I was finished the job I wanted to get this thing out of my shed. \n\nUpon asking my mate when would be a good time to bring it back round he tells me he has no space for it and asks if I could keep it at my place for a while. At this point I wanted to show gratitude for the favour so I said sure. 3 months go by and i didn't bring it up because again I don't want to sound like a prick but I'm running out of space in my garage. So I ask him again and he says the same thing to which I reply \"I can't hold on to thing forever I have no space\". He just laughs and changes the subject. \n\nIt's been almost 8 months now and it's like he doesn't want it but everytime I try get him to take it back he dodges around it. If I just tell him to come and get it or I'm throwing it out am I an asshole?",

      "description": "Okay, I know how to title sounds, but I'll explain.\n\nThere's this girl, Lily, who's been a good friend of mine for a few months. I kinda fancy'd her, to be honest, but she has/had (not sure) a boyfriend, so I respected it and never did anything about it.\n\nLast thursday I was away from my home country, I was in London visiting my brother. She called around dinner time, sobbing, saying her boyfriend cheated on her with a \"friend\" of her. She said she wanted to be with me, and I told her I was away until monday (today). She said alright, I told her to call me back in a few minutes because I could talk while I made dinner. She never did call me back.\n\nSince that night, I texted her once a day just saying \"hey lily, hope all's alright with you. I noticed you went [somewhere she put on her insta story], hope you had a good time. Love you, kiss\". She never replied to any of those.\n\nFast forward to today, I sent her a message asking if she wanted to lunch (no answer), and two hours later I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee before my class. No answer either. I didn't really mind because I'm used to people taking a while to reply. However, after I get out of my class, I find her at the entrance hall of our university, chatting and laughing around with the guy who supposedly cheated on her a few days ago, and some other friends. I got damn pissed at that and just left without saying a word. She didn't really acknowledge me either. I feel like she made me look like an idiot. I honestly don't really want to hear any explanation, if it were a misunderstanding with her boyfriend she has a few days to tell me, but she said nothing at all. \n\nAm I in the wrong? Should I let her explain herself? What would be the best course of action here? AITA?",

      "description": "Context:\n\nI'm a white male who lives in a predominantly white area. I work in tech, and recently we interviewed a guy for a position on my team and he was awesome, really bright and a great culture fit. He also happened to be black.\n\n\nA few days ago, me and one of my other co-workers (we'll call him Jim) were talking to someone on our team (we'll call her Jane) about the new guy and how we were excited to have him start on such and such project since it hadn't gotten any love in a while. Somehow Jane brings up how we need to make sure we're careful about what we talk about around him. \n\nJim and I are both like, what?\n\nShe proceeds to say that she looked him up on Facebook and he has a lot of stuff on there about BLM and how as a member of BLM herself she wants to make sure that he is comfortable on our team. She also said that we need to be ok if he says anything about us being white and our privilege or something like that and that he gets a free pass with stuff like that.\n\n\nNow at this point I'm feeling very uncomfortable. \n\n\nShe's not done though. She then says that some of the jokes that I've made might come across as insensitive and that's one of the reasons why she's bringing all of this up. \n\n\nI wouldn't even call what she is referring to as a joke, it's more of a comical acknowledgement of some of the biases that exist in America. There have been a few times where something good happens to me and I attribute it to my white malehood in a kind of sarcastic but not in a white-privilege-isnt-real-look-at-how-stupid-liberals-are kind of sarcastic, more of a funny/sad kind of way. Like, it's kind of sad that even though there isn't any truth to the fact of me getting free extra guac on my burrito having to do with the fact that I'm a white male, there are other things in this world that are of similar consequence that I am privileged in simply due to what I look like. I'm not sure if it makes a whole lot of sense, but I personally feel that every time I've made that kind of joke/ remark, the undetone has always been that of, yeah I fully admit that the system is rigged and it's kind of messed up. Jane knows all of this too - we've talked about it how we both feel same way about the system. It's where the \"joke\" started.\n\n\nHer entire shpeal made me feel very very uncomfortable so I finally stopped her and was just like, \n\n\"Jane this entire conversation is inappropriate and is making me feel uncomfortable. You know as well as I do the subtext of the jokes that I've made. I think it's extremely disrespectful to (new guy) to talk about how we need to  treat him any different than any other person. If you just want to know that I'm not going to make any remarks about how messed up the system is in his first week, yeah I won't. I feel weird even talking about this whole thing. Also, btw, I don't care what you look like - nobody gets a free pass.\"\n\nAm I wrong?",

      "description": "I 23m I’m dating my gf who is 32f. The past year we were living with our parents money as we are both full time students, I gave up all my allowance to rent a flat for us with the condition she would pay the bills and food we ate, through the year this wasn’t the case as we were constantly out of money because she kept wasting it on coke cans and pre made food on her campus instead of cooking for herself she hasn’t turned on the stove in months.\nBut she was on her last semester so I let her go on with this so she could get her coke cans because she said it was the only way for her to work.\n\nSo I kept having to cover up for her and pay the flat and the bills for myself and trying to get money anywhere to eat. But this month she finished her degree and I told her she needed to get a job to help me pay the bills and food because the money her mom was giving her was over, but she told me it’s not fair, that I pay for the flat with the money my dad gives me so It doesn’t count and if she gets a job it’s not fair for her to pay all for the bills since my money doesn’t come from a job and we should pay them 50/50. To that I replied if you want to make this fair you should pay me for half of all the things so 50% of the flat 50% of the bills and 50% of the food.\n\nAITA for not wanting to pay for half of the bills because my dad gives me money to live with?

      "description": "I'm an independent provider (its legal here) and recently I mentioned to a friend that two of my regular clients are married and in one case the wife is not aware her husband meets a sex worker. He seemed to think it was incredibly wrong to be taking on married clients if both parties weren't aware, and since then he's talked to me much less. \n\nI am completely against cheating personally, but I don't believe I am an asshole for taking on married men as clients. If they dont cheat with me they'll cheat with someone else, I don't flirt with them to try to tempt them to cheat, they have to contact me themselves, meaning they have clearly made a conscious descision. \n\nIf I get an angry call from a wife who finds out about her husbands infidelity I'd feel sorry for her but at the end of the day it isn't my job to keep your husband under control. A couple of other providers local to me state on their page no married men, I suppose for this reason, but there are some marriages in which both parties are OK with another person being involved sexually. I see a man who's wife is in a wheelchair and cannot have sex, he sees me to get what he can't get from his wife and she is happy with that. \n\nEven if I put no married men, people would just lie anyway so it feels pointless to make this empty statement as it would just drive people to other providers. I know that sleeping with a married man is certainly morally grey, and I can for sure understand being an asshole to their wife, but I don't believe I'm an asshole in generally because of it. ",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to let my crush make sexual advances on me?",
      "description": "For context, I'm 16 years old and I'm very insecure about my looks, personallity, sexuality, etc. I came out as a lesbian to my family when I was 14, and lets just say they didn't take it well. Anyone who knows who I am knows that I'm out and theres no 'maybe' about my attractions. I've liked this girl (we'll call her Sam, for her sake) for quite some time, maybe a little bit over a year. We've been super close since 2nd grade (sometime in primary school, for the Brits) and until a few days ago I considered her to be one of my best friends.\n\nAbout a month ago we had a big dance coming up and all my other friends were trying to get me to ask her to be my date. After a lot of convincing, they finally talked me into it. I put together a poster board and waited for her to get off the bus. To my devastation, Sam softly rejected me, telling me that she saw me just as a friend, which is exactly what I was afraid of. I cried for hours, but later that day she texted me saying that she'd changed her mind. I was suspicious at first, but I slowly became excited and hopeful again.\n   \nFor the next 3 weeks, Sam was directing some sexual interest towards me. At first it was simply just remarks to friends, talking about the way I looked in my leggings and wanting to \"see what I was hiding underneath\".  I kind of just ignored it because I was on cloud nine and I didn't want her to be frustrated with my oppositions. Then it escalated to telling *me* how nice I would look without clothes, or describing to me in detail how much she wanted to 'pound my ass'. It made me uncomfortable, yet something in me continued to let her do this, because a nasty side of me liked the attention. Then it escalated further to putting her hand on my thighs during lunch or grabbing my tits in the hallways and calling me her slut. I hated it, and I asked her to stop politely, but she didn't.\n\nThis particular day I had asked Sam to carry my bassoon to the band room while I gathered my school stuff from my car. Instead of doing the favor as I had asked, she came up right behind me and tried to grab my tits again. This time I pushed her off and told her firmly to stop. She seemed frustrated, asking me 'why?' over and over. I repeated, \"because I'm not an object, amd you're treating me like one. It's making me uncomfortable\". She started to raise her voice, demanding why I had let her do it all this time without saying anything. I asked her why that mattered if I said 'no' and her face became bright red with anger. She dropped my bassoon onto the cement (no damage, thank god) and stormed off into the school, yelling about what a bitch I was and how she regretted meeting me. \n\nWe haven't spoken since. Since then I've decided against going to the dance with my friends, and I took a day off of school to recover. I feel like I did the right thing, but I still feel like an asshole for leading her on. Did I make the right choice?\n\n\n",

      "description": "I apologize if this has been a topic of discussion before, but I didn't see one when I searched Reddit.\n\nI am married with one child. We are a single income family that can comfortably afford to have one parent stay at home. Our child is the jewel of our lives. Well-behaved, intelligent, considerate; everything we could possibly want. Education is important to me, so I send her to the best private school I can afford, and we have an upper middle class standard of living overall. I am content with having a single child. \n\nMy spouse drops occasionally makes statements that she wants a second child. Whenever it does come in discussion, I list my arguments in a non-confrontational manner to why this isn't in the best interest of our family. We see how stressed our friends with multiple kids are, how little attention each kid gets in some of the larger families, and how it affects their development. Some of the other families in our daughter's school have discussed no being able to continually afford tuition. I'm in no way judging them, but it makes the point that there is less money to go around per-kid. I have a business background and often apply that scope of logic; I feel like with a second child takes resources from the first, and that will affect not only the children but the parents as well. With one child, we can take turns and give the other rest. Some of my co-workers have warned me about becoming \"outnumbered\" and the stress entailed with 2 or more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my arguments are generally met with - \"I can't explain it, I just feel like I want a second one.\" \n\nPart of me wonders if it is just a status symbol of having the American dream with two kids included. \n\nI worry about the added bills, the stress, and overall change to our lives. I worry about not being able to afford the best I can for both, yet knowing I reasonably could for one. \n\nAfter a lot of soul searching, I figure I'd rather deal with (and am trying to plan for) the added stress and financial strain of a second child than have that her regretting not having a second child.\n\nIf we did have a second child, I'd love it and do everything I could to provide it with the best possible life. But I get frustrated because I feel like this is less about providing the best for our children than it is about having more. \n\nEven if AITA, I'd be nice to get some outside perspective on finding some peace with the argument and figure out how to not be one.

(Shotgun is shit in pubg m) I got pissed off, went down and chucked a grenade in. He got knocked out. I didn't mean to leave him to die, and was about to revive him when a team rushed on us.

The other day I heard him make comments to our friend about this girl--specifically him saying that he didn't need our friend to invite any other girls on this trip because \"\\[Girl's name\\] is good enough for me!\" This morning things came to a head and I asked him to unfollow her. He responded by unfollowing her and then deleting his Instagram account because he \"might as well\" since it \"obviously creates problems.\" This is not the first time we've had an issue with him pushing boundaries with other women (for example, he let his ex stay at his house for a few weeks and lied to me about it) but it is the first time I've asked him to delete or block anyone, so I don't THINK I'm being unreasonable, but I don't know how to judge at this point.

      "description": "My friends and I were at a bar last weekend. We are all super close and talk about personal shit all the time. My closest friend, I'll call him Andy, began to go into a drunken rant about his girlfriend. For context, his girlfriend is very controlling and rude, and was giving him shit about going out with us that night, and doesn't like any of us despite us being very friendly around her. I also think she may be a drug addict, though I have no physical evidence of this. Anyway, in an equally drunken state, my friends and I began to berate Andy for having no balls, and I told him to \"dump that annoying bitch right now\". Andy seems to agree and we continue to enjoy our evening. The next day he texts me a long set of angry messages basically saying that I should either put up with his girlfriend or gtfo, and that he told her what I said and they had a huge fight and she hates me even more now, which I don't care about. But in a nutshell, he began to blame me for \"ruining\" their relationship and causing them to fight. I apologized but we're not on good terms at the moment. Am I the asshole here, or is Andy being dramatic?",

      "description": "Every Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter for the past 8 or so years my family has met up at my brothers house to hang out and eat. My SIL's parents come and sometimes different people bring friends over. It usually works out really well.  Everyone brings one or two dishes and we have a huge feast with enough leftovers for people to take home. Everyone usually brings the same things each time so there is no wondering what to make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter my beloved Grandparents passed away, I took over making pies for the gatherings. Everything went well for the first year or so but after that each holiday started becoming more frustrating for me.  My SIL's mother started to duplicate the dishes that I bring, even the pies, and with only about 10 people we really don't need 4 pies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, it didn't stop with the pies. Easter rolled around and the pickled beet eggs that I had been bringing for years were now copied. Again, we don't need 3 or 4 dozen pickled eggs for 10 people. Along with those my macaroni salad, deviled eggs, cakes and rolls have all been copied by the same person...without being asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt Thanksgiving this year a big deal was made by SIL's mother that everyone should take a piece of each pie and vote on who's was best. I just shrugged and left the room. I go there to see family, relax and have some good food, not for a competition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this year for Christmas I will not be making pies or anything else for my SIL's family. I will be making each of my family members their favorite treat and giving it to them as part of their gift. I really hope my SIL's mother enjoys the pie she brings, I'm skipping dessert this year. I'll be outside playing with the kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I have been doing the long distance thing for a few months now. It sucks, but we make it work by texting each other constantly, and if one of us is busy, at least once a day. It's mainly the usual stuff, just talking about our day, how much we miss each other, look at this funny meme, etc.\n\nNow, I will admit, I'm bad at texting. Not spelling, I just have a tendency to leave people on read by accident. It's usually when I think the current conversation has come to a conclusion, but I have trouble telling when that is. It also doesn't help that when I'm busy I tend to leave people on read when I glance at my phone really quick and don't reply. It's a bad habit, I know, I'm the devil reincarnated /s\n\nAnyways, lately we've both been busy, as I'm an engineering student and she's just started a new job. I've been studying tonight for an exam I have in the morning (I'm done now, I'm not procrastinating, promise), and my girlfriend and I got into a conversation about Valentines Day. Since this was the first time in a couple of days I had talked to her because of our schedules, I didn't tell her I was busy. Admittedly, I ended the conversation at a point where I teased her about me being below her best friend on the \"Best People In The World\" list before going back to studying.\n\nNow here's where I contemplate whether I'm the asshole or not: My girlfriend mother (who I have a love/hate relationship with) gives my girlfriend the silent treatment when's she mad at her. And her mother gets mad at her over the smallest things. For example, she once refused to talk to my girlfriend because she went to see a movie without her. TLDR on that, there was some miscommunication, and girlfriend called her out on it. Anyways, because of this history, and coupled with my anxiety, she's afraid that whenever I leave her on read, it means I'm mad at her.\n\nTonight, before she went to bed, she snapped at me and told me she hated it when I left her on read, and that it would be nice if I at least sent her a letter or a word to show that I wasn't angry at her. And I get her point, because I know I'm bad at it, but this nagging voice in my head is telling me that I did something awful.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA...for not wanting to sit with my friend for five years on the bus?",
      "description": "I think to sum up my feelings in the most practical way, I should start at the beginning of our friendship. My friend (for privacy let’s call her Amelia) moves into my district when I was in third grade. I was best friends with a kid we’ll call Freddy at the time and when she moved, I took it upon myself to be super nice to her, and gain her friendship. For the rest of the year she was mainly friends with Freddy. I considered myself a third weel at the time, but looking back it was just us being elementary schoolers. Regardless, once 4th grade came around a new girl started riding my bus. Amelia, having ridden the bus with only boys, was really fucking pumped. She ignored me and Freddy for the rest of elementary school, even when her new best friend bullied me for a good year. I don’t let this bother me, because it was elementary school. Any-who, when we graduated into sixth grade I broke off my friendship with Freddy for dumb sixth grader reasons. Given that Amelia’s friend was no longer on our route, Amelia and I became the best of friends! This was probably the best time of our friendship overall. Then seventh grade came along, and we both became    your typical emo kids. I eventually realized how pretentious I was being, and stopped. However; she kept getting worse. Next year, she was at her worst point. She kept talking about how all boys only like her because of her looks, whilst self deprecating at any possible moment. Also, she assumed that everyone was judging her at all times. Given that I used to think the exact same way as her, I spent the rest of the year trying to show that people aren’t as judgmental as she thinks, and that she should have confidence in herself. She often would direct her anger at me at random. She seemed to assume that I was an asshole. For example, one of my friends was talking to us and accidentally messed up her sentence. We both were laughing about it except Amelia, who yells at me that,”I’m always such a dick and it’s an endless cycle and she doesn’t want to lose my friendship because I’m such a dick.” I believed her for a while, but didn’t understand what I did wrong. This repeated every two weeks. In between these periods, she would act generally afraid, even disgusted by me. I always try to be nice to everyone so the idea that I was hurting her in some way really bothered me, and still bothers me now. She was distrusting of me, listening to rumors others would tell about me, and would shun me at random. So far this year she outright hasn’t talked to me. Her friends say she blames our lack of communication on me, although for the first quarter I had been constantly trying to spark conversation. She’s been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I still can’t help but feel guilty for not talking to her. I feel like both of us would be happier if she sat with someone else, given that she used to talk with me on the way to school\n\nTherefore, should I go through with it? If so, how? If not, Am I The Asshole",

      "description": "My wife and I have been together for over 11 years, married for 5, and we have a toddler daughter (1.5yo). I work, she stays home. I'll admit from the start that my parents can be tough. They aren't bad people, but they are very set in their (sometimes retrograde) ways and there has been some low-key tension between them and my wife, especially between my wife and my mom. Basically, my parents are old-school boomers who think my wife and I are like little kids and my wife resents not being treated as a peer adult. This only got worse when our daughter was born and she and my mom nearly came to an explosion the first time we saw them when our daughter was an infant. \n\nNow before anyone accuses me of being a mama's boy or anything, I know my parents are difficult and that my mom in particular is a prickly lady. Our issues are a mile long and while I've learned to deal with it, I don't expect my wife to just suck it up. I have 100% stood by my wife when my mom is unreasonable and I feel like the two of us have really created a strong sense of partnership and unity. \n\nThere's no real deep malice or anything (my wife says she loves them but doesn't feel comfortable around them and we both suspect the feeling is mutual), but I've always respected my wife's desire to disengage from them. This has generally led to courteous if a little awkward meetings in person and almost zero contact between my wife and my family any other time. \n\nHowever, I've asked my wife to soften on one thing: sending my parents pictures of our daughter. From my perspective, it takes less than 2 minutes to send and they would appreciate it A LOT. They are completely bananas over our daughter and really good grandparents. Plus, my wife sends pictures to her whole family multiple times a day and posts them to social media (no one on my family is on any form of social media). So it just kind of seems mean to leave them out. She says that I could send them photos, which I do, but I just don't have the time or opportunity to send it as frequently as she does. From where I stand, it's a minimal effort action that is pure good will, and nothing more. She says that it's not her responsibility and that I am the one who communicates with my parents, not her. Which I get, but I just can't shake the feeling that it's petty of her to not include them. I would be fine with her not engaging my parents in conversation, but I feel like sending photos to both sets of grandparents is something she should be willing to do since she's with our kid about 90% of the day, compared to my 10%.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So, I will preface this with that my friend has never expressed or even hinted at these jokes offended or hurt him, laughed at them when I told them, and even made them about himself.\n\nThis friend had yet to retake an exam, which has resulted in him being sent out of the room several times while the teacher explained test problems. He came back in from one of those sessions asking if he had a grade in the grade book.\n\n“Right now,” the teacher said, “You have a big fat zero.” \n\nI muttered that the big fat zero suited him, but I muttered it a little louder than intended and the friend heard it. He chuckled a bit at it, but it was drowned out by two female students next to me screaming that it was rude.\n\n“OMG SO RUDE!” they bawled. \n\nWithout their input and help from them, the teacher would not have known that anything had been said. The friend stayed silent while the teacher offered me a chance to apologise. The problem here was that apologising would not be saying sorry to the friend; he was clearly fine with the joke. Apologising would be saying sorry for offending the drama queens with a joke not directed at them. Thus, I refused the offer.\n\nAITA for telling the joke? Refusing to apologise?",

      "description": "So bit of backstory so people get the full picture, this happened when I was in college, I was a quiet girl at the time and hadn't made a lot of friends, but I had people who would gladly use me as a target for being shy and easy to pick on.\n\nOne of these people who would annoy me would be Natalie, she liked to think she was better than everyone but she wasn't (at least not to me). Natalie was my worst bully by far, she insulted me, threw stuff at me and harassed me on a regular basis, it was daunting to say the least and the tutors did nothing when I told them as they said it wasn't a college matter.\n\nAnd I'm not one to start fighting back at people as I'd rather just ignore them and hope they lose interest but one day she actually pissed me off enough that I started insulting her back and when she threw pens at me I threw them back harder, which she didn't like as on my way home she caught up to me where she and I would be alone.\n\nShe was pissed because I had the audacity to fight back which I'm guessing she wasn't used to, she was so pissed that she wanted to physically fight me over it, I didn't want to but she started pushing and shoving me so I told her to fuck off, she then threw a punch at me and I'd had enough, so I went for her by grabbing her hair and yanking her head around as she grabbed my hair and we tangled for a minute before she put me in a headlock! she punched my head a few times and got me in the face once or twice which hurt and in my anger I kinda reached up and grabbed her head and forced it into a nearby wall which put her on her back knocked out cold. (I'm pretty sure that's what happened but I was in a headlock so was hard to see) \n\nAt first I was shocked and worried because damn she could be dead but once I checked she was still breathing and doing ok given the situation my rage came back as I started to remember everything she had done to me the past year.\n\nAnd so there she was knocked out whilst I looked her over and noticed the outline of her phone in her pocket so I think fuck her right? so I reached in and took her phone, but as she was wearing skinny jeans I could see she had a set of keys in her pocket which were clearly her keys to her bedsit.\n\nI am ashamed about it now but at the time I saw it as a massive Fuck you to Natalie because yes I took them knowing the problems it might cause her to take the keys to her home, and unfortunately it's not over yet, as whilst I was admiring Natalie's phone I noticed a shoe on the floor.....I knew it wasn't my shoe so I double checked and sure enough Natalie was missing her left shoe, it was a flat slip on so was clear how she had lost it during the fight, I honestly laughed and thought 'could I? could I really do this to her?'\n\nAnd apparently yes I can because I picked up her shoe and shook with either Adrenalin or exhilaration just looking at my former bully thinking of her walking home with only one shoe and sock, which is when my mind wandered a bit as I looked around and thought 'What's to stop me taking more?'\n\nI was literally out of control with revenge, I took her remaining flat AND took both her socks and left her to go home barefoot, I was through the roof pissed off at the time but I know realise I just might have let my feelings get the better of me.\n\nAs for her stuff I just simply took it all home with me, I turned her phone off and tossed the SIM so that can't bite me in the ass at least.\n\nJudge me r/AmItheAsshole am I a true asshole.",

      "description": "\\*names have been changed\\* , TL;DR at bottom \n\n**Background:** \n\nI am a sophomore, almost junior, in college. During my first semester of freshman year, my good friend from high school, Veronica, (we attend the same university) and I became good friends with two girls, Rose and Tara, who are roommates. We all decided to room together the following semester. We chose a place in the on-campus dorms that had two shared rooms and a connecting bathroom. Things went super well for the first month and a half. Then, the drama started. \n\nTara has had some issues with her mental health. We supported her by providing a shoulder to cry on, fun distractions, a listening ear, and also by trying to get her to get some professional help. None of these were problematic at first, but things started getting much worse. Basically, a guy she went on a few dates with told her that he didn't see things moving forward with them, and it devastated her. For the next three days, she was catatonic and crying all the time. She was basically on self-harm and suicide watch. It got to the point where Veronica, Rose, and I had to drop whatever we were doing to go help her.\n\nNear the end of the semester, I started dating one of our good guy friends. He and I were happy. Rose was so happy for us when she heard, but Tara immediately was like, \"Oh, now I need to find a boyfriend so that I will not be alone forever!\" It often seemed like she was trying to compete with me due to some of our similar struggles with mental health issues. Things became so stressful to the point that Rose was losing hair, and the drama with Tara was starting to affect my relationship with my boyfriend (we are still happily together :D ), and Veronica had basically started living with her boyfriend because of the hate that Tara gave her for the smallest things. It was a huge mess. One night when Rose, Veronica, and I were at the store, I received a text from Tara asking if I had an ice pack. I said I didn't and I thought that was that. When we got home, Tara had (what was obviously make up) smeared around her eye in an effort to look like a black-eye. She was like lol it's a joke, but I thought it was really weird and messed up. \n\nThings kind of died down a little, and then the semester ended. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Issue**\n\nBefore the semester ended, Veronica, Tara, and I had decided to room together the following semester (Rose would be doing an internship that semester). But the more Veronica and I thought about it, the more we realized that rooming with Tara would be a problem and that we needed to focus on our own sanity. We confirmed with the apartment complex that we would be able to switch rooms, and then we called Tara together. We talked to her a bit and asked how she was doing. We then brought up rooming. I said something along the lines that I think it would be a good idea if we didn't room together because of the drama last year, and that it would be better for our friendship. Tara was like ok yeah I get that, then she had to go. \n\nThe next day, Veronica and I saw that she had unfollowed us on Instagram and told Rose that she was no longer on speaking terms with us, and that we betrayed her. \n\nA little after Fall semester started, Veronica and I contacted Tara to see if she wanted to meet up. We met up at Starbucks and caught up. Veronica and I thought things went well, and we had talked about meeting up again later. Turns out that Tara had just wanted to see us for closure and that she was done with us. She removed us from social media and basically shut us out of her life. This really hurt me because I didn't think I had done anything wrong, and it made me feel like an awful person. She ignored my texts, so I stopped trying. Are Veronica and I the assholes here or is Tara just overreacting? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nMy friend and I changed our minds and decided to not room with our other friend who had caused a lot of drama that had started to affect our own health. She cut us out of her life after. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I have what she gave us. and no i don’t want it “spruced up” I want my picture to be left the way it was because I love it. and that place it was taken at is a HUGE MEMORY. and now it’s slightly ruined “\n\n\nSo am I the asshole?

      "description": "Hold tight lads, it's gonna be a wild ride. And probably confusing af. There will be 2 TL;DR - one at the end of the backstory, and one at the end of the actual story. Let me know if you need more info. \n\nBackstory: my parents (Irish mother, Australian father) split up 20 years ago, and my mam moved back to Ireland with myself and my sister. Mostly because she had nothing tying her to Australia after the split with my father, and by the time they had split up, he wasn't even living with us any more. He was a cheater, emotionally manipulative, borderline physically abusive with myself and my sister because he had some very firm ideas on what discipline should be, didn't believe in celebrating Christmas or birthdays (this sounds like a first world problem, but it matters when you're 8) blamed all his behaviour either on his own mother (which is a different story altogether) or on manic depression, and as much as my mother tried to help him, he wouldn't let her, and she eventually had enough, packing up everything we owned and spending her entire savings on getting us back to Ireland. Where we have been living happily, if not ideally, for the last 20 years. I was 8 when we moved, my sister was 4. \n\nWhen we moved, maternal grandparents helped out a lot, but after they passed three years after moving to ireland, I basically became a second parent to my sister. At the time, it seemed better for my sister to have two parental figures, because I was a lot more independent than my sister, even when I was her age. Even so young, I knew that I was OK with having only one parent, but I didn't want that for my sister. So I helped raise her in the only ways a preteen can. And this continued right up until I went travelling last January. \n\nAcross those 20 years, my father is still doing as he does. He was in regular contact with us at first. Phone calls, letters, a little money when he could afford it, since he was never able to hold down a job for very long. Because we were little, we relished every letter and every second of every phone call. As we got a little older, and started asking why we moved in the first place, our mam never lied to us. She told us the truth about how she had been treated. She never exaggerated about it, nor did she try to prevent us from keeping in contact  with him if we wanted to, but she didn't spare us the gory details of why they split, either. If anything, she wanted us to have a relationship with our father regardless of what he had done to her. \n\nI digress. The contact eventually petered out. We rarely heard from him, but every time he did contact us, he was all about how much he loved us and wanted a good relationship with us, despite doing nothing to prove this. As we got older, we got more and more fed up with his antics. It became a routine for him to cease all contact, then call or send something out of the blue as if no time had passed, we would call him out on this instead of things playing out the way he wanted them to, he'd get into this big pity party of \"I'm a piece of shit, you don't love me\" without actually doing anything to resolve the problem. He would then cease all contact with us so he could go nurse his bruised ego, rinse and repeat. This kept going straight through our teen years, and is still happening to this day. \n\nTL;DR: father is a manipulative, abusive person who expects us to bend to his will in order to rebuild/maintain a relationship and gets butthurt when we don't. \n\nSo on to the actual story. At the start of this year, I got a job on a cruise ship. I was informed that I would need either an Australian passport or an Australian maritime visa. A call to the embassy in Dublin told me that I'm not eligible for a visa, because I'm a citizen, and that if I turned up in Australian waters with a visa, they could extradite me back to Ireland because I should have had a passport. But in order to apply for a passport, Australian law states that because I was born after 1986 I needed proof that I am a citizen of Australia. Meaning I needed to have at least one citizen parent, and be able to prove this. So I send my father a message (we're in the stage after sulking but before he's plucked up the courage to talk to us again in the hopes that we've forgotten that he's a screw up) \n\nTo his credit, he simply asks me what I need him to do, and drives from the middle of the arrapiles mountains (where he is living in a van) to a passport office in Melbourne to send official copies of his birth cert and passport to the embassy in Dublin in time for my appointment. This is probably the best thing he's done for me in the last 20 years, and I am extremely grateful for it. I tell him so. Repeatedly. Appointment goes without a hitch, a passport is approved, and before too long, I'm on a ship, which is conveniently making port in Melbourne. \n\nHe wants to meet up for a day, which I'm fine with. We spend the day talking, and he deliberately avoids talking about the way he's treated us for most of our lives. I don't push it. After the meeting he stops talking to me again, despite the distinct lack of argument. I brush it off as normal and continue with my life. I get off the ship, and move to New Zealand. He's chatting on and off over these months, nothing too serious. There's usually at least two or three months before attempts at contact, conversation for an hour or so and drops off again. At this point, my sister hasn't spoken to him in about 5 or 6 years, because she's not as forgiving as I am. She decided years ago that she was tired of the crap, and decided she wanted nothing more to do with him. \n\nA few weeks before Christmas, my dads sister sends me a message. She wants to pay for me to travel from New Zealand to Melbourne for a visit in December. I agree to this, and she pays for literally EVERYTHING while I'm there. I think the most money I spent while I was over there was on one little ice-cream (a golden gaytime, for the curious :P) \n\nBefore I went over, I told my dad that I was going to be there, and that if he wanted a visit, I would be available for that. He proceeds to dictate how this visit is going to go. I am going to meet him in Melbourne CBD and none of his family was going to be with me. He wanted it to be just me and him for the whole day. At first, I'm OK with this.\n\nThen my mam sends me a message saying \"your sister is freaking out, your father just invited her to go to Nepal\" and lo and behold, I also have a message from him, inviting me to go on holiday to Nepal. Remember, he is basically a stranger to us now, and neither of us are inclined to go places with him, least of all Nepal. We call him out on this, pointing out that neither of us are going to drop everything in order to go to Nepal with a stranger. He proceeds to tell us that it seemed like a good idea to go to \"neutral territory\" to talk things through and try to rebuild our relationship. My sister, understandably, tells him where to shove his trip. I tell him that grand gestures are not necessary, and that there's no such thing as neutral territory here. Especially with my sister and her volatile temper involved. He promptly starts the pity party, telling us he's all sort of horrible things and it's no wonder we don't love him. He also blames his mad idea on adhd rather than on his own assumption that we could be bought with grand gestures and that we would simply drop everything to go to Nepal for an unconfirmed amount of time. We both get fed up, explain that there are easier ways of rebuilding our relationship than ridiculously expensive holidays, and explain several of the ways he could attempt to rebuild. My main one was, you know, actually getting to know us as human beings rather than inanimate objects that stop existing when he stops talking to us. We also spell out in plain speech exactly why our relationship is the way it is. Everything he's done to us. Every eyewatering detail. His response? \n\nI don't get it.\n\nAfter all that, he doesn't understand what he has to do in an attempt to rebuild our relationship. He doesn't understand why we won't accept his many excuses any more. He doesn't understand why mental illness is NOT an excuse for being an arsehole. He doesn't understand why we won't just forgive him and pretend like nothing happened. \n\nSo back to my time in Melbourne, when we were supposed to meet up. I decided to change the rules, and bring my aunt (his sister) with me to the meeting, because I'm no longer comfortable with the idea of spending an entire day alone with him. So she comes with me, and we go to an art exhibition. My dad looks like he's swallowed a lemon crusted in rock salt, and instead of enjoying the exhibition with us, proceeds to avoid us for the entire time we're in there. On the plus side, he seemed to enjoy it. He refuses to speak to either of us until we go to lunch, deliberately choosing somewhere he would like because he's vegan. He finally brings himself to talk to us over a cheap (and rather unpleasant) vegan meal, which he thoroughly enjoys, and leaves after an hour. He goes back to not speaking to me afterwards, and I haven't heard from him since. \n\nWhen I am with his siblings and mother during my Melbourne visit, he's a regular topic of conversation. They all know what he's like by now. One sister, his brother and mother are all OK with me venting my anger over the entire situation, and wouldn't blame me for wanting to cut ties. One sister doesn't agree. She thinks I should push through and make an effort because he's my father. I'm of two minds. I'm a 28 year old woman at this point, I've put up with this for so long, I don't know if I have the patience for it any more. It's never going to change as long as my dad doesn't make any effort from his side. \n\nTL;DR: father invites my sister and I on a crazy adventure",

      "description": "This morning, I was in my building's laundry room doing my laundry before classes, and I hadn't showered yet so I was wearing a tea shirt and sweat pants. While I was putting my clothes into the washer an old lady told me that I should be more respectful and not wear sweat pants and \"such a ratty shirt\" when I'm outside my apartment. I told her that I'm just coming up to do my laundry and I'll change after I shower, and she tells me that I need to \"have some respect for the world\" and dress nicely whenever I am outside. At this point I am expecting that she just wants to bitch me out and I don't really want to have a conversation about it so I just say \"no thanks\" and pretend I can't hear her while she keeps lecturing me and complaining about me to other people coming in and out of the laundry room, and she even follows me down the hall to the elevators (though luckily not into the elevator with me).\n\nWas I being an asshole here or is there no other better way to handle this?

I know it's not about me, but it was just too much. We've known each other for barely a semester. I'm young. The relationship was fine; no huge problems, but it was second one in total. I just don't want to continue falling for someone who has a 20% chance to die in the next 5-years. I don't know if this is selfish, but the effect on my mental health was just too much. So I told her that I couldn't do this relationship anymore. It seemed to go amicable enough (she was obviously hurt), we both shed some tears, but in terms of how it ended, I wouldn't say it was the worst.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell since, my phone has been blowing up. People are messaging me on facebook, twitter, texting, etc to say how huge of an asshole I am for leaving someone because they have cancer.

      "description": "I'm not on mobile but I still don't know how to format so I have no excuses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to provide some pre-story context everyone involved is in high school and around the 15/16 age range and this occurred during school at the end of the day before boarding buses.\n\nI recently, about a month ago, broke of with my girlfriend of just over 3 years. And as it was a first relationship for both of us it was very difficult (especially for her). The reason for the break up was that I had simply lost feeling for her and thought it would be best to end things so it wouldn't hurt more in the future. I did so in what I thought was a very amicable way; I kept reinforcing how much she had meant to me for the last 3 years and that I really did love her up until that moment and that it would be better for both of us to end it now. She was in tears and so was I. At the end of the conversation she told me her feelings and that she hoped we could still be friends after we both get over everything.\n\nOnce school started up again on Monday, I was careful to try not to cross paths with her or ever interact with her too much. Normally a few friends, her, and I would meet at her locker at the end of the day and talk for a while (this is important) but of course this didn't happen with me anymore, I would just go straight to my bus  instead and they would still meet.\n\nFast forward to today: I just got the news that I could start playing french horn in an after school band and that I should start learning (I normally play trumpet). Excited, I wanted to tell my friends who were talking a few lockers away from my ex (which I thought was a respectable distance). I walk over and tell them when all of a sudden my ex's sister, who we'll call L, comes over to me and starts yelling really loud at me that I shouldn't be there and that her sister(my ex) was right there. She told me to basically fuck off and go somewhere else while she was the one making a scene and drawing attention to us.   \nI cannot deal with confrontation very well so I almost start crying because I'm still not entirely over the whole break up either. I try not to show this though so while I am biting my lip I tell her I'm not doing anything wrong.\n\nAt this point I'm getting super anxious and nearly in tears and she tells me she's about to hit me if I don't get away. So I just walk away with one last, \"Fuck off\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the bus, I'm shaking like crazy trying to calm down and I feel like an absolute prick for just existing somewhat near my ex. I have been actively trying to make things easy for both of us in the whole situation and keep the pain minimal. I never wanted to hurt her and wouldn't stand there just to make things worse, but I also took into consideration that it's been more than a month and thought that standing 5 feet away from my ex wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nSo, am I the asshole in this situation?",

A few years ago when I moved into my own house, my mother would refuse to come over and insist that I go to their house to see them, which I would regularly do at first, however I don’t drive myself, so it’d be a case of taking multiple buses to get there, bear in mind that I also work full time.\n\nShe took it super personally that I didn’t get chance to visit very often and wouldn’t really speak to me much. I got a passive aggressive text from her out of the blue one day saying that it was nice of me to come and visit my dad while he’d been in hospital. So I immediately called her and asked what she was talking about and she told me that my dad had had an accident and had been asking for me to come and visit him and was really upset that I hadn’t visited. Nobody had told me anything.\n\nMy sister got married a few years ago and my mum spent six months beforehand slating my sister behind her back because this wasn’t the wedding she would choose herself and then she was miserable at the wedding itself which really brought the mood down for my sister on what should’ve been the happiest day of her life and she basically forced the entire side of our family that were at the wedding to leave early because she was the one who had arranged the transportation for us the get home.\n\n\nNow I got engaged a few months ago, my siblings were happy for me however when I told my mum, literally all she said to me was “oh, how nice.”\n\nFor the last week I’ve been ridiculously sick. I’m not registered with a GP in this area yet as I was reluctant to leave my family doctors (keep in mind that the doctors surgery is literally a 2 minute walk from my parents house). So I made an appointment and called my parents and asked whether they were busy at all on that day, they confirmed that they would be home and not doing anything that day so I asked whether they’d be willing to pick me up and take me to my appointment and I could spend some time with them afterwards if they wanted and my father just straight up said no he couldn’t and my mum said I could still visit if I wanted though, then my dad hung up before letting me speak any more.\n\nThinking about the fact that these are two people that will literally travel twenty times as far to see one sibling, still let one sibling live with them and will pretty much do anything for another sibling since she got pregnant. Honestly I’m tired of trying to make things work with them when they so clearly don’t give a shit.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for getting angry at my manager and reporting her to the GM for the way she treated me?",
      "description": "I've been working at a fast food restaurant in my town for the past five months and I've never had an issue with anybody else who works there, until last night.\n\nI was in the kitchen with one of my managers and a coworker, when the manager asked me to mop the floor. As I was mopping, she and the coworker were in my way and wouldn't move. I didn't think about asking them to move because I assumed they didn't need to be asked, but they just stood there having a nonchalant conversation because it wasn't that busy at the time. After I backed away from them and continued mopping, my manager said \"You suck at mopping.\" Right to my face. \n\nI replied with \"I know\" because I didn't know how else to respond to her remark without getting all bent out of shape. The thing is, I already had experience with mopping at a different restaurant. Being told that I suck at something that I'm experienced in by somebody higher up really pissed me off. After she said that, I could see the coworker snickering to himself.\n\nLater on, she asked me to wash the dishes. When we were in the back, she told me to \"pay attention\" to what I was doing. I have ADD. You can probably imagine how I felt after being told to pay attention for the 5 billionth time in addition to being insulted by a manager. I proceeded to angrily wash the dishes and then went back to the kitchen when I was done.\n\nAfter she left for the night, I went over to the only other manager that was present in the building (who just so happens to be the GM's son) and explained to him what happened. He told me that I could write a note to the GM that described my problem and leave it in the office for her to read the next morning, since he's never had to deal with a situation like mine before and that there was nothing he could do about it since he wasn't one of the higher-ups. \n\nSo that's what I did. I spent the last few minutes of my shift writing about how I interpreted the manager's comments as unprofessional and rude and that I wanted something to be done about the whole ordeal. I left the note in the office and then went home. \n\nFast forward to today -- I'm feeling nervous about going back to work. The store normally opens at 6 A.M., which means the note was probably discovered by one of the higher-ups earlier this morning while I was getting ready for school. I can't predict what will happen at work today. Will the GM or one of the higher-ups confront the manager? Will I get in trouble for leaving the note in the office? What will happen between me and the manager? I just don't know. I'll have to wait and see. I have to go back in an hour and 5 minutes. Wish me luck.",

      "description": "My husband believes in God but hates organized religion. I did for a while too, but stated feeling like I need to go to church. He doesn’t want our three kids to be forced to go to church. Church services are Saturday night or Sunday morning. He golfs most Sundays and always has. For a few months, I have been trying to go Saturday nights... Saturday nights just don’t work into our schedules. Saturday’s are huge family days, so for me to leave at 4:30pm in the middle of the family time is hard. We take family time very seriously. So Saturday’s have not worked out. Sunday’s he doesn’t want to give up golf, which I completely understand. It’s the only thing he really does for me-time. But he doesn’t want the kids to go to church with me. We don’t have a reliable babysitter situation. So I end up just not going to church when I feel in my heart, I should be going most of the time. Well it’s been a few months since I’ve been trying to go and Sunday I felt like I absolutely needed to and brought the kids with me. I didn’t send them to the Sunday School Class and they just colored the entire time. Am I the Asshole here? He feels like if it’s important to me I would go Saturday’s, but I feel that family time is important too. He pissed I brought the kids. I told him in the morning before he went to golf that I was going to, but he didn’t think I was serious.",

      "description": "Note: I am Av\nMy “friends” are David, Connor,\n\n\n\nWe’re all hanging out right? I join the vc and I hear David say “Ava is so toxic” ( Note: Toxic is thrown around like a beach ball here at my school,so yeah ) “Huh?” I say because they were clearly talking about me “Ava is so toxic on discord” “What?” I say trying to defend myself “At lest she didn’t hear us” says Connor “Oh yeah I heard you” I say back in extreme anger. I leave. Later, Connor pings everyone in my discord server. I kick him in a minute, because pinging is annoying and some people in my server have jobs and work; etc. Connor comes to me to say “I will yeet you”. When he first starts I say “I’m really tired of your shit” (Note: they think I’m innocent and don’t curse) I say that and it makes me  mad but you don’t care. He says “your mad because your toxic” “your the one to talk” I say back.  “I won’t  miss you next year” ( we’re  graduating ) “shut your chicken nugget headass” “ I don’t know why your mad” I say, considering his role in this had literally nothing to do with why I was mad. “ I’m not lol” he says, clearly lying. During this I was shaking. Compressing my anger, someone has to be the mature one in these situations. (Skipping some of the conversation because it has no matter besides he just calls me toxic again ) “you can’t call me toxic and not expect me to be mad” I say kinda annoyed. He calls me toxic again. “Thanks,”I say. “I find it funny how you liked me last month but now calling me toxic” “I didn’t like you it was a prank” he says. “At least the feeling was mutual” I say ( he asked me out, I never answered because we were “friends” and this isn’t the first time he’s had a crush on me ) “Shut yo bubble gum dum dum toxic acting like a 5yr old on steroids woman child head ass up” he says. “ you light skin ( I’m black and he’s Hispanic and I am darker than him by a lot ) you look like a mountain with all that acne ( don’t have a lot of acne, barely any actually” “thanks” I say absorbing my anger, still shaking, not believing this   “Five head looking” sends a picture of me  “ you feel better now?” I ask “no im angry” he says. “Dang I expected you to block me by now” “ I compress my emotions, I say” “no you don’t” he says. Then basically he mocks me, accuses me of liking this random boy in my class. Then he leaves. \n\nThis isn’t the first time this happened. They call me toxic yet I never talk about them behind their back, never get mad at them, and frankly only make sarcastic remarks, yet I’m always the blame. Emotionally abusing me, never considering how I feel. After all, I’m just stupid Ava! I like Disney and Nintendo and I don’t curse! I’m just always happy! Toxic Ava the annoying bitch is who I am to them and now myself! I used to be that way, 3 years ago. I used to be confident now I’m shy and scared to talk to new people, and being self conscious about my hair, my clothes, my face, and everything. Other people I have met I don’t have the problem with. Like my friend in 6th grade, she’s so nice and fun. We don’t have problems and we talk daily. I want to know if I’m the asshole so when we graduate I don’t ever have to talk to these stupid whiny face friends again!\nSummary: I get emotionally abused by fake friends ",

      "description": "Okay, so I hope you can help me, because this dude is either really good in manipulating or I really was The Asshole in this scenario. If I actually was and I overreacted, I need to apologize to him and live with the consequences of my actions. So, advice is appreciated, because I think I am losing my mind.\n\nThis will be a long one, so buckle up for a whole lot my drama. \n\nSo, I am with my fiancé for 4 years now. I was married once already and he cheated on me, which is why I am pretty paranoid to be cheated on again. I may be biased on regards to this topic, but I always did my best to not let my relationship get hurt by the actions of my shitty ex.\n\nMy fiancé is a *very* handsome guy. I am not saying that because I love him, but because he really is the epitome of all manliness. Dark, tall, eyes as deep brown as rich chocolate. Mid brown hair. I was so shocked when I figured he was attracted to *me*. But my lack of self esteem is for another sub.\n\nSo, since my fiancé looks really good he is often flirted on by other women (and men) who may not realize that I was with him. But instead of blocking these people who were clearly stripping him with his eyes like I did on the rare occasions that I was hit on, he would play along. Smile. Be funny. Be nice. Be adorable. One time, even pulling the chair up for *another girl*. Whenever I would confront him and explain to him how much he hurt my feelings, he would say I was overreacting, that he only loved me and that I should stop being so jealous. And he would always *always* bring up my ex who cheated on me, that this was the reason I would give him such a hard time for being \"nice\".\n\nSo I tried to to shrug it off, even though it killed me inside. I figured he may be right and I should let loose a little bit, that this was a small price to pay for such a loving future husband.\n\nBut last week I couldn't take it anymore. I saw two Facebook pictures with two blonde women one where he was kissing a girl on the cheek and one where he was kissing another girl on the *lips*. Yes, it was not a full on French kiss, it was more of a peck. Both pictures where  under a picture gallery *hanging with the bestiieees\". I have never seen this women before. He told me he would go to play FIFA with his buddies from work.\n\nWhen I confronted him once again he called me stupid and that he would never cheat on me, that he would at least try to hide the evidence if he were and that he did play FIFA with the guys and then figured he would go party. When he came back from this \"party\" he didn't smell of alcohol or anything that indicated he really was.\n\nI broke it off with him. He is since blowing up my phone how it was unfair and that he didn't want to lose his future wife over something that small.\n\nHe is not depended on me financially or socially or in any kind of way. It sucks to admit but I think I need him more than he needs me.\n\nBut please guys : Am I the Asshole? ",

      "description": "I'm a high schooler who is currently participating in a business competition. Recently I managed to get second place in the state-level round and will be moving on to the international competition. Since I competed solo, and the event I'm competing in allows teams of up to three, I had the opportunity to add two people who didn't get past the state round to my team and have them compete with me at the international round. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy event is pretty popular, so I got upwards of 10 requests to join my team within a day. One of the people who asked had placed top 10 in the international round last year, so I respected her skills immensely and immediately accepted her request. We both had past experience with teams of three that were disasters and decided to just keep our event as a team of two. Now all I had to do was say no to all of the others, a VERY uncomfortable task for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the people asking me was a longtime friend. Last year, he had been picked up by someone else and requested that I join the team as well, essentially getting me my first experience in the international round. I was super grateful about this, and this year he seemed to want to cash in on his kindness, essentially saying that because he got me picked last year, I owe him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow all things considered, he is really smart and would be valuable. My problem was, however, that this friend is incredibly lazy. Last year, I was forced to do 85% of the work that should have been split among three people, while the other two did basically nothing (part of the reason I did not want a team of three this year). He has a reputation for being lazy and not doing any work among my friends, and I knew he wouldn't pull his weight if I brought him along. This, combined with the fact that I only wanted a team of two, lead me to reject him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was the only person out of the 10+ people I had to reject who took it terribly. He called me a terrible person and essentially broke off our friendship for the time-being. There were arguably closer friends that I had to reject who were really mature about it, although they didn't help me out last year like he did. I talked to my sister about it and she immediately told me I'm the asshole, all the way, but a couple of our mutual friends agree that I made the right decision. So I wondered what reddit would think. AITA?",

      "description": "I posted this before with details, but got removed because I guess it was too detailed. So basically what the title asks. \n\nI’m a caring and supportive person by nature. My last two relationships have had a lot of difficult moments. Not because of our connection or relationship issues, but because of my SO issues which I end up getting heavily involved in. I’m just tired after two three year relationships that brought the same stress. \n\nI ask this because I just went on my first date since my last breakup and she was awesome. After the date she added me on Facebook and her page is all of the “toomeirl” type posts and self deprecating stuff that gets the “me” or “this”  caption. [example ](https://imgur.com/a/CC4p2WT)\n\nI’m a healthy guy both mentally and physically. I’m surprised the mental toll of the last 6 years hasn’t effected that. I see positivity in everything. My entire young adult life has been dictated by others problems though and I don’t think I would ever want to have that situation again in a relationship. \n\nI don’t plan on going on a second date she wants to go on. I’m not going to say why, but am I being an asshole behind closed doors?",

      "title": "AITA for not lying to my wife about weight loss?",
      "description": "(A little lengthy backstory, but you can skip down to the fourth paragraph if you're only interested in the here and now aspect.)\n\nSo, my wife and I have been together for almost 7 years. When we first met, she was what most guys call \"thick\". Very small waisted, bigger thighs, big butt, and very big breasts. She was also only 18, so the youth factor helped a lot with that. I was a very lean 200 pounds, and have until recently, been a very physically active person, taking part in rec league flag football, softball, and soccer. I never \"let myself go\" until the last year and a half, but I also made the conscious decision that I was not going to stay that way. When I stepped on the scale day one, it read 319 pounds. I stand 6'2\", and a lot of people would be nice and say things like, \"You carry your weight well.\" But I always knew what they meant. My wife (I will not disclose her height/weight), has always been the bigger of us two until I started gaining weight. \n\nAlmost exactly a year ago, I decided to get back into shape, and in doing so, my wife felt encouraged to join. We have a young son, so we quickly set up a regiment where we both got ample and fair amounts of time to do our work outs. At first, she was very excited to wake up and do a morning walk, and then some light exercise. It seemed like she really enjoyed the changes we made, so I never took it upon myself to push her towards working out. She works full time, and she's an adult, so I let her decide what is best for her body. \n\nDuring the last year, my wife has used her gym pass a whopping 22 times. Yes, not even once every other week, and a majority of that was the first couple weeks we started. I took more advantage, and have had great success. All my vitals improved, and I feel so much more confidence. \n\nThis is where I need my question answered: With holidays approaching, family has been coming in from all over the States, and seeing as I have shed roughly 70 pounds since the last holidays, it's easy to notice. My wife on the other hand, received none of that, for she has actually gained weight since we began this. This sparked her to hit the gym everyday for the last five days after work. She has done more working out this week than she may have ever done in the last year. The last two days have been filled with, \"Don't I look much thinner?\" Or \"Look, this love handle is disappearing.\" Although nothing was changing. I always have a simple short \"Yes dear.\" Or \"Oh that's great!\" Until I finally just could not hear it anymore, and told her the truth.\n\n\"Sweetie, I know you've been working really hard this week, and that's great. You need to really keep it up if you want to see any changes though. So far you're the only one seeing any of the results you're talking about.\"\n\nThat was enough to send her on a spiral of saying I was \"Calling her fat\" and \"not believing in her.\" Led by long phone calls to her sisters. I have been asked to \"Just apologize already.\" Although I feel I have no need to. I worked my ass off to lose the weight we agreed to lose together, and now that I'm the only one who kept up our agreement, I feel she needs to hear it unfiltered.\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": " My roommate and I as people were not compatible, we had very different standards, morals, interests, and political views, this caused us to argue incessantly. We both felt very uncomfortable in our own rooms. He threw trash and his clothes on the floor and was very messy in general, when I asked him to clean up he would clean up a little bit but then the next day it would be messy again. He was very loud and he blasted music at night and in the morning, even while I was trying to do my work, my roommate would blast music and when I asked him to put headphones on he said that he didn't want to use headphones because the music wouldn't sound as good. He masturbated at night while I was trying to sleep, and because we were in a bunk bed he shook the bed and kept me up and uncomfortable. His argument usually consisted of how I should have expected a situation like this because we were young and because it was a boarding school. We had many more issues and many more politically heated arguments but I am not one to cause trouble or to snitch. \n\nIt wasn't until later when things began to escalate, I am a person of color and my native language is not English, in an argument when I began to stutter he said that \"I needed to learn how to speak English\". At first, I did not think that the comment was meant to insult my ability to speak English based on where I was from, but later in another argument where I complained about our school, he stated that \"Maybe I should go back home\", I began to feel somewhat uncomfortable. It wasn't until he said that \"Americans are smarter than (my countries people)\" that I got really mad.\n\nWe clearly were not getting along and I wanted something to change, while I do not believe that he was a racist person, what he said was certainly insulting. I never discussed these issues with other students because I did not want to make people think he was a racist and ruin his year but he would often misrepresent the situation to other students. I did, however, tell my counselor EVERYTHING that we were having trouble with (except the masturbation part) so I could change roommates. While I did tell my counselor that I did not think he was a racist, the comments he made that I provided as examples certainly made him look that way. This issue reached the higher-ups and eventually all the faculty. \n\nI did not move rooms because it was an \"impossibility\" but my roommate began to complain to other students that he felt that he was being treated differently and that he had been scolded multiple times by teachers for his behavior against me. I didn't end up bettering my situation and I worsened his, AITA?",

      "description": "Background:  I have a friend from Asia, Jan, that I met through an online class and her (American's) husband's Jack work just happened to bring her to my area last spring. We are the same age and have kids of the same age. She grew up without much \"religion\" but an incredibly different culture.  Jan knows almost nothing about Christianity except for the idea of Christmas.  I know nothing about said Asian culture except maybe the basis of Lunar New Year.  We both love cooking and make cultural food for each other constantly.  We also talk about everything in relation to food trends, like Atkins, Paleo, intermittent fasting, etc.   Anything food.  I help her with English and idioms and she's teaching me her language.  To me, it's basically a storybook friendship of different worlds and fast friends.  We respectfully learn about (and sometimes choose to participate in) each-other's cultures.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt a party (here read a bunch of people over my house extremely casual) Jan and I were talking and I was asking for her best vegetarian recipes because I was thinking of going vegetarian for Lent and beans aren't that common in her culture (one of the things I can't do).  She wondered what Lent was and I said it was a time that people in my religion remember those who sacrificed for us and make sacrifices of our own to remember that we are going to die and so we fast and choose a sacrifice to remember that.   She thought it was a fabulous idea and feeling a bit separated from her culture asked Jack if they could try it.  My husband's friend Mark made a disgusted noise and left the room, I assumed, because he was somehow offended by the vegetarian idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter Jan left Mark starts laying into me about how terrible I am for whitewashing  my religion and making the practices of  bunch of pedos appealing to others.  He said if I'm going to talk about my hypocritical religion for weak minded people who can't handle doing things for their own health and wellness and not some fake God then I must disclose things like the name of said fake God as well as the \"shameful truth\" of my backwards practices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him to shut the fuck up and that he can go circle jerk with the atheists any time he wanted but he can't tell me how I talk about religion to my friends.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe started to go into another tear about how I'm just another hypocritical liar before my husband shut it down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband refuses to weigh in and said that his friend and I had \"equally valid opinions on the matter\".  Obviously, I feel his friend is a jackass and I'm not going to invite him if he needs to add such commentary.  Since I plan gatherings I've quietly removed his name from any of the facebook invitation lists going forward and told hubby that he can add him back once he talks to his friend about behaving himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My new neighbour has only moved in a week and hes already been over about noise complaints.\n\nHe's complained about the dog barking non stop. My dog does bark when people are passing or when someone is at the door but we have never had complaints about constant barking and the time frames he's giving just don't allow for the barking he says is happening as I've been there. It seems my dog is barking for a minute or two and he's significantly over exaggerating it but I have ordered a camera just to check and ensure he's not being overly disruptive. We've never had complaints about him before and we've had him for 8 years now so it just seems unlikely the noise he is producing is unacceptable. \n\nHe complained about a night of drinking we had. I had a few people round and we likely were louder than normal. This is a one off for us and even at that it was over and silent by 1:30am.\n\nHe's also complained about just general noise including talking and the tv.\n\nOn the last complaint I told him there's a level of noise to be expected living in terraced houses and I didn't feel any of the noise being made was unreasonable. The noise definitely isn't occurring for extended periods of time or at very late or early times. The complaints aren't exactly being phrased in a friendly way either. It's not a \"hey guys you were a bit loud last night, mind keeping it down?\" It's a warning that he'll phone the council on us. Were not worried about this as the council will ask other neighbours and ask for proof before taking action.\n\nOn top of this his house was being renovated for months on end after he purchased it, I was woken at 8:30am on my days off work for months and not once complained. In his defence I've heard very little noise from him otherwise. He's generally very quiet around the house. He didn't have a house warming or anything and other than normal doors closing and footsteps on the stairs we don't hear much from him so that could be why in his eyes even a few minutes of noise from us is unacceptable.\n\nDoes he have the right to complain the second he hears noise or is there an amount of noise from neighbours that should be expected? It seems unrealistic to me for him expect a neighbour to never have friends over, have a dog that never barks and never make noise that can be heard right next door.",

      "description": "!!!TW: MENTIONS OF SELF-HARM, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, AND EATING DISORDERS!!! \nOkay so, I'm in middle school and I have really bad anxiety and kinda bad depression, I also have really really low self esteem and have an ED (please hear me out I'm not just saying this). I've been cutting for around a year now and I've mostly managed to hide it, but a while ago (I don't remember the time I'm sorry) my mum found out. She had walked into my room and forced me to show her my arms, she yelled at me. A lot. She was saying things like \"you're going to get taken away or forced to go to your dads if you don't stop!\" (my mum and biological father (I don't like calling him my \"dad\" for personal reasons) were not married when they had me so ever since I was born it's they've been in a custody battle) And \"don't you like living here?! They're gonna take you away if you don't stop it!!!\" and other things like that. \nI stood there and took it while trying not to cry. Once she left me alone I broke down sobbing and called my friend Jazz (my bff and the person I go to with my problems, he's also the only person I've ever actually believed when he says he cares about me.) and I told him everything. He calmed me down and helped me out best as he could, he's an absolutely amazing friend and I'm so lucky to have him as my friend (although I'm pretty sure I don't deserve someone as great as him). \n After that she had started forcing me to show her my arms every day, and if I said no she'd threatened to tell my biological father that I cut. Anytime she saw that I had cut she would yell at me really harshly. It used to make me cry but now I just get really pissed at her afterwards, although I do tend to repeat her words in my head and it makes me feel like shit. She eventually stopped making show her my arms, but if she managed to catch me with cuts she'd still yell at me but what she said had changed. \nSomething to note, I text my friend Jazz literally every day, and my mum has went through and read my texts with him before (fucking bitch disrespecting my privacy). Since I complain to him about my problems and tell him all the stupid shit that goes on in my head, she probably learned some stuff. \nAt this point I should point out that I have a bit of an empathy problem, I only have empathy for people I care about, if I don't care about them then I could care less if they got hurt or died. And its actually kinda funny to me when people get hurt. And the thing is I've never really cared about any of my family, I don't know why, I just never have. So my mum had started being slightly nice to me about my cutting, and she had actually tried to help me a bit: she gave me a notebook and told me that anytime I wanted to cut I could write in that instead and she told me no matter what she would never read it. I, not giving a shit about her and honestly wishing she would just ignore the fact that I cut, I didn't ever write in that notebook or even pick it up. I just threw it in the floor and left it. \nSo then after that, she started getting mad at me for cutting again. She changed what she said though. When she saw I had cut she would now say \"stop doing that just to get that boys (Jazz's) attention!\" and other things like that. That really really hurt cause I've always been self conscious that people will find out I cut and just think I'm doing it for attention, especially since it's a stereotype that people who cut for pleasure/attention cut horizontally and people who cut vertically are actually cutters (I cut horizontally just because that's how I learned to do it and because I find it easier to cut with a razor blade that way). \nNow she still says things like that and other things about me just doing it for attention. Like \"you can find whatever attention your looking for elsewhere!!!\" and shit like that. It really really hurts and only makes me want to cut more and makes me feel suicidal. \nAm I the asshole in this for just wanting her to forget I cut and to just leave me alone or is she the asshole for yelling at me and saying that stuff to me? Please help me here. \n(I'm so sorry for any mistakes I made in this or anything I said wrong. Please don't gat mad at me.) \n",

      "description": "I went to a family-owned Indian buffet with a friend tonight, and although the food was good, the spices and 4 cups of mango lassi pretty much went right through me. My stomach started grumbling and I knew I would not be able to hold it in until I got home. I ran to the men's bathroom but it was locked. I tried to be patient, took deep breaths, and pulled out my phone to distract me. It was probably only 30 seconds, but it felt like an eternity and I could feel stuff inching out. I saw a lady come out of the women's bathroom, and I rushed right in. Diarrhea spewed out of me before I even got a chance to sit down. I was in there for a solid 10 minutes but felt pressured to leave because someone had been knocking about 4 or 5 times already. When I got out, an old Indian lady was standing outside(I think she was one of the cooks/grandma in the family) and started cursing (in her native tongue so I didn't really understand her) and wagging her finger at me and pointing to the female sign on the door. I was so embarrassed I ran past my friend and told him I'd wait in the car. He was laughing hysterically at the whole thing. I felt so guilty, but I was literally going to shit myself if I had waited any longer and that would have been even more embarrassing. ",

There's a window directly next to my toilet so I told him to just open that and then close the door after him. \n\nBut he still forgot, so one time I just went over and stood by the door poiting at it until he came over and closed it. Then he started getting mad about it, saying I'm acting like an asshole because he never tried police how I do this at his place. But I took note of stuff like that the first time I was there and remember to leave the door open at his place. \n\nI don't feel like I'm asking for a lot from him, but he made a pretty big deal out of it I feel like.

      "description": "Let me preface this with I'm on mobile and I have fat thumbs. Please keep that in mind. \n\nOkay so I'm 19 (F) and I have a ten month old and live in a two bedroom apartment with my baby's father 22(M). We moved in about a month ago and it's a fairly nice apartment. Ever since my daughter has been born I've been expected to clean and take care of her. I haven't been working, not because I can't or don't want to I just think it's more important to be with her than to work. I even worked while pregnant for months, it's not laziness just trying to be the best mom I can and I think these moments are precious. Well, we lived with his grandmother before living here and she keeps the house spotless by slaving every day. Keep in mind she has no babies to watch out for but cares for my Bfs two teenage siblings because his mom passed away. So he expects that out of me. I take care of my daughter all day and all night. She takes two naps a day and I try to at least get one of them to sleep as well. The house isn't disgusting, just sometimes it's a little dirty. From living in it. You clean the kitchen and in a few hours it's dirty again. And I've got a ten month old who isn't walking yet that I can't just set in the floor. We have a playpen but she will only sit in it for so long and by the time I get the mess cleaned up in an hour or so there's a new mess. He works nights so when he gets home it's usually dirty from the night before. Not always but some nights I'm struggling to get her to bed, etc. Well he rides my ass about cleaning the house all the time. Says he works and I should clean up to compensate. He's not very understanding of having to care for a child and do it, he says just throw her in the playpen and turn videos on for her. I don't like doing that but he says it's something that just has to be done. Am I the asshole here? Should it just be my responsibility? I really need some outside input here. Thank you. ",

Obviously, this is a total red flag but I still had some stamina in me and she said I didn’t have to use protection this next time so I hit it again knowing her feelings for me and then, after she fell asleep, I fled the apartment and blocked all communication with her. I also left a final text telling her that a fake name is my real name under the guise that I’m willing to pay child support in the event of a pregnancy so she takes the alias more seriously instead of my real name. I handled this badly, I know, but I feel I had to look out for myself above all else and she was a little racist to me during and after the date (making “BBC” remarks about my penis, which I don’t appreciate for it is stereotypical and I have a zero tolerance policy for that sort of thing). So at the end of the day, I feel I’m justified. But am I actually the asshole? I’m willing to accept it if I am;I just wanna know. ",

      "description": "Throwaway (or an account I might keep. This username is cool tbh)\n\nSo I have this friend, we met at the beginning of the semester because we have two classes and a major in common (I'm doubled up in two). He's gay, I'm a lesbian. We sorta bonded over this, since we've both grown up and come from places where who we are, wasn't at all considered \"okay\". We also have some of the same political views (important). He's more *far left*, I'm more center-left in my beliefs but could go either way, depending on what it is. He has an issue with this.\n\nAnyways.\n\nHe likes to point out men he finds sexy or hot, talks about how he wants to bang them, etc. Fine, whatever. Maybe it's just a guy thing? I don't know, but I do know I don't talk this way with my straight friends nor do my straight guy friends talk this way about the women they see (but we do sorta bond over what we find attractive, so maybe?).\n\nEventually, it got uncomfortable. He kept asking me how I can't find men attractive, and it usually results in me just shrugging. Like. I just don't?? \"But you're attracted to transwomen too!\" He'd exclaim. \"They were men!\"\n\nI usually reply with, \"Dude, that's transphobic. Women are women.\"\n\n\"So, if a guy were to dress up as a woman, would you fuck him?\"\n\n\"No??\" This went back and forth for awhile before I said I had homework and left.\n\nEventually, he escalated to showing me pictures of naked men with erections. I told him to stop, and got super pissed off at him after he didn't. He would go, \"Now you're mad at me! Why are you mad?! I was just kidding!\" So I tried to explain to him *I don't want to see pictures of naked men! I don't find men attractive in that way!* \"But how can you not? They're so hot!\"\n\nI usually just leave when he tries to argue with this. My therapist suggested that he's probably just joking around, but there's a point where I have started to feel disrespected. Plus, it's just hugely uncomfortable (but thank fuck not triggering).\n\nToday, he called women scatterbrained. He accused me of being mad at him. Like, he just popped up and started ranting and I really didn't want to hear it.\n\n\"Wow, lesbians *are* bitches!\" He usually uses that word in reference towards those of us who are lesbians, all the time. I don't know why.\n\nSo I finally told him that, \"Just because you're a gay man doesn't make you exempt from being a sexist and transphobic ass.\" He called me homophobic, insists there's no way that's possible, and I end up just snapping at him again and he's messaged me a few times but I haven't responded. He asked me, at one point, if I was right wing because I defended people's right to have a religious belief.\n\nI know I didn't handle it as maturely as I should have. But.\n\n**Am I the Asshole?**",

I am the most senior Deputy, giving me seniority or first pick to choose what pod/unit to work in. \n\nAlright so lately with my job there has been a lot of over time. I have worked the last 2 to 3 paychecks with 24-40 hours of overtime and needless to say, I'm burnt the hell out. I am also the most senior employee of a whopping 3 whole years here. The turn over rate is bad. And our over time schedule has been changed for November alone 3 times. I originally had Thanksgiving off, but now with a new schedule I am working the day of and after Thanksgiving. Today I come in for my over time expecting to get first pick. I have 4 other team mates there as well. We had an extra person so one of us was able to go back home. Well the supervisor sent the newest employee home. Even though I have worked more hours than them. I did not say anything because I was not in the mood for arguing. Then the supervisor picks another new employee first. He does this because he thinks it'll get him inside the employees pants. This sets me off. This supervisor picks her over everyone, every time. Because she puts on a sickly face thinking it'll get her to pick first. (Have you tried abstaining yourself from vodka every night?) So now I'm pissed because I was screwed over twice today. So I think they'll be just fine without me Thanksgiving. I have worked every holiday for them and this time around I would like to spend at least one holiday with my 2 year old son who I only get to see once or twice a week. \n\nSo am I the petty asshole for calling in because I am fed up with this Supervisor's bullshit?\n\ntl;dr - Lots of over time hours.

He handed me his money and his phone and that was that. \n\nI’ll admit that I forgot about it, and hadn’t fixed his phone. He came up to me asking for the phone and the money back, which I had no issue with. He then told me he had gone through my backpack to see if I still had it with me. \n\nThis is where I got extremely upset and confronted him about going through my belongings without my permission. It nearly escalated to a fight when he refused to acknowledge that going through my stuff wasn’t okay and I wasn’t happy with it. \n\nAITA here? Everyone around me seems to think I’m in the wrong, but I don’t see where I was the issue in this situation. Is it wrong for me to be mad that people are going through my belongings?",

      "description": "One of my coworkers was the longest serving person other than myself at my family's restaurant and has looged the most hours by far out of any employee at the place. That was until they quit today. My father had both become reliant on and been taking advantage of the fact that they were willing to work a lot no matter what by working them a lot and not paying them on time (under the table so he can get away with it easier). This went on to the point they had racked up a thousand dollars in back pay. They and many of my other coworkers had expressed their frustration with my father not paying on time and  during one of these conversations I mentioned to them that my father doesn't think they'd quit no matter what he did. Well they used this as their reason to quit and exposed me by telling him. Now I'm being forced to fill in for their duties until they're replaced as they were the closing cleaner and did most of our baking. So AITA?",

      "description": "     Heya, this is a bit long sorry. This is my first time posting so im really sorry if its hard to read or breaks a rule or anything.\n     Okay so one of my best friends, we'll call her S, is my sisters boyfriends ex. My sister and her boyfriend have been going out for nearly two years and her bf and S arent beefing or anything but they arent friends and don't talk. S told me in private when she was upset, that my sisters bf had slept with her the day before he got with my sister and that she been brokenhearted. I kept this to myself until i was talking to my other sister, who we'll call F, about our mutual dislike for my sisters boyfriend and let it slip what S had told me. I already know telling S's secret makes me an asshole, the actual aita comes later. F promises to keep it to herself.\n            So then a few months later F slips and tells my sister about the whole thing with S and her bf. My sister loses it at me, saying I shouldnt be friends with her as shes spreading lies about her bf and S is clearly trying to break up my sisters relationship. She throws a glass at me and breaks my mothers ornament in the hall when she storms out if the house screaming. My argument is that what S said wasnt supposed to be told to anyone else anyway so she definitely wasnt trying to ruin my sisters relationship and in any case my sisters behaviour is unacceptable.\n               Now its a few months later and im going to birthday party for S and I need to get her presents. My sister and i are talking before i head to town and I mention im going to get S presents for her birthday. My sister stiffens up a little and just says \"Right. Okay\"\n        And now i just came home and my sister went crying to our dad about how much she hates S so my dad pulled me aside, gave me a grilling for upsetting my sister, and told me to never mention S again to anyone in the house.\n          Am I the asshole for being friends with S and mentioning her to my sister without thinking and expecting my sister to be fine with the friendship? I feel I already make accommodations for my sister, like i never bring S to our house to hang out just in case my sister gets upset and loses it at her. I think I'm not in the wrong but a lot of the time I cant see what an ass im being until someone else comes along and confirms it. ",

      "description": "We have some kids that moved into the country to live with their dad. So to help him out, we offered to do their laundry for a short time until he got the hang of things. It's been a few years now and they are still bringing their laundry for us to do. Sometimes they even bring weeks worth of it. \nA few months ago we told their dad that we could not do it anymore. Now the kids just ask and my mum cannot say no to them so they bring it over anyway. She does not want to tell their dad over and over again. Their dad has been cheating on their mum ever since they got together and introduced his gf to the kids (their mum lives in a different country) and he only takes advantage of us, isn't thankful and once told me that we were not doing him any favors. My mum does not want to cause any issues but this simple thing is causing a rift between us because she just let's it happen even at her own expense (it's a lot of work, expensive etc...) I told the kids once that it is their dad job and they said \"ok\" but the next time they just brought it over again. I have a feeling their dad is coercing them to do it and I do not think that it is fair since we had told him to stop. \n\nTl;dr: WIBTA if I told them to stop again and let their dad do his job? Their dad won't answer our calls or respond but we know he gets our messages. We know he has the time because he uses it with his gf's but chooses to pile his responsibilities on us while being ungrateful. ",

At first I was reluctant of getting into a relationship because of my current situation, but she however kept insisting that she was interested in me and wanted to get to know me. I thought it wouldnt be too bad to meet her level of commitment to this by reciprocating her feelings. Chabby and I eventually decided to meet, but before that, this is important, we video chatted a couple of times. During those video chats we would talk about random things and it would even escalate to point where we were strip teasing each other. Giving me the impression that she was sexually attracted to me. As for the place we would meet for our first \"date\" we couldnt figure out a place so I suggested the infamous \"netflix and chill. Now many people know what that actually means and to that manner I asked Chabby during one of many of our conversations if she wanted to have sex with me. To which she answered \"yeah if it happens it happen, but dont be expecting it.\" So the day we are supposed to meet finally comes which is a Saturday, however, she cancels because she was too tired from work which I understand so we reschedule for the next Saturday. Chabby and I met for the first time at her place. We head inside and to the promise of my end, I had brought some food to make for dinner for the both us, but Chabby had said she wasnt hungry, so we decided to watch a show on Netflix. Before actually watching the show. We decided to smoke some weed to which I suggested because she is an avid smoker and I thought it help with the tension of the situation. My mind was a mess and my ability to think rationally was completely hindered. Im not too sure if it was because of the weed, but I manipulated her to getting into bed with me and made sexual advances on her. To which she was strongly against so I did not proceed any further. I apologized about it and we spent the rest of the night watching Netflix, talking, and eating the meal I had prepared for the both of us. Eventually we went our seperate ways. The day after, ridden by such regret and dissappointment, I suggested we stop talking and remain as friends. To which she agreed that is what she thought as well. However my dumb ass changed my mind and asked for one more chance by explaining that I was not in the right mind and just wanting to be friends was a result of that. In response of that, Chabby said told me how disrespectful I was and how to how ordeal of me making advances made her extremely uncomfortable and proceeded to call me a creep and then blocked me from contacting her in any way. I am extemely depressed this is how it all turned out, and feel terrible about all of it. I just want to know others opinions about it. In the end, am I just an asshole?",

GF and I knew each other before these relationships and we just flat out don’t like each other. Our personalities just don’t mesh. Also, we all work at the same company but I work in a different department. When it comes to work she is a huge bitch. We’ve never done double dates or hung out as couples. Another important note is that GM is constantly going back and forth with wanting to be with her. One minute things are good the next he is telling FH he is going to break up with her. \nFast forward to wedding planning. I tell FH that I don’t want her there. I don’t want someone I don’t like at my wedding. I also don’t want someone that doesn’t like me at my wedding. And on top of it I don’t want to pay $55 for someone like that to attend. Obviously she’s not that special to him if he is always wanting to end the relationship. FH says not a problem and tells GM when he gives him the Save the Date. FH told me things went good. Fast forward a month or two and GM and FH have a shift together. Turns out GM thought FH was kidding and said “well I live with her and she saw the save the date so how am I supposed to go without her?” I told FH that GM needs to figure it out because I flat out don’t want her there. \nAITA?\n\n",

She (let's call her A), I and my two other classmates live together.\nLast year during a particularly bad sem one day A was hospitalised due to an Infection that went on to affect her nerves leading to weakness in her arms and legs and she was unable to walk. Just the day before after her complaints of not feeling well, we give her meds, call up her mom. Mom arrives at night, till then my friends and I have taken care of A. Fed her even though she refused to eat complaining she doesn't feel like it. She doesn't get better, and is taken to the doctor. Diagnosed with rare disease that paralyses limbs. She was pretty shocked and upset and we go over to the hospital multiple times over the next few days to console her and just to take her mind of depressing things. All the while juggling college, assignments, and the general routine. Meanwhile her aunt has come over too. I help her sort food, groceries, household chores like nobody's business. Sometimes even paying for stuff required  for A through my own pocket. The other flatmates practically useless all this while coz all they cared about was how the aunt seemed to be a disturbance in their studies. \nOn one particular Sunday when I felt like I finally had some time to myself,  I get a call from A's mom saying A is upset and crying and mom feels I should go over asap and spend the entire afternoon with A. I refuse saying I haven't had lunch or taken a shower and feeling exhausted as hell but promise to call A and talk. She says ok. I thought that was the end. Fast forward 1 month A is all better out of hospital and back home. A's mom proceeds to call my mom and tell her how I don't care about A at all and am selfish. Out of nowhere. I was a little surprised and didn't know how to react. Ask A about it and she only tells me how sweet Ive been all along. AITA still? ",

      "description": "I have a small self-run business that I started when I was 12, and I've purchased some fairly expensive items to keep it running. My mom and dad supported my business because my mom didnt want me to leave home to work, and so helped pay for electricity and a couple other things. \nI'm now getting close to finishing high school, and am thinking about selling some of the things I bought for my business, since they will be of no use to me when I leave, and I could use the money. I mentioned to my mom that I MIGHT be selling one of the more expensive items for a couple hundred, but that I wasnt sure yet. She then said she might buy it, because she would be able to use it. I then did some research, and found out that most of the same item were actually selling used for over $600, without the accessories that I would include. I then told her that I did not think I would be able to sell the item to her, because I did some research, and would like to try and get $500 for it. The item I have is appropriate for a business, and she could easily get a smaller new one for under $200. I didn't think this would be an issue, but she then refused to speak to me for the rest of the day and glared at me any time I went near her. Then today she told me that she was shocked I had not offered to give her the item as a gift, because she had always supported my business and had helped pay for some things for it. She was also incensed that I had raised the price when I had agreed to sell it to her. I was a bit confused, as I did not recall ever agreeing to sell it to her, and as to why I would give her the item that I paid over $900 for. She then claimed I knew how much it meant to her, and that I was putting a price on my love for her (what??), and that she would have given the item to her parents as a gift. I told her she could get a smaller version for cheaper that would work just as well, but she just left the room. \nAITA???\n",

      "description": "So my wife and I have a 2 year old son and are expecting another child in January. The first pregnancy went fabulous for my wife. She was always comfortable, looked great, and loved the experience...Well this time around it is the opposite...she is hating being pregnant, constant heartburn, always uncomfortable and not sleeping well etc.\n\nSO...I recently started a new job requiring me to be up at 4:30 and out the door at 5:00 for an hour long commute. I dont complain about the commute or the job as I love my new position. The issue arises when i will occasionally respond with \"just tired\" or \"had a long day\" kind of responses when asked what's wrong.\n\nWhen i give these answers my wife loses her mind and begins shouting that she's always tired and basically made it feel that im not allowed to be tired until after January when it will be justified I guess???\n\nJust makes me feel like an asshole for saying im tired when she's having a rough time...but im still allowed to have feelings am I not???",

      "description": "I'll keep this short because I'm just confused and not sure if I'm reading too much into stuff or not. \n\n\nMy SO is turning 28 tomorrow and in the past month/months I've suggested many activities we could do and asked just as many times what he would like from me or how he wanted to spend his special day. \n\n\nAll my ideas were shot down  because they either involved other people or were too expensive (I can easily afford to treat him). But they were activities he's expressed interest in or enjoyed in the past (hiking, indoor skydiving, airsoft, dinner, movie, picnic, dinner at home) so I know I'm not just coming from left field. \n\n\n\nWhenever I ask what he wants to do, he shrugs and say \"I dunno\" so I thought \"hey maybe me asking is too open ended and overwhelming\" so I wrote a blank activity list with stuff like \"this is how I wanna wake up on my bday. This is what snack/dinner I want on my bday.  This is who I wanna see on my bday\" and it just sat on the desk until it got thrown away unfilled.....\n\n\nHe texted me yesterday saying we're doing dinner with his family then texted today saying it was cancelled with no reason why. I've asked if anything is wrong or if he just wants to not celebrate this year and it be a normal day and he says everything is fine.\n\n\nI don't think he wants to celebrate so should I treat it like a normal day and not say anything? He turned down the gifts I suggested so I'm not sure if I should still get him what I planned or not. I know it's his day but I would still feel bummed if I tried something and he had no reaction or appreciation for it...\n\n\nI can understand wanting to be alone but I feel like I'm being set up for failure since he won't tell me what he wants or doesn't want. If I follow his lead and do nothing am I being petty (even though I don't feel that way I'm worried it'll come across as such)? If I ignore his wishes and do something will he still be disappointed? I have no idea. Should I do something small with a note so it won't be awkward and he can acknowledge his bday if he wants on his terms?\n\n\nI already feel like an asshole because it's not even my day and I shouldn't force him into anything and it's not like it's a requirement to enjoy your bday but part of me can't help but feel bummed out and confused.\n\n\n**Tl;Dr** SO hasn't given any indication they want to celebrate bday. Should I take their lead or should I do something anyway but risk being disappointed in their reaction.",

Long story short, we've been seeing eachother on and off for almost 15 years, its OBVIOUSLY gotten us into problems with one another but I've recently come out of a very bad breakup with my longtime girlfriend, and the Woman in question came back into my life about 2 years ago.\n\nThat being said, things have been very thorny lately and she has become increasingly aggressive to take up part in my heart and home. I don't live far from her, about a 5 hr drive in California traffic so we don't see much of eachtother, but I've rather gotten accustomed to living alone temporarily and its been nice to have a quiet home. However, This explodes frequently over the phone and Now I am extremely distraught because I do have some very high stress levels, I know I can be a jerk and I try to be sensitive to everyones thoughts and opinions but lately, I've felt alone, stressed and just super emotional about alot of things. Its to the point where I don't want to talk about my problems because it always stems into a fight.\n\nTo be fair, she is a lovely person when she is behaving like a civil person. We've had some good times in the past and we've had some real fun, I do enjoy her company and I like when she smiles. It makes me happy to see her happy.\n\nBut then when stuff like this happens, I don't just forget it happened, it strikes me deep to the core and I have loads of loathing and self doubt for days or weeks sorting myself back out again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I have here for you to day, TL;DR for anyone who doesn't want to bother reading it, is a transcript from last week, in a series of Twitter Messages she sent me I have compiled, and my responses to them. AITA if I send her my answers and basically stand up for myself, and tell her to leave me be? Because at this point, I've tried to walk away more times than I can count and short of cutting all contact off, I don't know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So my best friend, Walter was talking about quitting drinking after his 42nd birthday.  I suggested we go to Vegas and do it right.  He loves Vegas and agrees, and we buy plane tickets and book a hotel. We invite two of our other best friends in our group text and they decline, and I invite two other friends that were with us for the last Walter's b-day Vegas trip 2 years ago, and one of them, Moose, agrees, and so we have our crew - me, Walter, and Moose. A perfect solid crew, and I'm pumped to get away for a wild night in Vegas. For me this is an expensive one night trip.  I'll probably spend $1000 to keep up with the other two, and I will have to tighten the ol' purse strings for a while to fit in my budget. Just my plane ticket was $400.  Expensive, but totally worth it for me. A few days later in the group text, Walter says -\" good news I think I booked my flight quick enough that Thomas can no longer go\".  Thomas is a guy we have known since we were little. Thomas and Walter see each other almost daily, and the last several times I've hung with Walter he goes on some rant about how shitty Thomas is, but he feels sorry for him, because he's his only friend.  I used to be friends with Thomas, but not any longer, and the last few times I have hung out with him he has made me feel very uncomfortable and I try to avoid him.  So I'm like, \"what?! there was a chance Thomas was going?! that might have been a deal breaker for me\".   I'm mad Walter even invited him, but I'm glad I dodged the bullet.  Two days later I get a text from Moose saying, \"Looks like Thomas and Walter are going a day early so I might go meet them a day early too. I'm like wtf. So I text Walter to confirm Thomas is going, and then I let him know I'm cancelling, and I have to pay $120 to cancel my plane ticket. For me, the trip is way to expensive to spend the evening with someone that makes me uncomfortable.  He lays on the guilt trip, and the other friends in our group text make it seem like I'm the asshole.  Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "On mobile so apologies in advance\n[disclaimer: I’m in no way looking for validation that I did the right thing, but honestly trying to see if I’m the asshole in this scenario]\n\nMe and my boyfriend have been dating for going on three years. We met freshman year and are now seniors in highschool (both 18 if that’s relevant) and only have 4 months left until graduation. The dilemma at hand is that he’s done with highschool. He’s ready to graduate(obviously just like the rest of us) and believes the last four months of high school are absolutely pointless. Well I totally agree that the rest of high school is definitely pointless and this is all basically busywork, it’s somehow really taking a toll on him. Almost every day(for the last 3 months) he complains incessantly that he doesn’t want to be here and is generally pretty unpleasant person to be around. Today I kind of lost my patience when he was being very short with me because he didn’t want to go to class, and was doing you and leave me and kind of a dick. The conversation went like this \n.\nMe-“You just bed to look at it in a positive way, we’re almost out, and then we’ll be off to [state college]\n\nHim-“whatever it doesn’t matter I don’t want to fucking be here”\n\nAnd most of the conversation was him being honestly pretty rude and short with me. It ended with \n\nMe-“honestly [boyfriend] you just kind of need to get over it. It’s 4 months and we’re home free. And you’re the only one in control of how you feel and how you’re acting”\n\nHim-“we just think differently, no matter what I do I’ll always be mad that I’m here and nothing can change that”\n\nWe got out of the car without a kiss goodbye(1st sign he’s mad) and without much of a goodbye. Later he texted saying I should just support him when he’s going through stuff like this. Problem is, he’s honestly just an overall dick when he’s mad about it, and I’m kinda over being treated poorly when he’s mad. I want to be there for him during all the ups and downs of life, but this feels more like me taking punches. \n\nSo the question is, am I the asshole for not supporting him and just letting him be mad?

We chose renting cars since it is cheaper than taxi and gives us more freedom and mobility then public transport, and personally I feel safer in a rented car then public transport but that is just personal preference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to give some background Dave has a grandmother suffering from dementia, which his parents chose to care for at home. Now I would be fine with this approach as long as it would not hurt their children but this grandmother is a horrible person to be around and they regularly put their children in charge of caring for her. This led to Dave's siblings already living on their own away from their grandmother and Dave (who suffered for years because of this) to say that he would be happier if she were dead. All of this when we have great care homes for our sick and elderly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would also be he only change this year to get away from home as his family does not go on vacation since then there is no one to look after his grandmother (his parents do go on holiday though and then he and his siblings have to take care of her).  \n\n\nBecause of all this me and a friend want to go to his house and have a talk with his parents as we think they a suffocating him and making his live miserable. I realize that this is probably gonna put a strain on our friendship and as he is a close friend I would not like to lose him, however he always gives in to his mother and we believe at least someone should stand up to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I have encouraged Dave to stand up to his parents multiple times but he seems to think this is a normal situation that he should just accept and if I told Dave we are going to visit he would obviously try to stop us and I see no real benefit from him being in this conversation as I want to change his parents behavior not his. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo WIBTA for mingling in someone else live, and WIBLA for doing it behind my friends back?",

      "description": "25M here, friend is the same. We've been very close over the years where we've confided personal matters to each other. A common subject in talks has been his various woes with dating women. The longest relationship he had ended two years ago and lasted for two years - a relationship that essentially involved him adopting his girlfriend \\[same age\\]'s infant daughter. Providing for the child left him virtually penniless and forced him to move back in with his parents with him having lived with his girlfriend and her mother during their relationship.\n\nIt turned out she was cheating on him throughout the duration of the entire relationship, yet he wouldn't pull the trigger on leaving her. In fact, she dumped him to be with someone else. To this day, he tells me from time to time that he misses that relationship, despite it having been so toxic.\n\nSince the breakup, he's seemingly specifically date various pregnant women as about 2/3rds of the women he'd talk to were already pregnant. His most recent girlfriend was pregnant as well prior to meeting him, but that was a relationship that quickly fizzled out after a month. (She had the baby months later)\n\nI chalked it up to it being some weird (to me) attraction type and never questioned his attraction to pregnant women. Then, in a conversation with his mother last month, she revealed to me that both herself and his father are putting a good amount of pressure of him to provide grandchildren for them very soon. When she asked me if my parents are wanting me to have kids soon I said that mine let me live life at my own pace and if I don't want any, then that is my choice. Her reaction was a simple and stern \"Well, I want grandbabies.\"\n\nWhat startled me after that reply was that she seemed to miss the days where he was dating the first girl w/the daughter.  I bit my tongue because I wanted to ask how could she sacrifice her son's well being and self confidence in exchange for him raising a baby even if it wasn't biologically his. That breakup wrecked him.\n\nThis has caused me plenty of concern recently as he just started to date a new girl \\[19F\\] last week that is due in a month. From what I've seen, she seems to be the polar opposite of my friend where she goes out to party a lot and has evidently smoked/drank a lot. My friend specifically seems to have gotten attached to her pretty quick.\n\nHe's just finally restored his finances again and has improved his self-confidence a bit, but I'm worried that he's about to go down another bad path and lose it all again.\n\nI want to warn him about this girl before he'd go official/before she gives birth and I want to let him know that he shouldn't let people put so much pressure on him to live his life the way they want... but at the same time, I feel I'd be hypocritical in some fashion doing that.",

      "description": "I work with a guy, who we will call L, whose head has gotten a little too big ever since he came into some money. The way he came onto this money, is his mother tragically was killed in a motor accident. He never explained how it happened understandably, but in the months leading up to the day he got his money, all he could talk about is \"I cant wait to get my money\" or \"I swear, I'm about to be rich.\" Things like that, where now it just sounds like he was using his mother's death strictly for money.\n\nNow that he has it, it has become 1000x worse than it was. Now whenever anybody says anything about not having alot of money, (like saying \"I barely had money for gas, food, bill's, ect.) He always makes a comment along the lines of \"Glad i dont have to worry about that now that I got money.\" Hes made multiple Facebook posts bragging about his new material wealth, like his new car, new 70 inch TV, just the typical stuff someone who recently got money would get. Now I woildnt really care except on the post he said \"This is what you can get when you work hard and get that money.\" And that blew my mind. How are you gonna act like you made that money yourself through hard work and dedication, when that's the money you got from your moms tragic death?  I just dont understand how one could take a tragedy and turn into what he has turned it into. \n\nMy question is would I be the asshole if I said something to him about the way it looks on him?\n\n",

      "description": "So yeah I am 27 and i have only slept with 4 other girls, 3 of them being in a relationship. I have been going out with my Girlfriend for 8 months and i really do love her. I was aware she slept about a bit from the start of the relationship due to hearing it through open conversation, but i had no idea how bad it actually was. She does not regret her past and she even has labeled herself as the S word and has told me that is what she was before she met me, this was her words, not mine as i have never called her it once, ever. She was aware of what she was and she was proud. I heard her call herself this multiple times before it really got to me the more i fell for her and i would also hear about where she has had sex (Alleyways, guys cars, up mountains beside her house, ANYWHERE). I guess i didn't really care at the start because i was not in love with her like i am now, i just brushed it off as i believe its okay for girls to go and have sex as much as they want. Who am i to judge? I found out her numbers are seriously high a few months into the relationship, we are talking 70 or 80 guys. Wow. Although when i was asked what my numbers are by my girlfriend, i told her, then asked her and she replied saying around 25. Once i caught her out with the lie she said she simply didn't want to make my feel bad. But that is not a reason to lie, especially when i was asked first and i never wanted to even know her number.\n\nShe was obviously comfortable sharing this information with me and trusted me to tell me, she told me she let me know what she was like before me, before anyone else had the chance to tell me. I appreciate her honestly but still i think about it to this day, not all the time but it does enter my head from time to time and i guess it makes me feel awful. We have talked about it and i explained to her how it made me feel as i did not want to hear about all these guys having a go at her and how it makes me feel how easy she was and to be fair nothing has been brought up since, it is never talked about anymore.\n\nShe literally would go out in the middle of the night with guys and just go to an alleyway or a field or in their car. \n\nSo, yeah i have struggled to come to terms with the fact that the girl i love was like this before me and i have NEVER met or even heard about a girl who acted this wild when it came to sex. She clearly has changed and i can see that, to go from all that to commit to me for 8 months.\n\nTL;DR - Girlfriend was EXTREMELY promiscuous in her past, right up until she met me. Her total count is around 70-80 guys. My relationship with her has been great until i found all this out, any advice on how to try forget or even accept it and move on? I have been trying for a bit, its working, but taking a lot of time.",

      "description": "My best friend is a very type A personality person. She hates being cancelled on, she hates when others are late, and she hates plans that aren’t concrete. I have ADHD and depression so I try my best to always meet her on time, etc. \n\nToday she calls me (I had full intents of staying home and doing laundry/ napping / watching tv and ordering takeout) and begs me to come shopping with her so we can go out tonight. I tell her I’m not sure about whether or not I want to go out. I’m obviously hesitant and tired. She begs and tells me we can do something low key and that of course I can always leave when I want because she’s planning on having her FWB come over after. I agree. \n\nWe spend 3 hours shopping a few different stores (a strip) and she asks me to be ready by 11:30. We meet at a place that costs me $22 to Uber to. I have 2 drinks. And we’re there for an hour and 10 minutes when she tells me she has to go because the guy she’s been hooking up with (who was with his own friends) was tired and going to his house. So he told her she could come over. He also told her she could come by tomorrow if she wanted instead. \n\nShe told me she feels bad because we “just got here” but she also doesn’t “want to keep him up” so she’s going to go. I tell her next time she should invite me out for longer than an hour at a time and she tells me “she knows” and that she “fucked up” in the least apologetic way lol. She orders an Uber and leaves 3 minutes later. I order another $20 uber to go home. \n\nI am 100% certain that had I done that to her she wouldn’t be cool about it at all. So she texted me when she was in her Uber about something unrelated and I didn’t respond. I just feel like I was better off staying home and if he gave her the option to come by the next day, why couldn’t she do that? She’s very quick to cut people off and if I was in her situation I would tread carefully knowing how impulsive she can be. I don’t want to cut her off but I also feel like this was a waste of an outfit, over $70 (drinks, covers, Uber’s, etc) in an hour’s time. WIBTA if I cut contact with her for a few days? Or just didn’t make plans with her for an unspecified amount of time. \n\nGranted, she did tell me she had plans after ours. But damn. An hour? Am I crazy?",

      "description": "Before I start, I have to apologize for any grammar mistakes. I am not American.\n\nLast week my car’s battery died and I was in the middle of a highway with few cars passing around, I was 30 minutes far from home, and I was alone. It was noon so the sun was at its highest point, and since we are currently in summer the heat is overwhelming. Dehydration would come easily to the point that it started to hurt my throat and my eyes would stank. My skin was sweaty and I just wanted to throw myself into an icy pool to cool down my overheated body. It is not a pleasant feeling. \n\nSuddenly, a guy in a pick up truck the kind of car you would see in rocky roads pulled up, He was probably starting his 30s. He was tall and wore very formal clothing and asked if I was okay and if I needed help. I explained to him that my battery’s dead. He instantly checked the battery and told me that there were some cables loosen and that was probably the cause. \n\nI was pretty tired at the moment, but I soon remembered that there was this company that brings batteries or other services for your car if needed and they practically are life saviors. I know, too dramatic. I kicked myself for not remembering sooner and I instantly called them, and they told me that they will arrive in an hour. \n\nI told the guy with the pick up car that I have already called for help and that there was no reason for him to stay, that he could go back to work (He told me that he was in the car’s company and that he had to go back to an important meeting) I really didn’t want to be a burden nor wanted him to be delayed. But, he started to act a little weird. He looked my body and then asked how old I was and my naive sf told him that I was 20...he kind of smirked a little creepily and asked me if I could be his friend. \n\nIt took my a aback for a moment and instantly felt uncomfortable. But, I told him that there was no reason for that and I insisted, politely, that he should go back to his work since I have already handled the situation. He seemed disappointed, and I was afraid he would do something to me but he complied, got on his car and drove away. I felt bad, really, but I don’t know him and had never seen him in my life. I don’t know if he had any ill intentions, etc...but I didn’t like the way he stared at my body. \n\nWhen my car was fixed (I thanked the technician for helping and told him how grateful I am for him to come all this way, even though, he said it was his job.  I mean, I was pretty far from the city and we stayed under the sun for 4 hours. I was just so happy that I could go home.)    I told my friends about what happened with my car, I told her everything and she was kind of upset that I rejected the stranger. She told me I was an asshole. \n\nBut I don’t know. The guy SEEMED kind, but I hated and disliked the way he stared at my body. I even told her that, but she told me that “boys always look at women’s body like that”.  \n\nAm I an Asshole? ",

      "description": "I already posted this on r/advice so read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ayrjyg/im_21_and_i_am_sick_of_my_dad_talking_down_to_me/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) first if you can.\n\nTo summarize, first while waiting for a table at a restaurant (my mom was sitting, my dad was fine standing), I was stopped from sitting down by my dad who lectured me that I need to let the women sit down first (which I don't agree with unless they're pregnant or old or something but my parents are old-fashioned), even though I waited a few seconds to see if anyone wanted those seats. He let me sit after I explained that nobody else was going to sit there but I was secretly pissed that he assumed the worst in me like that. I'm 21.\n\nSecond, I got in trouble for saying \"damn\" while handling a hot roll that was burning my hands, and proceeded to lecture to me that I needed to clean up my vocabulary, even though I know never to swear in front of authority figures and never use slurs. In fact, I swear a lot more than he realizes, and I say worse things than \"damn\". I was upset and thought of him as a hypocrite because his mouth isn't very clean himself. I was 20.\n\nSo here's the point of contention: when I posted this on r/advice, some people thought my behavior was immature (even though I never vocalized my anger) and that my dad is only trying to raise me. I realize that, but I'm 21 now and while in hindsight I understand the second incident (he doesn't want me to inherit his negative traits, even if I see nothing wrong with swearing as long as it's not in the wrong place at the wrong time), I hate how he jumped to the conclusion that I was keeping the seats from people who needed them in the first incident. AITA for thinking that way?",

      "description": "TL;DR on bottom.\n\nSo I have only really talked to my partner about this whole ordeal, and while she is extremely helpful she is biased and has admitted it. Although I think she brings up really important points.\n\nMy mom is in a tough situation first of all. She lives in a motel with two kids and her husband. I have been out of the house for around 5 years now and am in University. We do not have bad blood anymore, just differences in how our lives wanted to work that led to this situation.\n\nMy grandpa passed on due to complications too complicated to talk about here about a year ago. Him and I were sort of close. He was interesting for sure and the last things he told me was how proud of me he was for getting my “shit” together per say.\n\nWhen he passed I learned of the money he will be passing to his one son and two daughters. One of the daughters being my mom. My mother was to give some of his estate to me, according to my grandfather’s intentions.\n\nThe check will be coming in within the next month and now my mom is frustrated that I am asking for a share. She believes that the share she will be getting is not enough to be shared with me, but will not talk about it at all with me. \n\nIt is so bad that she is getting angry with me when I bring it up and is pushing me away from the thought of me getting any part of the money.\nThis frustration is in part of her always promising to help when she can, and feeling like when she can she makes excuses. I do not come first in her eyes.\n\nThis isn’t about the money either. Her and my grandpa had a turbulent relationship. But him and I did not. This money would secure my future and help me finish college without any hitches. \nAlthough I know that her situation is shit as well, and she needs to get a house and help her and my siblings and step dad. \n\nSo AITA for expecting my family to help out? Or should I be even more thoughtful to my Mom’s current state?\n\nTL;DR\n\nMom has changed her mind and decided on not giving me a share of my grandpa’s estate. After promising to before. \n\n",

      "description": "Basically my parents, her parents, and nearly all my friends are calling me the asshole for breaking up with my pregnant girlfriend (it's my kid) so Just looking for perspective here. I'll keep things as objective as possible and happily accept my final judgement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 months ago we found out that my gf (or ex now) is pregnant. It was a big surprise since we take precautions (condoms, BC) but she said it might've been a broken condom + she was bad about staying on BC routinely. Regardless, it was confirmed she's pregnant. I'm 21 and she's 20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took the news badly at first. I became surly, didn't talk, and just kept to myself for 2 whole days right after she told me. I was terrified and did NOT want to be a father at all. I just needed time to adjust to the news. I think she expected happiness from both of us as she imagined I'd scoop her up and kiss her and cry tears of happiness after hearing she's pregnant (I know this bc she even referenced that scene in The Office where pam/jim find out they're having a baby).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur relationship during this time was extremely rocky because she wanted us to be engaged before the baby came, and I dragged my feet. I took her to all of her appointments, paid for as much as I could afford, and was there 24/7 for anything she needed. I guess it was more emotional connection that I just couldn't force through and she could tell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago she sits me down and tells me she lost the baby. She says she had stomach cramps and then she miscarried. I was asking her a lot of health questions (I didn't know if a miscarriage this late into a pregnancy was normal?) and she kinda waves me off and is like don't worry I'm ok. After this our relationship's getting slightly better only because I'm slightly more relaxed now. She could tell and asks me to be honest about how I feel about the miscarriage. I tell her I'm sad it's happened so suddenly and mostly still worried for her but deep down I am really relieved because I 100% wasn't ready to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWRONG answer. She starts screaming, crying, throwing things at me. She says she's not miscarried, that it was a test to see my dedication and I've failed it completely. In short we fought for like 3 whole days after this, with little sleep bc she'd randomly throw cups of icy water on me if I dozed off. At the end of that I said I can't do this anymore and broke up with her. I told her I'll be there for the baby and I'll pay my share of whatever is needed but I can't be her boyfriend and I can't marry her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\nNow friends and family are all telling ME that I overreacted, that its just pregnancy hormones and could I blame her? Everyone's saying things like \"you can't leave a 20 year old girl to be a single mother\" but I know that if I married her it could be the worst mistake of my life. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for cutting off the girl who used my mental health against me in breakup?",
      "description": " \n\nTo start, I (22m) had been seeing this girl for about a year. We met at a job over the summer and we went on a few dates, she introduced me to weed, and we generally got along all things considered. I eventually asked her if we would ever get serious and she told me that she wanted to wait until she was done with school before she commits to anyone. At first I was on board because I respected her wishes and wanted a strong healthy relationship. The problem here is that she wants to be a lawyer and that would require more schooling outside of college (i guess around 3-4+ years). She also told me that the school she wanted to go to was in L.A. (we're in NorCal). On top of that, I was feeling self conscious about if I could even wait that long, which would normally be no problem but she hardly if ever shows any signs of affection or interest in me romantically. I would have liked to talk to her but whenever conversations like this come up, she always presents a new reason as why she can't reciprocate. (Ex. She required a solid \"connection\" that only came from seeing me regularly, which is impossible since she goes to a different school, lives in a different city, and she frequently cancelled our plans.)\n\nJumping to the night before the cut, I wanted to talk to her about these feelings. She said yes and we agreed to talk around 10-10:30 and she ends up falling asleep. I knew she was very busy with school and I didn't want to seem pushy or anything like that so I waited hoping she would respond later. Instead she texts me the next morning that she fell asleep because she started a new job (I also didn't know this). I was upset and responded by saying that next time, she should tell me before going to sleep that way I didn't feel that I was left hanging. She exploded saying I'm being immature and that she has a life outside of me and that I was being rude by saying that. This leads to an argument with me just trying to convey to her that I just wanted her to say something prior to her going to sleep which I don't think is asking too much. She didn't see it from my perspective saying that I'm going to be disappointed in life over little things that don't go my way. We weren't getting anywhere so decided to end the \"relationship\". She told me goodbye on Snapchat so I removed her entirely with no further words exchanged.\n\nShe then follows up to text me saying \"Thank you for showing me that all the countless times I talked with you and gave you my love and understanding when you thought about killing yourself meant nothing.\" I snapped, cursed her out, and never talked to her again. She had told me sensitive information which I won't be sharing here and I did not use that against her as I didn't want to stoop to her level.\n\nFor Clarification: This happened months ago. I am no longer talking to this person and am dating someone else who makes me very happy and is nothing like this girl. I think about how this went down and I wonder if I handled this correctly. We were never exclusive by her definition so am I asking too much?",

I can give further details in the comments. \n\nMe and my Ex met through classes, and she had gone through a tough nasty break up. We started talking to each other, and started to develop feelings for each other. After going through bouts of depression (from being hospitalized while attempting suicide, to going into a mental health clinic) and being at her side for a long time through all of this. Things then started falling apart when she stopped taking her meds (while we got temporarily engaged) and she cheated on me with a guy that has the same name. \n\nInfuriated I broke up with her, and blocked her. Flash forward a few months, feeling happy for myself and better because I didn’t have to worry about other people’s problems but my own, she somehow managed to crawl up back into my life. She started talking about all of this really depressing stuff out of the blue, and I told her I’m not emotionally ready or mentally ready to handle those kind of discussions.\n\nShe then called me an asshole for not talking to her about it and not being a good friend to her.

I pondered telling him back then but I barely knew him and I wasn't sure how long they'd dated so I couldn't be sure she cheated at the time. Cut to now and they are engaged to be married and are just about to move in together. Mitch is a great guy and I have a lot of time for him. Kate has messaged me a few times over the past few months and been very flirty.

      "description": "Okay, so hear me out. And before I start, let me just say that I (30F) also have the same disability (yay genetics).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my cousin (14M) is going on a $5k trip to Disneyland with his (50s) parents and (12F) sister. Because of his disability, they've crowdfunded the entire amount because he's always wanted to go and although we have the same disease, his is a lot more severe and there's a chance he could die. So they crowdfunded it extremely quickly and he's going next month - bearing in mind that they don't live in the USA and a lot of the $5k is flights for the four of them. HOWEVER, my qualm is with the fact that his parents earn $150,000 per year between them. Without going into specifics, I know for a fact that they have the money available to pay for the $5k trip in full. AITA for kind of getting angry about this, asking other people for money when people who are donating typically are a lot less financially fortunate than they are? I would just like to point out that I would *never* say this out loud, but honestly it really pisses me off. Like I think it's great that they're taking him to Disneyland and my issue is nothing to do with him, but I just think the parents are taking advantage of people.",

      "description": "So for backstory, im a 20 year old who works at a fast food restaurant that pays quite a bit more than other places in the area. Most of the money helps pay the bills for the house that me and my mom co-own and I use what little left for small things like food and video games\n\nA couple weeks ago i found out that the family and I are going on vacation for the 1st 5 days of June and that everyone of my family members got their time off. However when i tried to get off I was denied, and my managers said too many people requested it off before me. \n\nI talked to them to see if they could reconsider, unfortunately they wouldnt budge and told me that I'd have to go another time. So i tell my family this and they say thats its virtually impossible for them to reschedule, especially my mom since her job almost never approves her day off requests. So i tell them that they'll have to just go without me, but they instead tell me that they refuse to do that and tell me that I'll eventually have to quit my job and find another one after the vacation is over. \n\nI really, REALLY dont want to do that. If i have to find another job, it more than likely wont pay as much as my current, and im strapped for cash enough as it is. AITA for not wanting to quit my job so my family doesnt miss out on vacation? ",

Whether it be if I’m watching tv and a female comes on or if I like a post of a female stranger on Instagram that I think is neat on my feed (I’m not allowed to follow any females, she has my password and has blocked each female on instagram then months later when I realized I went on hers and saw at least 10 guys she’s fucked in the past still following and maybe 20 more I think she’s had a past with but she adamantly denied 😂😂) also YT or anything like that, she gets very mad and demands to know why I “need” to look at girl’s and how attractive they must be to me. Keep this in mind she’s probably has sex with 75+ people and is pansexual and has had sex with more woman than I have also. She likes to think that other people can’t find other people attractive or something? She acts like that even though when she’s gotten mad she’s showed me guys and women she finds attractive.. now I don’t like to lie...I do think a lot of women are beautiful, I appreciate them also. Sometimes when she asks I’ll say yeah I think that person’s cute what’s the big deal? We’re human and if you’re telling me you don’t find anyone else attractive that’s a flat out lie because she used to be one of those girls with a million people after her trying to get at her and she got to pick and choose to her likings and who she fucked.. and I’ve seen pics of the people she used to hook up and they consisted of really really “good” looking guys, definitely a lot better then me (Not that I care I’m fine with that) I also can’t watch any movie with nudity in it, but that’s only me as I’m sure she doesn’t mind it for herself. So recently I was watching the South Korea Fortnite tournament where tfue plays with some streamer I never have heard before named kitty plays. I was watching it earlier and my girlfriend flipped out saying why am I watching some girl and I must think she’s incredibly hot (I don’t, I really just like watching the gameplay) so flash forward to later and I decide to watch some other kittyplays gameplay (because to be honest, she rules and IS a really good gamer...) she once again flips out and starts screaming saying how could I treat her like that and why can’t I just watch males instead of some streamer with her tits out... (I don’t think she thirsts people into watching her but idk I’ve only seen one video..)  I responded something along the lines of that’s literally insane if you have an issue with any women that pops up in front of me whether it be on YT or IG or TV then by that logic you shouldn’t be able to leave your house because you’re attracted to females AND males... I just don’t get it. I love my girlfriend, I would never cheat or jeopardize anything but am I seriously crossing a fucking line trying to watch some female stream fortnite? I tried watching a movie that got good reviews the other night and she looked up the parental controls on IMDB and called me saying there are multiple sex scenes what am I trying to do/ what are my motives...Is this just insanity or am I the asshole? Am I seriously that bad? ",

The issue was she wanted to buy tickets now, so we had a quick discussion. She said if I decide not to go, she would pay for the tickets (they are non-refundable).\n\nI later found out there is a dress code, and I would have to pay 170 bucks in addition to the 50 bucks for the ticket, which was too much for me (as a college student), so I told my girlfriend that. She asked me who would pay for my tickets now, and I referenced what she said. She told me that that was under the assumption I would not want to pay for it, but if I want to pay for it I should pay for it, or we can split it 50:50. I told her that doesn't seem fair, as she clearly said she would pay incase I won't go, and that was part of the reason I agreed to this. \n\nI do understand that she does not feel like paying for it, but if she offered it and I took the offer under this condition, I also don't find it fair that I have to pay for it. In the end she said she would pay for it, but instead I have to pay for other expenses we usually share - which results in the same amount of money being in our wallets as if I paid for the ticket, so I'm also not particularly happy with that solution. \n\nBut before I argue about it, can I have a quick judgment?",

Personally, I don't care for their sense of humor much, but I don't particularly dislike it either.\n\nI'm doing my thing, doodling up a storm in the art room, when one of the kids noticeably points at me, and then whispers to his group. He then gets up, walks over to me, and makes a big show of pulling out his stupid special AirPods. He then asks, \"Hey, \\[name\\], how was your day?\" I start to respond but he cuts me off in the middle of my first word and snorts, \"Sorry, I don't speak broke.\" I don't consider myself to be upper class or lower class, but he has gone too far by using derogatory terms that he cannot throw around, especially used as a way to demean someone. I have already had enough by this point, so I snap back at him, \"What was that? I don't speak asshole.\" He and his group are a bit taken aback by this, and he obviously didn't expect this reaction, so he just shuffles back to his group.\n\nHim being one of the most popular kids, I expect a little bit of word to have spread by tomorrow that I called out the special little guy who makes everyone laugh, and they're probably going to mask the fact that they initiated while doing so.

There's a lot that we could do to lower the bills that we don't do, and my parents prefer that I not bring these things up as \"it's too stressful to discuss.\"  They have the premium cable package and rarely watch the premium channels.  They subscribe to Hulu and don't watch it.  They pay for a satellite radio that hasn't even been installed yet.  I try to tell them that getting rid of these little things might add up to some great savings, but they always say they'll figure it out on their own.  This is why I've been getting upset lately when they ask me to borrow money.  They always pay me back eventually, so I always lend them the money, but it's sometimes multiple times a week that they ask and sometimes they borrow money without asking me at all and I only find out when I check my bank statements.  I feel guilty about not wanting to give them the money -- I live at home rent free.  But it gets in the way of me saving the money myself so that I can move out (I'm 21, full time student, work part time, so I don't make much as it is).

I had tea lights and candles going, I wrote him a thoughtful card and got him and gift and waited eagerly to come home. I dressed up and put on makeup which I rarely do, I was so ready to seduce him. I put on a playlist to set the tone. He came home late....with nothing. I hate to say it but I was a little disappointed. He didn't even get me a card. He's not very romantic and struggles with romantic gestures to begin with. This is our first valentines together as last year we were living in separate states (military) and last year he got my favorite flowers. I've told him before how I've never received anything for valentines and that it's a depressing day. I don't want to sound entitled I just want to know...am I the asshole for being a little down put that my husband didn't make any effort this valentines?",

      "description": "So there's this friend of mine that I met at a party back in April 2017. We've known each other a while now and grew really close in around 6 months. We'd be there for each other when needed in the early months of our relationship and towards October, we'd grown really close. I'd seen her every weekend from October 12th to November 8th and we'd talk almost daily. \n\nShe's been a great friend to me and has done a lot that means very much to me (my dad, brother, her and two close friends of mine threw me a surprise birthday party on the 25th of October and she'd not only baked me a cake, handled most of the decorations, painted me a picture of the album cover for Ten by Pearl Jam; a favorite of mine, all during mid-terms) but as of November, she's become awfully distant.\n\nWe barely talk and when we do, it's normally me who initiates the conversation. We hang out like once a month and she normally postpones frequently, making it difficult to, well, hang out. This in contrast to the fact that she used to message \"I miss you guys\" to our group when we'd hung out like 3 days ago makes me wonder what happened.\n\nFor more context, after the whole birthday thing, I'd developed feelings for her and eventually told her 2 weeks later, I didn't do anything extra like \"I wanna spend the rest of my life with you\", just \"I like you as more than just a friend\" to which she told me she didn't feel the same way. After that, I began to fear that I'd driven a wedge into our relationship and was on edge when things started to deteriorate. I asked if our distance had anything to do with my feelings and whether it made her uncomfortable, but she said it had nothing to do with me. \n\nNow though, she's in a relationship with someone and over the course of 2 months, I've seen her twice. Like I said above, she barely texts and frequently postpones. Sometimes her excuses don't add up because she says one thing like \"I'm broke and can't go out\" and then she goes out the next day (I know because my friends and I follow the group of friends she spends time with now). I feel wrong for doubting her but she's been giving me nothing but excuses and I don't know whether I should just believe her because she's a good person or doubt her because the facts don't add up. As of a few hours ago, she got  back from a day out with her friends. She'd told me 2 days ago that she was completely out of money for all of January since she'd asked for her January allowance in advance and wouldn't be able to hang out at all. When I'd suggested asking her younger sister to pay for her since she's against friends paying for her, she'd said \"that's a nono\" and I'd just conceded, but that's exactly what happened today. I asked her why she changed her mind but she told me I didn't have to question everything she did, to which I agreed. \n\nShe told me a while back that she didn't want things to change between us after the whole confession thing but it feels like she's just avoiding me at this point. I feel like I'm wrong for doubting her and questioning the things she says but at the same time, I feel like if I don't know what's wrong, neither of us can make an effort to fix it.\n\nTl;dr - friend who I grew really close to suddenly started being distant, and giving me excuses for why she can't hang out with me and my friends. I wanna know why we grew so distant and why her stories don't add up, but feel guilty for doing so because she's a good person. Help.",

Today, I was sitting with two of my coworkers discussing work and the topic shifted to some other business ventures the company has made. The woman said “these Jews just want to make money”, in reference to the two owners, who are both Jewish and pretty well renowned in their field of medicine. While I am Jewish, I’m not very threatened or offended by this, however I feel somewhat compelled to not let this slide.\n\nMy questions is, would it be the right thing to speak to a manager about this, exposing myself as the one who told and potentially getting her in trouble, or letting it slide as an offhand comment? For context as well, I have been there 8 months and she is relatively new, so 3-4 months. She has also made many nagging comments about coworkers, patients and managers. ",

We only do missionary and she always just lie down, except for kissing she doesn't do blowjobs or any other positions. I get really tired after 30 or so minutes ( just missionary and foreplay that I do for her) plus the fact that I don't feel anything (probably due to condom or years of masturbating) so needless to say I don't like sex but she does and she always demands it at least 2 times a week. Basically yesterday I told her that I can't keep doing this unless she agree that we try something new, she denied and said anything other than missionary is too tiresome for her. I basically responded with \"I put a lot of efforts and tried a lot of things just to make you feel good so why don't you just do this for me at least once? I feel like masturbating is 10 times better than what I am having with you right now\". She told me that why don't I just masturbate instead so I told her that from now on I would limit the time I have sex with her and masturbate instead. She got angry and said \"You are a horrible person\". So am I demanding too much? Am I the asshole in this?",

      "description": "I work in a small office, there were only four of us for a long time. We sit in cubicles so you can't see each other, but because it's a small room you can hear everyone perfectly. We've always had an unspoken rule that work comes first. We do chat a few times a day, but it's always been understood that if you say something and no one answers you, either they're not at their desk (again, we can't see each other from our work stations), or everyone is too busy to talk.\n\nFor example, someone might generally say \"How was your weekend?\", and either people will answer and have a small conversation, or if everyone is too busy they'll ignore the question because they're working. None of us have any hard feelings if you say something and no one replies, it's just understood that we're all busy.\n\nAnyway, we recently hired a new coworker, and he's been extremely chatty. I tried to be polite at first, and would talk to him every time he asked a question or mentioned his personal life. I figured he was trying to get to know his coworkers and I saw it as a good thing. But it has not died down.\n\nIf he says something and no one answers, he now peaks around our cubicles to speak to us directly so you don't have the option of ignoring him. He talks so much about his personal life that I know more about him than I do coworkers who I've been with for years.\n\nIt got to the point where my boss called a meeting to address the frequency of personal conversations when we should be working. This is not good for me since I'm already on probation for unrelated performance issues.\n\nI thought this would solve the problem, but now this coworker follows me to the lunch room on my breaks and monopolizes my full lunch hour with irrelevant stories because technically I'm \"off the clock\".\n\nWill I be an asshole if I ask them to stop talking to me? I work in a customer facing role, so my lunch breaks are one of the only chances I have to be left alone for a while, but I don't want to alienate a new employee.",

      "description": "So I know this might sounds obvious, but for some reason I still feel guilty over it. \n\nSo I’ve been raised in a upper middle class family, but always have been taught to appreciate what I have a give back when I could. \n\nSo usually on the subway, you get your usual fare of beggars who at begging for money, food etc. Which comes to my story. So while on subway yesterday night, some young guy on the train starts saying how he’s homeless, needs money to buy food and such. \nI usually don’t give out money, I only offer to buy food, but I was carrying so many coins in my purse that I never use, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to get rid of it. \n\nSo here’s where the action starts. The moment I pull out my wallet, the guy comes over to me and starts asking for a dollar, but as soon as I open open my purse and taking out my coins, he focuses on the bills I have. Something like “Ms. I can see those bills you have, you only need to give me a dollar, I only need a dollar etc.” When I say I’m giving him coins, he starts exploding, saying like “BITCH I DONT NEED TO COINS, I NEED BILLS, ARE YOU DEAF”. Hearing this, I quickly put my wallet away and the coins in my pocket and say I won’t be giving anything to him. Then he starts yelling in my face, and walking all around the subway car, saying how ungrateful I am as harassing other people. And when someone stands up and tells him to leave me alone, he basically threatens and says he’s gonna fuck everybody up unless I give him that dollar. This goes for another 2-3 minutes until I get to the next stop and run to the train across the station. \n\nMy question was I the asshole for offering money then taking it back? Since I basically caused the situations by opening my wallet and causing everyone in the subway car to be uncomfortable. ",

      "description": "Long story short, I’ve made a new friend about a month ago and we seemingly get along really well. Suddenly, this friend slowly started to fade me out. Messages go unanswered, except when only this ‘friend’ has something to get off their chest. We used to play Xbox together, but this friend has resorted to hiding offline , reasons unknown but we would play almost every night. I don’t think I did anything.. one time I gently asked if everything was ok, and just was given the ‘I’m so busy’ speech which can be very true, but to be ignored and only messaged back days later when my friend has something to get off their chest, and my previous message not even acknowledged.. just kind of sucks. \n\n\nSo I’m thinking of just removing this friend off my social media and etc and not looking back. I’m usually a care free person, but for some reason it’s itching me. J want to ask what’s up... but most likely will be given the run around and come off as desperate. ",

I have been trying to talk to more people by working at macdonalds but that is to help my one on one talking to people.\n\nMy mum had asked me for help with something which involves me reading off of a script and she would record for some community project she was doing. I absolutely hated the idea. My sister was down for it but I said no. Which resulted in my mother being angry at me and going off to her bedroom to play her phone. This will not include any face recording just voice recording but the thought of the recording going to be used for a project that many people will witness I cannot stand. So was it wrong of me to say no to her? She is now giving me the cold shoulder. Was I suppose to say yes and do it anyway?",

      "description": "AITA. \nSome back story\n\nLast December my family found out that my brother has been acting inappropriately at his university. He had been videotaping his dorm mates  in the shower and messaging some of our mutual male friends some inappropriate messages. He was kicked out of school but still living in Minnesota (6 hours away from us). When my parents confronted him and tried to figure out why he was so disturbed he claimed he was raped in high school. \n\nI (21F) knew he was lying because he was disturbed well before high school. He actually molested me several times when we were kids (he is four years older). I did not want him to manipulate my parents any longer so I went downstairs and finally told my parents what he had done to me. They were obviously upset and furious. \n\nI’ve never told them about the assault before partly because I was ashamed but mostly because if I didn’t talk or think about it then I could pretend it never happened. But now that my family knows I can no longer pretend nothing happened. \n\nAnyways... My dad wanted to kick him out I convinced him not to. Instead we decided he would stay home from Minnesota and we would figure this out together. It was the plan until my brother abandoned us and in the middle of the night he went back to Minnesota. \n\nObviously we are all angry and upset at him. At this point I am completely done with my brother. I do not give two shits about him. That was a year ago but now I’m angry with my parents because after everything he’s done to me they still support my brother. I’ve told them that this bothers me but my mom claims, “He’s still our son” \n\nThey even let him come home for thanksgiving (he stayed with my uncle) which ruined my holiday weekend because I spent most of it crying. I love Christmas and I really don’t want that holiday ruined too. I don’t want him home for Christmas. Am I the asshole? \n\n\n\n\nTL;Dr Am I the asshole for not wanting the brother who molested me home for Christmas? ",

      "description": "So I made friends with two people (let’s call them Amy and Jack) and it was going great, we all had a lot in common. \n\nI began to notice that Amy would badmouth Jack to me and complain about him, such as his sexuality or lack of money. I thought she just needed to vent but thought they were unfair comments.\n\nThen it got worse. Before we were all friends, a huge party had been arranged. Me and Jack were both invited but Amy was not. Me and Jack had arranged to go to this party months in advance. She knew we were both going and didn’t comment until closer to the time. She asked if we could try get her invited as she wanted to celebrate with us (Amy is shy around people she doesn’t know and didn’t speak to anyone attending apart from us), so we asked but got told no. We asked Amy if she’d prefer if we didn’t go, but she said she had no problem with it and told us that one of her other friends was having a party and she’d just go there.\n\nSometime later, Jack had informed me that Amy had a fanpage and asked if she’d mentioned it to me. She hadn’t. I thought it was odd she didn’t mention it considering how close we were so I asked her and she was vague about it. As i’m quite nosey, I asked her if I could see it and she wouldn’t let me. Jack ended up finding it. I found almost all of her tweets were aimed at me and Jack, slating us going back to when we first became friends and more recently, about how angry she was about the party. The tweets were really hurtful, some of them had her own MOTHER commenting (she spent most of her time slating people like a teenage girl whenever we visited) She didn’t name us, but the time frames matched up and we knew they were aimed at us. Jack just left it although he was hurt but I confronted her. She denied them being about us, but wouldn’t tell us who they were about. She then blocked us from the account.\n\nI was irritated and used my old twitter account to watch her account. Surely enough, she continued to aim tweets at us and began posting our personal issues on there and mocking us. I confronted her multiple times but she’d just deny it and tweet more, so me and Jack both cut her off and stopped speaking to her.\n\nMe and Jack are still friends to this day, and she is still badmouthing us to whoever will listen but we are still being told that we are horrible people for cutting her off and we’ve left her depressed. Im struggling to see what I’ve done wrong as I confronted her multiple times and she still would lie. I’ve lost friends as I won’t “give her another chance” but I really don’t want to, especially as I know her own family was badmouthing me. She thinks she’s done nothing wrong.\n\nAny questions please ask, this is summarised due to the word count.",

      "description": "This happened almost 10 years ago with my then gf and now wife. We joke about it now and adamantly maintain that the other was wrong.\n\nWe were getting lunch at a sandwich place and could not decide which sandwiches we wanted, so we both agreed to get a different sandwich and share each half. \n\nWe get our sandwiches and leave the restaurant. Much to my horror, upon unwrapping one of the sandwiches, it had globs of mayonnaise on it. I hate mayonnaise. It is usually disgusting. These days I can tolerate it if it's a thin spread of it, or if it's like a freshly made aioli, but back then the mere sight and smell of it would make me want to vomit. \n\nImportant to note, the restaurant listed all of the ingredients for the sandwiches on the menu, but for whatever reason, DID NOT NOTE there would be mayonnaise on this particular sandwich. As we had left and were in a rush, we could not go back and have the sandwich remade. \n\nAs such, I reneged on our agreement and commandeered the other sandwich that did not have mayo on it, and said I would not be sharing it since she could have the other whole sandwich to herself (she likes mayo).\n\nShe was not happy and it turned into a bit of a fight. My thinking is that I entered into this agreement under the false pretense that this sandwich only contained ingredients that I liked, therefore our verbal contract to share the sandwiches was null and void. Had I not nullified the agreement, this would have left me with only one half of a sandwich while she would be left with 1.5 sandwiches, as I obviously would not eat the other one. \n\nSo Reddit AITA?\n",

      "description": "The came with leaf blowers and weed-eaters, ready for the 20 minute  *let's use loud power tools to clean the yard* thing.\n\nFlatly wouldn't let them access the property.  Turned into a big shouting match, but I prevailed.  I said:  \"Come back anytime between Monday and Saturday.\" \n\nThis was the second time the issue came up with them at 9:30 on a Sunday morning.  (They are a new yard crew, replacing a guy who was coming for 6 months--once a month--at varying times between Monday and Saturday.  I never had any issues with him, and was informed by landlord of that situation when I rented.)\n\nThe first time I saw this new crew, last month, I had guests from out of state over for a breakfast; we eat most of our meals on our outdoor patio. I had a large breakfast set up for 6 people, we were just sitting down and this  crew of 3 people shows up, demanding to do their thing. They did.  Totally ruined our breakfast.  The property is very small, yard is 150 x 40 feet.  Dust all over our food before we could even carry it back inside.\n\nI told them: \"Don't come on Sundays anymore.* They did not respond to my comment.   \n\nApparently these new guys made an arrangement with the landlord to do their monthly work *anytime* they wanted.  My state, like virtually all states, only limits big construction companies from working Sundays.  Leaf blower guys, yardmen can legally make all the noise they want Sundays.  (And it is rare--from my observation--for any these people who elect to work Sundays to give a s--- that they are bothering people with their noise.)\n\nAnd homeowners have a key role here by not informing people they hire that Sunday work is not permissible *to show respect to their neighbors.*. (Looking at the whole situation I would probably tolerate power tool work after 1 p.m. Sundays.)*\n\nLandlord is all pissed off at me, and is fining me $200.  I'm not disputing this because of another key factor: I reside in the main downstairs unit and he has 2 upstairs tenants in small units.  That means this is not *my rental house* but more like a rental complex.  \n\nLegally no tenant in a complex has the right to control a common area like a yard.  I have exclusive use to the yard fronting our patio and the upstairs neighbors, who both incidentally agree with me on this Sunday work issue, access only part of the yard.\n\nBut the upshot here:  The landlord can send over whomever he wants whenever he wants without giving us any notice.\n\nSo the ethical/moral issue:  *Did I unfairly treat the yard workers.*   \n\n\n",

That's it). \n\nI got so angry that I yelled at him on his way out the door. I told him he was fucking lazy and that he should have gotten up earlier than 10:30am so he could help me out. I do 80% of the cleaning without asking for help. \n\nI feel really bad I yelled at him, but I am so angry that he left all of this to me AGAIN. AITA?\n",

      "description": "     To give a little background, we met when I was 16 and she ended up moving about 2,000 miles to live with my mother and I about 4 months into the relationship (we were the epitome of the stereotypical lesbian “u-hailing”). Things were pretty great the first year and a half of our relationship, until deciding to get into a temporary open relationship; that’s when things started to shift. \n        I ventured out a lot during the open relationship period and she didn’t. I started to feel emotional distance between us and we decided to end the open relationship aspect of our relationship and continue being monogamous. That is then the first time she cheated on me with a guy best friend that I suspected was more than that and eventually broke up with me for two weeks for him. \n        Later, we get back together and decide now since I was graduated from HS, we would move back to her home state. We lived in a larger city for 3 years there where I met a really good friend/coworker. I really enjoyed this friend, and introduced her to my SO of the time (my ex) and they hit it off really well. To wrap this up, they ended up texting for the last 8 months of our relationship behind my back, and we all would hang out and carry on our times together, me unknowingly getting cheated on directly in front of my face. She ended up breaking up with me, I moved north to transfer to university and come to find out they are now dating. \n       This entire situation of distrust and cheating and all of the toxicity of our relationship has had a toll on my mental health, I have been in and out of therapy, psychiatrist offices and prescribed different meds for major depressive disorder over the last 8 months or so. \n          I am currently in a relationship with the woman of my dreams and we are insanely happy; she’s everything I could ask for. Within the last month, my ex moved to the same college town I live in and knows no one and I feel some sort of responsibility to ensure that she isn’t lonely and unhappy and has a friend. It makes my current SO upset, rightfully so, but I can’t help but feel that way about my ex. \n\nAITA for feeling this way? Am I just being stupid? Why am I drawn to this toxic situation? ",

      "description": "My current girlfriend and I have been dating for 7 months now. She’s a very fun person to be around, so naturally she has a lot of friends. A few of her friends are her former partners (yes, I said “few”). Her being friends with her exes has never bothered me up until now. I’ve always been confident in her and in us. As long as she’s not leading them on or doing anything inappropriate, then she’s free to do whatever with them, her choice. She says she loves me and has no feelings for any of her exes whatsoever and I believe her.\n\nHowever, the longer we date, the more I’m learning about one particular ex. I’ll call him Jared. And I’ll call my girlfriend Lisa. Lisa and Jared dated for three years and he was Lisa’s first ‘true’ love. When they broke up (because she fell out of love for him), they continued to sleep with each other. When Lisa started dating someone else, she CHEATED with Jared on her partner at the time. \n\nShe’s been real down in the dumps the last month or so because she misses home, but she had a really good day the other day. She was happy and back to her normal self. While we were laughing and having a great time (for the first time in a short while), she accidentally called me Jared. My insecurity jumped through the roof after that because it made me feel that she was only having a great time because she was subconsciously thinking of him or being with him. \n\nThey talk periodically, texting and phone calls. Sometimes she even initiates the conversations. For Christmas, she’s going back to her home state and Jared is going to spend Christmas time with her family because her family misses him and Lisa’s older brother wants him to meet his newborn (I will not be attending since I’ll be returning home back to my own home state). Before she moved away, Jared went to her going away party with all her close friends. I even saw pictures of them having a great time - nothing inappropriate, but enough to make me jealous, to make me think he’s still someone important to her. And she’ll say stuff like that sometimes, that he was really important to her at one point and that’s why she wants him to remain in her life.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I told her she can no longer speak to him?

I fully support her and am trying myself to find a new job down there so we can be together again. Since she left, I have drove down every weekend but 1 or 2 because she cannot take time off or leave early on Fridays to come to me. It's a lot easier for me to go to her.\n\nAnyways, this weekend is opening weekend for deer hunting. She had plans to come see me because she finally got a Friday off. Yesterday she told me she forgot it was opening weekend is actually going hunting with her dad instead all weekend (she lives with her parents, so she sees them everyday). I said ok, no problem because I don't want to seem like an ass. I'm not the type of guy to be intimidated by her relationship with her dad because I totally get it. I mean it's her dad and he will always be her #1 no matter what.\n\n I have not told her this upsets me but I plan to. We have a strong relationship and are very open with each other about how we feel. Now, this is a minor issue and is by no means relationship-ruining, but it is something that bothers me. \n\nAITA for being upset and hurt that she chose to stay home when she had a good chance to finally come visit me?",

      "description": "Note - This, among a lot of blow outs, happened last year. This one stuck out the most in my mind and I still look back and wonder if I was in the wrong. Please note that I am a female.\n \nSo, last year after gradding from college, I decided to move in with my mom for a bit in a different state so I could: 1.) Get on my feet faster and, 2.) Rekindle my connection with my mother. Growing up, she wasn’t always there. Drugs and relationships with men that were not good for her made it hard for her to be there for me and my little brother.\n\nShe eventually got clean, got a job and was getting her shit together. At least, I thought she did.\n\nThe first month or so with my mom was ok. I did learn she started smoking weed, which isn’t bad imho, but it’s risky, seeing as we lived in a state that hasn’t legalized it yet. Things had gotten... fuzzy by the time it was a little less than two months in. She started asking why I hadn’t told her when I lost my virginity (which was a random thing to ask and none of her business, I’m an adult) and would walk around half naked and talk about things she did sexually with men, sometimes for money.\n\nAnd then the screaming started. Apparently, when I didn’t answer the phone early enough or stay silent when she made a snide remark I was being “lazy” and horrible to her. Or, I wasn’t getting a job fast enough, and that just flew her either into a rage or a crying fit.\n\nI was so stressed when we made another move, to an apartment complex  with a very nasty landlady who apparently used rent for drugs (according to some friends who still live there, she has since been fired and replaced). Around this time, I finally got a job. It wasn’t perfect, but it was an office type of job and I was just happy to get anything at that point. It had been a couple of months since we lived there and we wanted to move to a smaller home in the suburbs. I had a cat that I loved, etc. My mom started drinking more and smoking weed daily, and her friends, who did harder drugs and drank more started to influence her actions and thoughts. During the training for a new job, we would have hour long lunches and breaks and near the tail end of one of these breaks, my mom called. The convo went something like this: \n\nMe: “Hi mom”\nMom: -slurring, I can hear her friends talking in the bg- “You know what? I know we don’t have the money now, but I’m gonna skip on the rent for that bitch and move! We can stay with *one of mom’s friends that she’s said is a creeper and I never met* for a month until we move!”\n\nMe: “Mom, I’m a little uncomfortable with that, maybe we can talk about it a little more-“\n\nMom: *screaming* “I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU! YOU’RE *mockingly* ‘UNCOMFORTABLE’?! I SACRIFICED EVERYTHING FOR YOU!”\n\nBy then, my coworkers started slowly coming in, they could hear her through the phone, berating me. Half of it, I can’t even remember because I silently started crying. I was so humiliated. I could barely muster a “Love you, mama. See you later, bye.” Before I fled to the bedroom and just.... had a breakdown for fifteen minutes. \n\nIt felt like, no matter what I did or said, I would always make her angry or upset. She would scream and cry and try to start an argument with me in public several times, and I just felt like I could never fucking win with her.\n\nFast forward to now, my mom didn’t learn her lesson about saving money and rent and we lost our jobs, our house, and our cat. At least he found a home in the end. We had to stay with a relative for a few months, but luck would have it that my mon was hired with a better paying job and she moved back. I didn’t go with her because I wanted her to be stable and in a home before I came down to try again.\n\nBefore anyone judges me for moving in with her, I am in the process of also getting hired and starting a job there in March, that’s why I’m moving and I don’t intend to live with her very long. \n\nI can weather a few more months with my mom, but I can’t help but wonder if I am really that horrible of a daughter? She has said and shown some horrible habits and words towards me but I can’t help if maybe I was at fault, some how? I think this will haunt me for a very, very long time. ",

      "description": "On the weekends my (M23) roommate (F23) doesn’t have, and she has a strange sleep schedule (4:00AM-4:00PM). She recently bought a puppy, without giving me very much heads up. She keeps it in a kennel while they sleep. So often I will let the dog out so she will stop yelping , this way I can focus on my work, as I am a full time student. Well the last two days it has had an accident in the kennel and wouldn’t quit yelping. It was the worst shit of all time, it’s still in the house a day later!!! So both times I woke my roommate up and asked her nicely to take care of it. Both times she did. But the second day she was obviously upset about it. Later in the day she writes a set of “dog rules”. Some where as follows.\n\n•if taken out of kennel by someone other than (roommate) you are taking full responsibility of the mess inside and outside of the kennel.\n\n• do not take dog out of the kennel unless taken outside and walk first or leave for whenever (roommate) is ready to take out.\n\n• if you can’t handle smell, or noise,  you have car keys you can leave.\n\nI told her that “if I take her out, so she’ll stop yelping, I will clean up any mess she makes after that point. Though I shouldn’t have to. Normal human beings are up at 10:00AM-12:00PM and have already walked their dogs. But those other rules, I am not going to follow. I pay rent to stay here and I need to study/do homework. Even if I am not studying and just watching TV I will wake you up. I shouldn’t have to sit here smelling and listening to your dog. It’s yours and you WILL take responsibility for it. You’re not gonna tell me to leave a place that I pay money for, because you want to sleep the afternoon away. It’s illogical and unethical.” \n\nSo AITA here??? My boy Wyatt (my best friend/her boyfriend) thinks I am in the right, but he’s scared to say anything as this is his first girlfriend and he doesn’t wanna mess stuff up. Plus I ain’t no snitch.",

Because of this, I have made an effort to not bring it up as often, but sometimes I cant help it.\nHonestly its not even the trash, its because she is kind of also a princess about it. Every time I clean I hear about how I am doing it wrong or I threw out the wrong thing or I dont clean often enough (she never cleans btw) \nShe told me she couldn't take out trash because she has a bad immune system. But then the other day I got yelled at for assuming the trash around the house bothers her because obviously its only trash that's been sitting (even though trash around the house has been sitting too) and I should shut up about it. My first thought was if that is true then she could put food away after she is done, and not leave it out.\nI have also seen her handle trash before so at least sometimes its ok, but on the other hand she also IS sick that's not a lie....She has also said that her anxiety is the reason for not doing more housework or making less of a mess so I am confused. \nI don't know whether to feel like an asshole or not",

      "description": "Hey. This is my first post on reddit so bare with me. \n\nMe and my boyfriend just welcomed a new baby boy to our home. He’s a month old at this point and spent the first three weeks of his life in the Nicu. He came home about 2 weeks ago. I do a majority of the parental duties. Like 90%.\n\nWe have these two friends who we like to hang out with a lot. They are another couple so we do couple stuff together all the time. During my whole pregnancy the girl, I’ll call her Tammie, told me when my son was born she would come and hang out with me all the time and couldn’t wait to see him. THE DAY we bring him home she and her boyfriend call to see if my boyfriend can hang out. I tell him it’s fine since the baby hadn’t been fussy at all that day and I wanted to spend as much time with him as I could. The only problem is...now when they call it’s only to see if my boyfriend wants to hang out. He goes and hangs out with them constantly while I’m stuck at home with the baby. \n\nI told my boyfriend that if felt like I didn’t really have friends because since I had the baby she hasn’t said a word to me and only wants him to come and hang out. He told me to call my own friends to come hang out (tammie and her boyfriend were his friends before I started dating him). I told him I’d love too but the one friend I have works at a hospital and has very little time to hang out. We got into an argument about it and now I feel like an asshole for asking him to stay home and help out with the baby more. Am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for calling my friend out for racism even though we're not from USA",
      "description": "Throwaway because friends know my reddit account. If she finds this, I'm killing myself. ESL.\n\n\nSo I (24F) have a friend (23F) that I've know for years now. I'd like to think we know each other pretty well, but you know, people change, especially in this age. I, same as many of my peers, spend too much time on the internet and a lot of US pop culture. But we're both from central Europe. I could say I know that I'm pretty fluent in pop culture and history and so on, more than her. We also do have some nerd and some dark humor in common. \n\n\nRecently, when she was abroad, she found a boyfriend. He's a bit older and french. Once we were in chat together and I talked to him for second time ever. It was pretty late and my friend mentioned he had some wine and was a bit aggregated. Towards the end, he literally called black people monkeys and then niggas (no R for the record). Nobody else reacted so I didn't either. We have reeally low number of POC in our country, seriously. \n\n\nSo after giving some thought, I wrote to my friend privately after like an hour saying that I don't think that what he said in the last part was cool. She was confused what I meant, so I specified the racial slurs. Apparently, she jokes with him like that all the time. That actually stunned me even more - she was never openly racist as far as I knew her. So I told her a bit a what I knew about this and why I thought it wasn't alright to say those things. Sent a few links explaining how monkey is used as dehumanizing and compared it to few slurs from our language. I also said that it's not that I'm somehow angry on someone elses behalf, but I was just unconfortable with how easily it came out. \n\n\nShe said that she doesn't see it as a big deal and that I'm probably \"too educated about this stuff\" and \"she's not as sensitive as I am\" and that he has black friends and when she hears someone being \"really racist\", she also voices her concerns. I know these are basic arguments, but this is the first time ever I've heard them coming from someone I know, so I took them more seriously. Now I fear it will have consequences for our friendship.\n\n\nSo. I'm now thinking if I should even have said something or not. If I am that detached or they're ignorant. I think she (dunno about him) is on some \"intelectual level\", where she should have some knowledge of other countries issues, not just \"our lands\". Especially when you colloqially use words that have obviously racial connotations that have no basis in our history (as far as I know our country has never historically participated in slavery nor colonization).\n\n\nI guess if you say that I'm looking for a validation, I'd have to say you're not wrong. Also if you say that this is difficult situation to judge as you only one perspective, you're also right. If you would specify if you're answering as US or non-US, I think that would be very helpful to the conversation.",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my friend alone drunk in Berlin?",
      "description": "So a few days ago now me and my friend were in Berlin traveling for a small music festival that was held in central Berlin. We are both from English speaking countries, but I have some ability to speak German and he does not. We were both very excited for the festival and had been casually drinking in the hours leading up to it. However my friend is sometimes unable to sustain a \"good\" level of drunk before he starts to go a bit crazy. \n\nHe was starting to reach his peak level of drunk just before we left the bar of our hotel and took the trains to the venue. At a stopover however when I was buying a pretzel for myself he had walked away nowhere to be found. I assumed maybe he had been able to find the platform and go to the gig, and after a few missed calls directed at him I thought it would be best just to take the final train to the venue and see if I could catch up with him there. However as I arrived at the venue I received a video call from him which to my surprise was not him but a member of an ambulance team who had somehow picked up my friend while he was at the previous station. They wanted to drop him.off so that I could take him home so I told them the address of the venue and they came around and dropped him off about a block away. However in my friends drunken state he started to wander off in the wrong direction and dispute all my messages and calls he would only reply with \"ja\" and \"nein\" for some reason. Eventually I found him standing at a street corner with the help of some German locals after about 3 hours of trying to track him down. \n\nI was able to get over this once we both entered the venue and we're able to enjoy some of the music being played. However it wasn't long until a security guard noticed how drunk my friend was and attempted to kick him out. I talked to the guard for a while and eventually convinced him to stay as long as I was supervising him. So wherever he would go I would have to closely follow and make sure he wouldn't fall down any stairs or what not. After he used all of my cash to buy a bunch of strangers a round of drinks, wandered off multiple times, lost his credit card to an ATM when trying to get money out and generally being a bit of trouble I decided it was time to go home and retire the night at 5am. \n\nHe had wandered off so I just went straight to the train station and sent him a message informing him that the next train leaves in 15 minutes and if he wants to come home with me then he better hurry and get here now. He said he was coming but over the next 15 minutes never arrived and I decided to just take the train and leave him. I sent him the details on what trains to catch to get back to our hostel and told him whatever he does do not walk back. He very quickly ignored this and started walking aimlessly to try to find another ATM to get money out. \n\nThis is where I start to feel very guilty. Shortly after I took the train my friend was snugged and had a bunch of money taken from him and his night generally ruined. I feel like even though he was hard to deal with I should have stuck by him in this state and then he would've been safe and not had the traumatic experience of being mugged. So what do you think? Am I the asshole for abandoning my friend when he possibly needed me the most? ",

I am working on going back to school and finishing my degree and am in the process of trying to get a job to help with expenses. \n\nAnyway. My boyfriend is under immense pressure at work and is struggling a lot right now because he is such a wonderful person and he does so much at work. They are really sucking him dry and taking advantage of him and it's driving him absolutely mad. Because of this, he is leaning on me heavily for emotional support and that in itself can be very overwhelming because he also has some issues that he is working on. I do the best I can to be that rock for him right now because I love him to death. And again he is helping me out so so much and this is the absolute least I could do for him.\n\nThis is why I may be TA for this tiny problem that is starting to drive me nuts. Hes a VERY messy person. More so lately since he is having a hard time and his motivation to do redundant tasks is annoying for him. I have taken the opportunity to try and help out with keeping up with the home since I'm home all day. I really dont mind because I am just naturally a clean person and I have accepted that I just tend to be a little more anal about cleanliness and wont take it out on him. Ya know we're still 2 different people and compromise is chill.\n\nI try asking him sometimes to do some of the easier tasks just to help a little but I've been doing that less and less out of guilt. Usually he doesnt end up doing it so I just do it anyway. I know he feels guilty so I try not to make him feel worse.\n\nI guess it's just become a bit much because it has gotten to the point to where he is leaving trash everywhere and dirty clothes. He used to not be this bad so again Ive been chalking it up to stress and not thinking about it as much. Sometimes it hurts my feelings because I feel like he's taken advantage of that I'm so willing to clean and doesnt think twice about it. Then I feel shitty because he is doing so much for me and I feel maybe me getting upset about this is dumb and I need to chill.\n\nI spend a lot of time helping him cope with this job and cleaning after himself and I is starting to wear on me. I'm slightly worried about getting a job because I dont think things will change if I do and it will be too much. He's been fine with me not working right now. (I bring it up a lot to make sure he is still fine with it)\n\nAlright y'all so AITA and should just chill or should I bring this up? And how do I do it without putting even MORE stress on him?\n",

      "description": "My late father's side of the family is having a family reunion tomorrow and I don't want to go. My mother says this is disrespectful to them. She says that since he is dead, it is my duty to keep in touch with his family and I am part of their memory of him.\n\nBut this story is more complicated. My father was a drunk. He was a violent drunk but the violence towards me wasn't that bad. My mother got the worst of it, but sometimes he would beat me when he was drunk too. One time it was different though. He abused me in a different way when I was 8 years old and I never told anyone. I was always scared to tell, and now that he is dead I feel like it will only harm my mother if I tell her. But I feel like I shouldn't have to confront his family. I want to disconnect myself from that memory as much as possible.\n\nMy mom thinks that I am mad because he used to beat me, but she says that wasn't him, it was his disease (alcoholism). Maybe if she knew what he really did to me then she would understand, but I feel like that would only tarnish his memory at this point and wouldn't do anyone any good.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to go to this reunion? Do I owe her an explanation? I feel like I am doing her a favor by not giving her the explanation, but it is making me look bad. I am fine with looking like an asshole, as long as my actions are morally justifiable and I am not a true asshole.",

      "description": "At my school, it's a tradition for seniors to take a beach trip right before graduation. My group of friends all seemed pretty excited about it, and we had been talking about it for a while, but nobody had made concrete plans. However, a number of us have been explicit in our intent to go on a trip.\n\nIn my group of 8 friends, there are 3 people, \"Clara, Jane, and Emily\", who will often exclude people from things that could easily be group activities. For example, if a group of 5 of us always watch a TV show together, Jane will only text 4 of us, excluding the same girl every time and forcing us to text her individually. This sort of thing happens a lot, especially when Clara and Jane are involved.\n\nFour days ago, I texted the whole group to get started on making plans for the beach trip. Suspiciously, everyone replied to my message except Clara, Jane, and Emily. Finally, Clara texted me today to say that a few weeks ago, her dad had paid for a hotel room that would only fit 3, and those 3 people would, of course, be Clara, Jane, and Emily. \n\nI understand that obviously, our group of friends would be too big to all fit in that room. But I don't see why the three girls couldn't have *at least* included us in the planning process instead of waiting weeks to let us know what was going on. \n\nWIBTA for reducing my contact with those three girls, even though we share a lot of mutual friends and are graduating in 2 months, anyway?",

      "title": "AITA for accusing my parents of being abusive and breaking several of their rules?",
      "description": "A bit of context: I am a teenager, and my parents have separated a few years ago.\n\nThis all started during Sunday, where I was using my phone in the bathroom and my parent shouted at me to stop. I didn’t comply and when I replied with a shout, he told me to not shout, that people were sleeping (napping). I told him to not shout and he ended up smacking me in the face. Now, my father is kinda aggressive and a control freak, so not obeying his commands means getting shouted at and maybe even hit. However, this time he drew blood, and before I could take a photo he cleaned it up and my brother grabbed me to stop me.\n\nDuring a long drive home since we were out for the weekend, I talked in a venting chat in a discord server I’ve been for around 10 months, and people were encouraging me to call the police, as it wasn’t the first time it had happened. However, I decided to speak with my mother about it.\n\nShe said that she doesn’t condone any of it and that she would speak with him, but I feel like she also shifted some of the blame on me even if she says she didn’t, saying stuff like “If only you had left your phone, this wouldn’t have happened, but it’s hard to do when addicted, huh?”. Eventually, she found out about the venting chat, and shit hit the fan.\n\nShe demanded me to delete the messages, and that I broke the first rule of the internet, that is telling personal information to people you don’t know in real life (which, ironically, I’m doing right now). She was really mad, and I started to freak out, so I locked myself in the bathroom. Little did I know, she got her hand on one of my devices and was reading the whole conversation. I claimed that I felt unsafe (which my mother claims I had no reason to), and the people said that I should call the police ASAP. I also talked to my therapist, who said that I should just step outside. All of this happened while I heard her trying to dismantle the lock and my brother crying and pleading me to not call the police.\n\nEventually, I ended up saying that I was calling the police and, as I was dialing, I heard a clash. My mother had broken the glass door and opened the lock from the inside. I started yelling my address before my mother snatched away my phone and spoke to them, eventually dissuading them from coming. After it, all of my devices got taken away, but I started to write on pieces of paper to send them via a colleague’s device at school.\n\nIn those I explained what happened, and... I have to admit, I probably gave an impression worse than what it really is. During the following days I spoke to some people, and most of them said that I overreacted, but otherwise understood the stress and tension of the situation. I’ll give a brief summary of what they said:\n\nMy therapist said that police wouldn’t change anything, that people like my father will be everywhere and that you have to know how to act with them. When I asked if I should just mask my feelings, he said that sadly that seemed like my only option.\n\nSome teachers that I spoke to said that the situation wasn’t healthy for me, but that I could have handled it better.\n\nMy school’s counselor said that the chat was making me do stuff that I wouldn’t do alone, that it was reinforcing obsessive tendencies, and that I shouldn’t have called the police as my mother has always been there to help me.\n\nNow, my parents do love me, but they are far from perfect. My father is impulsive and short tempered, and he hates it when I don’t obey his commands at the moment, as he has the image that I am inferior (which I am) and that he has the right to boss me around (he does). My mother, while much calmer, does guilt trip (or at least it appears like she does. She says that she never does) me sometimes.\n\nYesterday, my mother found out about the letters and started crying. The guilt I had accumulated during the few days this lasted was unbearable, and I ended up writing another letter where I basically called me the asshole, but people called it out as feeling like my mother forced me to write it.\n\nIn reality, I didn’t really believe what I was writing. I was just letting the guilt out, but my mother, seeing as people were calling that out and telling me to get help, was fuming, and now my parents have decided that I shouldn’t contact those people.\n\nNow my discord account is being held under hostage, as if they see me post another message there, they will delete it. I am considering calling social services, but this feels like I’m the cause of the issue. My brother never had an issue like this, and I can’t avoid but feel... am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Throwaway for reasons.\n\nSome background: I suffer from bad memory, sometimes I don't even remember what I had for breakfast the day before or the likes, and I've already talked about this with her. We've been dating for half a year and we'd never had a strong discussion before.\n\nSo, my girlfriend (24F) and I (25M) had a discussion yesterday because she was being super distant, sharing heartbroken IG images and not talking at all and stuff. I found it weird because she'd never acted like this before. Long story short we talked after work and she broke down crying saying I'd hurt her feelings and stuff because I never pay attention to her and the things she tells me and stuff.\n\nApparently, her exboyfriend sent her a message saying he was involved in an accident and had some loss of memory. She asked him what he remembered and he told them lots of stuff about her and their previous relationship (they were together for 2 years and broke up like half a year before starting to go out with me). This is important because apparently I don't remember most of the stuff her ex does (like favorite movie, stuff about her studies, stuff like that which I think is not really that important), and she said it's really hurtful that her ex remembers all of that and I don't.\n\nI've told her that it's not that I don't pay her attention, but my memory has always been bad and that doesn't mean I don't care about her, I just sometimes forget some things which I don't find really important, hell, I sometimes forget my SSN and stuff like that.\n\nPoint being, Am I Really the Asshole for having a bad memory and not remembering some small stuffs regarding her? Any advice you might have regarding this situation?",

Like we’re all good happy blah blah blah but when it comes to matters of my ex husband he gets... touchy to say the least. \n\nWell this morning I said fuck it my ex cut my sons hair without telling me and I wanted to see my baby. (I cried when he showed me) My ex and I just both happened to have off today this was in no way pre planned but I called him and said hey wanna do coffee I wanna see my son. I’m literally getting my tiny human tomorrow for the week but I missed some time with him due to a hospitalization from a kidney infection. Plus I wanted to give him some money for the daycare since he will be dropping him off in the morning. So we meet at Dunkin Donuts cuz I’m fat, pregnant, tired and at least need decaf coffee. \n\nSo I get home drag an entire wooden changing table up my stairs and put it together by myself. And I text my bf and say hey you owe me gas cuz he owes me gas he took my car and it cost me 40 to fill it up which was his job this pay while I covered the car insurance. He asks me why I said I met up with my ex. I didn’t hide it or lie. &amp; he gets mad that I don’t text back fast enough (I’m literally assembling the world most annoying changing table &amp; it was supposed to be a surprise so he has no clue) He then states that he has some questions but he doesn’t want to start an argument. &amp; I basically went off considering that last time I saw my ex he accused me of cheating on him with him in not so many words. I didn’t say anything disrespectful but I was super defensive because it’s not cool imo. He then states that it always seems to be when he’s not around that we hang out. Well he works ten hour shifts and gets off at 4:30PM with 3 days off in the middle of the week that me nor my ex would ever have off so yeah it would be that way. I then told him that it wasn’t about him and that until we’re married these relationships are truly separate and there is no reason to bring anyone else in and even then it would be for rly big things. \n\nI just want my son to understand that we both love him despite the end of our relationship. &amp; don’t want to feel persecuted for having literally a drink with my ex so that our son can see us exercise basic communication. Also I will admittedly say I will always love my ex because we spent 7 years together and he gave me one of my greatest gifts but I also feel the same about my bf and if we ever ended I would still care deeply for him and try to extend basic human decency and show our daughter that we don’t hate one another even if I felt bruised bitter or mad. Basically AITA for wanting my son to see me and his father in the same room cordially. Not to mention discuss schedule changes and give him money. ",

      "description": " Reposting on a throwaway account.\n\nI was building rapport with a new coworker and he told me that he and his significant other (who also works for my company) are moving in together. I told him that they should have a housewarming party. He thought that was a great idea, and mentioned that maybe I would be able to help with organizing it, which I said I wouldn't mind helping. This was two weeks ago, and I kind of forgot about it except when they bring it up in passing. There hasn't been any talk of dates or anything, just that it will be a small get-together of no more than eight people. Just today, his boyfriend came over and asked when the party was going to happen.\n\nSide note: I am 36 weeks pregnant and can barely waddle around work, let alone plan and throw a party.\n\nI was a little surprised, and asked them when they wanted it to happen, because I could potentially go into labor any day now. He threw a couple dates out there and went back to work.\n\nHonestly, I am exhausted and can barely make it through a work day, let alone planning a party. This really got away from me and I feel terrible. I plan on being honest with them and letting them know I can send an email or an evite on their behalf, but I am not up to planning a party.

      "description": "This happened on my cousin's 21st birthday a couple of weeks ago, she goes to college up in Maryland and my brother and about 45 mins away in Virginia. We wanted to go out and treat her to some drinks after we got some dinner. \n\nSo we went to a local bar restaurant to start the night and we wanted to grab some drinks, which is were the big problem started. My brother and I moved to VA about 7 years ago for college when we were 18 and got the state standard 'vertical' license for underage people which don't expire for another year, so I've never seen a reason to spend my whole day at the DMV. Additionally, before this night, we've NEVER had any issues due to the vertical license since anyone that takes a second to read can see that I'm actually well past legal drinking age. \n\nSo we tried to grab a couple drinks at the bar, as we have now in several different areas in several states with no issue, and the bartender starts acting strangely by getting defensive by asking all 3 of us about our addresses, birthdays, etc. likely thinking they were fake (even though VA licenses are incredibly hard to fake). When we asked if there was an issue, he says \"hold on\" and takes our licenses away and goes off to talk to the manager. This was not only sketchy but I felt extremely disrespected as their customer. \n\nAfterward the manager comes over and is acting very defensive and very in a very aggressive manner comes over and says \"yeah, we're not going to accept these IDs since they're vertical\" when I asked why he said \"because we can't confirm you're over 21\" (again he could take 2 seconds to do some mental math) . When I asked what  he meant by this since I've gone to MD bars before without issue he said \"look we're not taking these ID's and if you aren't going to order I have to ask you to leave\" \n\nWe obviously left since we were not going to sit there and be disrespected and have out legitimate IDs called fake by some dude too lazy to take 2 seconds to actually look at the dates. After we left, we were all understandably pissed off by this guy's attitude and we decided that since he was the manager, there was no one we could really complain to. I was pissed since he never gave us a chance to explain so I decided to get a bit of petty revenge and called the Alcohol Control Dept. and said that they were not ID'ing people and serving them, thinking at most they'd sweat him a bit with some questioning and maybe a surprise investigation. \n\nBut we found out last week through the grapevine, that the restaurant has actually gotten caught several other times serving minors and their alc license has been permanently pulled for them.  \n\nWITA in this scenario? The guy definitely needed a wake-up call for his shitty treatment and I feel I may have gone a bit far, but I don't really feel too bad since the manager clearly selectively applied the ID rule and clearly has no training in customer service.

      "description": "I am 21F and live in an African country with traditional African parents. I still live with them because I am in med school and it is cost effective. My sister is 17 and a bit of a golden child. She can do no wrong, and even if she does it's because I drove her to it. I was quite mean to her when we were younger because of that.\n\nAny who I am very obese. I started the year at 250lbs and am now 240 and working on losing more. Because of this I cannot buy many clothes in my size, so a lot of my clothes are sewn. I use these sewn clothes to go to lectures because my school demands that we dress formally. Most of my clothes are for that purpose, and\nI have a few nice outing clothes and a lot of very ratty lounging clothes. This is the reason why I'm trying to lose weight. I also have no ,money of my own, just an allowance my parents give me. I do have a secret side business of baking and selling cupcakes to my classmates, but that is less than once a month.\n\nAny who, my sister has he WASSCE coming up, and since my dad is a lecturer in the university I go to and where we all live, we spend nights studying I'm his private office. I pick my sister up from home and we take a taxi to the office. So today she was a bit late and I waited for her and chatted with my parents and their guests. She can put of the room wearing one of my club t shirts from when I was in high school. I told her, \"Oh no, that's my shirt please put it back.\" She shrugged and went to change no problem.\n\nMy parents weren't happy with me. They bombarded me, saying things like \"how can you be so mean to your sister?', 'if you keep up that behaviour you'll turn into a witch', 'I can't believe I raised a child like you' \n\nI told them that it was mine and I'm still using it (I left it at home sp I could have clothes to wear if I spent a weekend at home), and that I would give it to her if I no longer need it.\n\nMy dad said that it's not really mine because I paid for it with his money. He said that nothing I have is really mine, and because it's all his money he gets to decide what happens to it. He also yelled at my sis to keep it on. She seemed remorseful, sometimes she wears my clothes to annoy me (even the ones far too big for her. I'm an 18 and she's a tight 14) and she couldn't have anticipated this response so I don't blame her.\n\nMy mom said she's going to sit down through the clothes I have and give whatever she likes to my sister and there is nothing she can do about it, in those exact words.\n\nThis isn't an isolated incident, I have less than half the clothes she does and I currently don't have enough clothes for two weeks, I can't take another hit like that. This has happened with other things too when I was younger. If we both had the same amount of the same type of food and I refused to share, mine would be given to her to teach me to share. \n\nSorry if I'm rambling. So, AITA?",

      "description": "I’m currently a freshman living in the dorms with two other girls, F and R. Because I’m a bit of a hermit, I spend most of my time not in class in the room, playing video games on my TV. F barely spends any time in the room anymore because R asked that she stop having her boyfriend sleep over so often. R is rarely in, but only at weird times like 5am. \n\nAlso of note, I have less storage space than the other two. F has a lot of space under her bed. R had the whole area under her loft bed, easy access to the top of her dresser, and a more optimized dresser style. So while I’m pretty sure I have less items than the other two, I’ve got nowhere to put anything and the TV takes up a lot of desk space. \n\nAnd this brings us to the question: AITA for having a messy space? As in miscellaneous junk on my desk (body spray, notebook, Benadryl, salt shaker, chips bag), shoes out of the dresser, and a box full of more miscellaneous junk on the ground. Mind you, all of this stuff is within my “personal box” and does not in any way impede walking space. \n\nWhat prompted this question was that R has seemed really unhappy with my clutter, even moving stuff when I’m gone over the weekends. I‘ve had a trash bag tied up next to my desk for the past day or so because I’ve been busy with finals week.  I didn’t really think about it because it doesn’t smell at all and it’s still not taking up anyone else’s room. Even so, R wrote me a note asking for me to take out the trash and the room’s recycling (not full or even my job). I wrote back that I’d get to it because I will, I’m going home in two days and would clean + pack then. When she saw the note she angrily crumpled it and threw it in the trash without talking to me. \n\nAITA? It just doesn’t seem like something that should bother anyone but me",

      "description": "I'm 20 and I live with my parents, so I commute to college. It takes up to 4 hours everyday and it's so exhausting. But now.. A little backstory..\n\nMy parents have abused me, both physically and emotionally, up to this day. The physical abuse stopped around 2 years ago, but the emotional abuse is ongoing. I've ran away from home and moved out before, but my family were successful at manipulating me into thinking that they love me and that I'll be having a good life with them and thus made me move back home (very bad decision). Due to the ongoing abuse I got diagnosed with ptsd and have other mental issues. Even my counsellor advises me to move out and start fresh, but my family thinks it's a bad idea and get very angry at me for wanting to grow as a person. I  tell them that I wanna be happy but they're saying that I'm just ruining things for them and that I should stop being selfish.\n\nNow the issue here is: I told my parents about moving out and they got mad at me for being selfish and wanting something like that when they do so much for me. And that everyone gets tired and I'm not special and sometimes humans just have to accept their fate. \n\nThey say that I'm egotistical and horrible for wanting to move out since one of my 4 siblings has an illness and might get surgery for his knee and they need to focus on him and that I should help them and not take much space. \n\nMoving out will be the start of my recovery and I really need this.. At 20, I'm still suffering for things that my parents put me through.\n\nSo.. AITA for wanting happiness for myself at the cost of not helping them out? ",

      "description": "Long story short, my son was living with his dad full time because his dad was a stay at home parent so I paid child support, insurance, and anything else my son wanted/needed outside of child support. A few months ago my sons dad pretty much abandoned my son at school (meaning he never went to pick him up and left out of state). I found out because I was at work and his dads girlfriend called me and said he just left. \n\nAnyway, my son lives with me now and I do not want him ever going back with his dad. I've been asking my son if he talks to his dad and such and he says no. I found out today that they have been texting back and forth since his dad left. I am frustrated because my son had to adapt to a new school and I also found out his dad went back to live at the house he left. I want to block his dads number and I asked a few family members and they said I should, which I just did. Now I feel bad because they literally text everyday. \n\nAITA? Should I unblock his dads number from my sons phone? ",

      "description": "Since January, I’ve been living with my grandparents and my aunt. I as with my dad for a couple months, but it ended in a choking incident and CPS so I opted to leave. Before that I lived with my mom and stepdad. My mom was emotionally and physically abusive as well even if we had some good moments. \n\nMy grandma is not abusive. She is, however, very controlling and neurotic. \n\nAt my grandmothers she is very easily freaked out, she bangs on my door if my shower is longer than 15 minutes, she goes on long rants about how I sometimes leave a cup on the table (for which I almost always apologize and clean it.) she’s very nagging. \n\nLast week I was studying for my SAT and she burst open my door screaming about how my room wasn’t clean. I tried to explain I’d get to it after studying and she just kept screaming. I know this isn’t a me specific problem because she’s just like this in general. \n\nThere are times where she does rightfully get annoyed at me. I can be forgetful and leave dishes on the table, and she says she wants me to help out more although she seldom specifies what she means by that. I do usually do things when she asks though. \n\nSometimes I try and speak up for myself and say something but my aunt just jumps in and says how my parents never taught me respect or something. I’ve never raised my voice or cursed at my grandma. Yesterday I went to turn on the sink for me to wash dishes and she immediately went off on how I’m wasting water by turning the water on first. I gently said it was on for 3 seconds and she went on a rant. \n\nI told her that I’m 17, and that I can do a lot of things for myself now and she told my aunt who went off on how I lack respect or how I always have to argue back. It got to the point where I just gave up and left the house. I returned maybe an hour later to cops being there due to her thinking I ran away. \n\nAm I the asshole for trying to get my grandma off my back a little? ",

      "description": "Long story short since I'm on mobile, my girlfriend and I have live together and have been together for about 6 months - about 3 months ago she started spending a hell of a lot of time with one of our mutual friends, who happened to be a close friend of mine I've known even before I met her. Being the laid-back and chilled out guy I am I just let it happen and didn't worry about much, until I noticed little 'signs' here and there; mainly her mostly ignoring me and spending almost all her free time at work around him (we work together as well) and hardly ever being at home so she could go out and get high with him and crash the night on his sofa, or so she said, and this went on for at least 2 months. I won't go into the details about what happened then but eventually my suspicions and anxiety got the better of me and I managed to find the chance to go through her phone without her knowing, and found out they had been sexting and having an affair behind my back the entire time, while lying to my face about it and denying it every time I brought it up. She had sent him countless nude photos of herself while constantly bitching about me and how she wanted to break up with me to get with him instead.\n\nIt's been a month since that incident and we're working things out now, I've decided to try and move past it since I believe everyone deserves a second chance but I don't know, I guess I need a second opinion from you guys.",

      "description": "So me and my SO have been together for just over a year, but we have known eachother for several years. 2 weeks ago, we were talking about our hobbies and what we could do, everyday and not get bored. I said video games, comics and conspiracy theories have always been my go to, and also making music. She said she's not been able to enjoy anything for a bit, because of the past relationships, work, uni, etc. This has made her pretty much bored of many things, but there was a time when she loved going to the gym.\n\nAfter 40 minutes of me, giving an inspirational speech on how she needs to get back to her hobbies, or she's going to be miserable, she actually agrees with me and says she'll start to focus on herself more.To my surprise, the following morning she signed up. \n\nWe agreed we'll go together, that way we'll both make sure we're there to push eachother. The first session was the last one. She kept saying that her legs hurt, because she didn't stretch. So she skipped the next one. Then another. Same reason. Eventually, she started saying her boss needs her at work to sort something out. I wanted to say something, but I bit my tongue, in hopes she'll start going with me again.\n\nToday, I've asked if she's going to join, but she said she wont be able to go, because its already noon and she needs to make sure the inventory is done at work, ( she's off for the next two days) to which I suggested that we could go later in the afternoon, around 3 or 4pm. She suddenly tells me that she doesn't know how long it'll be, and that I should stop being so pushy. I remind her that she's been making excuses for the past 2 weeks, ( we're both blunt, so that there is no misunderstanding ) and she goes off that I only want her to go because I don't like the way she looks, that way I'm shaping her into what I want. I decide to go on my own, and told her that I only mentioned it, because she was really up for going to the gym with me at first. Now she's telling me I never liked her and keeps telling me I want to leave her.\n\nNow, just to clarify, I don't have a six pack, or a body of an athlete, I'm 6'1 and 15st, so I want to drop a few pounds, I like my SO the way she is, I just wanted to help.\n\nSo AITA for being honest? \n\nEDIT: Missed a few words.",

We’re five people from the back of the plane near the toilet and this middle-aged guy near the front thinks now’s a good time to use it, he’s obviously having to pass everyone already standing up to get there.

I then hear the “toilet man” making his way back up asking people to move as his stuff is “up the front” and he still had to get it out.  He gets to me and asks me to move so I say no. He repeats that his stuff is up front and I reply “we’re all heading there too, man, so surely you can wait as well?” I’m not kidding, his response was “yeah but that will take ages” so I turned my back on him and put my arms on the chair shoulders so he couldn’t get past me.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n",

      "description": "Key is that my daughter (8) threw up a bit around 11 pm last night and this morning said she was nauseous and her tummy hurt.  So she stayed home. \n\nNow my wife says my daughter said she’s better and is playing with her toys but wants to stay home and not go to my parents house. \n\nThese classes are a bit expensive and we were planning to go 4-5 times a week but so far for last two months we could only go about twice a week because of something always coming up.  Work, friends, School etc. \n\nIf we don’t go today we will only be able to go Friday this week. \n\nSo I told my wife that if she’s (daughter) not sick anymore we can take her to my parents and  my mom (she’s a cardiologist) can stay with her for a few hours. She can watch tv there and has some toys too. \n\nMy wife says she (daughter) doesn’t want to go and that she was sick yesterday and I need to be more understanding. \n\nSo it seems like we are missing today’s class because she doesn’t want to go to my parents house. \n\nI don’t deny that she was sick yesterday. But I’ve caught my daughter claiming to be sick before to avoid doing some things and going to school and then miraculously was fine later to do fun things.  So I was always of the mentality: no fever - no stay home. (Do a degree obviously) \n\nWhen I was a kid my mom didn’t ask me if I “wanted” to go somewhere when she had to go she just told me and we went. \n\nSo this I’m visibly irritated and now my wife is pissed that I’m irritated by this...",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nBckg to this (TL;DR at the bottom): I'm Brazilian, my parents are divorced since I was five. My mom got full custody of me cause dad had a fase in which he was extra irresponsible, and when I was little, I used to visit him regularly, but as HS and College started to become more exigent and I wanted to keep good grades, my visits became way less frequent. til I badly see here once a month.\n\nAs a result, I'm not very close to him and his side of the family, and I think it's reciprocal. I'm left leaning and have a VISCERAL hatred for any kind of injustice or inhumane treatment - our country had an awful time with years of horrible right-wing dictatorship.\n\nNow u may be asking: k, this sucks, but what does this have to do with the family group?\n\nWell, my father's family happens to be right-wing. Whenever the topic of politics come up, heated discussions r bound to happen. When dad created the group, he asked everyone to avoid the politics topic, but it didn't take long before the right-wing, anti-left and sometimes plain dictatorship apologist stuff started pouring here and there. I tried to ignored, but eventually started posting some facts to counter. \n\nHe messaged me privately to ask that I stop talking bout politics to avoid fights, I replied that I'd stop as long as everyone else did the same. He argued that their posts weren't only political, but also humorous. I started posting leftist memes and comedy videos and it didn't take long before my aunt complained. Discussion ensued, and I got positively surprised when Dad took my side, but the joy was short lived.\n\nHe asked me to stop posting any politics related content in the group, and I argued that I was posting jokes like everyone else, but he said ppl were uncomfortable and that I should either ignore the bs or leave. \n\nI left. Then he told me that I didn’t have to leave the group, only stop talking bout politics, and that I should just stay and ignore stuff I don’t like, that this only proves that unlike the ppl I accuse of being intolerant I can’t live with adversity and yadda yadda. \n\nI replied firmly that the rules should apply to everyone equally, and that he either put the foot down and tell them to stop posting things attacking the left and its politicians, either tell them to accept when I counter with my posts. \n\nThen today he told me that ppl want me back in the group.\n\nWIBTA if I refuse? \n\nTL,DR: My dad created a family group on what'sapp. His side of the family is right-wing leaning and I'm leftist, so he asked people to avoid the topic of politics. They ignored his request and made posts attacking the left, then complained when I started countering their posts. When I argued that the rules should be the same and apply equally to everyone, my father asked me to either ignore their posts or leave. I left. Now they want me back in the group. WIBTA for saying \"hell no\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So let me give some background, my friend of 10 years who lived in another state is going to be kicked out of the house he lives in, I invited him and his wife to come live with me as a roommate and I would get him a job.\n\nSkip 2 months and we are now renting a house together, at first everything was great but then I got back together with my ex. Things started to go downhill from here. Me and my girlfriend are night owls, my friend and his wife have semi regular sleep schedules.\n\nMy friend says he doesn't like conflict which made this situation much worse then it had to be in my mind. Basically to him me and my girlfriend would keep him up all the time for over 3 months, his idea of telling me we're literally ruining their sleep is telling me once every week or so that we are being a little loud can we tone it down (which whenever he would tell us we would).\n\nThe whole situation didn't truly become apparent to me until the last month where he asked me if we could talk, and he lays it on me that every time my girlfriend is over it is keeping him and his wife up and that he thinks that my girlfriend is literally doing all these things on purpose, these things range from laughing in my room with me or closing the bathroom door too loudly.\n\nSo with me finally realizing how much this is bothering them I tell him I'll try and fix it. I go and buy some sound dampening foam to put on my door and tell my girlfriend to try and be quieter when going into the bathroom, after I get it all installed the morning after my girlfriend slept over I ask him whether or not the foam is helping, he tells me yes. Week later I ask the same thing, again he says yes. (Figure I should probably include this, my girlfriend would be at our place less than 48 hours).\n\nAt this point I'm like awesome things are fixed 2 weeks later he wants another chat. He just unloads a ton of complaints at my feet. I kid you not he wrote a list.\n\n1. Him and his wife are still being woken up. (He lied about the foam working because he didn't want to deal with conflict)\n\n2. My girlfriend has purposely been putting her shoes on top of his shoes to annoy him. Not to mention he says she stabbed his new pair of work shoes which he needs as a CNA (My girlfriend doesn't even bitch about when her co-workers and manager leave their duties unfinished so she has to do them) \n\n3. He utterly hates my girlfriend because he thinks she's purposely doing this stuff and she's extremely rude because when he says hi towards me he thinks my girlfriend should take that as him saying hi to her as well and she should respond back.\n\n4. He also believes I am helping her \"torture\" them (his words) because when I was away visiting my mom with a different time zone I forgot what time it was at the house and woke them up with a Merry Christmas text.\n\nAt this point he tells me I should no longer bring my girlfriend over not even during the day because we disturb his rest/study time. In my mind I'm trying to think of what to do because telling me to ban my girlfriend from my place won't work because she still lives with her parents and her father won't let me sleep over. I finally get to the point where I say ok well at least let me try buying a heavier door or something to help with the sound, he refuses and says he doesn't want her over here anymore period.\n\nAt this point only thing I can see working is one of us moves out, I get in contact with a friend who is friends with both of us and he asks if I want him to try to mediate the issue, I tell him sure.\n\nAnyway to cut this short because it's just going over everything already in the story mediator friend recommends I get a new door and frame, put a white noise generator like a fountain and put it in my hallway I agree to it and my roommate refuses the attempt at a solution and says the easiest solution is my girlfriend no longer comes over and that's what we should do.\n\nTLDR: Friend thinks girlfriend and me are purposely keeping me and his wife up and refuses to try any solution except for banning my girlfriend from the house.\n\nI know it was a long read but thanks for the feedback regardless.",

      "title": "WIBTA if I kept some of my roommates money when she moves?",
      "description": "I live with three other roommates. One of them hasn't lived here as long as the other two, and is moving out in next week. (She wants to live closer to her school, which is fair) Also sorry for my bad English in advance.\n\nWhen she moved in she paid a security deposit, which I think is fairly normal, and of course she's going to get some of it back when she moves. She has broken some things while living here, and she's put of shelves with us etc. and of course we're taking some money for those things, so we're not footing all of the bill alone. (The rest of us are moving out soon as well, so we're not getting a new roommate.)\n\nSo here's the question: Would I be an asshole for taking some money from the security deposit for some of the alcohol and food she's used while living here as well?\n\nWe have a small bar in the kitchen, which was here before she moved in, with quite a lot of alcohol. The rule has always been to buy a new bottle when you empty one, and also to maybe add a few if you decide to throw a part in the house. She was made aware of this rule when she moved in, and she also said it was fair. A few months later one of my other roommates looked through the bar, because she's cleaning it, and sees that most of the bottles are empty (we're talking 1-2 shots left in some of the bottles, and most the them were more than half full last time any of us checked) And we're 100% certain it was her who used them, because the few that were missing were in her room (empty) So we confronted her about it (and she lied and said she hadn't drunk any alcohol) and in the end she ended up replacing one of them, because it wasn't ours but a friend's, the rest of them are still in the bar, and she hasn't replaced any.\n\nAs for the food: We have been very chill about sharing (which apparently has been a mistake) and almost the same rule with ''empty something - buy a new one'' with the added ''use common sense when looking in the fridge''. Now... we usually just buy what we need for ourselves, and if it's something we share (bread, cheese, butter, milk, pasta etc.) we replace it if it's empty, or buy some for ourselves if we need a lot of if. Sometimes I have woken up to an almost empty fridge with no milk for my cereal etc. etc. And when Christmas hit it got really bad. I was only eating celery for some reason, with honey and soy sauce, and two of my roommates were away, so I was home alone with her, and the kitchen slowly became more and more empty as the days passed by - which is fine of course, but when January hit none of it had been replaced. I also spent 54 EUR on milk in January because I could buy 3L and half of that would be gone the next morning. My other roommates have started buying rice milk and almond milk instead because of this. We have tried talking to her, but she straight up lies or won't admit it's her.\n\nSo would I be an asshole if I compensated some of the stuff she should have bought herself with the security deposit?",

      "description": "Doing this from Mobile, sorry in advance for horrible grammar or layout.\n\nSome background, my best friend (we'll call him Jack) and I have known each other going on 9 years now. We always hung out in high school and got into all sorts of shenanigans and even to this day we always keep in contact with each other and one of us will travel for the holidays to meet up again and hang out. \n\nNow then, a year ago, Jack meets this girl through a mutual friend who decides to hook them up. At first meet, she was a pretty chill and relaxed person despite some heavy family problems happening at that time. Eventually she decided to leave her parents home and move in with Jack and his parents to escape the problems. Fast forward a few months and they get married. I travelled down to where they were to be the best man and everything was pretty good and no problems arose. Over time though I noticed we would talk less and less and he barely ever wanted to do things like play games online or etc. I understood, he finally is starting a new life and works all the time. For the holidays, my wife and myself decided to go visit everyone. This is when I started to notice problems around their house. Due to college for her and work for him, they still live with his parents. His parents are basically like a second family to me and ha e always treated me like their other son, so I end up sitting with his Dad late one night on their porch over a drink and he begins to tell me how horrible Jack's wife is. Things like she always has to be almost connected at the hip with him no matter what, she always complains about everything that his parents say to her, she spends all of her time on her phone trash talking about all her \"friends,\" she leaves trash everywhere and is all around disgusting, and his parents always have to clean up. The whole time though Jack just defends her and \"calls his parents out on their bullshit.\" I was dumbfounded because this didnt sound like Jack at all. Until I saw an example with my own eyes.\n\nHis wife, (Janet), decided on a whim to bring home a stray cat and told his parents that she was keeping it in the house. They protested as much as they could before she completely lost her shit and shut herself in their room with Jack in tow. What she didnt realize was how thin the walls were as we could hear her complaining about how they treat her like shit and she never has any privacy and is bawling her eyes out. Immediately, Jack comes out and says they're leaving and shuts the door again. In about 10 minutes, they've packed up all their belongings and are leaving but not before Jack calls both his parents cunts and blaming them for making her feel like shit. After another awkward couple of days spending time with his parents we left and made it back home where I decided to try and get ahold of Jack to see how he was holding up. To my surprise he didnt give a shit about his parents and what he said to them and is glad that nobody talks to his wife like that anymore. I told him straight up that that is kind of messed up and that they only wanted her to act like a decent human being i.e. clean up after herself like an adult, stop hanging out with high schoolers, partying and stop raising hell when she doesnt get her way. He immediately accused me of being a dick and said that he thought my wife was a bitch. It took everything in my power to not completely lose it but all I could get out was that his wife was causing him to be an asshole and ruining his life by making him into someone he isn't. Needless to say he was furious and now wont talk to me or his family anymore. AITA for saying what I thought was the truth?\n\ntl;dr  Best friend's wife is nasty, mean and a spoiled brat and has caused him to become a different person to the point of not talking to me or his own family and I called him out on it.",

      "description": "The biggest telecom company in my area contracts out repair work to small firms whose workers identify themselves as working on behalf of the main company. It had snowed 12 inches over a couple of weeks and a neighbour had problems with their phone line so one of these workers came to fix it. The nearest box where the cables are linked underground is on my lawn. I knew exactly where it was located even though it was under about a feet of snow + ice.\n\nThe repairman rang my doorbell holding a shovel and just immediately started talking about asking me where to dig to find this box. I knew what he was talking about but played dumb because I was tired of how unprofessional and lazy these workers have been in our neighborhood. Simply identifying himself as an employee of X company here to do X job and say why he was seeking my assistance to do his job would have been suffice. I didn't want to do his job for him so I lied and said I didn't know what he was looking for. \n\nHe then ended up spending an hour in the cold looking + digging different piles of snow/ice before finally finding the box. The whole time he was digging he was lifting a snowball's size worth of snow each time he shovelled and was working really lazily as if he didn't want to be there. When he found the box, it was sealed shut due to ice and he had to go back to the house he was working at to borrow hot water to melt it. After he left I saw he had dug up some of the grass in my lawn too.\n\nAITA for not just telling him where it was in the first place?",

Bottom line, she needed to use the handicapped stall. Fair enough - - bathroom is 4 stalls, I never used it.\n\nExcept that one day. I was alone in the bathroom, in my regular stall, and discovered I had a little monthly visitor and no mitigation apparatus. So, I fished through my purse for quarters, put some toilet paper in place, and quickly sprinted over to the Cotton Apparatus Dispenser and dialed up a solution.\n\nSeeing as how I was only half zipped and in distress, I ducked into the handicapped stall to insert said apparatus. You guessed in - - in the literally 30 seconds I was in there, she showed up and started yelling at me that I was thoughtless and entitled. There was no room to interject \"30 seconds\" or \"emergency\" or \"you weren't even here.\"\n\nAm I the asshole? Is it never allowable to use that stall if you are not disabled? ",

I usually play minecraft with a hacked client for some features vanilla doesnt have.

I was threatened a ban if I hacked again, and I explained I only used the hack to game end myself, and everything else was vanilla. Heres where the double standard is.\n\nThe owner abuses admin, and spawns in command blocks, dupes all the time, and is always cheating things in. I dont like his actions, so, I grief his base. I lavacasted the whole thing. Next day I'm banned from the realm. I deserved it and expected it.\n\n\nHeres where it gets down.\n\n\nNext day I get on discord, several members that were in the realm start attacking me over chat, telling me im worthless and should leave the server, and what I did was wrong even though the owner was cheating I shouldnt have griefed his base because he was the owner. They also told me Im a bad person for using cheats (I had them, never used them, idk their point) and how the realm isnt mine and how I should always respect the owner even if he is cheating.\n\n\nIm not sure if I was right to grief his base for having a double standard of him cheating, but then threatening to ban me for cheating.

      "description": "So I’m in a quartet of high schoolers that formed spring of last year. I was actually invited to join them, as a former member had just quit and they needed another for some competitions they were planning.  I was never supposed to be a permanent member, but because we won all the competitions,  parents decided to keep it going into the following fall semester. The four of us were all going to be seniors, so I was a little hesitant to continue, knowing that college apps, and classes were going to take up a lot of time. \n\nFast forward to now, I’m very heavily considering just quitting the group altogether because of the flakiness in some members.\nFor example:\n\nThe entire quartet would agree on coming in an hour early to work on our pieces. However, half of the quartet didn’t show up, and I was left wasting an hour of my time.\n\nThe same half would also often come to rehearsal late (~15 mins)\n\nThe same half would come to a performance with only ten minutes to warm up, when we all agreed to have an hour.\n\nRehearsals not led by a coach would be unproductive.\n\nI have tried talking not only with the members, but to the parents themselves, but have seen no improvement of being on time.\n\nI can’t be mad at any of the members, because it would ruin the entire rehearsal (quartets are all about communication)\n\n\nIve talked about quitting numerous times with my mom, citing the blatant disrespect, and the amount of time wasted on my weekends (~3 hours), but she thinks it would be an asshole move, considering I already agreed to commit last fall, and we have performances planned. As much as I understand my mom, I can’t help but still feel justified, considering I didn’t know about the flakiness last fall.\n\nI definitely will consider just gritting my teeth through the rest f the semester, but WIBTA if I decided to quit?\n",

I keep the whole house clean apart from their bedroom. And i really have no issue doing so because we live here.

      "description": "My girlfriend and I haven’t been together very long. We’ve probably been pursuing our relationship for about 3 months now. \n\nRecently, I lost my job, (I was never necessarily financially supporting my gf anyways) &amp; she works at the job that I once did. They are cutting back on hours and due to my girlfriend’s expenses (Rent, Childcare for her daughter, other bills) my girlfriend has been completely and understandably flustered about what she is going to do as far as money, and the possibility of losing her place if she is unable to pay rent at any time in the near future. She has been stressing over finances for quite some time now, and if I could help, I certainly would but now considering I’m jobless, that’s not an option.\n\nThis morning we discussed the idea of her getting a roommate to help out with rent (one of the people she considered is an ex). This sparked a minor altercation between us, but she insists she only considered it because she knows her ex would certainly give her the money that’s needed &amp; help with her daughter when needed. \n\nAbout 30 mins ago she called and asked what I thought of the idea of her having sex with men for money. To say I was upset was an understatement. I explained to her that if she wanted to do that or felt that she needed to, she could, but we would have to break up because I’m not okay with that. She expressed that she expected me to be more supportive, but also in the same breath apparently changed her mind and said that it isn’t worth it if she loses me. \n\nWe’re going to talk more about the topic on her lunch break shortly, but right now I feel as though I’m in a frenzied state of mind. I would hate to do it, but I’m considering just calling it quits because of this conversation. I understand the financial situation that she is in, but there are so many other ways to get money and the fact that she felt like it was even okay to ask me if that would be okay is bothering me, deeply. \n\nAlso, considering I’m currently jobless, I feel almost worthless so I feel almost just like a hindrance to her anyways. I feel as though if she feels she needs the money that bad that she has to have sex with random men for it, then she should do what she feels she has to but I absolutely refuse to deal with that, personally. \n\nAm I the asshole for considering a break up for this reason?

I, on the other hand, was raised to believe it is God's job to judge, not mine, and to love and treat all people equally. Even the days I hate people, I hate them all equally.\n\nI really love my family, don't get me wrong, but they basically worship D. Trump. I could stop there and many would understand, but it is so much more than that. They preach the bible, peace, love, etc. but they hate so many. \n\nMy grandfather specifically, usually a relatively open, cool-headed man, WENT OFF today on how the democrats are the problem with the government, and the republican party is totally innocent. He insinuated its okay Trump is still president after the shit he has said and done because Melania is \"keeping him in check.\"\n\nI'm sure my position on politics is obvious having given this description, but I can always have a civilized, meaningful conversation with a level-headed person of the opposite political party, he was just irate and being irrational. \n\nThe worst part was when he was describing how Obama was the worst president in the history of the world, Fox news is the least bias news station and tells nothing but the truth, some liberal \"black congressman is the devil\" (his words) and the democrats are responsible for ALL of the violence. \n\nAt this point I'm infuriated but I'm keeping my cool. So I mention racism and prejudice in our country and he LOSES IT.\n\nI TRIED to ask about his thoughts on the COUNTLESS unprovoked shootings and killing of African Americans. Before I could explain I was referring to law enforcement specifically in this situation, he interrupted with \"Trump IS NOT PREJUDICE, TRUMP HAS DONE MORE FOR BLACK PEOPLE THAN OBAMA EVER DID.\" He gets louder and his face turns red. \n\nTo be clear, I never said Trump was racist or prejudice. I just wanted to ask what he thought about the violence committed by government officials.\n\nThen he brings up Hillary. Oh fuck, here we go again. \n\nTo calm the situation down I tried to move on by telling him he was raising his blood pressure (serious medical issue for him) and that I'm just trying to see it from both sides. He made some snippy comment about how I TRY (insinuating I'm not very good at it). \n\nBefore he left, he looked me right in the eyes and told me very sternly to keep my eyes open. This is the man also preaching the apocalypse is near. Like very near. (May or may not be relevant).\n\nTo be honest, I think he may be getting early onset dementia and that is the cause for his paranoia and temperament, but I'm not qualified to make that diagnosis. \n\nWhat I want to know is am I the asshole for pushing his buttons? Or even discussing the topic at all? \n\nIt has never been an issue in the past but now I'm really concerned he is truly this ignorant, judgmental person. \n\nOr maybe I'm the asshole. ",

      "description": "Backstory: Her and I just graduated in June. We were best friends all throughout high school, but definitely got in our fair share of fights that would prevent us from speaking for a month or two at a time. This was largely due to the guy she’s dating. He’s manipulative and controlling (tells her wheat to wear, gets mad at her when we hang out, etc). \n\nHe’s enlisted in the army. This past summer, he was at AIT. That entire summer, despite him being gone, I only saw my friend once. I tried making plans, but she was understandably busy with going to college and everything. However, I haven’t seen her since August even though she’s been home just about every other weekend. \n\nHer boyfriend is being deployed in April, but she’s known this since last August. He won’t be home until December. Her excuse for not seeing me is that she wants to see him as much as possible before he leaves, but I’m just getting sick of it. I feel like I only matter if there’s nothing else to care about. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I cut her off? ",

      "description": "This happened about a month ago and we are over it but still believe we are both in the right. \n\nSo during the summer my parents go down to their beach house a lot with my dad coming back for a few days every couple of weeks. During his time back home he never cooks or makes anything beyond maybe a sandwich because my mums not home to cook the meals. Alot of his 'meals' also come from food I buy, like avocado, bread, eggs etc which I do not mind him eating at all, I buy them to just stock up the fridge with food for communal reasons. \n\nI on the other hand do cook my meals, and usually enough for about 3 full meals which I happily share with my dad or my sister if they would want any. One particular meal I made was a really nice healthy chicken salad (empasis on the healthy, I had just found out I have a rare type of diabetes a week prior with my parents accompanying me to learn about diet and injecting insulin) and shared it for dinner with my dad, putting the last of it wrapped up in the fridge for when I return home after work the next day at 9:30pm. \n\nWhen i did return home with much anticipation to eat, the salad had been eaten by my dad. I was upset and I told him I had saved that for me because there was quite literally nothing else to eat in the house. I said I wouldnt have mind if he ate it if there was food left for me to cook or if he had messaged me so I could grab some stuff on the way home, but instead I get left with a completely empty fridge with no food. \n\nIn turn he gets angry at me for being ungrateful, I'm in his house, my mums always cooking me food. He never gets angry when I eat leftovers. He then just tells me to order uber eats and goes to bed. I end up having a choice of pizza, burgers or kebabs. \n\nI'm a little at a loss, because maybe I am being an ungrateful shit and shouldve just took a quick hit. \n\nThanks!\n\nTldr; make a healthy dinner for my newly diagnosed 1.5 diabetes to eat after I get home from work at 930, dad eats it knowing we have literally no other food in the house, gets mad at me for being upset by that",

I get them every month so I constantly sell them, well I was under 100 left today and this chick hits me up says where can I pick up, I give her the address she says on her way, about 30 minutes later I messaged her and asked if she was close. She read my message but no reply. My experience on the market when people do this they’re not coming. I get blown off by people all the time. So I’m use to this behavior, 15 minutes go by and a guy hits me up wanting to buy the rest so we agree. I marked the product as sold and he picked up at my house. \n\nHe said it was gonna be a 20 min drive. About 5 minutes till he’s here the girl messaged me saying “I’m here” and I said sorry sold already you never messaged me back. There was no communication what so ever so I felt no need to keep your order. She goes on and says I’m whack for wasting her time, but like why should I wait on someone who doesn’t reply? They’re coming to buy 1 when another person who’s prompt wants to buy the rest. She messaged me like 10 mins after I marked as sold. \n\nShe went onto calling me an asshole and that her drive was from a suburb, the way she did it made me seem she was using it as somewhere far from my address. When I plug her suburb into my phone I’m 11 minutes from it. She took over 1 hour. I offered her  10 at same price and I’ll even drop off next time and she went on talking shit. But honestly I don’t see what I did wrong. If I did help me see it. So AITA or what. ",

      "description": "I know, I know the title sounds horrid, but I want you to hear me out first. \n\nTL:DR at bottom.\n\nSo my loving husband has recently (I assume because of a new cavity) started having some really horrible breath. Typically I can deal with bad smells, but this is just horrid. This is been going on for over a month (dentist trip isnt an option at the moment we are down on funds), and I just can't cuddle him his breath is too bad, I dont want to kiss him because he sometimes breathes near my face, and lately during missionary he breathes so heavy over my body its awful.\n\nI began avoiding making out (which he loves) and just saying I had a headache or such as not to hurt his feelings, but when it came to sex I had to say something. Afterwards I told him his breath is just too bad. He says he doesnt think it's that bad and that he could brush his teeth before we kiss and such. We tried this and it was like kissing a mint coated trash can. I don't know why it's so bad. \n\nHe took it really well and began brushing his teeth more but it's still horrible. We have been married for a year and together for 3. This has never been a problem. \n\nI keep avoiding these close interactions because it's so bad. He says I'm being overdramatic. I can't help to think, am I the asshole? I mean he IS trying to fix it, but it's so bad. \n\nTL:DR- My husband I have been with for 3 years's breath started to be rancid and I stop close interactions and sex. He tries to make his breath stop being so bad yet it's still horrible and I refuse any close interactions still\n Am I the asshole? \n\nAlso, to note he is not mean to me in any sort of way, aggressive, or such. He just simply is annoyed and said I'm 'overdramtic'. He is not aggressive when I say no to sex nor does he try to force me. ",

      "description": "Obligatory I’m on mobile, so sorry for spelling and grammar mistakes\n\nSo, a little preface for this story.\nIn late September, I met this girl in a Discord server and I enjoyed talking to her. I’ll call her Nessie. \nThings were smooth until I had a really bad mental breakdown and threatened a lot of stuff. This is obviously never good, and she promptly told me that she didn’t want to speak anymore. \n\nI knew I had fucked up and last month, tried to contact her again to say hi and ask how she’s doing. She says hi and we become friends again.\n\nNow this is where the AITAery starts.\nLast night, I messaged her friend on Instagram to introduce myself, saying “Nessie sent me.” They responded with some bullshit, told me to fuck off, and I complained to Nessie. She said that he had heard of what I had done to Nessie, and wasn’t happy (they’re close friends).\n\nI asked why he could talk to me like I was nothing (I did the same, but I had been desperately trying to apologize for what I did), and she replied with “don’t turn this on me blah blah”. I got mad at Nessie since her friend was DMing me, with excerpts of our chat, meaning Nessie was telling him what we were saying. \nShe said that he wasn’t mad at me for saying hi, but rather for what I did half a year ago.\n\nNessie: “you can’t take stuff back. He’s just protecting me.”\nMe: “so he can treat me like shit? you defend him regardless. Don’t you see that I’ve been trying my fucking best to make up for what I did? Just because he’s defending you, that becomes null and void? Goodnight, I’ll unblock you when I want to talk.”\n\nWhen I’m in school, I unblock her and we talk for a little bit. She says that I had exhausted her with how I had treated her, which she had the right to say. She then went on to say that he was just protecting her and that he was a little harsh, but had the right to be pissed off. She called me a liar, and I said that I didn’t want to speak anymore. She said that she had warned me, and I blocked her.\n\nI know that I fucked up, but I’ve changed in half a year.\n\nSorry for it being so long and unformatted, thanks to all of you.",

The girl and I started talking and eventually set up a movie date over the weekend. Our plans were really last minute and convoluted and she ended up texting me saying she had some things to do but she would try and make time. She didn't get back to me so I assumed she was still going (where I messed up). I texted her ten minutes before the movie was going to start asking where she was. She said she couldn't go.\nWe decided to meet up during lunch break later in the week. I was really excited to actually hang out with her. I texted and asked where we should meet up and she was really confused until I reminded her that we were supposed to hang out. She said she needed to make up some schoolwork so I didn't care too much that she cancelled. Twenty minutes (lunch is an hour) into lunch my friend, the one who set us up, told me the girl was hanging out with her friend. This hurt me.\nI confronted her about this and she said that she wasn't trying to avoid me or hurt me and that she would tell me if she didn't want to see me. But I was still hurt and I stopped talking to her.\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I’m friends with a girl (let’s call her Val) who is also friends with another girl I know, Marge. \n\nThe thing is, there’s no love lost between me and Marge. We were good friends previously, up until she tried to steal my boyfriend, after which I returned the favor and did stuff to her and we both repeatedly talked shit about each other. About half a year ago, amid Marge-related drama I met with Val and she was like ‘Honestly, I still don’t know why I’m still friends with Marge’, so I was like ‘I’m not making you cut her off, just don’t involve me in whatever you do with her’.\n\nHalf a year later they’re still friends and there were some times I caught Val forwarding some my messages to Marge just for fun, but the problem is, these messages could damage my reputation, and now Marge had them. I talked it out with Val, asked not to forward anything from me to Marge, she nodded but I think she left with the impression that I’m just still mad after whole boyfriend thing.\n\nThing is, I’m a head of a huge uni project which Val is a part of. Val is a part of it and Marge was too, but had to leave due to several reasons. Val is working a lot but she also screws up a lot and it is noticed by many people. At the same time she asks me for more responsibility and I refuse to give it to her. \n\nLast week she told my friend that she thinks I don’t trust her not because she screws up (and she believes that whenever she does, it’s not her fault) but because she is still friends with Marge. Not only that, but she thinks I want to kick her off the project because that’s what happened to two other Marge’s buddies (believe it or not, it had nothing to do with it).\n\nI am really mad at her for that. I understand that people can be friends with anyone they want, but at one point I provided proof to Val that Marge is a shitty person, and I am frustrated by the fact she doesn’t trust me enough to believe in it. The only thing stopping me from confrontation is the fact that I’m not supposed to know why Val thinks I don’t trust her.\n\nSo AITA if I understand that I can’t dictate my friends who to hang out with but I still get angry that one of them is friends with a girl that wronged me several times?",

(Not as bad but the clutter and gross aspects of the house definitely lead me o believe they are hoarders, no one has been to the house in 10 years for example) The dog they have is extremely old (at least 12 years old). She’s missing an eye (has been for about 6 years from an unpreventable injury) and since she’s grown old I think she is now completely blind. Her fur is matted and she spends most of her time wandering around the house and crying out (I’m assuming in pain). She is too helpless to be let outside and goes to the bathroom all over the house. This has been bothering me since I moved out ~6 months ago and realized how not okay their way of life is. I was hoping the dog would just die or they would put her down. Well I’m assuming they are too embarrassed of her condition to take her to the vet and put her down, and have apparently been looking into ways to handle it at home but they are busy people and nothing is being done.\n\nThey also have two cats who live perfectly fine lives and are fed regularly. I would feel bad having the cats taken away as well but I’m unsure what to do.\n\nThe reason I think this would make me an asshole because I’m sort of doing it out of spite that my parents forced me to live in a pig sty for 18 years of my life.

      "description": "My big brother was always a party guy, having a lot of women but no real girlfriend. At 32, he finds the good one. I didn’t like her at all, but if he is happy, I’m happy. Christmas Eve 2015 was at my house, he brings his new girlfriend for the first time but didn’t bring any gift because his car broke on his way to buy us some. He takes everything we give him anyway, telling us he will see us soon to give us our present, it never happened.\n\nThey were together for about two years when she got pregnant. Weird situation here, I’m French Canadian and a lot of our traditions involve some old Catholic background. Even if they were not Catholic, they wanted their child to be baptized as a “tradition” so he asked me to be the godfather of his son, I was honoured to accept it. At every family gathering, they told us that they did not want any gifts because they absolutely wanted to choose everything for the child. It was not a problem for me, I prefer to be present than giving unwanted gifts anyway.\n\nA month before the childbirth, our father quit our mother for another woman. Our mom was devastated but still was happy to be a grandmother for the first time. It was a hard time as I was the only one supporting her, my big brother didn’t want to hear about the separation because he was finally happy with his soon to be family and my little brother (19) too childish to be able to help her in any way. As the middle child, it was weird to have all the attentions...\n\nIt happened that the day his girlfriend gave birth, I was leaving for vacation for two weeks but still was able to see them at the hospital (without gifts). Since then, everything changed. They stop talking to me on a regular basis. My brother started threatening our parents to cut off contact with his baby if they told him about their problems in any way. He was in his happiness bubble he told them. He then told me he doesn’t want me as his baby’s godfather because I was not happy enough, for him, about his family. He was hoping I wanted to follow the pregnancy like it was my baby because he name me as the godfather and that I never brought a gift to his child. I was shocked, told him I was taking care of our mom since the separation and as I understood, they didn’t want anything as he repeated hundred times. He apologizes but still didn’t want me as a godfather because anyway, he already ask someone else.\n\nChristmas (2017) was near and I know he will be there so I texted him that to not be awkward, I will not buy him anything so I ask him to don’t buy me anything too. He exploded, told me I was a piece of shit, that I was never there for his four mounts children, that I never buy him anything and that he never wants to hear about me again. I told him to go fuck himself and never talk to him since.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So, what started this is that a few years back I told her about a conversation I was having with a female friend. The conversation wasn’t anything sexual or flirty, and I brought it up on my own because I thought she would find some of the stuff I said funny. My gf flips out, calls my brother and his wife and asks who the girl was, but he doesn’t know what she is talking about as this was just a friend I’d met online in a game and lived 2000 miles away, wasn’t important enough in my life to bring up to family.\n\nAnyway, I’m embarrassed about it because I hate causing a scene, she knows that. And I have told her on multiple occasions if she had something to say just say it to me in private.\n\nWell, she came to her senses and apologized for the whole thing. And I stopped talking to my friend just to appease her. But, as a result of the incident I don’t tell my gf about any online conversations. And I don’t let her look at my phone.\n\nNow, she has my password, and I’ve assured her I’m not talking to the girl anymore, which I’m not. I also told her I do talk to other friends though, both make and female and that I won’t tell her what we talk about. It’s never anything intimate or flirty or more than plutonic.\n\nShe seems to think my behavior is pointless and that I’m holding a grudge and being petty, or that the only reason I won’t show her is that I’m hiding something.\n\nI told her she can go through my phone, but if she does, she won’t find anything and I’ll break up with her. I know that I wouldn’t really, but I want her to know how serious the issue is to me.\n\nIt’s about trust and if she feels she needs to check my phone that means she doesn’t trust me. And maybe that’s petty that I don’t just let her and put her mind at ease but idc quite frankly. So AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for considering on closing out an electric bill that my parents put in my name and reporting them for identity fraud?",
      "description": "In October after my parents almost got the electric shut off due to them not receiving a notice it was going to be shut off (their phones were inactive as they didn't pay the bill)  they asked if they can give the electric company my phone number in case they needed to contact them, I'm aware they only call if your electric is being shut off, yes before you ask they're financially irresponsible as all hell they probably owe an upwards of $10,000 in debt between utilities and rent and family members they refuse to live within their means. Now I found this a bit strange but I wasn't aware of an emergency contact like thing. But I said \"Yeah you can give them my number but you better not put that bill under my name it could seriously ruin my credit score and will be on my credit history for years.\" Now my stepmom immediately got pissy and said \"We're not, even if we did it would help your credit score out.\" It'd only help my credit score if they would actually pay their back balance proactively on their bills but they will only pay a portion of the monthly payment. \n\nWell come November I end up moving out because I'm sick of my parents acting like absolute asses to me and taking my money constantly to feed their irresponsibility because they've taken an upwards of $2500 from me from April-November and on top of that having the audacity to say I never help out with bills and that it's only fair they take my debit card and money because of that (makes no fucking sense.) On top of that they kept trying to control me despite me being 18 and essentially tried to keep me hostage after I exposed their asses for stealing driving lesson money off me that was given to me by family for that specific thing, money that they'd never pay back. After that whole fiasco happened and we all made up i was talking to my stepmom on the phone and she asked if I changed my address, I said no as me and my boyfriend were in the process of moving to a different house. She told me not to change my address at all so I'd still be receiving mail at their house and they'd give me my mail every few weeks because of some weird excuse being insurance reasons. I was having red flags popping up that would've made the Soviet Union jealous,  I disregard that though as I have important college papers come in the mail and tax forms come in and change it anywayd. Well lo and behold a few days after the New Year's begins I get a power bill in my name that was at my parents address. It had over $600 I back balance on it and a $200 payment due for that month! I was beyond pissed and called my dad asking what the hell was this? He deflects and pretty much tries to worm out of the conversation. I text him the next day and he says that they had to do it as they owed too much on accounts they had open at the electric company and plus their credit scores were in the shitter so badly they couldn't keep theirs open. He said that he'd pay it off income tax and close it out but until then he'd pay me $50 every two weeks   (not even half of what the monthly payment is.) I tell him that's not enough and there's no way they're going to accept it and to please take it out of my name and put it on theirs, proceed with guilt tripping about how my parents and brothers will live in the dark until income tax comes then because they know my younger brothers are my weak spot. On top of all this my dad kept asking for money and probably borrowed $140 in a month which he paid back so this $50 every two weeks for the power bill hasn't been upheld at this point nor paid. And I let it be because the guilt trip worked and I didn't want my brothers to suffer like that plus my dad begged me not to tell my grandparents (they're my confidants) as my grandfather was having heart surgery so I shouldn't stress him out and my grandmother is already stressed out enough. I just received a shut off notice yesterday and told my dad about it with no response of course and I've been thinking of some great advice my grandmother gave me. She told me if I keep enabling my parents and they don't face the consequences of their actions they'll never get better. I'm now considering calling the electric company up tomorrow and telling them to cancel that bill as there's been a mistake and reporting my parents for fraud, I have proof. But I have to keep my brothers in mind as they'll suffer if I close it and they'll be left without electricity. My dad might lose his job if I press charges against him and my stepmom for using my identity to open a utility in my name. Which would cause more suffering as my dad has already had 8 job losses in the past four years already. Plus I'm worried they'll just do the same thing to my brothers as they have no shame in committing identity fraud against me. The burning of bridges is also a concern for me as well plus i feel like an asshole for agreeing to let it continue but that's because they had a strong mental grip on me, I was emotionally and mentally manipulated. Which of course I'm trying to work on as it all ties into my anxiety. So Reddit AITA for looking out for myself? I need an unbiased opinion on this \n\n**tl;dr** Parents being shitty and do something unforgivable and emotionally manipulate to get their way, considering on letting karma deal with them at this point",

Short time after, a worker had to carry a table through this hallway and told us to step aside. I thought there is enough space for this guy to carry the table through the floor, so I kept looking at my phone. \nHe first walked past the person next to me, without any issues.\nThen he walked past me and I did not get hit by the front table legs. Unfortunately I got hit against my head by the table legs at the back. My colleagues haven't been hit by the table leg and we're pretty much like my just standing at the side of the hallway.\n    \nThe worker then carried on like nothing happened and I remained silent for some seconds. After he was at the end of the hallway, I called after him \"well, thank you for that\". He became really aggressive then, shouted \"I don't have eyes on the back of my head\" and left. Another worker came around and told me, \"well, you really could have step aside more.\".\n\nAfter a while he returned, to continue his work. I demanded him to at least apologize. He didn't and carried on his work.\n    \nAm I the asshole for not pressing myself against the wall?  \nThere was clearly enough space to go through the hallway without hitting me.  \nSaying we should take care, is not an excuse for being careless.  \nAm I the asshole for demanding an apology?

Never said I would or made a promise. So skip forward until yesterday I went out with some friends. I took the money just in case I saw some one. I decided to pay for all of our meals since they are all in college . And then gave the cook at the restaurant $5 because I use to work with him and he was always nice. Then an old family friend who is an elderly lady came in so I paid for her $2.50 hotdog. Still had money left over. When I get home they asked me where my money went and I told them what I did.

      "description": "The relationship between my now ex-boyfriend (54M) and me (36M) was in a rocky situation for its last six months or so, until I finally pulled the plug and ended it in September of last year.\n\nWe had had a very bad fight around March of last year, after which it seemed to me like it was possible that the relationship might not be tenable. \n\nAfter the fight we agreed to try couples counseling. I took the responsibility to find us a counselor and arrange an appointment for us to meet him. After only one session with the counselor in April, my boyfriend said he was not interested in pursuing counseling and would not participate any further.\n\nAt this point I was strongly of the opinion that without some commensurate effort on my BF's part to try salvage the relationship, the relationship could not be salvaged. This made very depressed. I felt like I was trying and he wasn’t, so maybe we ought to just break up.\n\n**However**, we had been planning an international vacation together to Paris and Amsterdam in July/August; two cities I had never visited, and would not likely get the opportunity to visit again for the foreseeable future. We had already bought our plane tickets and arranged for accommodations, which together cost us each couple thousand dollars.\n\nWe were both looking forward to the vacation. For my part **I decided that I would not ruin our fabulous European vacation by breaking up with my boyfriend before it happened, even though I already had serious misgivings about our long-term future**. \n\nI put a lot of effort into making the vacation a pleasant experience. I tried very hard to defuse or prevent arguments, and to be as agreeable and loving as we ever were at our best together. The vacation, from my perspective, was amazing! It was romantic, it was beautiful, it was sexy, it was educating. It was, by all accounts, a great vacation and a once in a lifetime experience. \n\nAbout a month after we got back to the States, I finally had “the talk” with my boyfriend and broke up with him. He claimed he was blindsided by my decision. In response, I explained that we had been on the ropes for months, and that I had been contemplating the possibility of a breakup since he vetoed any further attempts at couples counseling. \n\n**He interpreted this to mean that I had been planning to break up with him but was keeping it a secret from him during our vacation together.** That our happy experiences together were all lies. That I had deceived him. That I should have broken up with him before we went on vacation, because now his memories of the vacation will be forever tainted with the knowledge that quote: **“We were already not even a couple anymore, and I didn’t even know!”**\n\nI think this interpretation goes too far. In my mind I didn’t want to ruin an opportunity to create some beautiful, happy memories with a man I desperately loved but would probably lose. I also did not want to throw away the several thousand dollars I had already invested in planning this vacation, money which I couldn’t well afford to waste as I really don’t make enough money to go on international vacations except once every five or more years at best (My ex makes significantly more money than I do, and travels internationally several times every year, and has been to both Paris and Amsterdam multiple times before, so this trip was not ‘special’ to him to the same extent it was ‘special’ to me). \n\nAITA for not ruining our vacation? Should I have cancelled the vacation and thrown away the opportunity to travel and see the world? Is it fair to say that the whole trip was a ‘lie’?\n",

      "description": "I haven't had any traumatic experiences with alcohol or anything, and this idea wasn't brainwashed into me by anyone. But I've just come to accept it as part of my personal philosophy and I don't want to give it up. \n\nEssentially, I'm almost 21 and have never had alcohol, ever (never even been to a party, that's the kind of person I am). I never want to. I don't care if times get tough, I would prefer to resort to healthier coping mechanisms, thanks. I also certainly don't need it to have fun. And it smells bad. I have no need nor want to drink.\n\nSince my 21st is coming up in a few months, my boyfriend who is a couple years older than me keeps saying that he will get me some nice champagne for my birthday and he keeps talking about it like he will expect me to have some. I don't want to, and I keep telling him that, but since my birthday isn't super soon neither of us sound very serious about it either way. \n\nHe drinks a normal amount, which I'm fine with, I just don't want to drink, even on my birthday. I am worried that my boyfriend and any other people who may remember my birthday will keep pressuring me to drink, and if I don't, they will think I am lame/annoying/straightedge/an asshole. \n\nWIBTA if I don't drink, even a little, on my 21st birthday, or drink really ever? Part of me feels like with our current culture I will be seen as the asshole because I may be seen as holier-than-thou person who won't just chill and have a good time, or possibly fit in with others (I don't know anyone who doesn't drink AT ALL). That part of me says I should just suck it up and drink for one day. But the other part of me doesn't want to budge.",

      "description": "On mobile, apologies. (First post here)\n\n    Important context: Me (13 F), my mother (57 F), my father (57 M) and my grandmother (77 F) don't clash well together. Me and dad (A) v.s my mother (T) and my grandmother (c). T all her married life has been a hoarder, but since I've been born it's gotten worse. She basically is a beggar (not choosing thankfully) she's always tried to get as much free as possible. And always get mad at me for no reason Ex: I was pronounced Anemic and she got really mad at me for 'not eating enough'. But that's besides the point, all I'm saying is that I have some bias but for good reason. Another thing is that ever since I was like two, I've hadn't had a bed to sleep in, hardly a bedroom. And I barely stay at my parents house \n\nMain story/point: \n   Well back last year T was in a car incident, we recently lost a car so she had to walk to work. When she was walking she was hit, then of course was hospitalized. During this time my dad and I though it'd be good to work on cleaning our house (not as bad as what's seen on TV but a year away from that stage). We told T about this and           she flipped. \nA year later and a mediocre clear house (October 2018):\n    A and I have successfully have cleaned some of my room and I can access my closet. Though I still don't have enough clothes to wear, I'm still very thankful. No, I'm really thankful. Then I come back from C's and I went to my room to get ready for church and it has been completely filled up again with T's stuff, this enrages me. I walk across the Hall to T's room, \"Why the heck is your stuff in MY room?\" \n\"What are you talking about?\" she smuggly replies. \n\"Your stuff's in my room...? Why?\"\n\"Erm that's not your room, it's mine.\"\nMind you it's always been my room since I've been an infant. Enraged at this point I take all of the bags of American Girl  crap and put them in her room. 'Done.' I think, boy was I wrong. \nThe next week:\nMore stuff, taken out. (Repeat for the next couple of weeks) \nI show up at C's house to stay for the school days. \n\"Why do you keep moving your mother's things??\" C exclaims when the topic rises. \n\"Because she ruining my chance of sleeping in a bed...?\"\n\"Well she needs the space for her things.\" (T has a master bed room, she has plenty of room.) Conversation continues, this was q couple of months ago I don't remember much. But AITA? \n\nP. S I still get yelled at by C for not letting T dirty my room. \n\n\nTDLR: Haven't had a bedroom since I was an infant, finally able to have one, then mother starts piling more crap in my room",

      "description": " \n\nOkay. Bit of a long one, so bear with me.  \nEdited to be SFW.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI'm a native English speaker, and this is written VIA computer. I seriously apologize for mistakes, and would like to be corrected as it improves how I text/write.\n\nThis all happened over Discord roughly a year ago. The reason I remembered it was because my main PC was brought back to life, and I found a lot of old screenshots.\n\nFor context, I used to be super into Homestuck. I met some people on Shamchat (random server/chat website that went down recently) two years ago.\n\nI met Sky, L, and C. Later I would meet K, a friend of Sky; as well as M, a friend of L.\n\nC and I started dating, though she broke up with me and had turned out to be cheating on me. Incredibly emotionally manipulative. Constantly trying to get me to be smutty, forced me to stay on the phone with her for 4-6 hours daily. If I didn't, she would threaten to be.. for lack of better words, bad to herself. \n\nI did nothing to her, and she is not the focus of the story.\n\nL and I instantly stuck together like glue afterwards. We were absolute best friends. Talked daily, super nice.\n\nSky introduced K shortly before Sky was kicked from our friendship.\n\nL and I are still stuck together, and I started developing slight feelings for her.\n\nMonths later. K confesses that they're kinda/sorta into me. M then tells me that it absolutely crushed L as she was also into me.\n\nK and I dated for half a month before Laura started to drive a wedge between us. Saying that I knew she was into me, and I went to date K anyways.\n\nShe continued to act like it was new, even a year later.\n\nThe last contact I had with L was back in October.\n\nLast summer, she happened to be in one of K's servers and I just happened to be around. She was complaining about how her current girlfriend was out getting high, and L was sure she was cheating on her.\n\nWhen I offered comfort, she exploded on me. Saying I ruined her love life and that I was horrible to her constantly. I felt disgusted by it for a week before I told K, and he let it simmer until I claimed it really bothered me, instantaneously deleting all of her hate and banning her.\n\nShe attempted to shoot me a friend request in October, in which I politely told her to screw off.\n\nLooking back on old messages, I don't think I'm in the wrong. But I'd like a slight public opinion.\n\nI was considering contacting her again, but M strongly goes against it. I agreed with her, and think it'll stay that way.\n\nI have some of this saved in screenshots, and most of it in the content I never deleted. However, all of our mutual servers are now dead and gone, so there's no way I can retrieve anything from there.\n\nIs it really my fault or did she just overreact?\n\nTL;DR - Girl I was into turned out to be into me, calls me a bitch when I date someone else even though \"I knew\" about her being into me.",

I've been recently often criticized (family and friends) that I'm not doing the proper things in my life, mainly when it comes to starting my own family, getting married, getting my own place to live etc. I know that these things are a priority for many people, but it hasn't been the case for me or my girlfriend. We recently bought a new car that we've been saving up for a few years, that's when hell broke loose. My family is pretty pissed at me for not spending the cash on a wedding instead and we had an emotional discussion about it yesterday.\n\nBasically, I told them that I don't want to live my life like \"everyone else\" and that I see having kids as mostly a problem for me and my gf. I said that I'd rather spend my money on the things that make me enjoy life and keep me happy, instead of making everyone else happy. I also said that they are delusional and short sighted for trying to force me into making decisions based on what they would do. My brother has a 6 month old kid. He's adorable and I like to play and carry him around. Everyone is super happy when the kiddo is around during family meetups. The thing is, that kid isn't a sweety 24/7. He requires time and money. He needs to be fed every few hours, he needs his diapers constantly changed, he needs to be taken out on walks, etc etc. That's the stuff the parents are responsible for and I simply don't have the time or need for at the moment. \n\nAITA for sticking to my guns on this one?",

She felt like me and another friend (who backed me up) were ganging up on her. Basically the whole night was ruined because of it. \n\nDid I over react? I can add more details if necessary.

He was in between that or a fast food burger place, but since Ive heard him mention this place a few time I told him we should go there. We get there and he asks me what I am thinking of getting, I told him Im not sure since I don’t really know what to get. He says a few things we should get and then asks me if I want some tofu noodles, I said that I’m not super sure and if we could look for some other types of noodles. He says he always gets them and I should try them, I tell him he can order it but I want to order something else just incase I don’t like them. The waitress comes immediately and he orders the first couple of dishes to share and looks at me, and I order the chow mein noodles. As soon as the waitress leaves all hell breaks lose and he says that I am being disrespectful for ordering chow mein noodles at a classic chinese restaurant, that that’s something you would order in panda express. I told him that he could’ve ordered it anyways or just be more clear that he was going to choose the dishes for us to share instead of making it seem as if I should choose a dish. I tell him I can go and add the order and also cancel the other noodles (it wasn’t that I had to have chow mein noodles, it was just the only thing I knew) and at this points he doesn’t want to talk and just says I’m being disrespectful for not letting him choose the dishes at his favorite chinese restaurant, and that everything is ruined. I tell him that whats the big deal if I am just going to pay for it and just add another dish and we could enjoy the meal anyways., and if its too much take the other one to go. The dishes come and he won’t talk to me, 5 minutes later he asks for the check, I pay for it and we leave, he goes and gets burgers instead from the drive through and now I’m sitting in the car hungry with a box of chow mein noodles that I’m waiting to eat once we get home.\n\n\n\nI do feel like I shouldn’t have ordered the chow mein noodles, but I don’t feel like its fair the way he reacted when he wasn’t super clear and I was trying to make up for it once I realized how much the tofu noodles meant for him.

      "description": "(Sorry for being kinda sloppy with composition on this post, it's 10:00pm and I am pissed)\n(We're all in the 8th grade)\nEX: Ex Girlfriend\nFF: Former Friend\nNG: New Girlfriend (Not very relevant to the story, but still important nonetheless)\nME: Me (duh)\n\nPrologue: A few months ago, EX broke up with me after being together for a year and a half. That was my first serious relationship, I had an entire life planned out for us. Bad mistake. I moved two hours away, (this was out of my control) and eventually EX broke up with me. After long and painful months pass by, I eventually get over it. I find a new person that ends up being NG, and the day of writing this, Valentine's day, I tell her how I feel. Good feelings all around, I'm happy. Now, to the main story.\n\nAs night approaches, I get a message from EX.\nEX: Hey, Idk why but FF wants to talk to you. He says it's important. Get on discord.\nME: Ok we\nI go to discord, ask him what he wants, but he tells me to go to a new group chat that he made.\nFF does some crappy acting that I should've seen through, and tells me that he's dating EX now. I wanted this, because I thought he was a good person, so I say that I don't care.\nFF: We started dating right after you broke up with her.\nME: She broke up with me, but whatever.\nFF: She told me she liked me even more, while you two were still dating.\nME, being confused and angry that EX didn't break up with me sooner, go to confront her. EX is confused, and said she never said that, and that FF said that he was going to mess with me, but she didn't think that he would go this far. I angrily go back to discord to confront him with this newfound information. After I confront him, he spouts this bullshit.\nFF: Now, since I told you, I want you to tell me how mad you are at me.\nI accepted his request and went batshit crazy on him, cussing him out, and realizing that this sadistic shitstain is not my friend.\nAnd then he has the audacity to say that I never really loved EX, and that I was using her, even though I literally gave her everything, and that if I really loved her, I would've waited to date someone else. And he started to say that I can't play victim since I have no idea how difficult school has been since I left. And then I blocked him because I was done being verbally assaulted. I told EX what happened and she just took a middle ground to it, and told me I should probably blow off some steam by writing about it, since she had to go to bed. I told NG about everything that happened, and she comforted me, but she had to go to bed, so I told her she should get some rest. I decided to take EX's advise and post it on here, since I learned of this place through Cuestar and Misery Box. So here I am. On possibly the worst Valentine's day I've ever had. So, am I the asshole?\n\nThanks to anyone who reads this for listening to me unload my emotional baggage. This probably won't end up anywhere, but it was worth it to get my anger out in a non-toxic way.",

      "description": "First, let me say that this is going to be a long one, so strap in. \n\nAcronyms- \n\nM= Girlfriend's mom (\\~40)\n\nSD= Girlfriend's Stepdad (\\~50)\n\nGF= My ex girlfriend (16)\n\nI am 17 and a boy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met GF working at a grocery store 8 months ago over the summer and we really hit it off. We instantly became pretty attached and started to escalate our relationship. That is, until she got grounded due to smoking weed almost right after we went on our first few dates. I was (imo pretty understandably) upset, as I didn't get to see her for the next 2 weeks while she was grounded. After those 2 weeks, I asked if she would quit smoking so that nothing like that would happen again. She agreed, and for about a week it was going fine. That is, until she got caught smoking at her real dad's house and was subsequently grounded another two weeks. I was pretty mad but she found an old phone to talk to me with at night so I wasn't livid or anything. After this grounding I was pretty damn positive I wanted her to stop smoking. She agreed and, again, everything was fine- until I caught her buying from a known dealer on snapchat around two months after that conversation. I asked why she didn't stop and she said that she could stop whenever she wanted to and that she was just enjoying her life and I needed to but out of it. \n\nNow, some backstory- M used to be addicted to pretty hard drugs for a while before having GF. So did SD before meeting M. M still vapes uses weed and SD + M have now allowed GF and her stepsister to vape and smoke in the house. \n\nI told GF brutally honestly that this was bad parenting and that she shouldn't be allowed to openly use drugs inside of her house, otherwise she might end up like her mom (sore subject in retrospect but I was and still am genuinely concerned for her). So, she runs away crying and after me apologizing for what I said I ended up saying that she could smoke as long as it wasn't every day like it was in the past, as well as asking her to lay off of the Juul. She agrees, and we are better for a couple months.\n\nThen, I found out she had been smoking daily again and asked her why. She said that her mom was fine with it as long as she would periodically buy drugs for her. I was really angry this time because of how often and nonchalantly she breached my trust, so I told her that she needed to start being honest with me about things and that I really care about her. She said that I shouldn't be saying that weed is harmful to a young person because it cures cancer, anxiety, etc. I called her out on this and she said that if I did not think that it was OK for her to smoke daily then we should ask for an outside opinion. I agreed, but every person she put forward was outspokenly 420 friendly (examples include her mom, her smoking buddies, her stepsister, a mutual friend who was an avid weed user). So I called her out on this and she said that I obviously don't want to mediate so she'd just cave and stop juuling and smoking altogether.\n\nFor the next couple months after that, things were OK at best. She never really talked to me outside of when we were alone and we kind of just went through the motions together. There was not any intimate contact for around 2 months. When I brought this up she said her depression had come back and she thought it had an effect on her libido. So I laid off. After another month of very sparse intimacy I asked what the issue was and she still said it was the depression. I told her that it makes me feel unloved when we hang out for hours and all she wants to do is play Pokemon on my Switch. She apologized and again, blamed it on her depression so I didn't hold it against her or anything. I had voiced my concern and was just trying to make her feel better so we could get back on track. \n\nNow comes the recent stuff- \n\nOver Thanksgiving, she came to my house twice. Ate with my family and went on a day trip to a nearby town one day and went to a soccer game with us the other. Everything seemed great. Still not much intimacy but I was waiting on her to feel better instead of trying to force her to be better myself.\n\nI wanted to go eat with her the next week so I asked if she wanted to go out that Friday for dinner. She agreed, and then on Thursday broke up with me. I was crushed- it was so out of the blue. We had previously talked about Christmas presents and what cost range we were going for and I had already bought hers and was planning on going to dinner with her tomorrow and it just stopped me right in my tracks. \n\nLater that week, around Saturday, she apologized and said she wanted me back. I was very confused but still in love so I said yes. On Monday, it came to my attention she was grounded over the weekend. I asked why and she told me she was caught juuling at her house. She never stopped and said she did it just to spite me. I was hurt that she would lie to me so easily and for so long about her health. Later that day, she said she lied again and it was actually weed she was caught with, again. M thought that she was becoming a little too dependent on it so decided to disallow smoking in the household for a bit- but that didn't stop GF and her stepsister. So, she comes to me saying she's an addict and she was wrong to lie to me all of that time and she was sorry. And I forgave her- on the condition that she stopped vaping.\n\nNow, GF gets belligerent and defensive. She tells me its not my place to tell her when to stop something even though she got addicted to something chemically less addictive than nicotine. I was done with everything she had pulled on me the last couple months, so I told her that if she didn't stop I would tell M and SD that she had been vaping with nicotine. A dick move, sure, but I was concerned that she would get even more addicted and it would be harder to pull her back out the next time. She said she would quit within a week and that she was sorry about everything that happened. She kept commenting that she thought that after we went through all of this we could be better as a couple and that we would be even stronger.\n\nKeep in mind, she's still grounded, so everything I hear from her is at school. I heard that someone at the table she sits at at lunch was popping pills in the cafeteria. I commented that maybe those aren't the best people to hang around and was met with a deluge of comments about how I was trying to change her. I attend the play she helped work on two days later, congratulating her on her work and enjoying the show. Over the weekend, I went to send her a text about how I missed her and how I can't wait to see her on Monday but I noticed she had blocked me. \n\nI thought at first that it was just because she had to give her devices to her parents and that she didn't want them seeing anything we talked about. But, on that Sunday, SD comes to my house and tells me that the relationship is over as he read her texts and decided it was unhealthy for her to stay with me (I personally thought that he was offended I called him and M bad parents but I don't know how far back he read so I can't say). Of course, intimidated by the physically fit 50 year old man in front of me, I just nod and say yes.\n\nThen, come early Monday morning, I realized I am blocked on everything that she owns- snapchat, discord, Instagram, etc. I realized then that it was her decision to break up with me out of the blue, again. I was so angry and sad and had so much trouble coping with my emotions. She refused to even talk to me and I heard from a mutual friend that she was calling me \"emotionally abusive\" and from texting M about what the hell even happened that she and SD essentially told her that breaking up with me would be best for her. I asked why and was never even graced with a response.\n\nNow her whole group of friends (who overlap slightly with mine) think that I'm an abusive ass and they're starting to make me think that too. I don't know what to think anymore, and if I have really been as shitty as she says I was then I would like to know for my future relationships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- Tried to stop my GF from using drugs, ended up getting broken up with out of the blue (twice) and called emotionally abusive. Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Basically typically uninformed white girl and it was a turn off even though she was pretty, when the bill came I asked for it to be split and the look on her face was as if she was shocked.

      "description": "Basically, as the title says, I love video games, and was sort of a loner for a long time, so I got particularly in to single player games. In the past few years, I became way more social, and started playing games a lot with my friends, which I love doing. However, one friend asks me to play every time he and I are on at the same time, as he almost never plays single player games, but, while I love playing with him, if I said yes every time, I would never get to play single player games. I realise that sometimes this means he is bored if he has nobody to play with, and so I have started to try to say yes more often, but when I'm really in to a game, sometimes I won't play with him that often. AITA?\n\n Also, this is a somewhat separate question, as I'm pretty sure I'm the asshole in this situation, but sometimes I want to play multiplayer games we both play, but I want to play them alone, Im not even sure why, we're  basically best friends, and he doesn't  annoy me, I just  feel like playing alone sometimes for no real reason. So I set myself to offline, (showing me as being offline, even though I'm playing) even if he is playing too, AITA here?",

      "description": "I’ve been dating a wonderful woman (36F) for about five months. We get along great, have amazing conversations, she’s incredible. \n\nProblem is, she’s rich. She works in fashion (we both live in NYC) and lives in this huge apartment and has a lot of money even though she doesn’t do much with it besides donate to charity and buy groceries and stuff. \n\nI (24F) am poor. I live with four roommates in a two bedroom apartment (two of them have bedrooms, one lives in the den, one in the home office type space, I live in what used to be the laundry room) and waitress for minimum wage. I have very little money most of the time as my money goes to rent, utilities, etc. She knows about my financial situation and has never looked down on me for it or made me feel bad for having less money. \n\nSo when we go out, for food or to somewhere you have to pay for, she always pays. I offer every time, but I don’t insist because I know I can’t afford it. She shoots me down every time I offer (very nicely) and tells me not to worry about it. I feel terrible but at the same time it’s something for me to eat and I honestly can not afford to do all the things we like to do together. \n\nAITA for letting her pay and only offering once each time to do it?

I’ve been doing it for quite a long while and have gotten pretty good at it but I know that I can still get better.\n\nSometimes I paint individual minis for friends for D&amp;D or just because. In all honesty, I would normally try to not charge any money for this because I just like to paint but some of my friends are uncomfortable with asking me to do it for free so I ask for as little money as I can.\n\nHowever, when I’m given the model to paint, it sometimes takes me over a month or even two to finish it and get it back to them. This is because of school, work, other miniatures of my own, and getting together with friends where I try to paint but end up not. This doesn’t take up all of my time, though, and I know I can dedicate multiple hours a day to painting and get a model done in just a day or two.\n\nI just start painting it, get maybe halfway done, and go to another thing I need to do and end up leaving it unfinished for weeks before I can complete the model. The model always ends up looking good and my friends are happy with the results, but I always feel like I shouldn’t charge them at all if it takes me this long. I’ve brought this up to these same friends and they tell me not to worry about it, but I still feel like I should give each of them their money back.\n\nAm I the asshole for basically taking their money and doing nothing for so long?",

Don't know why she hasn't unfriended my yet but whatever.\n\nSo new years eve I am just chilling at home with my dog (was battling a pretty nasty hangover and just didn't feel like going out). When I saw a pretty cringy but funny fight breakout on facebook between my ex and her best friend. Remember I said that my ex was jealous and paranoid? Well she accused her best friend of hooking up with me (which never happened) and her previous ex's.\n\nSo shortly after this my ex's friend starts texting me and asks if I am busy, I just play dumb as say I am free. She comes over and hangs out and we end up hooking up. I knew going in that this was just some revenge shit for being accused of being an adultress on social media.

      "description": "Warning: Long. There's been a shit-tonne of drama. Just had the most terrific fight with my mates because they believe (not entirely unfairly), that I treated them like shit.\n\nBackground: I\\[15M\\] am an orphan. Recently I found out I have an uncle and a cousin sister. They seem like really cool people. They're also filthy stinking rich (at least by my standards). My uncle's apparently a fairly prominent official in my country's politics. It's been a shock, and I've been freaking out about the fact that I'd be leaving my mates behind. My birthday was coming up so I asked my uncle if it'd be okay if I stayed here through then and have a farewell party, and then come  to him right after. He agreed, got my flight booked and everything.\n\nSo now comes to the time to tell the fellows that I'm offski, and I just can't do it. Coz it never goes well.\n\nThe Buggers (that's what our group's called around here, long story) have been mates forever, doing literally everything together. You name it - pranks, getting punished, macking on chicks, having each other's backs if any of us is getting bullied etc. Thick as thieves doesn't begin to cover it. \n\nBut there are other gangs here where the dudes are just as thick... right up to the moment that one of them is adopted. Then its pretty much always one of two reactions - either everyone turns cold, or they turn into bloodsucking leeches. I've seen some of these guys guilt-trip a departing kid into begging their new foster parents for clothes, gadgets and so on for the mates they're leaving behind. It's sick. \n\nThe Buggers aren't like that. I know they aren't. But it's been weeks, and every time I've tried to tell them, I freeze up, because I don't want to spend the rest of my time here fending off having to make promises and get mooched off. After spending weeks feeling like shit about the whole thing, I figure I'll tell them the night before I have to leave. It's about as much as people usually get to process moving out of here anyway.\n\nEnter Tina \\[16F\\]. Name changed, obviously. She's cool, she's kinda hot, and every single one of the Buggers has been hitting on her since we hit puberty. I read, she reads, so that was my in, and we've been flirting on and off for a year. Her mum owns and manages a local inn. There, the director of my orphanage got drunk and spilled to her mum that I've been adopted, and that my uncle's someone important. Her mum tells her. She comes over and chews me out for not telling her, I make dumb excuses, next thing I know is that she came in to kiss me so fast our teeth banged and my lip's bleeding. Didn't stop me from making out with her. We didn't know at the time, but one of the Buggers saw us. She tells me her mum's invited me to have throw the birthday party at the inn's kitchen (that's the night before I leave), and I can bring friends.\n\nOne of the Buggers, call him Mixer, bakes me a carrot cake. We clean up the best we can. Head over. Tina's invited three other friends of hers, all girls. Cake is cut. Song is sung. I'm trying to feel out a good moment to tell the others about my uncle. Tina's mum leaves us alone. The girls are feeling frisky and the guys aren't complaining. Commence Seven Minutes in Heaven. Conversation turns to the time the girls got the bird-and-bees talk from their folks. And that's when Tina lets slip that my uncle's probably gonna give me the talk.\n\nTotal and instant silence. The Buggers ask what uncle. So I tell them. I show them pictures of my family that my uncle sent. They ask me when I'm leaving. I tell them tomorrow. That's when things start going downhill. They freak out. They want to know why Tina knows and they don't. Tina and I explain it wasn't me that told her. They wanna know why I didn't tell them. I swear I was going to tell them in just a bit (I was). Wtf else was I supposed to say? It's not like I had a good answer. So one of the Buggers, call him Rickie, answers for me, and he's got me dead cold to rights - that I didn't want them mooching off of me. He has a little rant. The other girls are just soaking up the drama now.\n\nTina tries to mediate, and that's when Rickie makes a shit situation shittier by accusing her and her mom of being 'in on it'. He was the one who saw us canoodling yesterday. He says she must be glad her ugly duckling is a golden goose. He says that's why her mom made her notch me on her belt. AT this point I hit him coz he basically called Tina a whore. He's looking ready to kill me, but Tina's mad now enough to handle him - she kicks him out. The remaining Buggers tell Tina they don't believe that crap about her and her mum but they're going to check on Rickie. Right before leaving Mixer tells me I messed up.\n\nObviously the party's over. Tina and I talk, but now I'm pissed and there's no way I'm leaving it like that so I go looking for them. Only, I can't find them. I hit the orphanage and all our usual hangouts but it's like they've vanished. My flight's in a few hours, and they're not seeing me off. I feel like I should've just left as soon as I got the letter, I feel like a shitheel but I'm also fucking pissed at them for reacting this way.

I have told her multiple times I feel uncomfortable for posting pictures of myself and I don’t find a reason for putting our relationship out for the world too see. It’s not like it’s a secret we’re dating but it upsets her.I’ve hinted multiple times that I find it uncomfortable and I’ve told her that straight out that I find it uncomfortable. I know we have been together for2 years but I 1 don’t find a reason to tell the internet we’re dating and 2 I find it uncomfortable.  And I also asked why she doesn’t post anything about me on her account but she said I’m turning around the argument on her\nFor context I don’t mean I just don’t want to post pictures because I don’t find a reason too I just don’t think people should be and their phones in the time and rather have them ask about us and also I have posted cute pictures of her before \nSo people of reddit am I the asshole for not wanting to do something I find uncomfortable ",

      "description": "I knew it was a mistake to introduce them, but I did it anyways.  \n\nMy grandpa is pretty abrasive.  He’s from another time and it definitely shows.  He’s often offensive and rude.  In my family though respect for the elders is paramount.   It’s how all of us kids were raised.   So while we very rarely agree with him, we just let it go and don’t confront or argue with him.   It’s just the way my family works.  Not to mention the fact that when I was homeless he took me in and kept me fed while I found a job and got back on my feet.  I feel indebted to him a great deal for that.  \n\nMy gf herself is pretty outspoken.  It’s probably my favorite thing about her.  We haven’t been dating super long, but I already feel closer to her than any of my past gfs. \n\nI go and visit my grandpa every couple weeks.  Lol it’s rarely pleasant, but he lives alone and even though he’d never admit it I think these visits mean something to him.  My girlfriend has been wanting to meet my family.  She’s met two of my sisters so far.  She’s been wanting to come and meet my grandpa, but I’d tell her no.   I was upfront with her about his personality and that I know what a strong personality she has.   That it’s not worth it because I just know they would butt heads and having a fight with one of my family members would cause problems for us.  She kept assuring me that she understood and was fully capable of being pleasant to unpleasant people.  \n\nThis past weekend she finally wore me down and I agreed to take her on my visit.   One of the first things he said to her was a comment about her short hair and not understanding why so many pretty girls insisted on looking like men.  Then he looked at me and asked me if there was anything I wanted to tell him with a laugh.  Gf just smiled and didn’t respond so I actually had some hope this would turn out well.  It didn’t.  There was some more small talk until he turned to her again and asked, “so what are you?”   I cringed because I knew exactly what he was asking.  My gf didn’t and still thought he was talking about her hair.  She told him she was a woman, it’s just hair.  My grandpa said no, he meant is she Mexican or Indian?  My gf didn’t really say anything.  My grandpa went on to say that he guessed it didn’t matter so long as she was a damned Puerto Rican.  My gf just said Jesus Christ and looked hard at me.  My grandpa was just going on about this time he worked with a Puerto Rican. \n\nI could tell it was only going to get worse so I made up an excuse to cut things short and leave.  To be honest this wasn’t nearly as bad as he gets sometimes.   I think this was his version of being toned down for her sake.   My gf is annoyed that I did speak up for her.   That’s just something we don’t do in my family.  I warned her multiple times about him.  ",

      "description": "So today I got to my first hour class at school and found out we had a substitute. This sub is an older lady that has anxiety issues and refuses to teach for most teachers due to how brutal some kids are towards her because she’s a little weird but kids bully her. Anyways this is her first time subbing for my teacher and she was very scared. She knows who I am and I’ve always been kind to her so she came up to me after other kids warned her about some of the classes later in the day and handed me some roster sheets. She told me to look through the rosters and put an “O” next to the kids who are obnoxious, “L” next to kids who are loud, and “VG” next to kids that are very good. I felt kind of bad for her so I listened to her. She asked some of my classmates to make sure that what I was marking was correct and it was reviewed and agreed upon. So there’s this one girl, we’ll call her Jen. Jen is a huuuuge drama queen who cries non stop, threatens to kill herself and blame others for it, and snorts ibuprofen in the bathroom and tells everyone about it. To say the least I’m not very fond of her. I personally find her obnoxious so I put an “O” next to her name. My girlfriend has that same teacher second hour and she texted me “Jen is pissed” and I asked why and she said “the roster” and I asked my gf why she would tell Jen I wrote that (I put an O next to a lot of people by the way) but my gf told someone else who I put an L and O next to but it was no hard feelings there. Anyways the sub decided to read out everything me and the rest of my class labeled to everyone in the rest of the classes but nobody was upset with me because everyone can be loud and obnoxious at times, I know how people act in that class and some are worse than others. I’m a fairly well liked guy and even the people who I labeled told me I was spot on but Jen was furious. She cussed me out and said she hated me and I told her that I was just following instructions and it was just my classes opinion about how everyone acts around that specific teacher but she threw a fit and now she’s telling everyone. I don’t care who she tells tho because the people are on my side. So AITA for calling her obnoxious? I see how it could be wrong to agree but I just felt bad for the sub. And I felt as if the labels the sub told me weren’t bad, it’s not like I’m insulting people’s looks or calling them whores. Thanks for the feedback :)",

      "description": "So I’m renting a room in a very expensive area ... but after making a post on Craigslist saying I was looking for a cheap room to rent, two elderly people reached out to me. They offered me a room to rent for probably half it’s worth (or maybe more), and said they wanted to help me because I’m a college student. Obviously I was very grateful... I mean, it’s still “expensive” but it makes living here actually possible.\n\nHowever, early into the first month I realized these people wanted like a “son” or “grandson”, as one the old lady told me “all my family has died so it’s really nice to have you here”. Every time I pull into the drive way she runs downstairs and pretends to be doing dishes, and as soon as I walk through the door she comes out of the kitchen and says “Oh, what a surprise to see you! How was school? Let me tell you about my day.. blah blah” and at first I wanted to be nice and talked with her but she would literally talk for over an hour.. I literally leave the house at 8AM and don’t get home until 8:30PM because of work, and I have to do online homework and be to bed early so I can wake up and do it again the next day..\n\nSo, now I kind of try to avoid them and talk to them as rarely as possible because I really don’t have time and also I just don’t want to. She has told me so many times that I should come out of my room and hang out downstairs and watch VHS tapes in the living room and hang out with their cats.. (the same cats who crawl all over the kitchen table all day contaminating it and she leaves the cat food out on the table and sink)\n\nShe always goes into my room despite me even locking it, but with good intentions to clean it or make my bed.. but one time she went up there and I guess it was “dirty” because I was in a rush and she threatened to kick me out in a super mean and vindictive email. I literally left a single towel hanging on the shower rack to dry .. she later came up and said “sorry” and that she has OCD.\n\nI’m not complaining about my situation, I mean you get what you pay for and I’m just grateful to find something affordable so I can go to school here.. but AITA for acting this way? \n\n",

      "description": "So, first of all, i live in a latino country where family is very important to everyone, but I don't particularly feel it that strongly.\n\nTo understand where I'm coming from, i got to tell some of my past. Parents divorced when i was 10, moved to another state with mom and two brothers, my two brothers started living in grandma's house, while i still lived with my mom, in the same city. My mom started dating some guys and kinda paid more attention to the guys and their family than to me. I am a very quiet and introverted person, so I became used to being with myself in my room. Whenever I went to my grandma's house, everyone there would criticize me for being too quiet and being in my room a lot and I never responded. My brothers would call me an useless person while the rest of my family just watched. I grew more and more used to avoiding my family.\n\nAfter I graduated highschool and went to university, I started living with my grandma. I discovered that my grandmother is very difficult to live with, anything that someone does that isn't exactly the way she wants gets her really mad, making her get really passive agressive and ironic, making the mood of the house really depressed. No one dares to respond to her. \n\nBeing the quietest one and accepting every insult thrown at me, just to go back to my room, I became the target for my family to criticize, specially since everyone in my family is very successful. So you can tell that the pressure on me is very big and it has been building throughout the years.\n\nWell, as of last year, my two brothers left the house and now is just me and my grandma. Her mood is getting worse by the year and I came to realize I don't need to be the scapegoat of my family and just let them insult me.\n\nA few days ago I changed the position of my bed in my bedroom and my grandmother exploded at me, cursing me and telling not to talk to her anymore. That was the last straw for me to want to move out. Problem is, I still don't work, because I am in college and in this current semester I can't do it because of my courses at my university. So my idea was to use the money my father sends to my mother bacause of the divorce. I talked to them and they just said i have a house and comfort to myself and just to tough it out.\n\nWIBTA if i just used the money anyways and rented a place?\n\nI can't help but feel like I am acting as a spoiled kid if i did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "o backstory here, I live in a 2 bedroom house with one other housemate. We have known each other for about 3 years are pretty decent friends. We used to live in a house with 3 other guys and this year we moved into a new place. It’s a really rad house with a cool yard. The only downside is the rooms are adjoining so it’s really eSy to heAr between the rooms or into the living room. Also, since I make a lot money than my friend and didn’t want to live with a random, I agreed to pay about 60% more rent than him for a similar room. While this bothers me some times, I still liked it better than sharing a small space with another person I don’t know.\n\nMore backstory: about the time we moved in my buddy had recently broke up with his girlfriend. I’m single too so naturally we have been living like savages and going out, getting hammered and generally having a good time.\n\nFast forward to about two months ago. I left for the weekend and on that Saturday my friend called me to tell me he had hooked up with a chick. He had been slumping after breaking up with how girlfriend so I was happy for him. I come back that Sunday to find his new girl was there, and she has been there pretty much every moment my roommate has been home since. If I come home before my Roommate, his girlfriend is usually already there Starting to make dinner. They bang a lot and it makes me feel awkward since it’s so easy to hear between the rooms. I know my friend has the right to have a girlfriend and I don’t want to stop him from doing that, but the issue is that she is literally always there, and they don’t ever really spend time at her house. Most nights I’m home I feel like I’m awkwardly intruding on their dinner date, since most every night they cook dinner and watch a movie I and never go out.\n\nAm I the asshole here for being annoyed by this? I feel like my house that I pay a lot of money for isn’t really my house anymore. Obviously I’d want my friend to be ok with it if I had a girlfriend, but I feel like what they do is excessive since they’re at the house all day everyday and I never get to enjoy the house without having people over.",

So if they're going to cancel classes for it, it must be pretty important, right? Well apparently not important enough for them to guarantee everyone knows what the fuck is going on. They give the sessions in French, only occasionally translating to English. I've always preferred English, but I believe it makes more sense for them to give the Axado in Dutch when it's for the Dutch section. I don't speak French.

      "description": "A few weeks ago, my 28 year old sister mentioned that she would be moving to a different apartment on March 30, just down the hall from her current one. \n\nShe asked my her BF, our Dad, Me, and another friend to help her move her furniture. \n\nI just noticed today that the time she chose to move conflicts with a non-refundable couples massage I booked for my GF and I back in January.  So, I offered instead to come by later in the day on the 30th to help hang pictures and stuff instead. \n\nNow my mom and sister are all pissed off because it’s going to be “hard to move” without me. My response: I’m not that strong, if I’m the glue that holds your moving plans together...you’re 28, hire movers.  \n\ntl;dr - I would rather go to my previously booked couples massage with my gf than help my sister move, and my mom and sister are pissed off about it. \n",

I was asserting that TES took way more liberties to make something more interesting. i’m now being yelled at by three people over this, who claim that i need to respect Tolkien and how i can’t get so defensive when i’m being ‘called out’ like, as if i’m saying something worth actual offense.  so was it that bad, what i said? i can’t help feeling like i was ganged up on, and that i can’t say anything lately without being dog piled.

      "description": "So I reside in a country where the main language isn't English, and was speaking English with a friend when an American woman came up looking for someone to translate something for her.  Basically, she said as she was turning in to park (in a parking lot) a bike had passed her on the left, forcing her to stop suddenly.  She wanted me to go to the biker (who had parked nearby) and tell the biker to be more careful.\n\nI went to college in a very bike heavy town, and am more sympathetic to bikers in this situation.  I think that even though the biker maybe should have been more careful, that it was the car driver's responsibility to be aware of bikes coming up behind them, and wait to turn until the bike has passed.  I basically told her she should be more aware of the bikes, and should have let the bike pass first.  I felt like going and telling the biker to be more careful would be putting the blame fully on the biker.  That said, I did not see the situation occurring, and was just going off of what the lady told me.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Let’s call her Prudence. Not so long ago, Prudence decided that we were a couple, romantically entangled and in love despite the fact that I’d never taken Prudence on a date, expressed interest beyond wanting someone to dance with and she’s arguably attractive, and me unattached. \n\nI wasn’t excited about the news that I was suddenly dating but I didn’t really do anything to quash it as I live 45 minutes away and in my experience these things tend to work themselves out with distance and no communication and medication. \n\nTime goes by and Prudence won’t let it go that we’re a couple. I start to show up places and there she is. It gets weird because I’m going places to get my dance on (think ballroom and latin) and she’s showing up and making it clear that I’m taken. \n\nI try to let her know I’m not interested and she storms off of dance floors crying and making a scene. It got to the point where mutual friends started telling me to knock it off. She was fine and I was the problem.\n\nThing is, I don’t consider myself now nor ever an attractive person. I’m not a skilled dancer though I did take classes and I could lead, and this was my way of relaxing. \n\nAlso, Prudence just wasn’t my type, which is one of those weird conundrums guys go through when a pretty girl is involved and the Barney Stinson Hot-Crazy chart is in play, which can lead to all kinds of possibilities. I can’t change who I am and Prudence couldn’t be someone else and yeah. \n\nAnyway, I agree to dance with her after she’s had a bad day, not caused by me, and during the slow pace around the dance floor she tells me she’s going to move away. Actually, she said, “Everything will be so much better when I move to New York City.”\n\nStupidly, I asked why she was moving and Prudence decided to tell me about all the shitty things going on in her life. Up until this moment, I didn’t know she had ever spent a night let alone a stint in a psychiatric facility nor did I give one thought to a potentially bad home life. \n\nI’m a good enough listener to commiserate with her and even though I don’t believe people need to be told to figure their shit out before moving to a different state and city, or before running away from whatever, it was taking all I had to not tell her to NOT run away from her problems. \n\nThen she said, “I’m going to New York to be a professional dancer.” She wanted to dance in musicals on Broadway, un-ironically. \n\nPrudence had two left feet and while I’m in no way an inspired dancer, she was just plain bad, horrible. So, I say, “Maybe, before you move to New York, you figure out some of the problems you have here. You can’t run away from them and problems have a tendency to follow you.” \n\nApparently, that was the wrong thing to say. She ran off the dance floor and out of the building screaming and in hysterics and I was  very quickly and less-than-politely requested to please find other people with whom to associate and other venues through which I could get my formal dance on.

      "description": "So, basically, I'm going to try to be short. The friend in questions is the kind of person who hangs around with your group but everyone kind of hates. This friend hates at least me back and has little respect for a lot of people. This happened today, I was wandering around a classroom before class, and I approached him(I don't remember why) and he punched me. For a second, I was like\"boyo what was that\" because it was just some random. Then I flexed my height on him (I'm tall for my age) and he cringed away. I didn't hit back because I don't really want to get into a fight, though honestly the entire class would have held him down. So basically, I am debating on whether or not to press assault on him. I told him \"expect a call from your lawyer within the week\" though if I don't press charges it could be considered a joke as I've already used that as a joke/threat.\nSorry if formatting is bad I'm on mobile.",

      "description": "Okay, first post and hopefully only post on this subreddit...\n\nMe and my brother both own an Xbox One, we have had it since Christmas 2016.\n\nI have installed Overwatch on it because I play it a hella ton.\n\nRecently, he had started to delete it. He has no real reason to other than spite, because we have a 4 TB external drive hooked up to it so it's not a space issue. He claimed that he doesn't play it, so why should it be on the Xbox? By that logic, I could delete 95% of the games on the Xbox since I never play those. He also deleted my account off the Xbox multiple times. I told our parents, they told him to stop.\n\nI took it into my own hands (or paws?) and deleted an Adventure Time game that he downloaded after setting Overwatch to reinstall (for the umpteenth time)... I can and will delete more games if he continues to operate under his current logic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo tell me... Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "First time poster with a throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nMy boyfriend (early 20s) and I (same age, F) have been dating for 3 years. He was actually the one who introduced me to weed when I asked him to a little before our relationship began. He had a history of heavy smoking; my parent are very anti-drug so I was very new to it. I love him very much, and we don’t really have any issues apart from this one.\n\nAnyway, for me, weed was pleasant but it was just a phase. For about a year now, I don’t have any desire to smoke. Especially after I’ve seen what it’s done for my boyfriend. \nWhen he smokes, he has little motivation, he has dropped out of school many times. He will say because of money, but he continues to spend money on weed? It’s been an issue for a while now. I try not to be judge-y. I really tried to be okay with it but something inside just rejects it. I just want him to be his best self, and get ahead because smoking has been part of what’s put him behind. \n\nI’m thinking of telling him that it’s me or weed. I hate to sound controlling. I don’t want to say he can never smoke again, just that he needs to stop buying it in quantities that feed the habit.\nSo WIBTA for this ultimatum? Or should I just accept that we are too different and end it?",

She's able to pay all her bills but without very much to save. \n\nShe went to school for nursing but has had a very hard time passing her boards and seem's to have lost that drive to pass. \nThese days she works around 30 to 40 hours a week, generally the former, her job is tied to the nursing world but she isn't making anything close to the income she would if she was a nurse. \nWe've been dating for around 8 months now and I really love her, she never really complains about her debt, she more so just keeps it to herself. She doesn't mooch of me, she isn't money grubbing. She isn't gold digging and waiting for someone to take care of her debt, but she also isn't really taking a firm stance in fixing it herself. I brought up things like getting a new auto quote, finding a new cell phone plan, finding a 2nd job, etc. But for all of those answers she throws excuses like, i don't want to deal with all the spam mail that comes with finding new insurance, or i need a cellphone plan with that price because it suits my needs, or there's no way I will get a 2nd job because I will become too depressed.\n\nShe says money doesn't matter to her, but I can see that her debt burdens her because it impacts all of her daily decisions. She works a friendly schedule and lives a stress free life to avoid feeling depressed but I feel she is also depressed because she has this overbearing amount of debt attached to her. \n\nI want to see her grind away, i'd love to see her ask me for advice,  I'd love to see her get mad and want to find a way to at least rid herself of some debt, any debt, her credit card debt even. \nBut it's been months between are talks and it seems like nothings really changed. She seems trapped but at the same time isn't showing the perseverance to really find a way out.\n\nYesterday it got brought up again and we left dinner saying a short goodbye and are now at a standoff. \nAITA for trying to tell her to buckle down and take action, for telling her that she needs to make life easier for herself and come with a strong plan. We've talked about getting married briefly and having a family but it's hard for me to commit to that when she doesn't show any ambition to make life easier for herself. \nI dunno. ",

      "description": "So I work as a server at a KBBQ and the manager almost always gives me the busiest section of the restaurant, booth (booth consists of 5 tables and this section is always full even if the rest of the restaurant is empty because customers always want to sit at a booth). The parties I was getting at each table ranged from 4-6 people. More people usually means that they will be needier. So for the entire shift I had to run back and forth bringing over the customer orders, changing the grills, and bussing the tables bc who knows where the bussers were, they only appeared to wipe down the tables. I would have 5 tables (full section), 3 would leave and then they would immediately  sit 3 more tables down. Eventually it started slowing down around 2:00 so the manager decided to give me a 6th table because they didn’t want to open another section. At this point I’m already getting pretty irritated because nobody is helping me out. All the other servers had maybe 3-5 tables the entire shift. (Tip is pooled so all the servers are tipped out the same). I was scheduled to be off at 3:30 and had told the head server multiple times around 2:30 that I was going to take my 10 minute break at 3:00 and he said that’s fine(usually we tell the manager but the manager is on break from 2:30-4:30 so we tell the one in charge). So 2:58 comes around and the restaurant isn’t busy except for booth and the head server lets server X go on his break. I remind the head server once again that I wanted to take a break at 3:00. 3:08 finally comes around and server X comes back.\nMe: ok im gonna take my break now server X is back\nHead server: oh I just let server Y go on his break you can go after he comes back\n\nIt’s now 3:18 and server Y comes back. It then starts to get busy in all sections and I told the head server “ok I’m taking my break. I don’t care that it’s busy now since you said I could go at 3:00 and it’s now 3:18” and just clocked out. After I came back from my 10 the head server was mad and threatened to tell the manager. \n\nAdditional info:\nThe rest of the servers were off at 4:00 and 5:00. I was off at 3:30 since I was scheduled to come in earlier. ",

We never do presents but I figured I’d grab some stuff that we always used to eat when we’d hangout in HS. I got a bunch of candy, snacks, drinks, etc. As I was checking out I decided that I would also grab some scratch off tickets, as we used to spend hours buying, scratching, cashing them in, repeat. \n\nI check out, pay with my card, and go to leave. At this point the woman cashing me out says “You can’t leave, you have to pay”. I got confused and replied, “didn’t I just slide my card?”. She told me they just instituted a new store policy, one that requires *cash* to be used for scratch offs. I did not have any cash on me, so I told her to forget it and grabbed my other items. \n\nThis is where it goes off the rails. She insists she cannot remove them from her cash register unless I pay her, freezing it up, and that it’s my fault so I cannot leave until I pay. I told her that if we wanted to get picky, she did not warn me about the policy before I slid my card- an obvious indication I likely didn’t have cash- so it wasn’t really my fault. This really made her mad, as she said she had no clue I didn’t have cash, and that I should’ve known about the new policy. \n\nThere’s quite the line forming behind me, with everyone pretending they can’t hear this fight happening. She keeps insisting I cannot leave without paying, and I keep insisting I can’t pay because I *have no cash*.\n\nI finally got sick of it and walked out, with her screaming at me the whole way. \n\nAITA for leaving?

      "description": "Context,  for clarity: my significant other of about five months is wonderful,  but I struggle with pretty bad sexual performance anxiety which causes  some trouble in our sex life. She worries that I'm not attracted to her,  and while I constantly tell her I am (and I am), I know she's still  really bothered that I often have trouble staying hard during sex (and  on the occasions I don't want to have sex, this feeling gets worse).  It's been the underlying cause of almost every disagreement and fight  we've had. She also has a very short temper, and often lashes out at me  when she's stressed.\n\nA  couple of nights ago, she texted me at around 3:30am asking if I wanted  to have sex. I told her that it was too late at night, she asked me to  send a picture. I did, and we ended up dirty talking. This went on for a  little over an hour, and at around 4:45am I sent her the following  message:\n\n\"(It's super late, I'm really enjoying this but I need to go to bed pretty soon)\"\n\nShe responded with:\n\n\"Fuck this then\"\n\n\"Just go\"\n\nI  clarified that I wasn't saying I wanted to stop, just giving her a  heads-up that I wanted to go to sleep soon. She accused me of looking at  sex like a chore and told me I was making her feel like she wasn't  wanted, and told me to \"fuck off\" and \"just go away\". I apologized for  making her feel that way, said again that I was enjoying the sexting and  just wanted to give her fair warning that I was tired, and said that if  she thought I could've phrased it better I'd be happy to change the way  I said things like that in the future, but I also told her I didn't  think it was fair for her to lash out at me for saying what I did. She  told me it was \"100% fair\" because I'm \"constantly shitty like this\"  then told me not to talk to her for a bit. I said okay and left her  alone for a while. I tried to talk to her earlier tonight (honestly,  hoping for an apology, although I didn't say so explicitly) and she said  \"Not yet\" and \"I'm p much ending this\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: the body of this post is a very lightly modifed version of a post I just made on /r/relationships",

      "description": "First time posting here, and also typed this in a rush, so i am sorry for any issuessss (TLDR at end)\n\nI work in a casual position- mainly as a cashier. We've recently lost a few workers and it's been super busy at work, and recently the last two rosters posted, me and the other cashier have been put on 5 days a week (some days we work together which usually isn't common). Now, this might not seem like a bad thing, but the environment at work is extremely draining and my boss and elder co-workers are massive assholes, so, you know, I don't really want to be there all the time/any longer than i have to. I am not super desperate for money at the moment, so I didn't want more shifts (i usually would only have 2-3 shifts a week), but you know, it's fine. However since it's holiday season, my boss probably assumes that i am on break from college and have a bunch of free time (which i am not, and don't)\n\n However, since we lost this one co-worker, (who doesn't even do the same thing i and this particular co-worker i shall be talking about who i will call S), things have turned to shit and I have been put on a bunch and even called in to do a double shift last week. Like i said, the work is very taxing at times and my boss doesn't make it any better either. So after working almost 7 days last week/the beginning of this week (our work weeks start on a tuesday and end the following monday if that makes sense), when i finally got 2 days off before having to work another 5 days in a row when i go back i was really happy to just relax, however, today i got a message from S asking to cover their shift.\n\nI said that i couldn't, which they responded with \"that's fine\", only to send another message about 20 minutes later, somewhat pleading for me to cover their shift (asking me if i am sure i really can't do their shift, even saying \"pleaasseee\"). I told them i really can't- i already covered S's shift earlier that week, and they got somebody to cover their shift the day after, then proceeded to leave work early when we worked together on tuesday. Usually when we swap shifts around- if you ask someone to cover their shift, you would usually do one of their shifts in return, however S never covered any of my shifts last week after i covered theirs, and i really didn't want to have to work another shift that week since i just wanted to enjoy my 2 days off.\n\nThey never gave me a reason to why they needed me to cover their shift, which isn't entirely necessary, but i just really didn't want to, although, i feel as if they did give me a reason, i would've said yes. I told them i really couldn't as i had college work to do, (which isn't a lie, i really do, but i initially was planning on doing nothing tonight), and they have since left that message on read, and now i feel guilty about it. We have to work together tomorrow and i am afraid they are going to be an ass to me or bitch about me behind my back; i am also worried that in the future (although S has since told me they wish to quit/move to a different department in our establishment) if i ask for my shift to be covered, and if i am desperate, they will say no. \n\nTLDR; my co-worker, S, asked me to cover their shift, i really didn't want to since i already covered their shift last week and they never covered any of mine, AITA for telling them i couldn't do their shift despite them asking multiple times purely because i wanted to have more days off?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "BF=G His Friend=P\nI hate P. He’s made fun of my s**cide attempt and s**f harm scars. He made a mockery of two trans students at school, calling them their birth names and saying being trans is a mental illness it’s not real and all that bs. He uses the excuse that he’s only joking and everything in life is a joke and if he makes it personal, YOU are the one that’s too sensitive. He’s done things to other girls that are definitely illegal. Sex was all he wanted to talk about, he even went as far as annoying me every day about his fantasies which included some weird role play, disgusting. I made it obvious I didn’t like that but he kept telling me.\n\nI’m very short tempered. P always waits until we’re in a social setting to try and get under my skin. He constantly pressures G into trying drugs which he hasn’t, but he’s not a good influence. G is on medication that you’re not supposed to drink on and P always encourages him to, even buying him drinks. If you ingest too much alcohol while on this medication you can actually end up in hospital.\n\n\nP is an asshole to G and their other friend,  F. At one point he had a bad breakup. On a night out P got with F’s ex which is disgusting. Since then P gets with every single one of F’s ex girlfriends or even attempts to when they’re still a thing. Me and G think he was an ego problem and he’s trying to prove he’s the alpha. G and F agree that he’s a terrible friend and when they get a change they’re gonna have a huge fight to teach him who’s boss. \n\nWhat really pushed me over the edge was the night of my friends 18th. We went to a club and G was there but actually left early. P showed up drunk, he kept getting closer to me as he talked so I kept taking steps back and even put my hand on his shoulder to let him know to keep his distance. I then saw a friend from class and took a picture with him and P offered to get us shots. Afterwards we stood near the dance floor  until my friend leaves, almost immediately P takes this a chance to do something bad to me. \n\nI argue with my boyfriend over this as I’m uncomfortable around P. Since we were 12 he’s had an issue with me, hence why he always goes out of his way to annoy me. I’m going on holiday with G and my friends in summer, P will be coming too. I told G that if P gets drunk and tries to do something bad to me or any of my friends, I will punch him. \n\nG tells me that P is his best friend and I have to be civil. I told him no. I said G, Pwill always be in my life right there to annoy me, he’s in my classes, he’ll be on the same holiday as us, they may go to the same college and for as long as they’re friends and I’m with G, I’ll have to put up with him. I cant be civil with someone who pressures people into drugs, drinking, does bad things to women and is racist, sexist, and transphobic. ",

      "description": "Background info, okay so my brother (11 almost 12) is the youngest of 4-call him 4, I (20f) am the second oldest with other brother being the oldest-call him 1 and my sister call her 3 (16) being the third. Growing up brother 1 was never made to do chores etc because he was a boy and chores, housework, cleaning etc was a girls job. Then when I was about 9/10 I had to take care of me and my younger sister meaning I had to make sure we were up, fed and walked to school. After school again it was chores and again my brother was a boy, my sister was ‘too young’ and should be allowed to play with her toys and 4 my youngest brother was only 2/3 at the time. So growing up I was essentially given the ‘mum’ role and even had to watch after them when my parents went out (friends, night-outs etc) and had to make sure they were fed, showered, put to bed all while still being young. I questioned this and was told that I had to be the one to do it because 1 was a boy and wasn’t mature enough even though he was 15/16 at the time older than me by 3 years but yeah. 3 couldn’t do it because she was too young which I got and 4 couldn’t either. \n\nAnyways now I (20) am being made drop off and to pick the two youngest up from school on any of my days off from work no matter the shift I was the day before. I took a week off as I hadn’t had anytime off in almost 4 months aside from 1 or 2 days which I legally had to be given. But during that week I was given the mum role again which is never given to 1 as he is still considered ‘not mature’ enough -he’s now 23- and they say they wouldn’t trust him to look after them which I get but still. \n\nThey told me tonight I had to get my siblings from school, get them their dinner and attend some play thing in the high school 4 is going to whilst they go out shopping, even after I told them that it’s their child which they planned on having and that I never chose to have a brother but was told I had to do my ‘sisterly’ duties, even thought 3 doesn’t have to do any of the things I was made or am made to do. \n\nI know it’s probably just me being an asshole but I feel it’s pretty shitty that just because I’m a girl that I have to be the third parent to children I never even wanted. \nSo your opinions, am I the asshole? \n(Sorry for spelling, layout etc) ",

      "description": "At the end of January I went to interview for being the karaoke host on weekends at a bar that was not yet opened. \n\nWhen I meet the contact, he seems professional. They have another business and he says he has been an entrepreneur for years. I find out he’s only 18, so my expectations for their hiring process are lowered a bit because it seemed like he didn’t have much experience in it.  \n\nI told him of my experience. I asked what they were looking to pay, and he said they hadn’t thought about it yet and what I would ask for (red flag). I asked for a reasonable price which he approved. We talked, he showed me around and told me about their plan and their expectations of me. They’re expecting to open up latest by the end of February. \n\nThe interview goes very well, we get along. I sing for him (he wants the host to get the karaoke going at the start of the night). He tells me I have the job and we shake on it. He says he’ll send me an email immediately with more information. Great! I am aware that there’s no contract signed or anything other than word of mouth, so I’m not relying on this or ending my work search.\n\nTwo weeks go by and no email. I call, he says basically sorry I’m on vacation, I’ll email you within a few days. Another week goes by. I text him, no answer. Another week and I call again, no answer. At this point I’m very annoyed at his lack of professionalism. Also choosing to refuse getting the hint. \n\nAt this point, I get a full time job that will start in the end of March. I could have still made a couple hundred euros working the weekends at the karaoke place until then. I’m mostly just pissed that he is literally ghosting me. Kind of acceptable in dating, but not so in business. \n\nAt this point I don’t even want the job anymore nor to work with him but I decide to make it my mission that I will not let him get away with his rude and unprofessional behavior. I have called him once a day for the past 4 days and he has yet to pick up the phone. I sent him a professional text message saying I have tried getting in contact, have yet to hear updates and would like to talk as he had told me that the job was mine. He’s seen the message but has not responded. \n\nI understand that this guy, a kid, might be scared or not know how to tell someone it’s not gonna work out. Maybe they didn’t finish the renovations, maybe a friend volunteered to do it, there’s a lot of reasons why they wouldn’t hire me. Frankly, I don’t want the job and I know 100000% that I can’t change this kid’s behavior and that I should let it go and not ruin my reputation over this. \n\nI am thinking of calling him from another number, like a friend’s phone or something. I am lucky to not come across assholes often but now that one has decided to cross my path I want to hear him admit to his bad communication and tell me what’s going on.\n\nAahh I need to just let it go.

      "description": "I'm a bit of a stickler about airplane seat etiquette. My philosophy is that unless there's nobody behind you, the person behind you is sleeping, the person in front has put their seat all the way back or there's some legit medical reason for it, you should only put your seat back about halfway. Putting it fully back is what I'd consider to be a dick move because everyone has limited space and you're effectively taking it from someone else. I follow this maxim and most  of the time on flights it seems like other people do.\n\n\nSo on the two most recent flights I've been on, the person in front of me was leaning their seat back all the way for no good reason. A family member I was travelling with spoke up for me (I didn't ask her to) and asked a flight attendant to tell them to put the seat back a bit. The first time the flight attendant told them to do it and they just put it back down when she left, and the second time the flight attendant said it was technically their right and refused to talk to them.\n\n\nIn response to both people, I lifted my legs up and used my knees to push back against the seat. I only pushed it so they were about halfway down. I only backed off after they did, and if they did it again I pushed back.\n\n\nThe first time the guy got the hint after a while and stopped. The second time the woman in front turned around and asked me to stop. My family member said (again I didn't ask her to) I was tall and needed the leg room, and she said we should've gotten a seat nearer the front, which is more expensive. I thought this was kind of a bullshit argument in my favour anyway so I just clarified that she could put the seat back, just not as much. She grudgingly put her seat more upright and pushed it back all the way later, but I was sleeping so I didn't really care.\n\n\nIf I had been on my own, I probably would have argued that it was an etiquette thing and explained that it just makes life harder for everyone else and that a compromise is necessary. I think getting the flight attendant is a decent idea too bc it gives them the opportunity to explain if there is some medical reason I don't know about. But I'm still wondering if what makes sense in my head applies to others, and if what I think is a case of 'turnabout's fair play' is just me being a dick. Any thoughts? I'll stop doing it if the consensus is that I'm the asshole.",

      "description": "I was basically imprisoned by my parents, developed a Stokholm syndrome. she managed to get me to pack my things and LEAVE. I felt like I owed to her, so my salary was our main source of income, she worked as a freelance designer and coudnt afford rent. \n\nThe main problem were PARTIES. We would have them so often, it was a constant stress for me.  I couldn't sleep well, or had headaches because she wanted me to drink, I became this walking ball of anxiety and stress and dealt with it by locking myself up in my comfortable l bubble. I was a bad roommate.  I was depressive - I STOPPED CLEANING. I tried my best in the beginning, but seeing how all my effort come into nothing after each party made me loose any will to clean anything. I would come after work,  fell asleep cause I coudnt sleep at night and I spent all weekends in bed. Eventually I only washed the dishes I ate from, cleaned after my cat semi-regularly. her method of cleaning became to put all the junk into a kitchen where I slept and  tell everyone that all that junk was mine.\n\nshe often told people I was fat, my clothes were awful, my interest were nerdy, my job was boring, my fav media too normal, shes ashamed of me. she became openly disgusted with me although I had enough money to pay the rent, just coudnt afford buying food for us both now as I had to feed my cat also.  friends told me that she speaks ill of me. Despite all that she never discussed with me the fact that I should move out, and expected us to stay as roommates. I understood that this is not good for me but stayed silent because i thought nobody would like me and that I owe her a big one for saving me. (Again, my fault and I try my best rn to deal with this \"stay silent and hope for the best\" mindset). The last straw for me was the fact that she  gave water to my cat  while I was absent, and her boyfriend sorta moved in with us, taking a lot of space  but not paying for rent.\n\nSo I left. I said to her that since her boyfriend lived 2 months with us he could help her with rent, and I promised to send her money as soon as I will be able to get some. But later doctors made me remember a lot of things I suppressed, I wasnt making enouth money and went out of all social media. I just felt broken, less than a human being  and I ghosted people who could only contact me through social media, and I'm 100% an asshole for that.During that time she tried to get money out of me by telling my abuser where I am.\n\nRight now I have a job that pays me enough to save a tiny bit. Im trying to save money to finish my education, but the fact that I promised her money is still over me. People say that I owe her nothing, but still she took me in! I dont know what to do. I would appreciate an advice from people with minds not as F-ed up as mine. I think maybe I should just try to end it with peace since she talks ill about me a lot, but I feel like that wont help at all.",

      "description": "\n\nFirst of, I apologize for typos and bad formatting, I am writing this on a phone. And english isn't my first language either. Sorry about that.\n\nNow, out of the blue like that, I probably do sound like an asshole but who knows. I'll try my luck, because I genuinely don't know if I'm wrong or not.\n\nAs title says, I despise my mother. I feel like she's horrible.\nFor the record, she has adopted me when I was a baby. But during my whole life she acted in ways that made me hate her so much.\n\nShe has been very mentally abusive towards me, and my father. Treating him like a slave and me as well. I've never been able to express my feelings or opinions without her snapping at me and punishing me. Same for my father, who told me that he learned how to not anger her, which is agreeing to whatever she does/thinks/says. But even crying would result in me being belittled, humiliated, she always called them \"crocodile tears\"\nShe also adopted my big sister and wanted me to \"become just like her\", since she was very good in school, very intelligent. My mental disabilities couldn't let me become \"better\" and she treated me like if I was retarded, neglecting my feelings and wouldn't listen to my difficulties and distress when I needed it the most. \n\nMy mom is very manipulative and I often get caught in it even when aware that she is so. It's to the point where I know she is but cannot pinpoint when she tries. She constantly projects her issues on me and always blame others (often me and dad) and not herself.\n\nI should mention tha she had depression for a good while. I understand that it is very, very hard, but I always felt like it was unfair that she took it out on mostly me. It's during these times that she told me I was an accident baby/made by an unfaithful woman and that's why nobody wanted me. She always told me that I was lucky to be adopted by her because others families would've beat me a lot, but I feel like she did that to me back in my childhood- she'd hit me and hurt me to make me \"understand\" that I was not allowed to respond to her.\n\nBack when I was 8 years old I tried to call the child protection services because I remember telling my big sister that I was worried she'd kill us, but she caught me in the act and dared me to call them in front of her... Which I didn't, I froze in fear and she punished me for it.\n\nTo this day I am still struggling to know if I am in the wrong or if I am right to hate her. Yes, she's been very hard on me and I understand that strict parents exists, but I can't tell If I'm just weak. You see I'm very worried, since when I start thinking about her too much, I feel dread and I often get anxiety attacks, PTSD(?). My body will shake and I end up having sleepless nights. \n\nI am very sorry if my train of thoughts do not make much sense, I tried my best to explain it without getting scared and anxious.\n\nShe really is one of my biggest nightmares, but I can't figure it if I'm too dramatic or not. AITA??\n\n",

English isn't my native language.\n\nLong story short about the roommate/ex situation; we were a couple then not anymore. We still live with eachother until she finds her own place, we're not NOT friends but we're not exactly best friends either.\n\nThis is however not the point, so onwards with the story.\n\nI was hosting a party with my friends and some of them noticed a bottle of Sourz in my booze cabinet and wanted to drink it. \n\nInstantly I thought \"Hey why not? I can just replace it since she's not going to drink. She's not even home for a couple of days\". \n\nSo she was away for the weekend with some friends and I knew she wasn't going to drink it at least for a whole week since she goes to school and makes it a big point to study all day during the week and goes to bed at an early hour.\n\nThe bottle itself is a bottle I purshased for her on a trip to Germany when I was there to stock up myself. (Where I live, it's pretty common to go there and buy loads of booze since it's much cheaper)\nIt's nothing fancy, you can basically get the bottle everywhere I live and it wasn't a gift so it had no sentimental value to her whatsoever. I even told her almost right away when she got home. I hadn't replaced it at the time but I asked her if she was going to drink it right now, or even the day afterwards but she said no.\n\nSomehow she's trying to make this big point that I don't respect her and tries to make me look like an asshole.\n\nSO my dear Redditors, AITA?",

I am also being unfair to those who did the actual work. \n\nIf I don't lie, he is gonna get a failing grade on an important project. He won't fail the semester but it is kinda heavy. I am also respecting the work the 3 put in. \n\nI used to cover for my friends like this in elementary and middle school.

All in all mostly young adults. The thing is, we are pretty cash poor due to the two moves in less than two years, she works seasonal and still owes money that I paid upfront in first/last as well as we both have combined around 7k credit card debt that we are slowly paying off.\n\nI know she will spend a crap load of money on decorations and food (which I will end up paying half of) for an event a week and a half before Christmas where we will eventually be seeing everyone anyway at different events on the day of. GF is paying me back about $1500 in expenses I covered for her during the moves and has been slowly whittling down her debt, but I think the event is a waste of money and our friend groups have such different background I don't see them really mingling either.\n\nThere will be about 30 people as well that I am not looking forward to cleaning up after, and with the holidays being so hectic for both of us work wise I was hoping for a quiet weekend.\n\n",

So she is working on that while we are waiting for the food to come and I'm chatting with the kids.  Every once in a while she needs input from me for the ap and interrupts my chatting with the kids.  Its kind of annoying but not horrible yet.  Then just as the food arrives she starts demanding I help her finish the last couple of steps (need to verify identity for this ap).  At that point, I kinda lose it.  I tell her to put the phone DOWN NOW.  \"I'd like to have a nice lunch with you and the kids, I really don't care about that ap right now, we can do that later.\"  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe shuts down.\n\n100% shut down.  Silent treatment, won't talk to me for whole rest of the afternoon.  When we get home she goes straight to the bedroom and closes the door.  I'm left with kids and groceries to put away.  I take care of everything and make dinner.  She comes down, eats, goes back upstairs without saying a WORD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have since worked through this little issue (been married almost 15 years you get good at that).  She feels like I was being self righteous.  I honestly just wanted to have a nice lunch without a stupid ap distraction.  She feels I was talking to her/treating her like a child.

He was supposed to come round but instead he told a massive lie about how he had workmen in at 10pm at night. \n\nHe later admitted anyway that he just didn’t want to come and couldn’t be bothered telling me so he lied. So I broke up with him because I can’t stand liars, and if he can’t talk to me what’s the point.  \n\nAnyway fast forward to last night. We were messaging and I was being friendly because I didn’t think we ended on bad terms. I was supposed to be meeting him to give him his things back and then he cancelled on me last minute. \nAs the day went on he started to send quite worrying messages. \n\nHe told me he didn’t want to be alive any more so I messaged his mum who he lives with, and she said he will be fine don’t worry. \n\nAbout an hour later he messaged to say he had taken a codeine overdose and was going for a walk so I called the police. \nThis was at 5pm last night. It’s now 11:13am and the police still haven’t found him. \n\nBut he’s still been messaging people, me especially. And I’ve been begging him to go home or tell me where he is and he won’t. He just keeps saying he wants to die etc. And then he gets really mad and says it’s all my fault and it wouldn’t be happening if I didn’t break up with him. \n\nI literally haven’t slept. I’ve tried to keep messaging him to make sure he’s alive and to keep the police updated but I need to sleep so I told the police I’ve done everything I can and I don’t know what more I can do. \n\nAm I the asshole for 1) breaking up with him and 2) now giving up on him? \n\nOh btw, we were only dating since November. It was a fairly new relationship. \n\nTL;DR - broke up with boyfriend and now he’s threatening suicide and gone missing. ",

      "description": "Short story: i got severely depressed with suicidal ideation, so my ex cut off my ability to see our son even though i was gettin help and taking medication\n\nLong story: my ex(fiancée at the time), was telling me on a weekly basis that if things didn’t change she was gonna leave me.\nI have to agree on one point, I wasn’t a very good fiancé over all. She was a stay at home mom and student, and i worked a 2-2-3, 12-hour nightshift position. So I wasn’t home much, and the time i was home, which she was always crabby during it due to not being a morning person, had to be spent properly dividing sleep, time with her, and time with our son. It basically went to the point where I didn’t help around the house as much as i should have, really only helping to take care of our son. I did however, start working on it, and thought i was getting better at, albeit, a bit slow.\nIt would lead to arguments on a regular basis, and i would get angry to the point where i need to walk away and cool off, or I might say or do something I would regret. Needless to say, she didn’t like me walking away and would push me till I got loud enough the neighbors could probably hear. Then i would just go outside to calm down and she would go to the bedroom and cry, or the bathroom and cut. When i had calmed down i would come back in and try to make things right, but she wouldn’t want to talk about it.\nOne weekend she went with some friends to celebrate one of their birthdays. I let her have the weekend to herself to calm down and enjoy herself. While i watched our son and worked on getting the house cleaned some. Well, not talking to her that weekend was the last straw. And rather than call me or message me to ask why I wasn’t talking to her, she came back that Monday morning, Sep. 10th, and broke up with me.\nWe agreed that i would have our son on my days off and she would have him when i worked. 7 days each every two weeks.\nFast forward a week or two and she is dating the guy who’s birthday she celebrated. And I’m getting more and more depressed, mostly due to how little i got to see our son. I ended up having to go to the hospital for it and they gave me medications and i set up and appointment to start seeing a therapist. We agreed while i tested the medication out that i would be supervised with our son. But in a two an a half week period, i only saw him for 5 hours, and only saw him because i kept asking her when she would make time for me to see him. However she did let me have him unsupervised again on Oct. 31st and Nov. 1st.\nThinking we were going back to the schedule we had agreed upon when we broke up, i got ready to pick him up the next time i had off. Then, less than an hour before i would have gone to pick him up, my ex completely cut me off from being able to see him. Saying that if I didn’t stop being depressed, then I wouldn’t get to see him anymore.\nI tried to get help from the police to convince her to let me have him, but since we were never married, which never happened because she didn’t want to sign the marriage certificate until she was done with school, she got full custody, and they wouldn’t lift a finger. Except to tell me she had full custody and to convince me I shouldn’t be upset about it, it’s the law and all.\nWell, not seeing my son was pushing me further and further into my depression, and mixed with medication that apparently wasn’t helping, but rather harming me, i went manic. Not thinking I tried to bargain my life for time with our son.\nI ended up going back to the hospital for a month. When the courts finally considered me safe and able to go back home, the first thing she said to my siblings after she found out i was back, knowing full well I wouldn’t be back if I wasn’t better, was that I’m not allowed to see our son because it’s not safe. I can’t confront her about it due to a restraining order she put on me after i went to the hospital.\nA month went by and she finally let me see him once on Jan. 1st, because she thought it would be good for me and him, as she told my sister. I haven’t seen him since, and have no signs of seeing him again despite it going well.",

      "description": "I [24M] was dating this girl [21F] for about a month. Things were going well, fun dates, cuddles at her place, making out, nothing under the clothes yet.\n\nLast I saw her was Saturday. Sunday, while texting, she reveals to me that she's been having a bad time with something that happened that day (don't hold your breath, I never found out what it was). I cheer her up what I can over text and then go about my business. We have dates planned for Tuesday and Wednesday nights.\n\nTuesday rolls along and the furnace stops working at my place (I live with my mom) and this is Canada, so it's already fucking kill yourself weather outside. Mom calls the repair guy, but she's working till 9PM so I have to stick around and chaperone the guy after work (I work 9-5). I call my date up and cancel, she sounds disappointed but not overly upset.\n\nToday (Wednesday) rolls around and everything's quiet on the Western Front. Until my oldest friend [24M], who I will always trust without question and who's known this girl a lot longer than I have, calls me up. He says something along the lines of \"what she's been dealing with is worse than you think and cancelling last night was a bad idea.\" Now, I try to remain a level headed person but i suffer from social anxiety and have a tendency to worry spiral, so, this sets me off just a bit. I text her noting she's been quieter over text (and she has) and asking if everything is alright. She admits things have been really hard on her. I ask if she's still down to hang, she says yeah, around 6.\n\nCome 5 I go home to let my dog out (a 30 minute drive from downtown, where she lives). When I get in I find she texted me shortly after I left work asking if I wanted to hang now. I didn't check because lol texting and driving. This is the last text I get from her till much later.\n\nSo, I hustle back to her place, sent her probably 3 texts and called with no answer. Arrive, knock on her door, her roommate answers, says she's not home. Send her another text asking where she is. I'm still getting more and more worried about this, but I fuck off to the river for a bit. Decide to give my friend a call and tell him everything that happened. He asks me to go back and let him talk to the roommate. Under normal circumstances I would have questioned this but I'm super far gone by this point (I've had a friend kill themself after talking to me, so I'm super sensitive to trouble of my peers). So, I go back, that chat between the two of them happens. And I decide to go home after that and cool off.\n\nThen I get a text from my lady friend saying she just wants to be left alone right now. I say sure, give me a text if you need (across about 3 messages). I get to a different, nearby friend's house and find she's cussing me out for checking on her roommate twice and says we're through. I tried telling her I was just worried about her but she wasn't having it and told me to get lost. Up until this point I'm still worried sick about her so, this hits me about as hard as the launch of the Titanic.\n\nI'm not going to talk to her again regardless of what happens and I probably already know the answer to this but AITA, Reddit?",

      "description": "I have been friends with this girl since high school. We were in each other’s weddings. She was always very competitive and somewhat toxic to me, but I put up with her a lot before because she didn’t have many friends.\n\nAbout 3 years ago, I made the decision to start slowly phasing her out of my life. Then, she got pregnant accidentally a year later. She had previously thought she couldn’t have kids, so she never bothered with BC. She was married and wanted kids, but this pregnancy was very unplanned.\n\nI reached out to her and tried to help her get excited. We also talked through some of her feelings of guilt over her finally getting pregnant unexpectedly when she struggled for so long with the idea that she never would conceive at all. I also told her about my husband and I struggling to conceive. We talked about the baby names we both had picked out for a boy and a girl, and she said she was still deciding on a name, but she had a short list and told me what they were. She said when she decided on a name, she would keep it a secret until the child was born.\n\n6 months later, she has a baby. And uses the name I had picked out for a boy. My husband and I still had not conceived. She ended up telling a mutual friend “yeah, OP gave me the idea for the name, but I don’t think she will mind because she probably will never get pregnant anyway.”\n\nAll her toxicity came flooding back to me. I would have been completely fine if she had even just told me that “I really like the name you said and I would like to use it.” But I was blindsided. It was about her doing something hurtful because I would never get to experience naming a baby anyway.\n\nI blocked her on everything. She tried to make contact a few times, but it was obvious I wanted nothing to do with her.\n\nIt’s been over a year, and I now have a child of my own. I think about this friend a lot. Sometimes I feel like she deserved to know the reason why I no longer want anything to do with her. But I also think that telling her wouldn’t have done any good. The proper time to confront her would have been right when I found out about what she said, but she was also very freshly postpartum, and I didn’t want her to deal with that while getting to know her new baby. I know that ghosting can be immature, but I feel that I didn’t have much of an option. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This spring break my mom was gonna take me and my brother 4 hours south to Zion national park and escalate and stuff (that won’t make much sense if you don’t live in Utah or don’t go there a lot but basically we were gonna go to a bunch of state parks and monuments) and my mom told me we could only go down to Zion for 3 days and 2 nights because she wanted to be careful of her budget as she’s getting divorced and I respected that. \n\nToday I found out she’s in Escalante right now, in an expensive hotel. Our trip is next week and my mom just out of the blue planned a trip to Escalante and is staying in a Marriott. After she told me we couldn’t even stay an extra day in the crappy 3 star hotel we booked when she’s in the same exact place, in a Marriott suite for the weekend. Now I’m kinda pissed I think it might be understandable especially if you know my mom, but I questioned her about it cause like duh I was super confused and she blew me off essentially and when I asked why she was in Escalante she acted like I had never talked about wanting to go their when I explicitly stated it, and she said that she went cause we weren’t which is still just so frustrating because trump recently opened the whole Escalante staircase for fracking and drilling and I wanted to see it before if and when it’s basically decimated, and I find out we can’t even go at all, even though she’s there, right now, in a far superior hotel and has been since Saturday, which is almost double the trip we already planned for next week. \n\nI feel like I should also mention that my family is well off in a sense and my mom travels a lot, not for work, for fun, and I haven’t been on vacation since my sister who is 8 years older than me had her senior trip which was really fun and I’m very thankful for the experience but in that time my mom who likes to tel me I can’t get an extra pair of clothes because she’s on a budget but will buy a 3k ticket to Italy in the summer and dozens of tickets to Mexico to fucking kite surf. \n\nSo I kinda lost my shit a little bit and I yelled at her, I explained basically what I just did but much much more angry and all she said was passive aggressive remarks about things she knows I’m very very sensitive about and that I can’t control like my anxiety or depression or the fact that I choose to do this school year online. So I just want to know, AITA for getting mad at her for this and kinda losing my shit ",

      "description": "Okay so I use this app where you can buy and sell things from people. I found an item I was interested in &amp; the lady responded and told me I could come pick them up. \n\nI picked them up &amp; as I’m pulling onto her street she messages me and says, “I’m deaf by the way but I communicate very well”. Instantly I got excited because I’m involved largely in the deaf community &amp; am fluent in American Sign Language. \nI get to her house and we instantly strike up conversation. She is mostly deaf but has slight hearing in her right ear with a hearing aid. She tells me she has no friends &amp; she’s so lonely. I’m quick to give her my number and tell her we can be friends. She hugs me and bursts into tears. Left her house and called my mom to tell her because I was so excited. \n\nA few days go by and she’s texting me, a lot. If I don’t respond within 10 minutes, she’ll send another text. And another. And then she’ll call. I told her gently, if I don’t answer Its not because I’m ignoring you, I’m just busy and will get back to you when I can. She seemed super understanding. A few hours later we are back at square one. \n\nFast forward to this evening. She begged me to go shopping with her and I felt really bad because I’d been so busy. I basically chauffeured her around. She offered to by dinner and I obliged. She waved the check in my face at the end to make sure I saw the price, “I got it. But you owe me big time.” \n“What’s up?”\n“I don’t know but I’ll think of something”\n(May I also mentioned she commented on how many carbs I was eating. Maybe that’s minor but my pregnant hormonal ass definitely was agitated)\nWe went to another store where she told me I could park in handicap spot because she has the placard. I had forgotten at the next store about the sticker and she said, “park in a handicap spot, duh. Are you stupid?” \n\nWe went to the last store where she offered to buy me something. I told her it was okay, that I’d buy it. She told me it was fine, she insisted. And I dropped it. As we walked up to the counter she said, “you know what? Fine. If you’re so insistent you can buy it” \n\nI had to call my mother in law while I was with her and she kept saying “tell her you’re with a awesome friend” but my mother in law was telling me about how her tumor came back non cancerous but that she’d still need surgery. It wasn’t exactly good timing. When I hung up without saying it she told me that I was being rude and asked why I was ashamed of her. \n\nI think she may be on the autism spectrum scale as she missed quite a few social cues and puns, but I’m not sure. \n\nAnyway, I was very polite and tolerant but I’d literally rather get eaten by sharks than ever hang out with her again. And I don’t have it in me to explain to her why this isn’t going to work when I know she’s going to be abrasive and rude. So I’m going to ghost her. Does that make me an asshole? She *did* buy me dinner. \n\nTL;DR befriended a lonely women who turned out to be kind of an ass. I’m going to ghost her to avoid conflict and her attitude. ",

      "description": "So I live on the third floor. I often leave my window open so that just a screen separates my house from the outside. Partially for the A/C, partially so my cats can feel the outdoors. Recently, I think a new family moved in nearby. For the last two weeks, three little kids have been running up and down the corridors, hitting and yelling about who knows what. One day, they saw my cats in the window. I made the terrible decision to let them pet my cats, and now they stop and talk to me every day at my window. It doesn't matter what I'm doing: watching tv, playing video games, emailing, doing the dishes, they stop to talk to me through the screen. Then, today, I eat a handful of crackers and this kid peeks in and says \"WHATCHA EATING\" and keeps asking me again and again and again. I wait until he finally leaves and I go to close the window. I feel bad because my cats like to feel the outside but I am starting to feel like a fish in a bowl in my own apartment. I just want to close the blinds and hide but I feel like an asshole for hiding from three elementary kids. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "'m in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend of over a year; we usually skype at night because we are both busy and its the only time we have during the day. Last night she was having a rough day, she didn't sleep well, felt sick, and had tons of work to do. The call was normal until I suggested that she go home for the weekend since she wasn't feeling great. She told me I made a good point and proceeded to call her mom in the middle of our call. She left her headphones plugged in her laptop and didn't mention my presence at all in the call. I thought this was rude, so I made a face at her, and she made one back thinking I was joking. Then her mom starts asking about her day and passes the phone to her dad. The call lasted 7-10 minutes in total. \n\nAs soon as she finished, I told her that I didn't appreciate her calling her parents in the middle of our call, especially since I had homework to do. She immediately started crying, and I comforted her for the next half an hour until her roommate got back and the call ended. She then texted me that I shouldn't have yelled at her and I ruined her night, and she was sitting on the floor in her bathroom crying. She said, \"I'm sorry I wasted 7 minutes of your time.\" and that I yelled at her. She also said it was especially bad because she already felt sad. \n\nI think it is rude for her to interrupt our call by calling her parents. She has expressed before that I should point out things I am do not want her to do when it happens before as well. I feel like my reasoning is justified and she blew it out of proportion.\n\ntldr: gf calls parents in the middle of call then cries when I tell her its rude. ",

      "description": "For a bit of context, I have a very intense mental illness that effects a lot of my life, a lot of it revolves around germs. I’m in therapy and have been for a long time. \n\nMy husband and I got married three years ago and we have a young child. I work sometimes late into the evening and insomnia means I can be awake a lot later than my husband. \n\nI was having a cigarette outside and noticed that there was a small mushroom growing on the windowsill to the bedroom where my husband and I sleep. This sounds ridiculous but that kind of thing horribly agitates my illness and I panicked. I sat outside the bedroom door, hyperventilating for about an hour before I finally brought myself to sleep on the sofa. I was convinced it was releasing some kind of spore that would kill anyone in the bedroom, but at the same time the therapy I’ve had made me realise that wasn’t real at all. It’s a horrible stupid phobia, one of many, but I calmed myself down and managed to get to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, when my husband asked why I’d slept on the sofa, I answered honestly and he was furious with me. He yelled for a straight half an hour the next morning. His reasoning was that if I was convinced there was something dangerous in the bedroom, not waking him up was unforgivable. \n\nI tried to explain that I knew it was irrational and he’d be angry if I woke him up for nothing. I can calm myself down, it just takes time. I felt like he knew this, but he hasn’t talked to me for two days. He’s just gotten up from bed, gotten ready and then left without a word. \n\nThis was an unusually large overreaction from me, usually I can keep it under wraps but there are certain things that will set me off. I’m so convinced in the moment that there’s danger but there’s a part of me that knows there’s not. I don’t know, if my partner thought there was danger and he didn’t help me out of the house I’d be angry which blurs the lines, but I don’t know whether or not to apologise or to stand my ground. \n\nHe does know about this illness and has known since before we started dating. I’ve had attacks in front of him and he’s been nothing but supportive. \n\nI hope this doesn’t sound stupid because my head is everywhere but AITA?\n ",

      "description": " \n\n**Background**\n\nThere is a woman I work with that has always rubbed me the wrong way. I will call her 'Karen'. A couple examples: The first week she started at our company we were walking out of a meeting and she yelled at me down the hall \"You've got all the men at 'company name' wrapped around your finger!\" Later when I was promoted to a VP role she came to my office and asked me 'How did you do it?\". Nothing horrible but it was constant. She would always have something to say under her breath when no one was around for me to prove it. Or she would say things in a way that bringing it up to anyone would make me sounds dramatic.\n\nIt's been a year of this, I guess I could even call it bullying. She was eventually promoted (because it's literally only me she does this to that I know of and otherwise she is a great employee as far as I can tell) and began hiring employees for her department. I gave her a wide berth and just tried to stay out of her way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recently**\n\nOne of her hires was a woman over our marketing. I will call her 'Sharon'. She's a really nice lady that didn't appear to operate with office politics in mind. Part of the reason I felt this way was because despite who she reported to (Karen who was constantly trying to pull me down and get those around her to side with her) she started to nurture a friendship with me. It was nice to have a coworker I could be myself around. So one evening 6 weeks ago we went to dinner together and both got tipsy. She began to vent about her boss Karen so I vented about my struggles with Karen too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Yesterday**\n\nMy boss and our HR person sat me down to explain that Karen came to them crying last week about the things I said about her to Sharon over dinner 6 weeks ago. (To be clear I said things like \"She's a hard worker but kind of immature\" and \"I just feel like she's kind of emotionally manipulative.\") I'm also told that Sharon is upset. \n\nI've been asked to apologize to both Karen and Sharon. And of course I will because I can see the part I played in this. I guess there is this part of me that feels frustrated and I genuinely can't pin point why. I can see why I was wrong to vent to Karen's direct report. And at the same time I feel a betrayed since she was the one that initiated the conversation in the first place and then waited so long to reveal it to Karen.\n\nIt happened 6 weeks ago and Sharon told Karen last week? Or did Sharon tell Karen right after it happened and Karen only chose now to reveal it to my boss? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither way- Am I the asshole? ",

I have made my opinions very clear to them but they don't seem to listen to me. (I do realize that pregnancy is something that can't just be magically cancelled)\n\nMy father has had several relationships, one of them which lasted for a long time and was really bad, leaving me a little skeptical when it comes to new spouses. I feel that I'm still not used to this new girlfriend and don't really like her. She is nice, cooks well and tries to help me, but there are times when our views clash or she annoys me. It has gotten so bad that I can barely control my rage. I have never had any kind of anger controlling issues, but suddenly these kind of things have started to appear.\n\nMy father tends to favor my brother a little whenever he comes over. He likes to play games with him and overall spends time with him, while I don't get that kind of attention. I'm scared that as the baby comes, I will no longer get any attention and that I will be kind of kicked out of the family (feeling like an outsider, as all three of them are a family when I'm from an earlier marriage.)\n\nThe thing that annoys me the I most about this is that they never tried to plan this with us children. I'm aware that these kind of things can't really be planned, but feel like some kind of before-hand discussion would have been necessary. I also feel like this is all happening too fast and with everything else that has changed along with this new girlfriend it is too much for me. I have tried talking to a psychologist but feel like it isn't helping. Moving over to my mom's place is not a choice, as I would have to change my school.\n\nAm I just an asshole who should shut up because as a child, I have no say in matters like these?\n\n\nTd;lr: Will be having a new stepsibling who will be 17 younger than me. Can't really get along with the mother and feel like I will be left without attention.",

I said fine but it's getting beyond a joke as son actually wants a relationship with his dad,  especially since its coming up for Christmas. \nNow,  son has asked if he can send a card to ex so I ask the address,  and ask if he will get one in return. \n\nI know his financial situation,  he makes a decent wage,  lives rent and utility free with his mother yet he says he can't afford to. \n\nArgument ensues and I have said that all I asked is if he can at least send the boy a damn card for the first time since he was born and I've had him,  his mother and now his sister calling me selfish etc. \n\nAITA because right now I bloody feel like one. \n\nTl;Dr,  asked sons dad if he can send a Christmas card for the first time in 7 years,  got called a selfish gold digging bitch and told to go fuck myself.

      "description": "(I'm married with kids, live across town, usually on good terms with parents) My mom and I had an argument last weekend. It's hard to give all the backstory without turning this into a novel, but LSS, my mom got really defensive for me calling her and asking (in an admittedly somewhat accusatory tone) if she was telling stuff to people in the family, because an out-of-state cousin mentioned knowing something about me and it for all the world looked like she was blabbing her mouth to everybody. It's important to note that she DOES have a history of blabbing, but she'll deny this to the grave. So I was at least partially justified in assuming it was her who told my cousin. She denied it and got really defensive as I said, finishing with the flounce of \"I would NEEEEEVER say that, We're NOT the \\[u/chewbubbIegumkickass's in-laws\\]!\" To understand, we've had several rough patches with my in-laws, involving a lot of drama and backbiting and gossiping. This was a really low blow, because we had told my mom what was going on with that family in confidence, and to throw it back in my face as a means to win an argument was really shady and petty, I thought. And then she hung up on me, which she's never done before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was pissed and texted her and yelled a bit, then I told my husband what she said and HE got pissed and text-yelled at her too, telling her to get off her high horse. Which he's never done, he's always been the favorite soft-spoken son in law, so now mom really knows she done fucked up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on I got a few guilt-trip texts from my dad, and some sanctimonious \"let he who is without sin cast the first stone\" crap. I called him out on enabling his wife's bad behavior, and told him we both were waiting from an apology from her, and I wasn't going to let him be her messenger boy. No answer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to a week later today, I'm at home with my two youngest kids, and  I heard a knock on my door, and my parents are BOTH on my front porch. Now I am 100% not against an open civil discourse between us all to reach an understanding and put this all behind us. But NOT when they drop by my own home unannounced, when they know my husband won't be home so they can pounce on me when I'm outnumbered. Nah, son. I'm not playing that game.\n\nSo I didn't answer the door! I took my boy into the back of the house in his bedroom and we played Legos. I let them knock until they gave up. If they want to call and set up a time to come over and talk when my husband can be home to give his own voice to the conversation, fine. But I felt like them swooping down to gang up on me unannounced was totally inappropriate. Was I the asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She quickly told me that since she is also plus-sized, she was great at angles and editing that would flatter or hide the areas I was insecure about. I was so relieved, because I loved her work. We hired her the same day.   \n\n\nWe paid our photographer for 6 hours which included get ready, first look, ceremony, traditional, and dinner pictures which just included a toast and cake cutting. Our contract stated that our package included 300 edited images. It also states that the photos will be delivered within two months, but she has up to 90 days to deliver.  Totally fine. My only request was for ONE image that wasn't watermarked so we could send out announcements. She happily agreed.   \n\n\nWhen we booked her for our wedding, our package also included an engagement shoot. It was beautiful. The pics were delivered later than the stated time in the contract, but at this point they were so beautiful, I didn't care. I loved them so much, I booked her for our Christmas photos. She sent me a couple of photos with no watermark so I could send out Christmas cards, but I didn't get our album of 40 photos until February.  I was pretty upset about it, but at that point, I had already paid her in full for our whole wedding.   \n\n\nThe wedding came and went, and it was beautiful. I got a few watermarked sneak peaks, and I was super excited to get the rest. I few weeks later, I contacted her about the image without the watermark so I could send out announcements. She told me she would have to edit it. She never sent it. I left it alone, because at point, it had been 6ish weeks since the wedding, and I was supposed to have them within 60 days. The 60 day mark passed and I didn't hear from her, so I sent her a message asking for an update, and she told me that they weren't ready yet.   \n\n\nI received my pictures today after two and a half months. The sneak peaks that were watermarked were not in the album.  I received a total of 152 photos. Several of which were the same photo, just one in color, and one in black in white. If you include the sneaks which I don't have yet, I've received about 160 photos. And they are not good AT ALL. They are horribly unflattering, crooked, off centered, and she didn't even edit out things like a pimple on my husband's face. Very basic things. Some of them are so unflattering, I don't even feel comfortable showing other people. They're so bad they brought me to tears. And it's even worse because I only have HALF of the pictures I was promised to pick from.   \n\n\nAITA for sending her an email and telling her how unhappy I am? I don't want to be rude or mean, but I'm just at a loss. ",

      "description": "This has actually happened twice in the last month, and I'm discovering that this is becoming a pet peeve of mine.\n\nLast night I went to dinner with my wife and my 12 year old son, and we were sitting at a hi-top table next to the bar.  There was a couple at the bar, probably about my age (mid-40's), and after a few minutes, I noticed they couldn't keep their hands off each other.  They weren't making out or anything like that, but just constant stroking, petting, and nuzzling (no feeling-up or crotch rubbing from what I could tell).  I found myself feeling oddly distracted and uncomfortable. Initially it was funny, but the longer we were at the restaurant, irritation and annoyance started to set in, and I wanted to get the hell out of there as fast as possible.\n\nI don't have a particular aversion to PDA, and my wife and are affectionate to each other (not nearly to that extent), but I tried to explore reasons in my mind why it began to bother me so much.  It's not like I was envious of how I perceived their relationship, because I'm just not wired that way.  I think the only thing I could come up with is that we were in somewhat close proximity to them, and it felt like their overt intimacy in a public setting was invading my personal space.  Like if I was on a plane, and the couple next to me started going at it, I'd feel like I need to be further away to give them privacy. \n\nJust to note, I didn't say a word about it, much less ask them to stop.  I mentioned it to my wife on the way home and she thought it was funny that it bothered me.  It just made me wonder why this random couple getting so touchy in public struck a nerve with me.  Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Okay backstory: I work at a small independent grocery store. Employees don't get discounts but do get everything that's left at the bakery at the end of the day. I have a coworker that I like a lot but I noticed that he started stealing a while ago. At first it was just small stuff like veggies so I pretended that I didn't see it. Anyway: my boss (one of the sweetest old guys you'll ever meet) trusts my coworker and me enough to leave us in the store on our own. We don't have camera security as well. Anyway: the stealing coworker is a pal of mine. But since our boss isn't around anymore he started stealing more and more stuff. He basically steals his entire grocery list plus luxury goods like alcohol. I noticed he drinks during shifts too as I found emptied beer bottles in places where he's been before. I caught him several times sneaking stuff to his car through the backdoor. When confronting him he'll just tell me that he'll go ahead and pay for it later but he never does. I also talked to him about the day drinking but he just shrugs it off. He always says that he's been a construction worker before and that day drinking was totally normal there. I know his fiancée and him very well and I also know that he doesn't have any money problems that would force him to steal his groceries. He's just lazy and wants to save money that way. He also has a second job that my boss doesn't know about. Because we're friends he doesn't take me seriously when I tell him that his actions will have consequences. Frankly, he just doesn't think I'd snitch on him. \n\nI'm in a conflicted situation here. He's a pal but our store struggles enough already with big chain stores stealing our customers with their lower prices. Plus, I can't stand my boss being taken advantage of like that. If he loses his job because of me I'd feel bad naturally but on the other hand I think that he's on a dangerous road since stealing seems to become a habit for him. AITA if I snitch on him? ",

We’ve talked multiple times and neither of us want anyone there when she does go into labor. She doesn’t want people in and out of the room and I won’t be in the mood to play 20 questions every 5 minutes. So we have agreed on no one around until after the baby comes. \nMy wife spent most of the last 2 days in the hospital because of blood pressure issues. I only told one person, my uncle, and only because we had plans this morning that I ended up canceling because of the issues. He ended up running into my mom at the grocery and bringing this up to her. So my mom calls me and gives me the 3rd degree and tells me how her granddaughter needs her there during labor etc etc. Then my mom starts calling the hospitals until she finds my wife and does the same to her. IMO that’s borderline insanity and making the birth of OUR child about her. AITA?\n\nTL:DR I think my mom wants to make my child’s birth about her and the wife and I aren’t interested in having people around since it’ll already be stressful enough. ",

Am I?\n\nI won't reveal my race or the race of people I want to date because I feel it is irrelevant and will only bias people, but if anyone asks or if it turns out that information is necessary, I will provide it.\n\nI recently revealed to one of my friend groups that I only want to date people of a certain race, and it has become a shitbag. A girl, let's call her Steph, jokingly pointed out that I only seem to date people of this race in our group chat the other day. I agreed and said that I only ever find those people attractive, and immediately all hell broke loose. It was like I told some of these girls choked their dog or something ffs. Some of them started hurling abuse immediately. The most vocal people said I should find people of all races equally beautiful, and if I don't, I am basically saying that some races are lesser than others, making me a racist, a bigot, and a raging asshole (their words).\n\nI disagree. I just don't find people of other races, *even my own,* sexually attractive. I respect people of all races as people, I am friends with them, I do not think lesser of them at all. But I just don't want to date anyone besides the race I am attracted to. I even brought up the fact that I don't find my own race attractive, but all I got in response was that what I think of my own race doesn't matter, the problem is what I think of other races. I even brought up that people who only want to date within their race are therefore racist in their definition of racism, but they shot it down with the same argument they used for my other point.\n\nI've probably burned all bridges with a chunk of this friend group, but I don't care. I think they got angry for no reason, and not everyone in the group chat had a problem with it. A few friends even defended me, saying I had the right to date who I wanted. The rest didn't care and didn't get involved.\n\nHowever, since it actually caused such a huge shitshow, I'm starting to doubt myself a little. If it wasn't a problem, I don't think that many people would have gotten offended. I wanted to know Reddit's opinion. AITA for feeling this way?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So we (entire household) have been sick for the past two weeks and, as luck would have it, I am the last to get over it.  The wife and kid have been feeling better for the past two days.\n\nLast night I got literally 20 minutes of sleep (between 6 and 6:22 am) because the illness kept me up all night.  Tonight the wife was going on about how she's looking forward to finally getting a good night's rest.  That kind of irked me because I'm still sick and running on *20 minutes* of sleep.  Work was miserable today.  I work in IT so was able to do it remotely...but so busy there was NO CHANCE for even a lunch break.\n\nAnyway, night rolls around and we all settle in for bed.  I read the kid a story and put em down.  I get nice and medicated (cough syrup, cough drop etc) and around 11:30 I start to hear fussing from the kids room.  I get up to check and the kid was just \"sleepy fussy\" groping for their stuffed animal.  Easy fix.  Walk back to bed and the wife is all \"oh, baby woke up?  Thanks for getting it\".  Amazing how my medicated butt heard it but hers didn't hear squat.\n\nAnother 20 minutes roll by and now the kid is starting to fuss.  I look over and she is **clearly** not asleep and just \"fake sleeping\".  I've slept with her enough to know when she's put or not.  Plus she snores like a band saw.  At this point the meds are hitting me full force but...I can't just ignore the kid man, that's a dick move IMO.\n\nI get up to attend to the baby and half way to the room decide I'm done.  I have work tomorrow and she doesn't.  I'm sick, she's not.  The kid is full blown awake and I scoop the kid up, and walk into our bedroom.\n\nWife instantly pops up (weird considering she's supposed to be asleep and \"can't hear the crying\"), I hand the kid over, take my pillow and crash on the couch.  She then proceeds to handle the situation but after the kid is back asleep comes and chews me out for waking her and how she \"can't even get a night's sleep\".  Meanwhile I'm trying to focus as the meds hit me combined with the only 20 minutes sleep in the past 24 hours.\n\nAITA for waking the wife up to handle this or should I have just handled it?\n\nI'm just too exhausted to stay on to read replies, but need to know if I fucked up as I'm sure there'll be hell to pay tomorrow and don't know if it's legit or not.  Catch you guys in th a.m.",

      "description": "tl;dr so basically, about oct 2018, i'm scrolling on instagram and i see an account that hella people i know are following. she goes to another local high school, has about 1500 followers but is following double that number. i see her bio and there is already a huge no-no. her bio reads: \"ugly stupid kid\" and \"i'm ugly so no one likes me\" and her captions had some of the most bullshit i've ever heard \"when i look at you, you barf, but when you look at me, i smile so much\" and you could just tell if you read them yourself that she's looking for attention. so being someone who is recovering from depression i go to confront her. i don't have direct access to her account as she has now blocked me, but here's how the conversation went:\n\nme: hey, i noticed something, your account constantly talks about how you're \"ugly and stupid\" but when you're in public you try to verbally abuse them as much as you can, even though they haven't done anything? we all know you're faking depression. you act as though, you're dying. \n\ngirl: i'm not but thanks\n\nme: what do you mean, you're not faking depression? i can read you like a book. the lies are in bold and black, underlined. \n\ngirl: fuck off. you don't know what it feels like to be depressed\n\nme: actually, i do. and, i know you don't, because your school insists on hospitalized mental treatment from their counselors, and i have a family member who works there. we have never seen your name enter, and there is no hospital nearby for another 60 mins. \n\ngirl: stop lying *blocks me*\n\n\nso, i came up with a backup plan: i had a friend, who was also male, follow the same girl, and start direct messaging her. if there's one thing that her instagram profile says, it's that she desperately wants a boyfriend. so, after a lot of convincing and fake compliments, she took the bait. we, along with 5 other people (who all have been previously hospitalized for depression) ratted her out for obliviously lying about having depression. so, i wanna know, AITA, if she actually had depression?\n\ntl;dr- girl trying to emphasize the fact that she's ugly, stupid, has depression, when her depression is an oblivious lie. i go to tell her to stop, since there are people with actual depression. get friend to contact her via instagram, she takes the bait because she desperately wants a boyfriend, 7 people yell at her for faking depression and taking it seriously. AITA in case she actually had depression? (i have had depression before, i am aware of what it does to the human body)\n\nedit: i understand everything you guys have to say, just wanted to clip this to it",

So I thought I could start off simple with a low entry level job. \n\n\nWhen getting to this interview I had been coached by the agency and had decent attire.

This is not real experience\" \n\n\nMe: \"It might not be relevant for dishwashing but I am competent enough to clean a dish\"\n\nHim: \"I have applicants with THIS much experience\" and he gestures with his hand a thick shape to suggest a large resume. \n\n\nMe:\" I guess we are done here then\" \n\nAnd I just get up and leave. it didn't seem like he was really going to consider me and I felt insulted.

      "title": "AITA for resenting my flatmate over a stupid mistake?",
      "description": "I've had a kitten for a couple of months now and she is mainly an indoor only cat. She is incredibly curious so will try to run out the door and explore if you give her half the chance.\n\nFor new years I stayed over at a friend's house (don't drink and drive!). I told my flatmate I was going to be away for the night, but the kitten had everything she needed (food, water, litter etc) so he didn't need to do anything - just FYI. I do everything for the cat, but I did check with my flatmates before getting her that they were OK with having a pet in the house. \n\nAnyway around 4pm the next day as I'm driving back he messaged to say he hasn't seen the cat all day. When I got home and asked about it he said he hadnt seen her since the night before but didn't think he let her out because he only left the door open 'for a second' to put out beer bottles - but she may have slipped past him since she is so curious. I just left and started looking for the cat. I was pretty furious, because there is only one way she could have got out, and that was by her getting out when he opened the back door. It just seemed disingenuous to deny letting her out but saying 'maybe it was possible' to cover his bases. I figured it was better to walk away then say something snarky when I was stressed, tired and pissed off.\n\nAnyway this led to hours of searching, hitting up all the local social media, contacting the neighbours etc etc. Also ended up being a massive downer/distraction for the last night I had with my family from overseas because we were all so worried about her. I managed to find her just as it was getting dark on my last hunt through the neighbourhood climbing fences etc. \n\nThen it turned out she had been attacked by another cat while she was locked out all night. Her scratches got infected and led to giant cysts, a huge open wound that will take weeks to heal, multiple vet visits and $150 vet bill. The flatmate blamed it on the breed of cat as it was 'prone to happen'. Haven't found anything on the Internet to back that up and the vet didn't say it was a breed specific thing so....\n\nI know the kitten is my pet, and my responsibility, and stress and vet bills come as part of the package. I just feel resentful that his mistake (he was probably drunk) has taken up hours of my time, caused stress and inconvenience, cost a significant amount of money and caused serious harm to my beloved pet. He hasn't apologised because he 'may or may not have' done it and I'm not really sure how I can get over it and not let it become a simmering resentment? \n\nAm I being an asshole for holding a grudge? Any suggestions on how to move on given he is not likely to take responsibility or apologise? Maaaaybe it is possible she got out some other way, but all our windows are very high and hard to get out of - if there was another way for her to get out she would be doing it all the time. So maybe it's a 1% chance she got out some other way - so you have to give benefit of the doubt right? But my feelings don't feel that way. It feels like he just isn't owning up to it. \n\nTLDR: 99% sure the flatmate locked my kitten outside all night on new years eve. This lead to the kitten getting a somewhat serious injury and to me wasting a fair amount of time, energy, stress and money finding the cat again and getting treatment. He hasn't taken responsibility or apologised for it. AITA for resenting him? Any suggestions on how to move on since I won't get an apology?\n\n\n",

      "description": "Yesterday I was at a restaurant I already went to 5 or 6 times and while going to my table to sit, I unwillingly kicked a table and spilled a full cocktail glass that was on it. I profusely apologies, and help clean up on with napkins (the server did most of the work but it was more \"symbolic\") . The client whose glass I spilled (let's call her C) just looked at me with a killer stare and did not say a word. She then asked the server to get another cocktail so I moved on and got seated.\n\nLong story short, when C left the restaurant she stopped at my table and the conversation went like this: \n\nC: \"I paid my bill but let the cocktail for you to pay as I will have to pay for the dry-cleaning\"\n\nMe: \"I do not like this way of doing things. I would have been okay to pay but this way of imposing it to me is not okay\"\n\nC: \"You should have offered to pay for it\"\n\nMe: \"Well, given how you reacted when I apologized and did not stuttered a word despite my multiple apologies, I wasn't going to chit chat with you\"\n\nFollow back and forth arguments which ended by me saying: \"Well I do not want to waste my time talking to you, for a cocktail so bye\"\n\nAfter that C left the restaurant.\n\nComes the time for our bill and obviously the cocktail was added to it.\n\n I refused to pay it saying that: \n\n1. It was not normal that this had been added without my consent\n2. In any other restaurant they would have offered to make a new cocktail free of charge \n\nThe server told me that:\n\n1. I never apologized to C when I spilled the drink\n2. She thought C was right and it was for me to pay\n3. That someone had to pay for it and that it was not her\n\nAnyway, I told her to move away and go wait other tables because I hadn't anything to say to her anymore. So I paid my bill minus the cocktail and left.\n\nSo, AITA ?",

(I didn’t want to tell my parents the truth because they’re already not okay with us living together and I wanted to avoid a fight).\n\nSo yesterday we were doing Christmas with my extended family and the plans for today came up. My boyfriend then was asking everyone “are you going tomorrow?” And “I’ll see y’all tomorrow!” When I asked him on the way home if he was really going to go he said sure he’d tag along.\n\nNow comes this morning. We wake up and I ask him if he’s still coming and he says no. I got upset and said that I had gotten him out of it but by telling my family last night he was coming and backing out Christmas Eve morning it’s going to make things difficult for me to explain. \n\nAm I an asshole for telling him he now needs to come today because of what he told my family?

We don’t spend much time together, but I like them.\n\nMy dad works at a casino and usually I go with him on Saturday so I’m in a work environment and I can get some schoolwork done. It’s nice to get alone time with my dad, and usually we are there the whole day. However, whenever we go I feel incredibly awkward because of all the things he does for me and says to me. He will say things about how I’m his favorite and how he does things for me that he doesn’t do for the other 2, which makes me feel bad, but I go along with it because I don’t mind the free stuff.\n\n\nI think it started to cross the line when I came back and he had bought me a PS4, to keep in the office. I wouldn’t mind, but he has explicitly stated multiple times he doesn’t want any of my brothers to go with him to work, and when they want to go he makes up an excuse. He also does little things like bring me money for lunch if he’s going to be out. I haven’t told him anything because I really like getting the extra money and food, but I feel guilty. It’s little things but lately I have been feeling really spoiled, and I know he has his reasons, but I’m still very awkward about it. \n\n\nAITA? ",

I was lucky enough to be born in a very nice and rich family who will have no problem paying for my college, no matter what school I go to.  This is relevant because it’s about money.\n\nAnyways, I enjoy public speaking. I am on the forensics (speech and debate) at my high school. I recently won a partial scholarship to any college from my speech work through winning a competition. I’ve put lots of hard work and time and effort into my public speaking, and I was really proud of myself!\n\nHowever, a few of my friends said I should pass up the scholarship because other people need it more then me. At the risk of sounding like a rich asshat, I feel like I should take it since I got it through my hard work.\n\nSo, what do I do?",

I didnt really like it at first and every time I was about to shave she'd ask me not to, that she thought the scruff looked cute and all that, so i kept it. Ya know gf liked it even if i felt like a hobo so it was worth it ya know? \n\nAnd last night when i came over, she kept staring at me, more specifically my face. I asked her what was wrong she told me that it looked \"kinda ugly in person\". 😑 \n(We haven't gotten to see each other in 2 weeks because of busy schedules, so shes only seen pictures through snapchat)\n\nNot gonna lie i was a bit salty, so over snapchat tonight she asked me if i shaved it. i told her \"no, actually im thinking about keeping it, i kinda like it now.\"\nI asked her why she asked, if she thought i looked ugly now because of it, and she said \"no its fine just wondering.\" \nAlthough i could tell it bothered her alittle.\n\nI know i was just a bit salty and all that, and tbf for her she hasn't seen it in person until yesterday, and everyones entitled to thier own opinion on what looks good or not, including my friends and family who told me from day 1 it looked ugly and i should shave it...but i put up with it ya know? Cause the girl liked it and i didnt care much about it. \n\nLeast i thought she woulda liked it lol, \nAnd not gonna lie it has started to grow on me and all that, sorta in the spirit of no shave November and stuff i was thinkin about keeping it, letting it grow out even more. \nBut am i the asshole if still deep down i know its somewhat out of spite i wanna keep it? \nOut of spite for continuously asking me to keep it and then turning around and asking me to shave? \nIt may have been just the way she said it made me feel it was a but rude i guess haha ",

      "description": "     Let me preface this by saying, I’m posting this here because I openly admit I am close to clueless when it comes to “Doing right by family” or knowing what you owe family. Since 15 I was mostly by myself, and before that I didn’t really stay with any one person long enough to really grasp the concept of “family”.\n\nAnyway, as an adult I reconnected with some. Most of this meant they got in contact with me, we exchanged details, maybe talk once or twice a month. One of the family members I got in contact with was a brother.\n\nNow, I try my best not to judge people, but the dude is close to 30 and still living with his parents. Does not help my mother pay any bills, deadbeat alcoholic, all that good stuff. This is important in my context of things.\n\nI had an old car that tbh I just wanted to get rid of. Absolutely nothing was wrong with it. It had a decent amount of mileage, but it was a safe bet it was good for many more (It was a Honda). I shopped it around to fellow friends, coworkers, school mates, and found a guy willing to buy it for 2500. Had the money up front. Okay, nice, told him I’ll get to him on it.\n\nThen my brother got ahold of me and, before saying hello or anything of the like, began a long winded story about his truck not working and he needs another car and blah blah all that stuff. I told him 2500. He immediately turned sour and began to lecture me on how to shop things better , and how I’ll never sell it for that much. I told him I had a buyer, for exactly that much. Attitude changed completely. Practically begged for a reduced price. I caved and gave him a deal of 1750. He then said “can I just give you 200 and pay the rest in payments “ and I said no. I’ll take payments but I’m not gonna struggle with making sure you pay over that long of a time period. I said it more nicely, but that’s the gist.\n\nSo, I got 1000. Literally the next day he crashed the car and totaled it. Came crying (literally) about how he needs that money back or he won’t make it and he doesn’t know what to do. I said I am not giving him the whole 1000 back. That’s ridiculous. He then said “Well it’s kinda your fault! You sold it to me and it had pretty bad brakes “ and I just said “No it didn’t”. Which is true, I took great care of the car. He stood in silence for a little bit and literally threw the grown man version of a temper tantrum. He hit one of my shelves that I held very rare, and very expensive vinyl records in. One fell on the floor and he stomped on it, attempting to break it. I did not assault him, but I did firmly escort him off my property and said not to come back. I can’t help him with the money.\n\nNext day, my mother calls me and says I did wrong, and I could of gave him the money back. Is it really necessary to owe someone something simply under the fact that we have a little of the same DNA?",

      "description": "I'll make sure to add a TLDR at the bottom.   \n\n\nMe and my family have a complicated history. Specifically my mother. In the past, she used to taunt and tease me to the point of me breaking down in depressive fits. I've discussed with her multiple times that I'd like for this to stop and she's explained she'll try. I appreciate her trying but I feel as though she don't put in her efforts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Saturday, I went to my grandmother's house to get my hair permed. It was supposed to be a quick event which turned into an all nighter. Me, my grandmother, my mother, my various cousins, my uncle and auntie were all sitting in the living room watching tv via cast from my mother's phone when one of my cousins started demanding we look at \"baby pictures\". Baby pictures usually means old embarrassing pictures. The first picture up was Me! During my blunderyears. I tried to scroll off of it myself but found out she had five of the same picture. My family was laughing hysterically when I asked her \"why did she have those pictures?\" She didn't really answer, just retorting, \"why not? It's *my* phone.\" I was humiliated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to block out my family's laughter by listening to music but that didn't work so I stepped outside and called a friend, explaining how I felt hurt by my mother's actions to use me first for the humiliation. The only thing separating me from my family was the glass door, everyone could still see me and slightly hear me. I know what I said in anger was probably not justified but I was really hurt. I said things like she only aims to hurt me, she doesn't care about *my*  problems, things just from a place of hurt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we got in the car, I asked my mom why did she show me first and why does she constantly try to embarrass me to the family? She explained she didn't see it as embarrassing or humiliating, instead she just started from the top of her photos which so happens to be me. She explained that my words did hurt her and that she does try not to put me on the spot by saying rude things anymore. I felt really guilty, feeling as though my clouded self esteem saw what it wanted when she was genuinely trying to have a good time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- My mom showed my embarrassing pictures to the family and I made her feel bad by venting to a friend.   \n\n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Later on I talked about crushes and love stuff way too much when my friends rarely talked about that stuff so it was awkward. My friends told me to tone down the relationship stuff and I took it badly, I was really distraught. \n\nI have to say that everyone was super supportive of me especially all of my friends but I was really afraid of rejection. Being told to tone it down felt like a rejection, so  with them I went back in the closet. I say again that they were super supportive and encouraged me to talk about my romantic life when the time was appropriate. After the talk I just felt really ashamed and embarrassed so never talked about relationships. I've been dating a great guy for almost 6 years and we're getting married! My guy friends know this only because social media (they like almost all of my happy relationship posts- the pictures are usually really funny).\n\n Social media is the only way they know my bf and I feel like they might not even want to come? They haven't met him ever, what if they don't like him? On the other hand they support my relationship at least online and I really wish they would come?\n\nI am thinking to not invite them because it isn't like it would matter to them and the plan is to make the wedding really gay, they will be uncomfortable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hey Reddit, I'm pretty 50/50 on this and not sure where I should go from here, so input on my potential asshole-ness is very much appreciated :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo long story short, back in 2017 I had been dating this guy for a while and things were going pretty well. We lived together and used a joint account to pay bills where we would each put in half the amount needed. It became pretty obvious that his car was on its last legs and he needed a new one. His credit was frankly awful, but we were 22 at the time so that was to be expected. The smart thing to do would have been to get a clunker for a couple grand. He didn't want to and ended up getting a loan for 15k for a used car. I was stupid and agreed to co-sign because my credit is actually pretty good and things were going well at the time. Only the dealership was a little shady. They rushed through the paperwork and it turned out that I was not co-signing, but co-borrowing. Basically, the car is in my name primarily. So at this point we have a joint bank account and he is driving a car that's under my SSN, but he's making all payments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a year to 2018 and things end very badly, to put it nicely. We don't talk anymore because he has called me numerous times both drunk and sober yelling, called me a bitch, threatened to sue (for what IDK because I never got served), and said that \"I should run away if I ever see him in public.\" Cool. I was angry and a little afraid so I did nothing. Now I'm past that, but the bank account and the car still exist. He uses the account frequently and I have full access to it. I check it monthly to track his car payments because I don't want a delinquency on my report.  However, I don't want the liability of either the account or the car in my name. But I do know that, in the case of the car at least, I agreed to be responsible for it. So Reddit, WIBTA if I asked him to close out the account and use his own and refinance the car under his own name?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(FWIW, the loan is 7 years (\\~5 remaining with 7.something% interest so refinancing would really be in his best interest anyway. Not sure if that helps my case here or not)",

      "description": "\nKinda of a long read, so I’ll post a TL;DR. \n\nSo this happened about a day ago and I’m still kinda feeling weird about it. \n\nSo my friend came over to my place to hang out for a bit, but after awhile he started complaining that his stomach was hurting at about 9pm Saturday night. I asked him if he were alright and he said he was, but that he had stomach cramps, but he chalked it up to having gas. I gave him a soda to help settle his stomach and he said he was feeling alright. \n\n Well flash forward about 3 hours and he’s writhing all on the bed saying how awful he felt. Then suddenly he sat up, made a bee-line to my bathroom and start puking and simultaneously shitting everywhere (in the toilet). After this goes on for well over an hour (as well as the abdominal pain), I tell him it’s probably best that I take him to the emergency clinic. Before hopping in the car, I make sure to grab a grocery bag and some paper towels. Well in my haste and worrying about what was coming out the front end, I forgot about what was coming out the back end. \n\nYou can probably guess what’s going to happen next; I heard him starting to get ready to puke again and reminded him that he had a bag with him, but he said he also had to shit really bad as well. Before I could even react he’s letting loose at both ends. I can’t really do much as I’m driving, besides give him a comforting word or two. Well once we arrive at the clinic, I put the car in park, run around to his side to help him get out and walk him in. Once the nurses see him starting to puke again, they automatically start helping him and they bring him in the back. Once he is taken, I go tell one of the nurses I’m going to go park my car in the garage and that I’ll be right back. \n\nWell after getting him started on an IV drip, putting him in a hospital gown (he soiled both his pants and threw up on his shirt), answering some questions, and sending away a sample for a lab culture it was determined that he had a bad case of food poisoning. The doctor put him on some antibiotics and fluids and he started feeling better pretty soon. He called his girlfriend to let her know what was going on, what was happening and to come to the hospital. He told me to go home (it was about 7am at this point) and get some sleep since his girlfriend was on the way and he was feeling better. I told him I’d call him later on in the day and left. Well I got to my car pretty exhausted only to be greeted with the most horrific thing I had ever smelled/seen in my life. \n\nIt was awful. Like top 3 worst smells I have ever smelled in my life. I couldn’t see it before because it was so dark, but my God it was awful in the light. There were chunks of vomit all over the passenger dashboard, the door and some on the floor as well. But the thing that almost made me puke, was the soupy, liquid human shit puddle on the fabric seat. I completely forgot he shit himself in my car while I was driving. While escorting him into the ER, and while my adrenaline was pumping, I didn’t notice the shit flowing down from his ass, onto his legs and probably onto the floor (he was wearing basketball shorts while this was all occurring). I don’t know how I didn’t notice the smell when I was parking the car, but I must have attributed it to just the residuals of him having just been in the car and thought it would go away. \n\nWell after 4 hours of it marinating in still air, it created the most pungent and putrid smell ever. I was completely disgusted. Like it took every ounce in me not to throw up everywhere. I couldn’t stand the smell for more than 10 seconds let alone an entire 15 minute car ride home. I was stuck. So I decided to call one of my other friends and fill him in on the situation and ask for a ride. After laughing hysterically for a few minutes and not believing it could be *THAT BAD* I told him he was more than lucky to come on down and see (and smell) for himself. He finally made it down and after showing him the shit-show, he dry heaved for a solid 5 minutes. \n\nHe took me home and I finally was able to sleep. After a 4 hour nap, I texted my friend to check on him and see how he was feeling; hearing that he was fine, I now had to figure out what to do about my now un-drivable car. I found a business in my city that did car interior detail cleaning, and called to let them know what happened. After getting a price estimate and being reassured that they could clean it, no problem, I got an Uber back to the parking garage. I bought one of those face masks that painters use and some Vick’s Vapo Rub. After putting both on, I opened my car door. The smell was still awful, but not nearly as bad with the added equipment. I opened all the car windows and drove to the shop. I must have looked like a complete lunatic but I could’ve cared less. \n\nAfter the longest drive of my entire life,  consisting of trying not to take too deep of breaths and trying not to gag, I finally made it to the car cleaners. I parked, hopped out the car and talked to the guy in the front who I spoke with  on the phone and he asked to see my car. I showed him and he tried not make a face or anything, but I could tell he was totally grossed out. He kept his professionalism and said it would take about a day to clean. I got another ride home, and then kept getting updates from my friend about how he was getting discharged and going home to rest. \n\nThe next day I go to pick up my car and pay the bill. Well apparently I didn’t let them know the full extent of “damage” to the inside of my car and my estimate for a $150-$200 clean up, quickly sky-rocketed to $550. I was floored. I called my dad, told him the situation and he agreed to split it with me and sent me the other half of the money. I paid the bill, got in my smell-less car and drove home pretty upset. I debated on whether or not I should tell my friend what happened, but decided to let him know.\n\nHis response, “Damn. That sucks man.” That’s it. No, ‘Hey sorry man. Let me pay for at least half’, not even a ‘sorry’. I’m pretty upset at the moment. Had he not had explosive diarrhea in my passenger seat I wouldn’t be out $275 right now. I know he wasn’t feeling well and it wasn’t his fault, but it also was kind of his fault and I feel like he should maybe pay for it. \n\nSo finally, AITA for wanting him to at least give me half of the money to cover the cleaning costs after he shit/threw up in my car? \n\nTL;DR: My friend started getting stomach pains at my house. After said stomach pains became shitting/throwing up nonstop for an hour, I took him to an emergency clinic in my car. On the ride there, he threw up and shit all over the passenger side. Took my car to an interior car cleaner because it was un-drivable otherwise and they charged me $550. Told friend and he didn’t even say ‘sorry’. AITA for wanting him to give me half the money for having to get my car professionally cleaned? \n",

      "description": "Note: a bit of a long story, but if you would take a minute to read it and help me, I wouls appreciate it immensely. \n\nCreated a reddit oaccount just to ask this as it's been bothering me for hours now and I cannot go on with my day properly without having a conclusion to it.\nSo. I have an amazing friend (she is kind, caring, compassionate, empathetic and everything else you can ask for in a friend), and we've been through a lot. Both of us had our share of problems and we would do our best to fix each other's. Sometimes it didn't work, but mostly we would part ways thanking each other for helping, and this is when I feel amazing. In any case, I will refer to her as Vienna for this story. \nFor a bit of backstory: she is in a relationship with my good friend and classmate, who I will call Andrew for the time being. He is a great guy and I believe he really cares about her and truly loves her, but he has a habit of getting angry at League when they play together. I would go on, but it isn't relevant to the story besides the fact that he can get loud and swear. When this happens and I am in voice chat with them, I tend to stay silent and analyze both of their arguments and make a decision on who is right based on my limited knowledge of the game. Also, this way I make arguments with which I support the one who I believe is right in the end (it's mostly her as he often overreacts to simple mishaps and gets toxic while playing).\nAnyhow. Today I felt absolutely awful. I have had trust issues ever since elementary school, so I don't open up to many people. It just so happened that I ''lost'' a person who I was about to open up to (we had a fight and I now deem them untrustworthy). Additionaly, today I remembered many of my past mistakes and regrets (which happens fairly often), but today it was worse than usual, as I remembered too many things at once, and I wanted to scream. I'm not going to go into too much detail as I don't want the whole story to get depressing and I don't want people with similar demons to mine to get negative emotions because of this. I simply felt miserable to the point where I was shivering and repedeatly saying 'Im sorry' to memories of the many people I have failed in the past.\nI tried to shrug it all off and distract myself with playing some games, and thankfully Andrew accepted to play with me. So I put my best ''I'm fine'' voice and both him and Vienna seem to buy into it (much to my relief). We play for about 20 minutes and I feel a slight bit better. Not even close to okay, but don't feel like apologizing to shadows as much anymore.\nAll the sudden, Vienna starts screaming that her graphic tablet is lagging and that touch doesn't work correctly. She is a graphic designer and artist and she often does commisions for other people. What I think was wrong with the tablet is that it had a cracked screen and it was pulling everything to the crack thinking the user is tapping that spot. I don't know much about them, but this is what I think was wrong with it. In any case, I mutter ''try giving it a second.'' as I can't muster up anything better at the moment. I was in a state where I couldn't help myself, and talk about someone else. She disregards my attempt at support and screams even louder that it doesn't work that way and that she was doing an important commision and that she couldn't work like that.\nNow, I would usually take a few hours of my time to calm her down and cheer her up afterwards. I wanted to do so here as well, but I just couldn't. I never felt that bad where I couldn't even give someone the cliche ''It' s going to be okay.'' but words simply wouldn't leave my mouth. I was done eith everything and told her to let me know when she is calm, and disconnected from the voice chat. This shook me up and I felt helpless.\nNot a minute later, Andrew messages me saying that she left and that he wants me to come back. I wanted to say no, but I needed to be with people to distract myself. I go back in voice and he seems unfazed, continuing the game. I agreed to this as I just wanted the day to end. But of course it wouldn't.\nLiterally 10 seconds in I get messages from Vienna accusing me of being on his side and never leaving voice when he is angry, but when she does, I ''dramatically leave\". I try explaining to her my condition for the day and that I would do the same if it was him who screamed. She isn't having any of it. She reminds me hoe she cared about me for the past few days (which she did) and that she is pissed thst I'm not giving back. She also tells me that my ''advice'' wasn't support at all.\nAt this point, I am seriously done and I am happy to read the message where she announces that she is leaving. Offline status appears and I'm pretty sure she put it on herself for added effect, but I don't care.\nAfter thinking back to this for a few hours, I am lost as to the question of why I didn't help her. I hate myself for not being a friend, and that she is mad because of me more than the twblet itself. If it was now, I would do things differently and would support her fully, but alas, it is over for now.\n\nI would say I am the asshole, but I don't trust my own judgement right now and I need an outside perspective on the whole situation. So please, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "First time poster on reddit. I’m on mobile so I apologize for the formatting. Also, long story but I will try to keep it down.  \n\nBackstory: I am a 23 yo female. My husband and I have been together for 8 years, he is 25. Back when I was a Sophomore in high school, I was diagnosed with OCD, Depression, and Anxiety. I do not currently take medication but have improved over the years. We currently live in a 3 story home. We have 3 bathrooms in the house, one on each floor. The bathrooms on the first and third floor have been out of use due to a plumbing issue. \n\nSo today we had a family friend come over to fix the issue. Family friend fixed the issue but left toilet water all over the basement floor. \n\nGerms and bacteria are my downfall when it comes to my OCD. My husband is very aware of this and has seen me go into hysterics over filth. \n\nMy husband was out of the house running errands while I cleaned the top two floors as the family friend walked his toilet water shoes all over the house. I finished cleaning the top two floors and my husband got home soon after. \n\nH will be husband and M will be me. \n\nH: Hey, are you going to the store soon? I have to drop off an envelope in the dropbox unless you’re going out and you can do it? \n\nM: Well I have to go out but I haven’t had a chance to clean the basement. I was on my hands and knees cleaning the top two floors. I’ll drop it off at the dropbox if you wanna clean up the basement.\n\nH: Nevermind. I’ll go to the dropbox. \n\nSo he left. I realized that we didn’t have any gloves and I definitely wanted gloves for how dirty the basement was. I closed the basement door and waited until he got home so I could go to the store. He gets home and the conversation went as follows. \n\nH: I’m gonna do laundry right now. \n\nM: Well you can’t go downstairs. I realized we don’t have gloves but i’ll go to the store and clean the basement so you can do laundry after I get back. \n\nH: You told me you were going to clean the basement while I was gone. That’s you’re fault. I have to do 4 loads of laundry. \n\nM: I didn’t have gloves. Just wait until I come back and I’ll clean it. You can’t go downstairs or you’ll dirty the top floors again and I already cleaned them. \n\nMy husband then proceeded to go up to the third floor and walk down to the basement with a load of laundry in his hand. He took the shoes he went to the basement with and walked all over each floor of the house. I was FURIOUS. I left without saying anything to him and went to target to get gloves and some other things.\n\nI came back and cleaned each floor again even more thoroughly than I did the first time. My husband was upstairs and I went up the stairs and proceeded to ask him for the shoes on his feet while he sat at his computer. I told him I needed to clean them because I recleaned the entire house and I didn’t want him to dirty it again. I will admit that I did call him a pig and that his actions made me have to reclean as I told him to give me his shoes. So he refused to hand over his shoes for the two seconds it would have taken me to clean the bottoms with antibacterial wipes. I asked a few more times and he again refused until I apologized for the pig comment. \n\nM: If you don’t give me your shoes and you walk anywhere other than your current position, I am leaving. \n\nSo he did. He walked all over the floor again with those disgusting shoes. I was in a blind rage. I got a bag from my closet and started shoving my clothes, toothbrush, etc in the bag. While I’m gathering my things from our room on the third floor he is following me asking me where I’m going. I was silent and went downstairs to the main floor to get some shower things and again he walked downstairs. I walked out the door bag in hand and drove away. \n\nI am now currently sitting in the Starbucks parking lot writing this. I have called my mother who thinks I’m overreacting and my best friend who said she’d be pissed too. I need to know from you guys. Am I the asshole for leaving? He knows how I feel about germs and I don’t want to step foot back into that house right now because I will have to clean it for a third time. My husband is fully aware of my OCD and how clean the house should be and normally makes my life easier as he is a bit of a neat freak as well.",

      "description": "WARNING: Pretty long \nSo I have been friends with Becky* (changed name) from all through high school and right up until the summer before my sophomore year of college. I always felt insecure around her because she was always talking shit about everyone, including people I thought she liked. Calling someone fat (I’m on the bigger/a little overweight side) and they were not even fat IMO. Or always talking about how she gained/lost somewhere between 5-10 pounds (it’s normal for teenagers weight to fluctuate this much). She also was slightly spoiled and I don’t think she meant to rub it in my face, but that’s how it came off. My mom was unemployed/in between jobs during HS. I didn’t get my first iPhone until the very end of my senior year as a graduation/18th birthday present and it wasn’t even brand new, it was a refurbished one from Amazon. Becky always had a new phone, like ALWAYS. She went through 2-3 a year. Or her mom or grandma took her shopping and would buy her all these nice clothes and shoes. Or her grandma wants to take her to Paris (she never went, but always talked about it). A lot of my insecurities I feel like she targeted. But we were “twins” because we kinda looked alike and best friends and we did everything together. Around my sophomore year of HS, she started dating my brother’s (Jay*) best friend (Dan*). She met Dan at a football game we attended and she was attached to him ever since. Dan lived down the street from me and when they started dating Becky was pretty much inviting herself over all the time to see Dan. Eventually she didn’t talk to any of her friends including me. For Dan. She was on and off with him, and of course when she was off she’d come crying back to me. I could only do this so many times. The summer before my sophomore year of college, she had to live at my house for a couple weeks because her mom kicked her out and she was broken up with Dan at the time. I was employed but I wasn’t getting paid until right before I was going back to school. And she was unemployed. I was driving all around town for interviews and bank stuff and eventually she found a job 30 minutes away. I was driving her back and forth all the time and she and I both don’t have gas money. And any money I got from tips she would pressure me to buy weed so we could smoke. Also during this time she mentioned to me that dan had hit her (she has visible bruising on her legs) Finally I got back to school, she found a friend to live with but eventually went back to Dan because her friend’s mom was making her pay rent. Fast forward to about October, I’m getting unknown calls, not answering them. Becky texts me saying it’s the police, they’re calling about Jay (my brother). She said the cops had called her first, asking Becky if she was Jay’s sister and she said no. The cops saying they found him at the park drinking beers and smoking cigarettes (jay is only 17 w no state id , Dan 18 and Becky 19) asked me to verify his address and stuff. He lied about his address, we have both parents in our lives happily married and he lied and said he didn’t have a dad, didn’t even give his full name. So I told the cop that none of that was true basically. He told me that Jay could go to jail for lying. After I got off the phone with the cop, I called my mom and told her what happened and told her the cop was at the neighborhood park. My brother was gone at this point but my mom still showed up to talk to the cop. After my mom talked to the cop, she told me that the cop said Becky and Dan were BOTH at the park with Jay when this happened. Now I’m PISSED at Becky because she didn’t tell me the truth and my brother almost went to jail. I have ghosted her since then and all she does is make passive aggressive posts on twitter about me. I feel betrayed because I let her live with me and she lied to me about an altercation with the cops that included my brother. AITA? \n\nTldr; AITA for ghosting my friend after she’s been a bad friend to me, lied to me and lived with me and took advantage? ",

      "description": "TL;DR: Friend took a photo I didn't want circulating. Wrestled him to get his phone and delete the photo. In the process, his phone microphone stopped working. AITA?\n\nBefore we get started, two pieces of pertinent background: \n\n1. I'm in college and last year when I was showering, one of my friends (Mark for the story) took my clothes in the communal bathroom and would only give them back when I shouted, \"I DO BUTT STUFF WITH MEN.\" (I'm a heterosexual male.) He recorded it and sent it in a ton of groupchats, repeatedly played it in coffee shops, and was generally obnoxious with it.\n\n2. I have really bad hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), so once a week, I have to use a very strong antiperspirant before I go to bed. It stains stuff really badly and has left dark smudges on my sheets. It's annoying, but I don't mind them, even though they look like cum stains.\n\nFast forward to Friday night. Mark comes down to my room and we're just chatting like normal. He spots the stains on my bedsheet and asks if they're jizz stains. I tell him they aren't, but he took a photo of them. I knew it was going to be a repeat of the \"I DO BUTT STUFF WITH MEN\" episode, so I launched at him to delete the photo (Wrestling isn't entirely out of the ordinary for us.) After about ten minutes of wrestling, I got him to unlock his phone and I deleted it. His phone took a couple hard hits, but nothing ridiculous and we thought nothing of it.\n\nToday, Mark told me his phone microphone isn't working anymore and he wants me to pay for a new one. I was busy when he told me about it, so I said I'd be happy to discuss it this evening when I had time. We were in class together today and before it started he kept saying \"kidneystoneslayer broke my phone\" over and over really loudly, despite my telling him to cut it out and handle it like an adult. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "This problem has been ongoing for years. It's driving me crazy. As simply as I can put it, my birth mother had me when she was 17 and I was adopted by my grandmother in a closed adoption. This makes my grandmother my legal mom, and my birth mother my legal sister. This \"family secret\" isn't much of a secret to anyone except me I suppose, since even my nephew/brother was told by his father that this was the case. Apparently, my legal mom swore my birth mom to secrecy.\n\nSo, I've been trying to figure out more about my origins and where I came from. Every time I bring it up, it makes both moms mad. Which makes me mad and we end up bickering. I've been told that I'm selfish, and \"You have no right to know, because they \\[birth parents\\] have their rights, too.\" So I ended up thinking on it, and I realize that this could be an incredibly touchy subject for them. It's possible my birth father wasn't a nice person, it's possible that he traumatized my birth mother, and I can understand that they wouldn't want to talk about that sort of thing. Because of this, I've been trying to think of ways to find out about this man and my birth without either mom finding out (which seems impossible since it's a closed adoption, but w/e). I'm practically obsessed at this point, and I think about it all the time. I'm almost 27 years old.\n\nAITA for going behind their backs to find someone who they could be protecting me/themselves from and thinking it's unfair that they won't just tell me about it? I know I'm being selfish and that I should be able to because it's my life, but this could affect them, too, so it's not just my life involved anymore. And for all I know he could not know about me... or he knows about me and doesn't want anything to do with me. This is not a validation post because I honestly can't decide if I'm in the wrong or not because of how delicate this all is.",

I was trying to let her know how it felt or trying to see if this behavior was OK, or if this was normal. She said this does not make her reflective, it just is terrible communication. My take is her terrible communication started the whole thing. She said she should be allowed to make mistakes. I said how can this be considered a mistake when you never acknowledged or apologized for your behavior? It spiraled out of control and turned into a huge argument.\nTL:DR She stood me up for dinner and did not acknowledge or apologize.

      "description": "This happened less than an hour ago. My dad is currently on a hunting trip for the week. His girlfriend (I'll call her LG for leech girlfriend) and her son (FA for fat a**) are home. I live in a different house on the same property (basically in my dad's backyard). \n\nLG called me to do some shopping for her. She broke her hip 7 months ago and refuses to do the physical therapy and rehab to be mobile again. I walk into the house to get her list and money and was horrified. The kitchen was disgusting. Food and trash all over the floor, sink overflowing with dishes, good and open food containers covering every inch of counter space. There was dog urine on the floor all over the house. Flies are taking over. The smell was nauseating. He's only been gone for 5 days and won't return for another 4 days. My dad keeps a very clean house without the help of LG or FA while he works a full time job.\n\nI took pictures while LG was in her bedroom (she never actually leaves the bedroom tbh). When I left to go to the store, I called my dad. I told him I didn't mean to stress him out while he's on vacation and I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble, but LG and FA are destroying the house. I just didn't want him to be blind sided when he got home or wondering why his house is suddenly becoming infested with flies and roaches. He curtly said I did stress him out and let me go.\n\nI feel horrible now because I feel like I ruined his vacation. If it was me, I'd want to know what's going on while I'm not home. Even if they clean it before he gets home, which I seriously s doubt, that won't take care of the smell and the bugs. I don't know if he's mad at me for telling him while he's away our mad at them for what they did. He was clearly mad either way. Am I the as whole?",

      "description": "For context this person used to be one of my best friends. We were roommates for awhile and he was a great buddy. \n\nHe had been dating this girl for over 4 years when this first started happening. I was away for school and hasn't seen him I awhile, and when I returned for a visit he told me.\n\nHe had cheated on his girlfriend with another woman multiple times. This woman happened to be married to someone his girlfriend knew. He ended up getting this married woman pregnant, and he and her split the cost for an abortion. He then basically cut contact with the woman and his girlfriend has absolutely no clue that any of this has happened.\n\nThis guy is friends with most of my friends. They all like him better than me. Him, his girlfriend, my other friends etc. are all part of one big friendship circle. When he told me this story I got angry with him, told him we weren't coop anymore, and basically don't speak to him anymore. \n\nI told one friend about this story and he agrees it's fucked up but he told me not to tell anyone. Neither of us have seen this guy around anymore but we've seen his girlfriend once and it's clear they are still together and that she has no idea.\n\nI feel like telling the truth would be like dropping a nuke in this entire circle of friends, especially since it has been almost a year since he told me this story.

      "description": "Petty, but judging petty issues is what makes this sub great.\n\nI’m at the airport, which has rows of seats for passengers who are waiting at each gate (as airports typically do).Each row is four seats, with lots of available rows scattered about.\n\nWhen I first sat down at a seat fairly far from and facing away from the gate (so, not hot real estate gate-wise), I was fairly early and so put my backpack on my seat next to me.  Gradually the seats around me begin to fill up, including a woman who places her bag on the seat next to my bag and then sits in the next seat over (so, the row is lady, her bag, my bag, me).  \n\nI’m looking down at my phone, but see a lady approach in my peripheral vision who stands in front of me  and asks in a sort of pissy/huffy voice,\n\n“Can you put your bag on the floor, please?  So I can have a seat?”\n\nI look up and see:\n\n- the lady next to me with her bag on the seat, not being asked to move her bag\n- several other people with bags on seats, not being asked to move their bags\n-several other empty seats without bags in them (maybe four or five, all perfectly empty).\n\nFor whatever reason this made me incredibly annoyed (likely due to a pet peeve I have where I feel like something about being a pleasant-looking woman means I’m often asked to move or accommodate - for example, if I’m in a line of several people and someone wants to cut through, I’m INEVITABLY the one they ask to squeeze past).  So, I picked up my bag and moved both myself and my bag to another nearby and perfectly available seat.  Mainly because I worried if I had to continue to sit next to this woman, I might say something rude/express my annoyance (and no one wants to argue in an airport, they’re annoying enough).\n\nSo, now I’m sitting in my new seat, stewing in petty annoyance.

      "title": "AITA for buying my own wedding suit?",
      "description": "Hello All\n\nFirst time poster on here so sorry if I've gotten something wrong and sorry it's a bit long. This happened around a week ago and I'm trying to gauge whether I'm in the wrong or not or how I should proceed.\n\nI'll start off by saying; I love my mum, though I don't agree with everything she has done and some decisions she always put me and my little brother first no matter what and I have a lot of respect for her. 4 years ago I met someone, long story short we hit it off and got engaged two years later, bought a house etc...\n\nThis year we're getting married in May. My other half has been working hard on getting everything organised for the wedding and we want the day to be a relaxed, calm day that we want. We've been told by many'a people not to listen to anyone else and do what we want to do. Her father is paying for the Venue, Dress and catering which is very expensive. My mum is paying for the band, my stag do, suits for little brother and mum's partner and her partner is paying for the bar, tables and chairs.\n\nNow when we planned the wedding we didn't expect anyone to pay for anything. I have a good job and so does my OH and can easily afford to do this all on our own if needs be. I should stress at no point have we ever asked anyone for money, they have all offered.\n\nSo back onto my mum; For the past two years, she hasn't really got involved or even showed she's wanted to be involved. When we did see her she'd ask us questions about dresses etc.. but never offered to help or anything like that. Which is fine by the way, as I say we don't expect people to help. The OH's parents have done a lot as they had offered, took us to Birmingham and helped us pick our rings, given us advice for the day and just been generally interested.\n\nFor the last 6 months my mum has been going on and on about taking me, my brother and her partner to a day our suit shopping. She wanted to go to Peter Posh which really isn't important to me and when I said I was happy buying a suit from a small standard retailer she kept laughing and saying \"No, you don't want to look like crap on your wedding day\" but it really doesn't bother me what I look like and I'd still look smart just the suit wouldn't be branded. I think it's a waste of money and quite frankly the most important thing to me on the day is to have my OH beside me and we enjoy the day. What kind of suit I'm wearing doesn't phase me in the slightest.\n\nSo I kept re-iterating I'm not bothered about the suit but as my mum is a \"Strong\" character sometimes and will kick off if you disagree with her opinions I was trying to do it in a joking, light hearted kind of way every time I saw her. Mum kept messaging me on Facebook to ask me when I was free, I have a very busy life and job and she can only do weekends so I kept telling her I'll let her know. Three weeks ago myself and my OH went to our local shopping centre to get some bits and bobs for the house when we walked passed a suit shop with \"SALE\" written all over it. Long story short I saw a nice suit at a decent price and bought it.\n\nI informed my mum that I'd just found a suit I liked and after speaking with my OH we decided, as we're going for relaxed casual look, that it would be nice idea instead of matching suits to have OH's brother and father and my brother and mum's partner in a matching Waistcoat instead. This meant it was cheaper for everyone and I didn't really want them matching my exact suit, so this is what I tell my mum.\n\nMy mum then contacts my OH who goes on to tell my mum what we want. Mum isn't happy and says she wants to rent a different suit as it's cheaper to rent one than buy one (It isn't cheaper, to rent the suit my mum was looking at is £140 to buy this waistcoat was £70) it got to the point where my OH gave in and said the suit mum has picked out is fine and to go with that. This still isn't good enough and mum points out that it would have been good if we all spoke about it, that she's been left out and doesn't know what's going on. She ended the conversation to my OH saying \"Do whatever you want\" This really upset my OH and angered her, all this over a choice of suit... I told my OH not to respond and I'll speak with mum when she calms down.\n\nA day later comes and I get a message of my mum, not about the suits but about my dad. My dad is a lovely chap, again made some wrong decisions in my eyes but he does his best. He left my mum when I was 18 and my brother was 12, has always paid maintenance etc... Mum doesn't like him especially when they talk about money. It was also very difficult to get my dad to come to the wedding as he was worried about mum and her side of the family. My dad did an honourable thing and called my mum on the phone to put water under the bridge for our wedding and it worked. My mum had contacting my dad after the fact and explained that my little brother wants to go to university (He's 19) and was asking dad to pay his share. My dad told mum that he doesn't think University is a good path for my little brother (I kind of side with my dad on this one, see too many people leave Uni that struggle to get jobs and have debt hanging over them, but it's not my place to get involved between mum and dad) at the age of 18 my dad could have stopped paying child maintenance and so he messages my mum his opinions about university and that he was going to stop paying maintenance when my little brother turns 19 in March.\n\nMum copies and pastes this message to me, saying \"Look what your dad has done\" it puts me in the middle of them both and I don't want to know. I'm in an awkward position and I choose not to respond to mum because she either wants me to say \"Dad's a dick!\" or I'd tell he my opinion which wouldn't side with mum's when it comes to uni and it's not my place to say anything.\n\nSo anyway 4 days later I think it's time to talk to mum about everything, get it all sorted. I offered to take her out for lunch this weekend so we could talk about the wedding over message and she says she can't as she's showing my little brother around universities over the weekend.. It was 2 Uni's and it's not like she would have been there from midday to midnight. I'm a bit upset she couldn't find an hour for me either Friday night or Saturday/Sunday but what ever. So I say I'll call but again \"No\" she's busy. At this point I'm annoyed, my OH is upset and stressed about the whole thing, my dad now feels awkward and doesn't want to come again and she can't find an hour or two over the weekend to just talk with me.\n\nSo I put everything I wanted to say in a message and sent it her, something I didn't want to but had to do. Here's a link to the messages [https://imgur.com/a/TOIZvBt](https://imgur.com/a/TOIZvBt) I've removed the names of people - I may need to remove this at some point.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Any help would be most appreciated!!",

      "description": "On mobile, sorry for formatting.\n\nFirst time poster.\n\nI don't smoke weed, but I don't care if others do in their own home, on their own time. A couple of times I've gone to a casual friends house and they started smoking in front of me fully knowing that I don't smoke. I realize that it is their house and they can do what they want when they want in their own house and I can leave if I'm that uncomfortable with it. I don't know if this will make any sense, but it just makes me feel weird. It's a combination of 2 things. 1. I feel like they have to be high to hang out or relax or have fun. Like they can't relax and be sober. Or maybe they have to be high to hang out with me. I feel like I'm just way overthinking that part which I do a lot. 2. It makes me feel left out. Like I said I'm not against it, I just have medical issues where I am not comfortable with me doing any type of drug, besides drinking and even that's minimal at best. So I feel like everyone around me is having a good time, high and giggly and stoned and here I am sober as a nun. I just don't know if I should say anything to them, or just deal with it or leave. They would be understanding of course, I just don't want to be THAT person. Y'know? AITA? TIA",

      "description": "Every year our friend plans a ski trip where she pays for a cabin at a ski resort and 6-9 friends come depending on vacation time. \n\nWe are the only friends who have an SUV so we get stuck with 3-6 pairs of skis and snowboards and therefore we have to ride alone as well, while everyone else piles into one or two other cars and have fun. \n\nWe also have to go back to our home state to pick up the equipment (MA-RI) before and after the trip and then keep it in our apartment (1br) and it takes up so much space because we don’t have storage so these things just have to lay across the living room floor. https://i.imgur.com/h3wiJRs.jpg (this is like 1/3 of the stuff).\n\nWhen I was 20 I didn’t care as much but now at 23 where we both work and have to take time out of our schedules to bring stuff back and forth and have this (DIRTY) equipment on our floor I’m just over it. \n\nMy boyfriend thinks I’m being selfish and that it’s the least we could do since one friend pays for the trip but it’s not our trip! We didn’t invite anyone, and no one throws any gas money to say thanks for driving your gas guzzler as well as also driving it back and forth to pick up and drop off the stuff! \n\nI just think it’s so annoying to have to do this as well as have it obstruct and take up space in our 700sqft apartment. \n\nI think they’re being thoughtless and taking advantage of us because they could easily drive one or two more cars (each person has their own car btw) and take their own stuff. They all love to do snow sports in the winter but I think if they like them so much, they should get their own suv or drive their own cars, not use our car at our expense. \n\nTL;DR: friends make us drive their equipment on ski trip and we also have to waste our time picking it up and dropping it off. No one offers gas money or to pick up or drop off our own stuff at our place. Boyfriend thinks I’m selfish. \n\n",

      "description": "For some background, I am a 21 year old Indian male. Currently in a top college in the US because I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship. I come from a very poor and traditional background. My father is a tailor and my mother works as a maid. They worked day and night to send me to an English medium school. I am currently studying aerospace engineering here and love them more than my life. They are high traditional though, and want me to only have an arranged marriage, or at least a marry an Indian girl they like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a deep rooted mindset they have, and since marriage is not even my priority now, I decided to let them be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnytime I had a crush or got infatuated ,I just tried to suppress the urge because it leads to false expectations. All my close friends know of this and I have explained to anyone who asked me out that it would be the best for the both of us if it didn’t happen because I wasn’t ready to go against my parents and didn’t want to play around with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA girl who apparently had deep feelings for me for the past few months gathered the courage to ask me out yesterday. During lunch. With around 100 people around us. Problem is, she was a black person. And as I said, I didn’t want to lead people on.\n\nI very softly tried to put her down saying I wasn’t looking for any relationships now, and that I wished the best for her. I was eating with my buddies, and I got up to take the plate for another round of pizza, and she just started following me, demanding a valid reason. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sort of got nervous when she brought her race up, so she picked up on it and started asking me if it was because she was black, and to be 100% honest with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started giving her an explanation but she just cut me off to tell me to give a yes or no answer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said yes. But as soon as I started to give an explanation I got cut off again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe shouted in the hall and told everyone she got rejected because she was black. Everyone sort of starting shitting on me at that moment, and I left the hall straightaway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently with a couple of my friends right now at my dorm room.... half of them are black. They understand why I did it and do tell me it wasn’t my fault. \n\nReally tenses about what’s going to happen though. There are murmurs that the person I rejected was going to take some action against me. I am also being removed from a couple of clubs from what I know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas I an asshole here? I genuinely don’t know guys, please help me out. Would mean the world to me.",

I had already disliked her for various reasons she is homophobic,very judgmental, and has told my father that he would not have diabetes if he had enough faith.(my father has hereditary diabetes which he got at 8 years old)So one day I was already mad for unrelated reasons but I lashed out at my aunt and said some mean things to her in school of course I got in trouble for this.\n     \n    So later after I was sent home she called my mother and basically told her that she was a horrible mother and should have taught me better. This made my mother cry. And this made me hate my aunt because of this.Neither me or my mother have told anyone else about that call. I avoid my aunt at social gatherings and never want to be around her.I do feel a little bad because she is my aunt but I just can’t forgive her for what she did to the closest person to me in my life.

      "description": "So here's some back story for some context. My mom and adoptive dad were together and had 3 kids before me. They broke up and during their break my mom got pregnant with me. When they got back together they agreed not to tell me and he raised me as one of his own. I didn't know I was adopted by him until I was like 13, but I wasn't mad at all about that. Around that same time he started dating his current girlfriend. Over the past 7 years she has been physically and mentally abusive to my siblings and I. Every time something happens my dad is either on her side or is on no ones side. I've dealt with it for years because I was raised in this dysfunctional family so I thought it was normal. Now I'm 20, I've lived on my own for 2 years and through therapy and an amazing support system I've realized the environment I grew up is not healthy or normal. Over the past few weeks they have done two things to my siblings that has pushed me over the edge\n1.) When one of my older sisters stood up to her and left she and her kids publicly attacked my sister on Facebook for being a recovering meth addict (she's doing very well with her recovery and I'm so proud of her!)  It bothers me because my step mom actively uses meth and xanax, one of my step sisters is 18 and pregnant and still smokes weed, and the other is pregnant and on meth.\n2.) My other older sister just went through a rough break-up and my step mom sent her ex messages claiming to be my sister bragging about all the dudes she was seeing when in reality ever since the break up my sister has been with me every single day depressed as hell. Now my sister has been dragged into drama with her ex and people they know mutually over things she didn't do all because my step mom was bored and wanted to stir the pot\nThese are only two instances of her craziness, she's done a lot worse over the years but these are the most recent. I finally broke down and messaged my dad and told him that I'm tired of her abuse and if he doesn't leave her I don't want any part in their life. He defended her actions because \"she has mental problems and is struggling right now\" and that I should deal with it because he raised me when he didn't have to. I got angry and told him the fact he allows her to do this shows that he doesn't care about us and that I'm better off with no dad rather than a dad who let's people abuse me and my siblings. He tried to make me out to be a piece of shit for not feeling bad for her and not appreciating all he's done for me which is ridiculous because I've told him multiple times throughout the years I was thankful for all he's done for me that he didn't have to. I was done and told him he has no place in my life and blocked him. So reddit, am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "About a year and a half ago, my friend asked me to be in her wedding and I politely declined. She was a good friend but I only saw her 2-3 times a year because we live on opposite sides of LA and both have busy careers. \n\nI said no for 2 reasons:\n1. Financially I cannot keep up with her and her friend group. I am a single mom and though I have a decent income, I still have 2 people living off of it. She lives lives kinda away which equals about $40 in fuel + a $30 meal every time she would have a bridal party get together. Which she wanted 1x/month.\nAdd in the bachelorette party, shower, the dress was $$$, hair, makeup, nails, 3 nights at a fancy SoCal resort, gifts, travel to and from, etc...you get the point. I simply could not afford to sacrifice that much money on an already tight budget.  \n2. I dread all event \"girly\" and always respectfully decline. I have social anxiety for these type of situations and do not do well before or after them. This is also a group that drinks. a lot. and I don't live that lifestyle. \n\nI only told her the 1st reason. \n\nShe was obviously upset, which I understand, but then she wouldn't talk to me for a year. I'd reach out every now and again to say Hi and get no reply. About 3 months ago she called me while at one of these wedding planning parties. She put me on speaker phone and had everyone ask me individually if I would be in the wedding. She even said I could stay in her room at the resort. She said she had been having anxiety that I said no and was affraid to talk to me. Being put on the spot I panicked and said yes. I was suppose to go to the next planning party but it was scheduled for a weekend I was flying out of town to meet family. I text her to let her know as soon as I realized it was the same weekend and never heard back from her. \n\nI feel gross about the whole thing. I don't think it should have ruined a 7 year friendship but she was obviously hurt by it. Am I the Asshole?\n\nTHANKS!",

      "title": "AITA For ignoring my dad over hurt feelings",
      "description": "Okay, so my dad and I don't have the best relationship to begin with due to many reasons. But I won't dive too deep into that. Basically, my parents are divorced and both remarried. I've lived with my mom full time since I was 16 because I couldn't deal with my dad always talking crap about my mom and he just caused a lot of my insecurities. I get along with my step dad perfectly fine and know that my mom will do anything she can for me. My dad on the other hand has always put work before his family. And after meeting his new wife, it has always felt like she came first. \nMy step mom and I have very different outlooks on well, everything. She acts very immature and will throw adult tantrums if she doesn't get her way. Well, we've had our fair share of arguments and I've even told my dad before that it's me or her when I was younger, before they were married. I just hate how she views herself as \"holier than thou\" and puts on such a fake front. \nMoving forward... due to my stepmom being such a pain to deal with, I've told my dad that I'll be friendly during social events, but I don't need to be her friend. I don't see any reason to have a relationship with someone if it's proven time and time again that we just don't \"click\" but I'm willing to put aside our differences and be cordial. \nI feel as though I have every right to a relationship with my dad, but no responsibility to respect or put up with someone simply because she's married to him. \nThis last Thanksgiving I was trying to decide if I would be able to go to their dinner due to scheduling with my moms dinner and hadn't texted him back about it. He then sends me a text saying how he's decided that I shouldn't come over until stepmom and I have worked out our issues. \nI now refuse to text him and didn't even attempt to ask him about Christmas. I was so enraged that he would uninvite his own daughter from a day of celebrating what you're thankful for. I've always seen Thanksgiving as a day when you set aside any family differences and deal with even the worst of your family. \nObviously I don't want to cut him off forever, I'm just really hurt that it feels like I'm not even a valuable part of his life anymore, let alone part of the family. \nGoing to add that he's never able to accept his own fault in situations, the divorce was when I first started realizing that, and he always blames me for not contacting him when he's the parent? I mean, I've told him time and time again that all he needs to do is text me and ask when I'm available and he never does. I'm getting really tired of constantly getting my hopes up that he has started to see things from my point of view only to have him repeatedly prove that he never will. \nSo I have to ask, am I the asshole and overreacting? Should I just get over it and be the bigger person? Or is this a valid response for what he did? ",

      "description": "So I'm in a club where a bunch of people come together every once in a while and play games, competitively and casually. Some of the games get pretty heated, but it's mostly good fun since a lot of the folks are fun to be around and generally everyone has a good time. Even though I'm pretty much a novice and get swatted down every week, I still have a good time and even get some upsets every once in a while. The issue, though, is an old acquaintance that I'll call \"John\". \n\nJohn is a pretty good player. He's also a pretty sore loser in a sea of good sports. Every once in a while during a tournament he'll flip the fuck out and storm out after a loss, even going as far as slamming controllers into garbage bins and not coming back, leaving friends to pull out the controller(s) and hand them back later. Of the extremely few times I've beaten him, he's never taken the L with grace; even during a no-stakes friendly match he made complaints after I beat him once, blaming it on the stage chosen. Compared to other people who may just take a break to cool off or just peacefully leave the club after a bad experience, his reaction is ridiculous IMO. \n\nI play to have fun. I can have fun winning and even have fun losing with good company, but here I'm stuck with a lose / lose. I can play the salty player and either win, causing him to storm out and kinda ruin my mood, or just lose and feel bad about it. It's gotten to the point where I've debated disqualifying myself in a situation I run into him to avoid ruining a good time or simply foregoing the club to try and avoid a negative experience. Now, I can't say John is in a good place here, though. I know he's had issues with his mental health in the past and he skipped out on the club for most of last year simply because he wasn't feeling it, despite still playing the games. I don't really know his situation well enough to know if he's venting because of other things or just having a tantrum, and maybe confronting him over it wouldn't be good for him. It'd be kind of embarrassing and a bit hurtful to have someone bitch you out for how you've been acting if you've been going through a lot.\n\nEven disqualifying myself could be a possible bad move though, considering a lot of this goes down in tournament games. Would it be disrespectful to basically call out another player and refuse to have anything to do with them over something like this? WIBTA for refusing to interact with him because he's taking away from the fun of the event?",

      "description": "My parents are decent people. We live on their property in a different house and pay rent. They made housing possible for us even tho it's not easy on them or us but it does help alot.\n\nThat being said, my parents have some issues: My mother is an alcoholic. While she has been working hard to stay sober, I'm not capable of trusting her entirely. She's been drinking since I was a child so I can't help but feel she'll never actually beat it. My father, on the otherhand, is rather old and has serious memory issues. Then when my mother lapses and drinks, there is a 50/50 chance my father can't tell or denies it happened. \n\nWith them being retired, they have flat out offered to nanny our child so I can return to work full-time. Had any of the other family made this offer, I'd have seriously considered it. With my parents tho, I don't know if I'm willing to risk my child's health even if they essentially offer a solution to all our concerns. Denying this means serious financial ramifications or changes in employment to get by.\n\nWhen this came up in a discussion with my aunt, my mother flat out said that she expected to be the care provider while I worked. I didn't know how to handle it, having been completely thrown off guard, and kind of laughed it off awkwardly and talked about my moral belief of raising my child myself (also 100% true). My mother took offense to me not confirming her statement, but hasn't said anything directly since.\n\nWIBTA for denying this generous offer because of the off chance something happens? Or WIBTA for accepting and taking that chance?",

      "description": "Hi everyone. So I want to start out by saying my aunt is like a second mother to me, she took me in when I was in high school and we have been very close for years now. My cousin, her son, is also like a little brother to me and he is in his last year of high school. My aunt and uncle (the baby daddy, but I will refer to him as an uncle since he has been like a second dad to me too— very successful man who has a good heart) met about 19 years ago at work. He was married to his longtime girlfriend and they had a daughter together who was about 5 at the time. According to him, my aunt and the rest of his family she was a very negative, selfish, toxic person who was more of an enemy than a partner to my uncle. They adopted another child who was a baby and I still to this day don’t really know all the details but apparently she gave back the adopted baby without his approval?? Don’t know. Anyways, according to him that was the last straw and he said his marriage was ruined after that. This all happened right before he met my aunt at work, they had an instant connection that began as friendship and blossomed to a full blown relationship. My aunt knew he was married and had a kid and it didn’t bother her because the relationship felt so real and it sounded like he was on the edge of divorce. Well, she ended up getting pregnant and neither of them were mad or upset. I can only imagine the shit storm that was my uncle telling his wife (yes, they are still married) that he got another woman pregnant and they are actually dating. My aunt and uncle were together a year after my cousin was born (so total of 2 years at the time), but then he went back to his wife, fast forward to 2019 and him and his wife are still married and living together, but according to him they are just married because he doesn’t want her to take all of his money/property and they have a younger son who’s going to middle school soon. He has been telling my aunt for years that he’s going to move in with her: first it was right when she got pregnant, then when his daughter graduated high school, then when my cousin would enter high school to now he doesn’t even know. I’ve spoken to my friends about this and it boggles my mind that no on close to my aunt has said how crazy this is!! She is a very defensive person and it’s pretty scary when she gets mad, so no one wants to step on her toes. ALMOST TWENTY FUCKING YEARS. I recently watched this TED talk that defined what true love is— selflessness and compromise. The speaker outlined how (to an extent) true love is when you make sacrifices for the people you love. My aunt has sacrificed the possibility of meeting a new partner, attending events alone, the picture perfect spouse living situation and arguably her sanity while it seems he still has it all. I feel kind of funny that a random TED talk has spurred this urge in me to tell her that my uncle doesn’t love her, but I think it’s time. WIBTA??",

      "description": "I've been lurking on this sub for a bit and seen other people's dilemmas, and decided finally post something of my own here. I'm on mobile, so sorry for bad formatting in advance.\n\nSo, throughout my entire life, my family has been the kind to snoop around. My mom found out that my dad was cheating through snooping, a lot of family drama occurs through snooping, so on. I hate the drama this creates, and as such, I just want my own privacy.\n\nOnto the story. My entire life, my mom and dad snoop around on me. They want to know everything, my dad always asks if I'm being bullied or made fun of (to which I reply no, as I'm not and I don't want to start and false drama) and my mom always asks about my school life. \"How's your friends? How's your relationship life going? Why don't you talk with this person anymore?\" It bugs me so much, as this happens every day, and only escalates when family like my aunts and uncles visit. They ask the same questions, and I'm forced to repeat them over and over again.\n\nThis all came to a head one day after school, a few months ago. I had learned that my parents snooped through my room and found a journal of mine which I like to write stuff in about my life. They looked through it and began to question me on it, and I told them it was private. We stopped talking about it, and I thought that was the end of it.\n\nThe next day, I wake up early, and my mom demands my passcode to my phone. I tell her I have a right to privacy, as it was my phone and I had the right to have a private life. She told me as long as she pays my bills and keeps me fed, nothing can be kept private from her or my family. She then proceeded to take away my phone, telling me I can have it back when I give her the passcode. Her knowing my phone passcode has gotten me into trouble multiple times for conversations with my friends using 'inappropriate language' or my YouTube history.\n\nI'm visiting family and I suddenly remembered this incident, and decided to post this here. \n\nSo, AITA for wanting my own privacy, even from my family?",

      "description": "\nBasically, earlier in our friendship when my friends and I were getting to know each other, we would ask when our birthday (to check our zodiac signs and all that astrology shit). I always told them my birthday which is on June 9. But then as time goes by they would always forget and ask, “is it July or June.” I guess after a while I just got tired of correcting them??? I don’t know  but now they think my birthday is on July 9th. \n\nPersonally, I’m not a fan of birthdays in general so this confusion doesn’t really bother me. In fact, its kind of amazing because on my birthday I could just have the chill day I want and maybe cut a cake and spend the day with my mom. And then when July 9 comes around, I’m not as stressed about the attention I’m receiving because it’s really not my birthday (omg that sounds so bad to say). You’re probably wondering now like why can’t you have a chill day with your friends as well. To answer that question, my friends are the type to go all out and I always tell them every year that I don’t want to do anything special, that I just want a day of just quiet and maybe a low key dinner later in the evening; but that doesn’t make any sense to them. They think I’m just being modest because they couldn’t imagine not hosting a party or event for their birthdays.\n\nNow the one thing I’m worried about is that one day they’re going to find out that my real birthday is not on July, and they’re gonna be really mad and hurt. It’s not as if I hide my real birthday. For example, like whenever I’m filling out paperwork or something where I have to put my date of birth, and they are around me, I wrote out that it’s June but I guess they have no reason to look there or even be suspicious.\n\nI also started to notice that when people ask me when my birthday is I’ve started saying it’s on July 9 and I don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing but I also think it might not be that big of deal because they probably won’t remember and if they do then it’s the day everyone thinks my birthday is, so there’s no conflict.\n\n\n\nTLDR: my friends think my birthday is in July when it’s really in June, but I don’t feel that guilty about the confusion, but recently been getting paranoid about them finding out the truth and potentially leaving our friendship. AITA?\n\n\nNOTE: I’m really sorry if it is confusing and/or the format is wonky. ",

      "description": "Background- I was raised in what I now consider a fairly crazy religious upbringing. With asinine beliefs projected me at a young age. ie the Earth is 10,000 years old, evolution is a lie, witchcraft is real, gays are going to hell ect. My parents sent me to a private Christian School for grade school which I couldn't stand when I was younger. Anyways now at 24 I have denounced religion for quite some time and have made it clear that I will never believe that the Bible could possibly be the word of God. Anyways for Christmas this year my mom got me a Bible and she hid money in it so I would have to open it (lol). I was polite and thanked her for the gift. Anyways fast forward a couple weeks and she puts it in my car to take back to my apartment at which I promptly put it back inside her house. She sees me and goes off on me for being \"rude for not accepting her gift\". I kind of feel bad because I know she truly believes in the Bible (which is fine) but I'm kinda mad that she tried to guilt trip me and give me a gift she knew I wouldnt want anyway. Am I being an asshole? Should I just take it home with me so it gives her hope that I might read it? ",

      "title": "AITA for taking my neighbors dogs when they were being abused?",
      "description": "Background: I live in a pretty standard \"cookie cutter\" tract home neighborhood with pretty small yards and very little space between houses. I like my house and it's what we can afford. I'm thinking six weeks ago a new woman moved in to rent the house next door. She came over to say hello while her stuff was being moved in and something just seemed a little off about her. My husband likened her to Mimi Bobeck from Drew Carrey but to a lesser degree. Instead of meeting us, it seemed she was scoping us out under the guise of friendliness if that makes sense. She insisted we be facebook friends and since I don't use it anyways I said that was fine. \n\n\nLater that afternoon her dogs started barking and this is not an exaggeration, one or more of the dogs has been barking 24 hours a day 7 days a week for since she moved in. There were four, but we are pretty sure one died from neglect, but I can't stress enough, between 1 and 4 dogs have barked essentially right outside our bedroom window for the last six weeks. \n\n\nFirst we tried to talk with her and she said she'd handle it and absolutely nothing was done. I mean nothing. After about a week I peeked over the wall and in a week the yard was coated with the dog crap and the smell was beginning to get overwhelming. It was then I logged onto facebook to see if maybe there was chatter on our neighborhood page about her dogs and maybe I could join forces with other people who were being disturbed. Nothing but I made a post to see if anyone had advice. It wasn't even 10 minutes before \"Mimi\" was pounding on my door telling me to leave her the fuck alone. I told her if she just took care of her dogs, I would have no issues with her. She said something about being registered breeder with AKA and shed forgotten more about dogs than I'd ever know and I needed to mind my own business. I told her again that I would happily leave her alone if the dogs stopped barking. She said they never barked and stormed off. \n\n\nNext incident occurred when I had a particularly bad day at work and the headphones I usually use to drown out the noise just wasn't cutting it so I peeked over the wall again to see the dogs (3 now) with not even a water dish in the back yard. One was huddled up in small amount of sunshine the yard gets just shivering away while the other two were howling at her back door. I felt really bad so I filled up a bucket and carefully set it down over the wall and the dogs just sprinted towards it as if they hadn't had water in days. Mimi came bounding out her back door and told me to get the fuck off her property. I tried to explain the dogs needed water and she told me she was going to call the police. I told her PLEASE call the police and she did. Police came and we explained our side of the story. They gave her a citation for a noise violation since the dogs barked the entire time they were there and referred the waste situation to the county health department and implored us to follow up with animal control.\n\n\nWe called animal control and they could not have been more apathetic and given less of a shit. They said they don't do noise complaints and waste is not their problem (county codes say in black and white they are responsible for both) and that the owner themselves has to call if theres an issue with food, water or abuse (WTF?!?!).  We started consulting with a lawyer about suing her because the law states that we have an expectation of \"quiet enjoyment\" of our home. \n\nWhile we were pursing that again I saw the dogs had no water, again I gave them a bucket and again we had an interaction with the police where Mimi was cited for a noise violation. She clearly told the officer that she had the money to pay for as many noise violations as he wanted to give her and now one was going to tell her how to manage her dogs because she's the \"expert.\" \n\nI very much tried to retain my cool but I had a shit day at work yesterday and just wanted to relax and sleep. I didn't get home until about 11pm after starting work at 8 and the barking made me lose it. The dogs like me so I just opened up her side gate and was able to usher them into the back of my husband's truck. I drove them to my brothers property in a neighboring state (about 2.5 hours away) and he and his kids spent the morning getting the dogs fed, cleaned up and checked out by a vet tech friend of theirs. The dogs were covered in ticks but surprisingly well adjusted for being so neglected. I am paying for a vet to come over to look at them tomorrow but after we removed all the ticks they seem ok. The one who I first noticed was shivering to death is a little snarly and skittish but the other two have already fallen in love my brothers kids and they've walked them all over their 10 connected acres. \n\nI was expecting Mimi to be beating down our door or have the cops over but so far my husband has not heard anything from her and he said the silence is almost deafening with no barking and for the first time in six weeks, he actually slept in. \n\n\nSo I know for certain what I did was wrong in nearly ever sense of the word...but am I an asshole for doing what I did?\n",

It should be stated that we both are smart, straight A students. We take daily quizzes on the book after our daily reading, which isn’t more than about 50 pages a night. The reason I’m frustrated is that he refuses to read and do his own work. He wants me to just tell him all the answers when I’ve read all the chapters, so he doesn’t have to. And when I say I don’t want to, he pouts and says he would give me all the answers, so why won’t I give them to him? I feel manipulated into giving them to him just so he’s not upset but it’s so unfair to me it feels like because he never has to do his work, and can just use mine. I work so hard for my grades and it hurts me to give my work up just because I love him when he is 100% capable of doing his work on his own. I know his love language or whatever is acts of service, but I take such pride in my hard work and it hurts my feelings when I feel low key manipulated into giving it to him. It’s not even the situation of him forgetting his work last minute and me helping him out. It’s him just not doing his work because he knows I’ve done mine.

      "description": " My girlfriend and I have what I think most people would consider a great relationship. We have disagreements and fights but nothing we couldn’t talk through over Chinese food until yesterday. We both have hobbies we share as well as hobbies we don’t share, one of which for me is video games. \n\nI’m 25 and I’ve been playing video games since the original Pokémon games back in the 90s.  Yesterday I went to GameStop with a friend and my younger brother to pre-order the new Pokémon games (Call me a man child if you wish I’ll always love Pokémon lol) She gets home from work about the time I got home too and sees the receipt on my desk because I didn’t get a chance to file it in my cabinet yet. \n\nAll of a sudden she’s giving me an ultimatum: video games or her. I asked her what was wrong and she told me she thinks I care more about video games than her (this has never been a topic of discussion before this). \n\nI told her if it came to it I would choose the video games over her not because they are more important but because she resorted to an ultimatum for something is consider silly and if she is going to do that what is she capable of demanding in a marriage setting? Our shifts overlap so 90% of my playing is while she’s at work and always gets shut off when she gets home so we can talk, cook, and do something together unless she has solo plans. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable but I’m starting to question our compatibility. ",

We hadn't finalised where we would be going out what we'd be doing. So around late evening, one of them texts me and says \"lets grab dinner and then head to a bar or something\".. I say sure let's do it, but where. He suggests a somewhat expensive place (for me) and then the bar. I decline the expensive place and suggest a cheaper place, which I could afford.\n\nThe original texter doesn't reply to my msg and instead asks the 2nd friend to text and tell me that, he (1st friend) doesn't want to eat at that place. Understandably, I say it's all right, go-ahead for dinner without me and when you're heading to the pub hmu and I will join you there. \n\nHe declines that offer and says, we'll catch up soon. I once again let him know, after declining, whether he's sure he wants to cancel the whole thing. He still hasn't replied to that message. \n\nAITA for turning down the expensive dinner which I cannot afford &amp; suggest an alternative plan?",

He was still worried about, but we told him \"Don't worry about it, she was drunk\" (no ill feelings towards her at this point). After the thing started to get tricky. She started telling others \"her version\" of the story but not mentioning what she asked of him.\n\nThe next day, about 5 of us were in a voice chat on discord including the two in question. For one reason or another they both left the call at the same time for about a minute, and just as they came back I made a joke about what happened, not knowing they were back in the call (They joined the second i made the joke). After that the call went silent and she muted and defend herself for the remainder of our LOL (League of Legends) game. After the game ended she left the server. AITA for making this joke. We really didn’t see what had happened the previous night as a big deal.\n\nTLDR friend 1 asked friend 2 to jack off over mic while drunk.\n\nFriend 2 was not comfortable.\n\nNext day I made a joke not thinking it was a big deal.\n\nFriend 1 left the discord server.",

      "description": "After a 2 month struggle to recover from a hypoglycemic  (diabetic shock) event, our eldest \"Kit-son\" (cat) of 19 years passed away last week. We spent the last month doing in home hospice, which amounted to myself and my husband handling round the clock feedings, medications and caretaking.    Our Kit-son's passing was the hardest thing we've ever been through and we were not ready for him to go. He was the light of our lives. A week later I still cry each day and my husband is still not good. Mostly I'm just trying to support my husband and get through this week, holding it together without falling apart and collapsing. Our cats are our children, and we love them as strongly as any parent loves their child. In short, we are in mourning, made slightly more difficult by the fact that traditional avenues of mourning  (wake, funeral, bereavement time, people understanding) available with humans, are not as common with animals.\n\nMy co-worker has been really kind throughout the whole ordeal. But  a couple days after my cat died, I returned to work, and she stopped into my office asked how I was. When I said, \"not good\" she started to talk about her dog, who has just been diagnosed with diabetes and she kept talking and talking. I listened to her, but I didn't want to. I could not absorb it or express the same level of concern or care that I normally would. In fact, I felt a bit resentful that she would talk about her stuff when I clearly had just suffered a great loss. It felt like now that my cat had passed, I should just wrap it up and be done with it.  That felt incredibly disrespectful to my cat and my feelings.\n\nWhen I got to work the next day she came in to my office, briefly asked how I was doing  and then promptly started talking about her dog again. And I just didn't have the energy to interact or be supportive. So I just listened and  at the end I only said \"I'm sorry\". Normally I would be much more supportive and helpful, talk about things she could do, or things to try, but I can't talk about that stuff now. I just want to get through the week. \n\nShe comes in to talk about her dog every day now, who is not doing well (been to the emergency a couple times), and although I listen, I don't really say much and I cannot bring myself to care. I feel like she should have been more respectful of my loss. I can't tell if she knows I am \"checked out\" when she talks to me, so her feelings probably aren't hurt, but it seems like she should have some awareness.\n\nSo who is the insensitive jerk here: me or her? both?",

      "description": "Greetings,\n\nSo. Crytek, the developers of the Crysis series, have been working on a new game called Hunt: Showdown.\n\nTo summarize, it is set in the Louisiana are around ~1985, where there are zombies and you are trying to send a big bad monster back to hell. You go in either alone or with a friend, and are competing against other people to Kill/Banish the Boss Monster first to earn rewards. As a result, you have great PvE and PvP elements.\n\nThe developers recently released a new mode, pushed out a patch, and put the game on a 25% off sale for the Steam Winter Sale.\n\nPromptly afterwards, the ENTIRE Dev Team went on a holiday vacation. leaving NO ONE behind to do any type of hotfixes or anything in case something went wrong.\n\nWell, it turns out the patch they pushed just before release, almost completely broke the game's matchmaking.\n\nThe game is crashing consistently for everyone when trying to load into a match. Causing people to constantly restart the entire game in hopes of being able to play it at all.\n\nI am being critical of the company and the developers for their actions. Saying that they should have had someone available and on hand (or at least on-call) to be able to address potential issues, especially major ones that are completely prohibiting the game from being played.\n\nOf course, everyone should get vacation time, and the opportunity to spend time with their families during the holiday season. But I normally see employees take turns and stagger their time off so that their work and livelihood is covered. I see it as extremely irresponsible for the entire company to be gone at the same time. Especially when you are providing an experience that requires an internet connection and proper matchmaking.\n\nIt it even more egregious IMO that they would push a patch out to a game and then just hope that it worked while everyone buggers off on a 2 week holiday break.\n\nSo.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So the other day my wife and I were at a store at which I've previously observed far too many instances of long (&gt;10 min) delays at the checkout stands, usually waiting for the supervisor/manager to come over to tend to an issue.\n\nAfter browsing the store we go to check out and naturally line up in whichever line we think will allow us to check out the fastest.  I've developed a habit now of lining up in one of the adjacent lines even if it is obviously longer and having my wife swing the cart over in front of me if I reach my cashier first due to issues with her lane's cashier.  I always leave enough room between me and the customer in front of me so that noone else has to move their cart when she passes it over to me.\n\nI haven't had any issues with this until the other day when the lady behind me noticed that I was talking to my wife and asked us to \"decide which lane we were going to be in.\"  I politely tell her that I think I'll remain in my place in line and my wife will also remain in hers.  Lo and behold, my wife's cashier has to call for manager approval so I take the cart, check out and roll out of the store while I hear the 4th request for the manager over the speakers.\n\nI was initially considering that IATA but I figure:\n-We're only checking out once, we're not adding a net amount of wait time to the population\n-In most cases, we don't switch and there is no change to anybody's wait time\n-In cases where we do switch, it actually spreads out the wait time (e.g. Suppose a cashier has a 10 min issue and it takes us 3 min to checkout our cart, if we don't switch, everyone behind my wife gets a +10 min wait.  But if we do switch, everyone behind my wife only gets a +7 min wait while everyone behind me gets a +3 wait.)\n\nSo what say you reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So I've worked in professional theatre for almost 10 years and I have a theatre degree. While looking on some job boards for some extra work (I'm saving for a dream trip), I found a posting for people to basically review/evaluate shows to decide if they should be given awards by this arts nonprofit. I've got all the qualifications, so I apply with a cover letter, resume, the whole bit. Fast forward to today- they want me to come in for training. Training is unpaid. Okay, it's the arts, I'm just looking for a little extra cash, no big deal. But then I keep reading. They are offering a $25 stipend per viewing and write up of each \\~2hr show (so easily 3-4 hours of my time, not counting travel) and each show could be an hour or more travel time. We're also required to attend unpaid meetings. I politely declined at that point, but I'm pissed. It took time to put together my application, fill out the required forms, etc., and that's time I could've used to find an actual side job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, I found out about this on a JOB BOARD, and there was no mention of it being a volunteer position. I wasn't expecting to be paid much, but what they're offering would barely cover travel expenses. I know there isn't a lot of money in the arts, but it just seems kind of deceptive to me to put it out there implying that it's a regular job when it really isn't, and it's a huge waste of everyone's time for me to go through the whole application process without knowing until the end that I'm basically volunteering. I don't think this would happen in other fields. On the other hand, it is an arts nonprofit and obviously they do good work that I care about, and their expectations are reasonable if they had advertised it as a volunteer position, I just don't want to do a job without being paid for it.

      "description": "I moved to a new city ten years ago and made friends with another mom. She was older and had a kid and my husband and I ended up close with her and her kid. We babysat for free, bought her kid stuff, did a lot of stuff all together or with just the parents or the kid. We still really like her older kid, he’s just a really fantastic little dude.\n\nShe became pregnant around the same time as me. Her pregnancy was more complex and high risk and we were supportive the whole way through and bought them an expensive gift once their kid was born. We upped the babysitting and dropped of groceries and gift certificates for take out on a regular basis. They invited us to their baby shower and our kids (who were two weeks apart) spent a lot of time together during the first two years.\n\nIt became obvious that our kid had a disability at around 30 months. I don’t want to get into what it is but it’s something common and wasn’t detectable before birth. Our kid is happy and healthy. He loves hanging out with other people. He liked both our friends older kid and the younger kid a lot. I’ve seen the three of them together and they seem to have a good time together. There’s never been any issues that I’ve seen. \n\nWe found our long term friends pulling away. I’m not on social media but husband saw them having play dates and outings without us. They never initiated contact with anything involving the kids. We still reached out frequently and still babysat their kids for free and dropped off groceries when one parent was away or when everyone in the house was sick. I still met up with both parents for coffee and things like that. \n\nMy husband and I figured they were just busy with two kids but it didn’t explain why they had time for kid stuff with other people. They still invited us (but not our son) to adult things. \n\nWe weren’t invited to the 3rd birthday party for their son. We saw all the planning stuff on social media and knew we weren’t invited. We live two blocks away from their house where the party was being held. On the day of the party we got a call from the mom inviting our kid because other kids had cancelled last minute. She didn’t explain why we didn’t get an invite in the first round. Our kid attended and had a good time. He wasn’t disruptive or aggressive or in any way a detriment to the party. We bought gifts for both kids. Our kid was happy to see his two buddies. My husband did not want to go and said “these people are not our friends.” We of course invited both of their kids to our kids party, they didn’t show up. \n\nThis year we didn’t get an invite to their kids party again. No last minute invite either. Their younger kid came to our kids party and had a good time. \n\nA couple days ago they reached out and wanted to come talk to us. I assumed this was about giving our kid the cold shoulder and was kind of relieved that maybe we could talk and move on. \n\nThey were after some free professional advice on something else. I almost lost it at them for basically making no attempt to include our kid for the last two years. \n\nI realize that no one owes my kid an invite to their kids party and my kid doesn’t care about it. They also still Are fun people who offer to spend time with me. They just don’t seem to want my kid  around their kid (unless they need free babysitting). \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "Posting on mobile, apologies in advance. \n\nUntil recently, my father's sister lived in a dangerous and unstable country (I won't go into specifics, but it is somewhere in Africa), however she is still a citizen of our home country and due to the instability, my father offered to get her on a plane house her until she is on her feet. She is nearing retirement age, she has no saving and she cannot drive, and we live in a rural community where work in the local area is scarce. Also important is that I have not seen her or even spoken to her in over 20 years and my fiancée has never met her. \n\nMy fiancée and I have been together for approximately 5 years but only moved in together about a year ago. Our house is a very small 2 bed, although the 2nd room is barely more than a box room - it's fine for the two of us, but it gets cramped if we have anyone round. Financially we are comfortable, but we are by no means well off. We're also getting married later this year and plan to start trying for a baby immediately after that. This is all important context. \n\nMy father is emigrating later this year, and on christmas day he took me to one side and put me on the spot; if his sister is not on her feet by the time he moves, will we take her in? I was taken aback but I did not give him an answer either way as I was not willing to commit without my fiancé's input. Shortly afterwards however, we returned to the lounge and my father phoned another member of family and, in front of my completely oblivious fiancée, informed them that we'd be happy to take in his sister. My fiancée was gobsmacked but said nothing. After we left however, she erupted and we had a major row - again, on christmas day. Because of the way she found out, she thought I was in on these plans and had agreed to all of this behind her back, and though I eventually convinced her that I was as much in the dark on this as she was, it nevertheless ruined our christmas.\n\nAfter calming down, we sat and talked and decided that we would not take her in. Housing her would compromise our privacy, it would potentially hamper our future plans re: trying for a baby, and  we are simply not in a position financially support a third adult right now. A few days later we went to my father's house to tell him this, however he became very angry and told us to get out. Since then, I have barely spoken to him, and on the few instances that I have, the atmosphere between us has been noticeably different. I understand the reasons for her leaving the country she was in, but I feel as though my father took it for granted that my fiancée and I, who are just starting our own lives together, would step up to the plate to support her whilst he moves to another country to start a new life for himself. As terrible as I feel for her, it's not a burden that we are in a position to take on, even if she is family.\n\nAm I/my fiancée the asshole in all of this?",

Since we have a lot of mutual friends, I asked them for an opinion on her, in which they said I should really go for her. After asking her on a movie date, she straight up told me that she \"honestly\" thought that I was just asking her to go hang out as friends, and that she thought we wouldn't necessarily fit with each other and after I heard this, it came across as a big red flag in which I decided I would just go on the movie date and afterwards tell her I would like to stay friends.\n\n After the date, which I kept COMPLETELY to her standards of just \"hanging out as friends\", she starts messaging me and from then on, starts acting a lot more clingy and attached, to the point where she forced me to tell her everything I would do daily hour by hour. Keep in mind, at this point, we've been talking for less than 2 weeks. After bluntly responding to her for the next week, I decide to tell her that I don't think a relationship with her is the best thing right now.

      "description": "I wasn't even planning on posting here but I told my roommate about this story, and he (more or less) called me a douchebag, but I don't agree.\n\nLast night I went to a bar after visiting a friend of mine. I just wanted something to drink and I was feeling good so I said to myself why the hell not? Anyways I sit down at the bar. I'm casually talking with the bartender and shooting the shit with some drunk dude next to me. After a few minutes a guy and a girl come in and the girl sits next to me. I greet them and turn back to the dude next to me. Sometimes the girl asks me something and I slowly join their conversation, I thought everything was cool.\n\nWhen the girl left for the bathroom, the guy she was with turned to me and asked what I was doing. I asked him what he thought I was doing, and he said that he was on a date with the girl and that I was getting in the way. I told him I wasn't doing it on purpose, but that I would leave them alone. So I go back to talking with this drunk fuck next to me. \n\nAfter maybe 15 minutes the dude leaves for the bathroom, and the girl immediately turns around and starts talking to me. She was being incredibly flirty. I'm talking going out of her way to touch me for whatever reason, laughing at everything I say and making strong eye contact. I noticed that she was really attractive and our conversation went smooth, and when the guy came back she was barely paying any attention to him.\n\nTo keep it short, she started blatantly hitting on me, and she ended up coming home with me and we slept together. Initially I felt bad for the dude but she clearly made a choice, and I gladly accepted it. I don't feel like I did anything wrong. Am I the asshole in this situation?\n\n",

He was in desperate need of a new wallet so I spent about four hours researching different name brand wallets that he may like. He is a super simple person so I was looking for a neutral color and ended up deciding that I was interested in the Givenchy wallet. On my lunch at work, I drove to the mall and took a look at the Givenchy one in person to see how it felt and if I liked it. I also went to the Saint Laurent store to look at theirs. I ultimately decided on the Givenchy. Me being paranoid and also I can't really keep a secret, I decided to give it to him early. He didn't say much, thanked me and we left it at that. About half an hour later, he starts looking at other wallets and decides that he wants another one instead. I was pretty hurt when he said that and said fine, I'll return the other one and get what he wants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for getting angry at him about this?",

      "description": "I (22F) was close to my mom only for the first 10 years of my life. Around 11, I was so hurt and upset by her that I vowed to never talk to her again. and I didn’t. I had my reasons and they were valid. However, she passed away a little over a month back and it’s brought up a lot of messed up emotions. My family offered no help emotionally, even thought they knew this was a hard time. You see, my family had a bad relationship with my mom too. She made some bad decisions, stole from us (mainly bc of drugs), and ultimately abandoned all of us in some way.\n\nDespite all that, I recognized she struggled with mental illness and drug addiction. It wasn’t really her doing all this shit to hurt us- it was because she was struggling. When she died, it brought up a lot of shit and drama. Lots of shock, anger, and confusion. I was contacted by police as I was next of kin. I was told I could handle my mother’s remains, or her parents could. I talked to her parents (first time I spoke to them in a decade as well) and they were assholes. Kept saying horrible shit about her while I was on the phone trying not to cry. From what I gathered, if I signed my mom’s remains over to them, they’d probably just let the city keep her and toss her in with the rest of the unclaimed deceased people.\n\nNone of my mom’s siblings stepped forward. I don’t know all of them, but she has 7. One of them is in the east, and the only one I ever met is now homeless due to drug addiction as well. I know my aunt could afford to help (her husband is an engineer and they make good money), and I know my mom had other siblings who could at least donate a bit up to help pay for funeral- minus the homeless one of course. That’s a whole other bag of fish to fry though.\n\nSo, I turned to my dad’s side. My grandparents are loaded. They just spent an ungodly amount getting a house built. They go on vacation to Europe twice a year for the past 12 years. They have money. I expected them to maybe offer help financially, or at least emotionally. But nope. Nothing. I have one younger full sister, two younger half siblings and they can’t help. My dad is struggling to pay his own bills and I don’t want to ask him- especially considering this was the woman who abused him emotionally and physically.\n\nI had money saved up for school or emergency, so I used that. It was about $4,000 to have her moved closer and cremated. This might not seem like a lot to some people, but considering I pay rent and bills for my full sister and myself, it took up 2 months of rent. I wasn’t able to hold a funeral. I’m not able to get a super nice urn. I was told my mom was sober for about 2 years now and she was religious, and now I feel bad because I couldn’t afford a proper burial, let alone a sermon. Even if I could, it would just be 4 of us there because the rest of her family wouldn’t even come out here to California to check on any of us.\n\nNow, I gotta ask... Am I the asshole for expecting either of my grandparents, aunts, or uncles to help pay? All of them are 40+, married, with their own kids, homes, etc. Of course I don’t expect them to toss me thousands of dollars, but even just a hundred here or there to help give her a proper funeral would have helped a lot. Or am I an asshole for expecting them to help me pay, when she had already took so much financially and emotionally from them when she was alive?",

I've had a lot of ups and downs in that time but only recently have I sought help for it. \n\nI went to the mental health nurse at my school about a month ago and told her how I felt and then she referred me to the campus Doctor. She diagnosed me and prescribed me antidepressants which I've taken daily. \n\nFast forward to today. I'm trying to sell my car (I talked about this in a previous post if you're interested). My mom was looking for the key to my car in my room and found my prescription. \n\nWhen I got home she asked me about it. She seemed really upset that I didn't tell her and even more so when she realized I lied to her about going to the doctor because I was \"just sick.\" But honestly, it was really hard even telling the mental health staff about this. \n\nAm I an asshole for not telling my mom or any of my family?

      "description": "I have this Friend but she stopped talking to me after I started dating this guy she doesn’t really like and cut ties with me and so I gave her some space. (The reason she cut ties with me isn’t bc I started dating him). After a while, I tried talking to her but everytime she would just ignore me and act like she didn’t want to talk to me. So like a normal person would I gave her a little bit more distance bc I also know that she hates it when people approach her while she’s still mad. I tried to make everything okay by texting her first and approaching her first and acting like everything was okay hoping that we would be able to move on (I don’t know why she’s upset honestly). All of this didn’t work she still iced me out and never gave me a proper response and acted like she didn’t want to talk to me, like I was a burden everytime I approached her. \n\nIn the end I tried confronting her and asked her what was wrong and why she stopped talking to me. She started telling me to just ignore her and do my own thing like how she’s doing her own thing and that she was just tired etc. She later told my other Friend that I made it sound like I was blaming everything on her and I shouldn’t have confronted her right then in the situation which was in the morning before class. \n\nKeep in mind that I’ve always tried to listen to her problems but she has called me selfish and called out many of my faults as a person which I dislike very much bc I try to be the best version of me with her. She said she thought  I was  spending too much time with my SO despite her not liking him so I always kept her in mind when I’m with him but none of my efforts have been appreciated.  \n\nRegarding her side of the story I think she might be upset bc I ask her for advice for many things but don’t really take it in when something happens bc I am very impulsive which I get can be annoying. I think she thinks I don’t try to make Amends or put much effort in the friendship after I started dating my SO which is not true bc I have been taking time out purposefully to meet w her and talk w her. Regardless of all of this I think she cares for me a lot bc she listened to my problems and gave very good responses with carefully thinking things out and said whatever hurts me hurts her too. \n\nI was thinking of apologising but idk if I should after everything that happened - she’s contacted me once after she started ignoring me and I care for her so AITA ??

      "title": "AITA for writing a script my way?",
      "description": "This is a bit older, but I only just found this sub and this has brought a twinge of confused feelings every time I think about it. \n\nA few semesters ago, I was in a film class where, for one assignment, we came up with an \"elevator pitch\" about a historical fiction script we would like to write. These were then voted on to find which were the \"coolest\", and those whose pitches weren't chosen were assigned to work on the projects of those who were. \n\nI gave a pitch about a man who converted to Voodoo as an actual faith system and had the misfortune to move to Salem during the witch trials. It was popular enough to be voted in, and I was assigned a fellow classmate, a mixed-race female, to work with me. Since I feel it pertinent for the story to mention her sex/race, I need to tell you that I am a white male. \n\nRight from the start of working together, it becomes apparent that she missed some key details from my pitch and had a different idea for the story. I wanted to write about a realistic Voodoo practitioner, as in a follower of the actual religion who believed it was a \"good\" faith meant to help others. She wanted to go into the mystical magical voodoo trope. She kept wanting there to be spirits and spells that actually worked in the plot, and I kept shutting her down. I had a reason in my mind to do so: I wanted this to highlight religious tensions and fears where the community judges a believer to be evil based off of incomplete information about the faith, such as Islamaphobia. She wasn't necessarily against that theme, but neither did she seem to care about it. In fact my number 1 problem seemed to be she didn't have any overarching thematic ideas at all. As far as I could tell, she just wanted to write a compelling conflict with cool effects, without any thought as to what it meant, and real voodoo would heighten the wow factor. I didn't want real voodoo though because I felt actually seeing spells operate would have given some justification to the Salem townsfolk, and would thus ruin the message I was trying to convey. If she was trying to take the story a different way for a reason, she never revealed that reasoning.\n\nI argued my view a bit forcefully. I also tried to make sure I said \"I want to know your opinions and reasonings\" each time I did so, but every time, her ideas conflicted that core theme I wanted. So I explained why I didn't want to go that route yet again, and it ended up being me repeatedly turning down her ideas. I worry that, because I repeatedly said \"no\", she thought my offers to accept her advice were hollow. I sincerely wasn't *trying* to reject everything, it just honestly felt like every suggestion she made was running counter to my theme. \n\nEventually, she said something along the lines of \"I guess I just misunderstood your story from your pitch. I don't want to work on this one, just do whatever you want.\" That hurt. I see myself as trying to be a fair man and a feminist, but seeing how she shut up, I could see in her eyes that she thought I had \"mansplained\" her out of the project. During the actual writing, I asked her repeatedly for how she wanted it to be written. I find that I come up with overarching ideas fairly well, but am not the best dialogue or action writer, so this was where I truly needed help and I tried to show this to her. She gave minimal feedback and stuck around for the minimum required amount (since this was a graded group project). Then she basically had me finish it on my own. For what it was worth, I accepted all of her input about dialogue and action while writing the actual script (sometimes even when I didn't 100% agree), but of course, at that point she had given up and was just trying to agree with me and get the project done.\n\nSo AITA? The idea was mine to begin with, and I had a theme and idea which I tried to do my best to convey in the pitch, but it didn't get across to her until she was actually assigned to my project. Her ideas weren't bad in and of themselves, but they didn't match my theme, so I rejected them. I tried to give her opportunity for input, but after arguing so long before even starting, she gave up and left me to do a group project pretty much alone. Part of me says I was justified because I was defending the core idea of the story, which was mine and which was chosen for the assignment. The other part feels horrible for not allowing a mixed-race female voice to be heard, since we need more of such voices in the industry imo, and I can't forget that look she gave me when she gave up.",

      "description": "My husband and I have been friends with a guy for about 12 years now, during which time he was mostly single. We spent a lot of time at each other’s houses, chilling out, eating good food, and talking about our lives. A lot of our talking involved picking his bruised ego up from bad dates, giving advice about women, and reassuring him that he’d not die alone. Quite often, we’d joke that he was the third person in our marriage (and no, not like that... this was only ever platonic). We were close. \n\n7 months ago, he met a woman (hurray!) and they hit it off. Things were moving really fast, and as expected, we saw less and less of him. That’s pretty normal, right? They moved in together, things were going great! But still, it was like we were cut out of his life. We went for a dinner or two with the two of them, but honestly they were so wrapped up in each other it was like we didn’t exist. Sentences we started were cut off as they whispered to each other. Conversations became awkward trailing monologues.  Dinners started to last less than an hour with both parties making their excuses. It was awkward and really quite rude. \n\nWe’d lost him. He was no longer interested in our lives, and we watched with interest, hoping he’d come back, eventually, when the honeymoon period was over. \n\nThen he announced his engagement on Facebook. Neither of us use Facebook any more (which he knows), so we actually found out by a mutual friend sending us a text. It was a little hard not to take offence here, but we congratulated them sincerely- on the phone and via text. When questioned why he didn’t tell us, he said it was “something he had to do for himself”. \n\nHe’s recently had a civil ceremony in our town. We weren’t invited. We were invited to a restaurant with them after their families had gone home, as a small celebration. \n\nHe’s finally invited us to his main wedding celebration by sending us a picture of the invitation he keeps forgetting to send us. (Everyone else already seems to know, including some people he’s not seen for a couple of years). The wedding is in Poland, and we live in the UK. It’s also in the middle of nowhere, not in a main town. \n\nAITA for thinking we could spend our money better by NOT going? \n\nTLDR: used to have a good friend who’s been really distant since he met his girlfriend/fiancée - is it shitty not to go to his wedding?\n\n",

      "description": "I know already it sounds bad but hear me out. Me (18m) and this girl (17f) both like each other but grew apart after she started dating someone else (16m).  The problem is that he is immature and a brat at times and the feelings she used to have for him went away. The only reason she hasn't left him yet is because that he is seriously obsessive and has anger issues. When I mean obsessive I don't mean like oh he knows where she lives and is always jealous. No I mean he will throw a temper tantrum if she doesn't talk to him every hour. Another example is that he will blow up her phone even if he knows that she has a volleyball match to attend and will get angry at her if she doesn't answer. This all came to a head around a month ago after he put on his story that he would kill himself if he was ever single again. Then turned around and texted her saying that he felt alone in the relationship and that she didn't care about him. He basically guilt tripped her into staying with him. In the meantime I struck up a romantic relationship with a friend (17f) of mine which essentially boiled down to FWB no strings attached no feelings involved. On Monday me and  the girl I like were talking and she asked me if she called me a certain sexual trigger word if I would get turned on. I gave her my answer and needless to say it did the job well. Nothing happened but I did get me aroused and we didn't really talk yesterday about it either. Well today I asked her if I asked her if I asked her out before her current bf who she would say yes to and she said me. We talk on that just a little while longer. Afterwards I say I want to date you but I don't want to ruin anything good you and your bf might have to which she replies was there any good. My simple reply is that it wasn't up for me to decide but i don't want to be the other guy. All of that is to ask WIBTA for trying to get her to dump get current bf to get with me? ",

I told my close friends and familly. I saw a psy for 4 months and I thought I needed to be strong and \"not a victim\". Nobody came to me.. no one shows up at my door or called me or texted me to see how I was doing. I confronted them and they told me they didnt know what to do, so I asked 1 simple thing ( hangout together, except this time I'm not the one planning it) after 2 years nothing... \n\nNow I'm on a work leave because I'm burned out ( promotion at work, breakup, miscarriage, to name a few thing that added up) and the same thing happened. And now my father stoped talking to me saying im acting like a victim. Am I the assshole for asking for support when I'm down? \n\nPs: English is not my first language, sorry! ",

We went to the laundry room and all but one washer/dryer were filled with clothes that had been washed already but were sitting there wet. I thought \"no big deal\" and decided to wait about 20 minutes to go back and check if someone had moved them over to the dryers. It appeared to be the same person who left all their wet clothes there, since there were many small loads, no dryers were in use, and all the clothes that had been washed were sitting there unmoved. After 20 or so minutes, I went back in and the clothes were all still sitting there. The laundry room closes at 11pm and I think in a building with shared laundry it's pretty rude to not set a timer and get your laundry relatively soon after it's finished. After waiting awhile, I decided I would just move one load of their wet laundry to the open dryer next to it and put my clothes in the washer. My husband is appalled that I would do that. AITA here?

Again, they said no because things need to be fixed in your car.\n\nThis is where I created my master plan.\nMy uncle has a lot of experience in working on cars, so I save up extra money, have him fix the one thing wrong with my car.\n\nThen I asked my parents if I could “spend the night at my friends house” of course they said yes, so after asking. I packed my belongings without being caught into my car, later that day, it was time for me to leave. And so I did, I drove 4 hours until I received a message from my brother wondering where I was at, I didn’t answer. I continue on all the way to Wisconsin.\n\nOnce I was there, the next day, I ended up receiving a lot more messages from him and my parents, I had to explain where I was. They. We’re. Furious. I had left the state without telling anyone a word of what I was doing, you can imagine how worried they were.\n\nThey insisted I come straight home in which I protested and said a firm no, I was staying the whole time I planned. \nWhich was originally just 1 week.\n\nHalf way through the week they even threatened to report my car as stolen and have a warrant out for my arrest &amp; have my car taken back but me leave here.(the car was in their name, not mine) I was fully prepared to stay as my cousin was who I was staying with.\n\nNeedless to say that never happened. But there’s more, something happened which I don’t remember what exactly, but because of it, I couldn’t leave after that first week. In the end I ended up staying in Wisconsin for 3 weeks total.\n\nEventually got home, and shit hit the fan. Everyone was baffled as to how I could do such a thing. Therefore, I one upped my cousin, who was already the black sheep of the family, in turn gained mad respek 😂\n\n(I was 18)",

I want her to move in with her family member who also goes to the same school.\n\nI have tried to convince her that moving in with this guy is a terrible idea because I'm concerned about her safety and the possibility of her being abused again, but she thinks that I'm too concerned and she is perfectly safe. She says he feels terrible about assaulting her and that it wont happen again. She says he really cares about her and that's why he's offering to let her move in with him. She also says that she wouldn't allow herself to get into a situation that leads to abuse, and that his two friends will prevent him from trying something.

      "description": "I (23, F) was with my ex (26, M) for two years. He had an ex-girlfriend (27?, F). Let's call her Rebecca. My ex (let's call him Jack) and I were reasonably happy together for the first year of our relationship, and then I spent five months studying abroad, came home for a month, and spent another four months studying abroad before coming back home permanently. We chatted daily, and were still very much a couple while I was abroad. When I returned home, Jack made very little effort to see me/spend time with me, and I felt neglected. He told me I was being clingy and expecting too much. I should also mention that I started taking antidepressants during my time abroad (I'm a long-time sufferer of anxiety and depression), and as a result, I gained a significant amount of weight. I asked Jack whether the weight gain was the reason for his loss of interest, and he told me it was. I was hurt and angry, and we broke up. He let me believe that a combination of my 'clinginess' (i.e. wanting to see him twice a week) and the weight gain was the reason for his loss of interest. I was heartbroken and my self-esteem was at rock bottom, but six months later, I no longer have feelings for him and we stayed friends. He told me that he was dating someone new, and I was happy that he was happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I found out yesterday that he was cheating on me with his ex (Rebecca) while I was abroad. His 'new' girlfriend is actually Rebecca. She has no idea that he was still in a two-year relationship with me when he started dating her again. They've even talked about marriage. While he was dating her, he was telling me he loved me, spending time with me and my family, and asking me to move in with him. He begged me not to tell her, apologised to me (though I suspect he was just sorry he got caught), said he'll commit suicide if I tell her, tried to make me feel like a bad person, etc. I (perhaps mistakenly) told him I won't tell her, but urged him to tell her. He doesn't want to, but I think she deserves to know the truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I told her the truth, especially given that marriage is on the cards?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: ex was cheating on me with his current girlfriend. She doesn't know. I found out, and he begged me not to tell her. WIBTA if I told her?",

      "description": "My birthday occurred a few months ago and my girlfriend planned a birthday surprise for me. She led me up the candle lined stairway to a room she filled with balloons and had romantic music playing and a bed setup with a TV with a slide show of all of our pictures. In Addition she had a USB with a bunch of movies she thought I would like and she bought me some clothes to go along with it. Unfortunately i was really sick that day so i couldn't enjoy it much which bummed her out but that's not really why I was unsatisfied. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow throughout our 6 year relationship I have never been the mushy feely type of person and I am not that affectionate of a person and i understand that and so does she. I know I am already sounding like the asshole and will accept any judgement passed down but AITA for feeling like this gift was kinda for her as much as it was for me? She is the one who enjoys all the romantic stuff and I am more than happy to do that sort of thing for her on anniversaries and other occasions but on my birthday I kinda want to do things i enjoy.(i.e video games, hiking, exploring, etc) It just felt like the doesn't know exactly what sort of things I am into and planned something she would like such as a romantic evening. The year before this she took me to a fancy restaurant where we had to get all dressed up which i also don't really like doing either. I appreciate the effort but AITA for expecting something more catered to me?",

      "description": "My daughter and I have had a rocky relationship for the past 10 years.  Prior to that we had always been very close.  She is married but separated they have three children.  I divorced her biological father when she was six months old. Her paternal grandmother and I were extremely close (important) closer that my bio mother and I.\n\nLast weekend my daughter asked if the oldest grandson could spend the weekend with us (my husband and I) while the two other kids (boy and girl) went to visit their dad. Naturally we said yes.  Our rule of thumb is that we never ask questions we just go with the flow.  My daughter does not like questions and has a quick temper.  We surmised from a few comments dropped by the kids that the oldest son does not enjoy being around her father nor does he like his father's one bedroom apartment.  We reside two houses away from my daughter and the children.  (kids ages 16,14,11).\n\nYesterday afternoon my SIL called me to thank me for mailing him his birthday card and Christmas card (both had $$). My daughter's grandmother always remembered me on every holiday with a card, sweet note and a check.  She was very good to me and was a wonderful example of the perfect MIL. My goal has always been to emulate her in every aspect that I can. Due to the volatility of my daughter's pending divorce I have been kind to my SIL but have kept my distance. After thanking me for the cards and money he explained that the oldest son was sick with a cold. He further advised that he felt it would be best if said child did not have to be cramped into the 1 bedroom with the two siblings and father for the weekend.  He asked if the boy could spend the weekend with us again.  I assured him we would be fine with it.  He asked if it should be kept a secret from daughter I advised she should absolutely be advised of the situation. Phone call ended with plans for him to drop off boys and pick up dinner I had made for all of them.\n\n5:00 rolled around the front door slammed open and I heard screaming \"where the Hell is she?\"  I ran from the back of the house. My daughter was there as I came to a halt she was yelling about me inserting myself into the middle of her family. My husband tried to stop her and explain what had happened but she kept yelling and swearing. Finally my husband said \"that's it, you get the eff out of my house!\". I stood there with my jaw hanging. Not usually a guppy this time I was completely dumbfounded, flat footed gob smacked. She whirled and slammed out the door.\n\nWithin ten minutes SIL called. Come to find out that moron had only told daughter that son was \"going to a clean safe place\" and then proceeded to drive from daughter's house two driveways down to our house.  Daughter became enraged and they had a verbal altercation in the street.  Oldest son who is a great kid was livid and cussing his father out (completely out of character I swear) standing on the porch of his father's apartment in the rain and refusing to come inside.  I spoke to him on the phone and calmed him down.  SIL wanted to bring son over to my house I said I could not get in the middle of it.   SIL brought all three kids over to pick up the food I had made for them. oldest son sat in car. I went out and hugged him, kissed his cheek told him everything would be okay sorry this was happening. This sweet straight A Honor Roll boy had tears in his eyes. My heart is breaking for him. \n\nMy husband and daughter are normally close. He walked over to talk with her. She was home doors locked music blaring (I am sure wine was flowing poor child) she looked out the window and refused to open the door. It is a $ht show.\n\nAITA  for saying that grandson could stay with us again this weekend?  AITA for trusting SIL to call daughter to make visitation arrangements? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The last 4 weekends, we have made plans to hang out and it has fallen thru due to him having a lot of issues going on with his roommates and his mom being sick. Legit issues, that I have not held against him but have been super patient and supportive, even going so far as to drive 40 miles to get his favorite comfort food and deliver it to his house in the middle of the night.. \nNow, this weekend I am planning on celebrating my bday by getting out of town. I have had my own issues going on and i need a get away. \nWe have both been working back to back 12 hour shifts to clear this weekend. I asked him last week if he was good to go, and he responded with yes! And i booked a (non refundable)room for us in the mountains.\nYesterday he tells me that his good friend will be in town this weekend, and he wants me to meet him, and could we possibly include them in our plans. \nConsidering my plan was to be laid up in the hotel all weekend, no not really.. So i told him that he should plan to see his friend and i will just do me.\nSo, AITA for wanting him to myself for 2 days? It seems as tho our tine is always stolen, and he has acknowledged that.\n",

      "description": "I work in fast food, as a cashier. The last customer that came in had something wrong with her order that she got from the drive thru (aka, not me.). I followed the training I was given, ask for a receipt, take the food she didn't want and toss it, then remake her food. She asks for the manager, no big deal sometimes people just want someone higher up. Manager comes over and deals with her, I start sweeping and getting ready to mop.\n\nWhat I didn't know is she called me an asshole and said I screamed at her. Whatever, you get those people sometimes. My manager knew she was lying, so I didn't worry too much.\n\nAnyway I'm sweeping around tables, he's talking to her and I notice her look at me with a pitying expression. Didn't think anything about it until she leaves and every single employee starts laughing. I thought maybe someone told a pretty good joke, so I go to over to get in on this. Once they see me they just start laughing more. I ask what's so funny, my manager looks at me and says \"I told her you had a learning disability!\"\n\n \"....What?\"\n \nMore laughter. I'm starting to get pretty annoyed, which must be obvious because he said \"It was just a joke man, I was just trying to get her to leave!\"\n\n I know he couldn't have known this, but that is the one thing that pisses me off to no end. I was bullied and called retarded (God I hate even typing that) because I have a lazy eye and a speech impediment (occasional stutter, pauses, tripping over words, etc.) but I certainly don't have a disability.\n\nEveryone jumps to my managers defense, saying \" oh he didn't mean it bro, he just wanted that bitch to get out\" or \"it's a joke, calm down.\" .\n\nI went off on everyone. \"Fuck you! You can't say that to people, what the fuck is wrong with you?!\"\n\n He could've handled that any other way (perhaps saying I was a new cashier, which is the truth) but he chose that option and royally pissed me off.\n\nSo, am I an asshole?",

      "description": "I am currently enrolled in Algebra II. Recently our teacher created a challenge for our 30 student class to find solutions for each number 1-100 using the numbers 2, 0, 1, and 9 (for 2019). For each solution a student finds, they will receive one bonus assignment point and for every five solutions a student finds, they will receive one bonus assessment point. For reference, assignment points are worth 30% of the total grade and assessment points are worth 70% of the total grade.\n\nThe problem arises when she said that only one student can claim a number's solution. For example, if a student claimed 1 = 1\\^(2+9+0), they would receive the bonus point for solution number 1 and nobody else could claim a solution for number 1.\n\nI'm no genius, but math is one of my stronger subjects and I know that others in the class would need the points more than I do.

Many of our friends co-workers, starting getting engaged last year and we inevitabley talked about our future. We both imagined our relationship on the path to engagement. \n\nAround September/october she said she wanted to get engaged by the end of the year and I it put unfair pressure on one side.\n\nThough at the time of that conversation I felt like I could be ready to get engaged, my job was stable, future was sketched out, relationship was healthy. Really felt like I just needed to get some ducks in a row first. She understood and agreed that sometime next year.\n\nFast forward 6 months and I feel uncertain over getting engaged. Over the past couple of months my career and future have both been put under pressure (switching companies, cities, contemplating grad school). This has challenged me to figure out what I want in my future and, more importantly, who I am. The thought of getting engaged encites stress and feels low priority. Though I understand she wants to be sure engagement is in our future and want to be mindful of that.\n\nI feel like I am barely getting to know my adult self and the thought of promising myself to somebody else without knowing who I am feels wrong.\n\nFor the next several months I have set up a \"plan\" for me to get myself organized, spend time getting to know myself, plan my future in more detail and get to know exactly what I want. I can't promise a rainbow at the end but wanted to show her that I am working towards it.\n\nTl;dr: gf wanted to get engaged, we talked and I said I needed a few months to get some things in order.

I this case a team of five where in which you face another team of five. So friends that we are decide well make a group and participate. The games for us would have us get ready at 7:00 pm-7:30 pm and then start playing. \n\nAnd now to the core of the issue is that one of my friends has work during the hours of the tourney, unfortunate but isn't the end of the world.  Given that my friend has work, I make plans to do other events outside from the game. The day comes,  I decide to go out hangout/eat with other people. Around 6:00 pm, I get notified by my working friend that he has skipped work and has decided to play some league of legends instead. Unfortunately for me I'm stuck across the city and with other people. We did talk a lot about clash to the up coming days towards it, but I assumed that nothing would come of it because my friend would be working.  \n\n Initially I think he's just messing with me, and I play it off like a joke, but as the conversation kept going I realized that he was in fact not. I'm annoyed at this point because I felt like I would have made time for him if he made me aware of the situation, I ask who was aware of this, because I was not. The friend then said that one other friend was aware of this since yesterday, but not the other two. But in this case the other two were both present and one had even made time for this tourney without even having prior knowledge. \n\nThe general feeling of the group was that you were \"expected to be there\" and that they all agree that I should have told them that I wasn't going to be there.

      "description": "So, little bit of backstory. I always used to be super close to my mom when i was a little kid (sorta still am, 16) and we would spend a lot of time together, but a few years ago we had a bit of a falling out. My mom always used to be the type to check your conversations and private pictures, history, etc. About 4 years ago she asked to check one of my convos and found out a little bit more of my sexuality than id like. Long story short, we agreed that I was just “confused” and that we wouldn’t tell anyone, because at this point I wasn’t ready to share that part of my life (I’m still not). Anyways, a week later, we had a (very hispanic) family party in our house (which happens to have very thin walls) and as soon as i took a break going to the bathroom, she took the liberty to tell absolutely EVERYONE about our little fight earlier, and all I could do was walk out of the bathroom, and put on my poker face. For the next two years, whenever anything LGBTQ was mentioned in the TV or anything, she would avoid looking at me and tear up a little. \n\nSo, now that you’re all caught up, you should be able to tell that our relationship was never the same again. She gives me more privacy, not checking my phone and letting me go out with friends, etc. Im still not fully out, and everyone acts as if nothing happened. My mom got divorced about a year ago and we live alone,but we still rarely see each other with us both having lots of events and things to do. I like being alone in the house, and have a couple trust issues, but nothing like major trauma, I simply take a bit longer to do things some people might jump right into with each other. I think that recently she’s finally realized that were not nearly as close as we used to be and wants to do something about it, like spending tons of time together, talking about our friends and family, me taking her to school events to meet my friends, just spending doing a lot of activities together and “trying to fix things”.\n\nI am not interested. I have good grades and many community service hours, and have done lots of research and have scholarships available for me. When I turn 18, I plan on moving out to an out of state university (yes i have been saving up quite a bit) and living either by myself or with a few friends. My mom wants to spend time with me but I never really looked at her the same after I realized how manipulative and crazy she used to be. I also don’t need another incident like the previous one happening, and having to come out to my (very hispanic) family sooner than I have to. I know I should give her the chance, but I don’t know how comfortable i feel letting her further into my life, and i would rather things stay the same way, does that make me an asshole?",

      "description": "My sister bought a brand new car 5 or 6 years ago. For all that time she never put a dime of money into the car for maintenance; oil changes were done once a year maybe; it's now got 300,000 kms on it, and in the last few months she has found she is running into problem after problem after problem.\n\nI have 2 vehicles: a pickup truck, and a car. I work in the trades so I use my truck to deposit and remove tools from jobs a couple days of the week, and drive the car for getting to work the days in between, and all my general running around. I pay an extra $100 a month in insurance to add the car to my policy, but having the car saves me from $300-400 monthly in gas bills. So it was a good buy.\n\nNow, in the last couple months when my sister's car has been off the road or in the shop for a few days, it naturally falls to me (being the owner of two vehicles) to lend her one of mine. I didn't begrudge this at first, and I know she isn't wanting to borrow my car just to annoy me, but at this point I am getting a little annoyed.\n\nHer car is now on its last legs and I'm waiting to be asked to borrow mine for an undetermined amount of time. It irritates me because I feel like it's not my fault she was irresponsible for the last 6 years and didn't maintain her car. I pay insurance for my own vehicles, and to me that car is literally worth $400 a month. I'm losing money every day that she borrows it. \n\nShe is rough on her own car...I don't want to know how she drives mine. Not to mention the fact that she likes to drive around smoking with the windows up if it's cold out, and is heedless of whether she slops her 5 Tim Horton's teas a day all over the interior of a vehicle. \n\nI bought my car cheap and used, higher kms, so it's not like it's a brand new Mustang that I'm worried about being treated recklessly, but still...it's my car, lol. I feel bad because I think I'm being petty, but also annoyed by the fact that because I have two vehicles, it's like I'm obliged to lend one of them out. Is that how it works?\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "The reason I'm posting this is because I've been thinking things through and I've come to the decision that when I move out, I will lose contact with my mother. \n\nShe's incredibly toxic in my life and I think losing her as a contact will improve my life. For the past 15 years she has dragged me through the mud. I'm the only child she has custody of out of the 4 kids she's given birth to. \n\nShe doesn't even have full custody of me, she only has me because my father is in prison. She gave my oldest sister to my gradparents (because she was doing meth), so my sister only learned we had the same mother back in 2016. My youngest sister was put into foster care because my mother was affiliated with a gang.\n\nMy younger brother's father (none of us have the same fathers) gained custody of him and refuses to let my mother see him. If that was it, I wouldn't be here posting this...\n\nFor the past 15 years, I've lived all over the U.S and my mother has been with over 10 men. Each one was worst then the last. She only recently met a man who was the nicest man I've ever met. My childhood was ruined by the time I was 12, because my mother would stand by as I would be beaten and thrown around in a room by her boyfriend. She alway buys animals, putting us further into debt. \n\nInstead of being in a house, we are living in a 29 foot camper. With 3 dogs, 5 cats, and she plans on getting 2 more dogs. She pays $1k for each dog. Less then a year ago, she had an idea to move out to the middle of the desert. Of course, she had to perchase at least 500 chickens (not an over exageration, she would buy a bunch of 25 chickens each time), 6 goats, 9 pigs, and 2 turkeys. Meanwhile we were living in a shed. A 25 x 10 ft shed. \n\nWe were 40 minutes away from any hospital, so if me or her new boyfriend got rammed by a goat, we were fucked. Oh, and by the way, we didn't have running water, or electricity. We stayed there in the middle of winter. Despite the fact that we were in the desert, it snowed. Many times. We had our camping toilet *outside*. \n\nWe argue all the time, I can't stand spending more than 3 hours together.  She manipulates everyone she's near. And after all of this... Will I be the asshole if I lose contact with her when I move out?",

      "description": "I've been on this sub for a bit, and I finally thought to post something.\n\nEveryone knows in high school how guys like to tease girls, flirt, etc. I've had this specific group of about 5-6 guys in my history class (and a few of them in other classes like language and PE), and with my schedule I always see them in class 2 or 3 times per week. These are the types of \"nice guys,\" (in my opinion) always trying to show off and impress people. No matter if I walk into class early in the morning or in the middle of the day, at least 1 or 2 of them always approach me, either saying something about how cool and great they are, or how much I mean to them. Now I know for a fact I don't like ANY of these guys. I think their behavior is just rude, especially when I've told them since last year that I have no interest in going on a date or anything. They don't listen when I simply tell them no or that I don't want to. I even told them I liked someone else once, and they paid that no mind.\n\nOftentimes, I'm ashamed to admit, I do end up getting annoyed and angry and it sometimes devolves into an argument. It's been going on for months, and I do know that some of the things I said could be taken in a rude context.\n\nie 'Nice Guy:' *\"(name), why won't you go out with me? Come on, I'm great!\"* Me: *\"There's nothing I find remotely attractive about you. That's it. Now please stop asking. I have no interest in going on a date with you.\"*\n\nThey say I'm being rude, but I think it's just how they take it because I don't want to date them like they want me to. Am I really being that rude, or is it alright for me to say things in a slightly less positive context if it gets the point across?",

      "description": "Throwaway for reasons.\n\n8 months ago my husband passed away. He had an adult son from a previous marriage and the two of them weren't very close. I don't think they hated each other or anything like that. Honestly, I think the divorce had more to do with it. Because of reasons I won't go into here, his ex-wife basically had sole custody of their son and the two of them never had a chance to fix that relationship. \n\nAnyway, my husband held some animosity about the whole affair because he felt like his son sided against him in the divorce. Right before he passed he made me promise not to give his relatives any of his possessions (he had a bad relationship with his family and he owned some family heirlooms) and I asked him \"what about \\[son's name\\]\" and he paused and he said \"he doesn't get anything either\". Honestly, I was shocked, but I was pretty much grieving at this point so I didn't question it. \n\nWell, about a month ago his son reached out to me over email asking if he could have a couple of his father's items. He said he's been regretting that they never repaired their relationship and that he never got to say a proper goodbye. The items he asked about were small things like a gold lighter he remembers (I still have it) and a blue button up shirt (I don't know which one specifically, but I still have all of his old clothes). I responded and told him that unfortunately it would go against his father's wishes to give him anything and he replied very politely \"I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks for responding.\" and that was it. \n\nAbout a week later his mother sends me an email calling me names and a bitch for not giving her son the things he asked for and that I'm basically preventing him from moving on. I didn't respond and I blocked her email and I haven't heard anything since. \n\nI've been feeling sick ever since this happened. I'm still trying to move on from his passing and I'm not trying to stop him from moving on, I'm just trying to honor my deceased husbands wishes, but I feel like I've done the wrong thing and I don't know how to handle this. \n\nWas she right?

      "description": "Okay, I really need an outside point of view on this because I’m too emotional to think straight. My boyfriend split up with his now-ex in May 2018. They both had agreed to an open relationship in the beginning of 2018 (i met him in March) and in May they decided to officially split and she moved across the country. \n\nAfter a few months of dating (around June/July), he began spending 100% of his time at my place. He still has his own place and lease, and his place costs about half of what mine does per month. I make more than he does, but not significantly more. He always said he had trouble paying bills (in fact I’ve leant him money for this, some of which he still hasn’t paid back), so I never asked him to chip in for any expenses. We take turns paying on the rare occasion we go out on a date.\n\nToday I learned that he’s been sending his ex hundreds of dollars per month. Every month. Anywhere from $100-250 per week. I’m PISSED and demanded he stop - he literally **borrowed money from me to give to her.**\n\nNow here’s where I may be the asshole. They were still doing the “open relationship” thing through April, and they found out she was pregnant just before she moved away. This was before we were exclusive, so while it sucks, it wasn’t a cheating issue. The child was born at the end of December, and they have not gone to court or filed anything about child support (which is now pretty evident why). \n\nI told him that he (1) needs to sort it out in court, and (2) until then, he can and should  pay for everything for that child that she sends him a receipt for. However, no more paying for her hair (she gets it done extravagantly in rainbow colors, definitely not a home-done thing), her clothes, and everything else in her lifestyle that she loves to brag about on Facebook. Supporting the kid is fine, but ZERO money to her. \n\nHe thinks I’m being unreasonable and that he owes it to her and her (not his) 11 year old son from a previous relationship to keep funding whatever they want, although he’s at least admitted that he shouldn’t have borrowed money from me for “bills” to send to her. \n\nAITA for putting my foot down and forbidding him to send any more money that’s not baby-related?",

      "description": "This is something thats been bugging me for a while but i feel too involved to think rationally about it. \n\nSince probably early 2018, ive only spoken to/seen my sister twice. once for our dad's birthday, and once for christmas. Both times were brief and we behaved like normal. It's the product of a lot of things, and it feels difficult to explain because of how complicated family dynamics can get. Of course we had our petty sibling fights and we've always been completely different people, but theres one big incident I just cant seem to get past. \n\nIn 2016 I overheard a conversation she had with my mom on speakerphone in the same room. saying now that she's found religion, she can't find it in her heart to be okay with gay or trans people. I'm a gay trans man, and my family knows this, has known this as I'd been out for almost 5 years at that point. I know she wasnt talking to me, and maybe I wasn't meant to hear, but I spoke up to ask what she meant, and then she repeated the sentiment, now actually to me. \n\nI definitely overreacted to this, but understand that my sister was one of the first people to ask my new chosen name. She used to be the only family member who I thought supported me. The change was shocking and saddening and my reaction to it, which included deciding i won't tolerate my identity being disrespected, led to being kicked out of my mom's place two weeks before I was supposed to move into a place with my boyfriend. Afterwards, no one really talked about it. I distanced myself, and focused on my transition and work. I never received an apology for her words which I guess I don't deserve because she was just saying how she truly feels. But I truly feel like I don't want to be around her more than necessary since I know i'll be deadnamed, misgendered, that my nieces will be told to call me Aunt, and that my boyfriend will just be my 'friend'. I'm well over a year into my transition, and I don't sound or look like a woman anymore. It's painful to experience. \n\nRecently, though, she's going through a lot. Divorce, with two young kids, which can't be easy. She's also isolated herself from my mom and her side of the family for an incident that, objectively, she is in the wrong for. Ive been urged to reach out to her, but I don't even know what I would do. Even one of my managers at work who knows her (his wife did my sisters laundry) approached me at work to tell me I should be there for her. Which I think is a little inappropriate but what do I know. Yesterday even my mom told me I should be the one to break the silence between us, because she is family. so, if I don't, am I the asshole??  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I’ve got a really close friend who recently came out to me as MtF transgender. We’ve always gotten along really well, but since she’s started her transition Ive started to get the feeling that she’s been copying me - a lot. \n\nIt started off with little things. She talked about really looking up to my style and asked to go thrifting with me. Of course I agreed. But over the past few months she’s started doing more and more of the same things as me- poetry, yoga, listening to the same music, watching the same shows. I wouldn’t mind if she was just taking inspiration from me or if she only did a few of these things, but I’m genuinely feeling like she is taking my entire personality. \n\nSo far, I haven’t been able to bring myself to say anything to her. I know that transitioning is difficult and that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery— but I also don’t think it’s an excuse to copy every aspect of my style, interests, and personality. I don’t want to cut ties with her because she’s genuinely a really good person, but right now I’m honestly resenting her too much to think straight. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "For 5 years I’ve been building resentment towards my in-laws. I’ve tried over and over and over to cultivate some form of functioning relationship with them only to be crushed by their consistent grumpiness and meanness.\n\nSo I met them 5 years ago when I met my husband. We were younger and dumber. A lot of drama happened and I ended up moving in with them and my future husband for a little while so we could get our bearings before we moved out together. During that time I had been going through a really rough patch in my depression and spent the majority of my time either at work or locked away in our room. I didn’t have many friends and my in laws were not very friendly. \n\nMy father in law is a “don’t tread on me”, hard-R, Republican ‘Christian’ who goes to Church of Christ and believes gay people should be castrated and trans folk should be lynched. Also uses the phrase “master race” unironically to defend his white Italian blood. My parents are Norwegian and German (grandma lived in Norway, grandpa lived in Germany) so I’m very white too, but I’m not a racist religious wack job. He also believes blacks and whites shouldn’t work together, and women shouldn’t be allowed to work because they need to be homemakers. \n\nAs you might be able to see, I didn’t easily get along with him. My mother in law is a very timid woman who pretends she’s big and tough when she’s at home, but becomes very shy and quiet when her husband isn’t home. She is physically disabled yet my father in law expects her to do 99% of the housework. Once she couldn’t stand long enough to do the dishes without feeling pain and they almost divorced over it. He secludes her from the outside world and doesn’t let her have opinions. She doesn’t see the harm in this though and often praises how good he is to her, keeping her in line as a good Christian wife. \n\nI am a woman currently in my second semester of my engineering degree. I thoroughly support gay rights and trans rights. I support black lives matter and closing the wage gap. I think we should be more open about sexual education for children. I am very “liberal millennial”. I have short hair (father in law calls it lesbian hair) and hate wearing dresses and skirts. \n\nI get ZERO PERCENT along with my father in law. Literally our only similarity is our favorite movie, but it’s a horror movie we can’t watch since my son was born (much to my father in laws disapproval, he thinks a 2 year old watching The Thing will “build character”). \n\nAnyways, I put up with their garbage for a long time. My husband is a Christian but he’s not homophobic or racist or sexist. He’s okay with a lot of the things I’m okay with. I’d say he’s a loose Christian. I’m agnostic (in laws do NOT know this). \n\nWhen my son was born I decided I wanted to go to school like I always dreamed. I wanted to be a good role model for my son. My husband was ELATED because he’s always wanted to be a stay at home dad. We were so happy because once I graduate I can be the breadwinner doing what I love while he’s the home keeper doing what he loves (cooking, cleaning, organizing our schedule, etc.). My father in law LOATHES THIS.\n\nEvery single time I see him he says “how’s school going?” and I tell him. I’m getting As and Bs and just finished my finals, and I think I did good. My GPA is good and I have my sights set on a work/study program. \n\nWithout. fail. every. time. He responds with “damn it. You’re trying to prove me wrong aren’t you? I know you’ll fail eventually. I said it when you started and I’ll say it again.” and my mother in law and husband just chuckle as if he’s telling a funny joke. \n\nHe drops the hard R and fxggxt / other gay slurs. Around our son. My husband usually cuts it off and tells him well leave if he doesn’t stop, then he stops. \n\nHe’s bipolar and my husband defends him saying “he can’t control it, he’s bipolar. He means well.” But fails to take into account some of the horrible things he’s said to me. During an argument once he told me he wished my husband would leave me and get back with his ex, the one who was “prettier and nicer”. \n\nHe makes comments like that constantly. We’ll “cut them off” for awhile then let them in after awhile. I hate it. \n\nAm I the ass for wanting to just stop seeing them? I’m ok with maybe seeing them on holidays but I hate being around them. And I don’t want my son raised around thinking that’s okay. My husband does nothing to stop it. \n\nThey haven’t made a SUPER offending comment in awhile, but I still hate the little ones. I know my husband will throw a fit if I say anything because “things have been so good”.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to keep myself and my son away from my in laws?",

      "description": "My friend and I are in high school. He's very much into politics- I'm not so much- and a committed 'leftie' in his own description. He's been having problems making a lot of friends. I used to as well, but recently have been having lot's of success socially. My friend, let's call him Matt, asked me my secret. I sent him the link to a channel that really helped me: Charisma on Command. \n\nI thought he would happy to have basically a blueprint to becoming more socially skilled. However, he got upset that I recommended him a 'right-wing' channel. In hindsight, I should have guessed he would have acted like this, but at the moment I was kind of surprised. We had an interesting conversation about this. It went like this (I sometimes don't have the exact words or phrases he or I said down, since I don't remember word for word, but the general idea remains):\n\nHim: Why'd you reccomend me a right-wing propaganda channel?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHim: I thought it was supposed to be a charisma channel. But they have videos on Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, and even on Trump and why he'd win the election.\n\nMe: Did you *watch* those videos?\n\nHim: No. Why would I?\n\nMe: Well, if you did, you'd know that the video on 'Trump winning the election' was not like a 'oh, lol, trump wrecks all this stupid SJW cucks' type video. It was an analysis, and as we can see, of Trump vs Hillary's campaign and advertising, and how Trump appealed to the masses while Hillary made the mistake of playing Trump's game. It's not even a pro-Trump or anti-Trump video, just an analysis.\n\nHim: What about the videos of Jordan Peterson and Shapiro?\n\nMe: Well, they cover lots of celebs, comedians, and famous figures who they think have particular talents. For example, they have videos on people with particular confidence (Jack Black), people with a sense of humor (Russell Brand, Ellen), storytelling (Kevin Hart), or a general cool factor (Robert Downey Jr). Peterson and Shapiro do have a specific social talent, so they covered them.\n\nHim: Neither of them are charismatic though. \n\nMe: I didn't say they were charismatic, I said they had a social talent. They're good at debates, in a lot of cases. \n\nHim: The channel's title is literally Charisma on Command, and you're telling me these videos aren't about charisma?\n\nMe: Yeah... they've branched out before, in a lot of cases. They've done videos on productivity, learning faster, etc. \n\nHim: But if they do videos on so many obvious roght-wing figures, it's probably because they're right-wing.\n\nMe: I mean, they've done videos on Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton. \n\nHe got mad at me after this and left.

So I am a guy and one of my best friend's is a girl and we were hanging out by the creek and she ended up pushing me into the water and I got really wet. Later we had to go out to a fancy restaurant to meet up with some other friends and my underwear was really wet and I didn't bring a extra pair but i did have some pants so I took her underwear and I wore it. It felt weird wearing girl underwear but it was just panties not like a thong or anything. When we returned to her house my underwear dried off so I took off hers and gave it back to her and she lost her shit. She was pissed I wore it and she thought it was really weird and now she thinks I got some crossdressing or panty fetish which I don't. She's ended up burning the underwear. She is chill but she still brings it up and makes fun of me for it and it really annoys me. Also i did the same thing to my sister last month and when she found she cursed me out for 5 minutes and wouldnt talk to me for a week. ",

      "title": "AITA for making my sister pick up my nephew early?",
      "description": "This is a long one folks! \n\nI'm in my mid-late twenties, and I live with my mom for a lot of reasons. My sister is in her 30s and is married with a 2 year old kid. My mom and I live pretty close to my sister's family. I'm not sure when exactly it started, but somehow this arrangement developed where my mom and I watch her son basically every weekend. I know this definitely started before his first birthday, and it's continued to today(a few months after his second birthday). If there's 52 weeks in a year, I'm certain I've watched my nephew for over 40 weekends. I'm allowed to make outside plans and they can't/won't really say anything to protest it. It used to mean he wouldn't come, but then it gradually became my mom watching him by herself. Something to note is that unless my mom is running late, all the communication and arrangements for this is between my sister and our mom. I think maybe twice my sister contacted me letting me know the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway I recently started a full time job(M-F 40+ hours a week). After my first week, my nephew came over, and then when my sister picked him up on Sunday evening it was around 8pm. I felt burnt out and exhausted, and I kind of had the realization that the reason why I initially didn't mind the arrangement so much was because most of that time was when I was either unemployed, or employed part time. Now I'm in a new field and I'm trying my best to learn more by reading books and taking a udemy class(for the time being) as well. That being said, really what I needed was time to myself, time to decompress and not be stressed out. I kind of realized the part of the deal where I can make weekend plans wasn't that great because, that doesn't account for when I just want to chill out and play video games on the weekend, or even work on my udemy class for that matter(if I stayed at a cafe or something for too long my mom will call telling me to come over asap). The next week he didn't come for a reason that I forgot. And the week after that was last week. When his parents came to pick him up on Sunday I had a somewhat awkward conversation with my sister. I love the boy so it was really hard for me to say that I can't watch him any more(at least this regularly) but it was a hard thing for me to accept. The conversation went like this:\n\nMe: Hey....I don't think I can do this any more.\n\nSister: Do what?\n\nMe: It just feels like I'm working 7 days a week and saturday and sunday are the most stressful days.\n\nSister: Watching \\[nephew\\]?\n\nMe: Yes\n\nSister: Ok..(looking away)\n\nIt should be noted that her husband was in earshot of this conversation. That was it. They went home, and fast forward to yesterday(Friday). I'm having dinner with my mom and she mentions the nephew. I tell her that I told my sister that I don't want to see him regularly anymore. She starts protesting and arguing with me. Saying things like I don't have to leave my room when he's here(which is BS, he will call for me and look for me, and I can't exactly ignore him when that happens, once he's here, he's here and there's no way to compromise that space). She also says she lives in this house too and she wants to see him so she should get what she wants(although at 40+ weekends a year, I think I should get at least 12 where I get the say, but you can also argue that him being here on the weekend shouldn't even be the default option but I digress, my point is that I should be allowed to refuse every now and again).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich brings me to today, I slept late last night and was woken up to the sound of tiny foot steps running down the hall. My sister is here with her son. I'm..confused, in part because I was woken up abruptly and in part because I'm kind of afraid of pushing the matter and assuming the worst. My sister mentions that their house is getting painted and that they were going to the park soon, and I decide to assume that she was just making a quick stop in the cold weather because they didn't want him around while painting. I ended up taking a nap(because I woke up \"early\") and I wake up to my mom alone with my nephew, sister nowhere in sight. I stop being in denial and text my sister saying that I wasn't expecting him to come over, and that I didn't appreciate that she blatantly ignored what I said about not being able to watch him any more. She just said \"sorry\" and \"ok\". After a bit I just scream in frustration and my nephew sees me and leaves the room(something I'm very ashamed of). I decided enough was enough, I texted both of his parents one thing: \"What time are you picking up \\[nephew\\] tonight?\" Very aggressively not giving them the option to let him sleep over. My sister starts texting me saying she's sorry her son is a burden for me but it feels hurtful the way I communicated it and thanked me for watching him. I told her we need to have a proper conversation to establish boundaries. She mentions I also need to talk to our mom because our mom said he could sleep over. I explain that the short version of the story is that things are different with my new job. My sister suggested she come over on the weekends with him but I explained that that's not going to solve the problem. My sister explains that she just told our mom this morning that he was coming over because they didn't realize how big of a paint job this would be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I piece together the facts so far:\n\n1. I did mention to my sister that I can't watch my nephew any more, and granted it wasn't elaborated on, but I definitely said enough to indicate that I'm exhausted.\n2. I told my mom just last night over dinner that I'm exhausted and I don't want to see my nephew specifically this weekend. She argued with me about it but I did make it clear.\n3. My sister called my mom this morning to let her know she was dropping off the nephew at our house.\n4. My mom told my sister it was ok if he spent the night at our home.\n\nIn other words: I told both of them that I'm burnt out and tired and don't want to watch my nephew, and they contacted each other and agreed that he would spend the night. Somewhere(or everywhere), there lies a complete disrespect for me when I brought this up before it would be a problem, and now that I'm making a big fuss they're finally listening very begrudgingly. I told my sister that contacting our mom does NOT count as contacting me. Her yes does not always mean mine and she needs mine too. Anyway they come to pick him up like an hour and a half later, my mom is very upset by this and my brother in law is just awkwardly avoiding talking to me. My sister said they won't be coming next week(they'll be in Miami) and that's kind of where it ended. I'm mentally exhausted, and none of this feels remotely close to resolved, but I really think I need a break from this arrangement and I want my nephew to not see me in this exhausted, low patience, irritable state. My mom accuses me of being mean to the nephew when I'm not holding him accountable for anything and besides the screaming(which to clarify: was not at him, he just saw/heard me scream) I haven't been treating him poorly today.\n\nSo, am I the asshole here?",

      "title": "AITA For Cutting My Closest Friend Out Of My Life Because Of a Few Things He Said",
      "description": "AITA? So this happened this week and I want to know if I am the asshole. \n\nPreface: My friend is a neck beard through and through, he loves Loli porn, is a weeb and is an anti-theist to the point of calling the people who are religious idiots. I have been in a 4-3 week long depression where I have begun to cut myself and have had suicidal ideation for the past week and a half, when I get suicidal I start looking for religion to try and find meaning in order to keep myself alive because it is better than being a nihilist in that state. (For those curious I am male).  \nStory Time: So in my depression I tried to find some reason to stay alive, my friend (we will call him neck beard) was taking to me when I drunk about 3 8oz glasses of tequila broke down into tears, crying how I was unworthy of any friendship (I have been bullied horrible my entire scholastic career)  and how I have been depressed for the last 3 weeks and how I needed someone to talk me out of doing anything stupid (like cutting myself). He pretty well by having me entertained by playing Dark Souls, but when he went to bed I took out my knife and gave myself a nice long cut along my upper leg. In the morning I asked him what I'd done because there was blood in my boxers and a knife stuck in my leg and he told me I drank and he fell asleep. This continues on for a few days until in a video call I got out of my chair and Neck Beard asks why my undies were bloodstain and asked why I had about 4 bandages on my leg and I told him that I had been really depressed and how I had been cutting myself to feel better. The first thing he said was \"Why? You have no reason to be depressed.\" This had a horrible affect on my psyche and for the next week he constantly said that I had no reason what so ever to be depressed. I was/am looking at Catholicism as my religion of chiose when he said, \"Why are you wearing all of those religious paraphernalia are you stupid?\" (at this time I was wearing a roserie and a Benedictine cross. I said no this was to keep my catholic friend happy. Then the next day I was in tears, I was trying to get Neck Beard's girlfriend out of the abusive relationship with him when suddenly he said something all the lines of \"You asshole, why are you doing this to me. You do realize that if she goes then my mental health will suffer and if you go then I will spiral into a depression.\" That broke me down into tears, as a child with a big squishy heart I was always taught to help those who needed it but were to proud to accept it (my grandfather was a perfect example of this mentality) and to vocalize your opinion about something if you think it is in someone's best interest. So when I was trying to get his girlfriend out of the abusive relationship, I lost it. I started crying and profusely asking for their forgiveness, I was saying how it wasn't my place to judge and how worthless my opinion should be to them because I was just trying to stop their relationship from becoming even more abusive. They calmed me down kinda, I was still in hysterics but it was more manageable. Until the next wave of suicidal ideation came along and I said \"You know what? This word would be better off without me because all I've been able to do is harm my best friend's relationship and what sort of friend would do that?\" With that they tried to calm me down, I ended up leaving the  Discord call about 3-6 times, on the 6th time they managed to keep me from leaving and I went into hysterics about how I was a horrible person for trying to break up their abusive relationship and how I shouldn't be depressed when my friend pulls this whopper on me, \"You know (My name) I have never committed suicide because I am stronger than that.\" So he calls me weak, which to be frank doesn't help anything and I start to internalize what he said because I have attempted suicide about 3 times in my life, so he was calling me weak and then he starts to copy my crying and breathing patterns. After that I was considering commiting suicide and then he says this, \"If you commit suicide, then you are directly responsible for the deaths and all of the horrible things that would happen to my friends (one of my friends suffers from extreme depression and the other one is bipolar 1).\" That was when I decided to cut off all communication with my friend and after a few days away from that decision I feel much better then I did with my friend.  \n\n\nSo my question is, am I the asshole in this situation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My friend says some horrible things to me and I cut off all contact with him",

By the time K and I have finished one drink, S has finished five. After about seven (and this woman is pretty small), I tell her she needs to stop drinking, or at least slow down, because she's drunk enough she can barely sit up. She gets super pissed at me, and immediately orders another glass. K and I exchange glances, and I tell her to at least drink some water. She angrily declines, and K and I decide it's time to go.\n\n When we leave, S runs across four lanes of traffic to grab a taxi (instead of waiting two minutes for the crosswalk light).

      "description": "For whatever reason, whenever I get up in the morning I'm in a fairly bad mood. Usually I just get up, get a protein bar and a glass of milk, take a shower, get dressed and leave or go back to my room. It goes away after \\~1h. My flatmate knows this. This morning she was nonstop talking, asking me what I was going to do etc.  I didn't mind too much, but obviously I responded with less enthusiasm and in a deeper, more grumpy voice than usual. And that's when it got annoying... \n\n\"Wow, you're in a bad mood today!\"\n\n\"I'm not, but I just got up five minutes ago.\"\n\n\\*goes on with bullshit, I'm still responding the same way\\*\n\n\"Everything ok? You sound depressed.\"\n\nAnd here I might have overreacted. I'm not a guy who smiles like an idiot when there is nothing to be happy about. I'm not depressed though and I'm sick of hearing that, so I asked her what her fucking problem was and told her to fucking leave me alone and get a dog if she wanted to see a happy face in the morning. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Bit of background. My family has been extremely abusive and neglecting of me and my siblings which I was blind to until recently.  Our family is in bad relationship with all of our relatives so I had no point of reference.\n\nWe were flat out denied to learn simple human skills like cooking because “you don’t need that with us” and “you are too useless to be independent anyway”.\n\nNow on the story. I started going to university but wasn’t allowed to move to campus so I spend four and half hours every day simply to get back and forth to uni. \n\nI made friends who all opened my eyes that this is abnormal and I as an adult (20f) should be able to make my own decisions and my sleep deprivation caused by travel is affecting my performance.\n\nI found that one of my friends is in search of a roommate and I immediately agreed because I will have off rent and groceries if I agree to practice cooking (I can make food to live off despite everything) because she is busy with her job.\n\nNow on one hand I would like to inform my parents in advance but on the other hand I know they will do everything to keep me from leaving and I am not immune to it especially if they include my siblings. But I will also feel bad putting them on the spot.\n\nSo WIBTA if I proceeded with telling them only a week prior that I am moving out and then got all my stuff out within a day?",

The relationship deteriorated quickly after I found her cheating on me despite my support in taking her to her appointments and visiting her when she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, years later, I'm in a much MUCH better relationship with a great person who has supported me in my efforts to go back to graduate school, and progress professionally.

You don’t need this!” To them and they gave me a smile then turned around and left. I was a bit shocked and wondered if I should run out and get them but the person I was working with assured me that my sarcasm was perfectly clear and assumed they’d had just left momentarily to continue the joke. Though, they never came back and later I asked the student  if they knew I was kidding to which they replied “sorta”.  Of course I apologized and confirmed I was only joking but I didn’t get any acknowledgement from them. I can’t help but feel bad about it because I don’t want them to not feel welcome or anything but at the same time I’m not quite sure how my sarcasm could be misinterpreted since we’ve interacted many times before where I made sarcastic comments that they didn’t have any trouble understanding.",

The problem is: she's doing multiple different celebrations with different groups and the only person required to attend all of them is me. Here's a rough schedule:\n\nSaturday: Birthday dinner and game night with friends\nSunday: Full day with just me\nMonday: Dinner with her family\nTuesday: Actual birthday dinner\n\nProblem is that I've got a lot of other things to do or obligations that I'm trying to work around. She wanted me to sleep at her place after game night, but while she's waiting for renovations on her house, she's living with her parents for the next few months and my dog doesn't do well in strange houses, so I stayed until 1am. \n\nThen her friend had an emergency Sunday, so she cancelled our plans. Totally understandable. \n\nTonight I went to family dinner, but didn't meet them at their house to ride in the same car, choosing to drive myself because I just left a work event. This turned into an absolute screaming fit by her about how I ruined her birthday and how I didn't do a single thing that she wanted. I responded by saying I've been to every event with more on the books, but I've only slightly modified them to work a little bit better for me, and that she needed to stop being spoiled and acting like adults get birthday weeks. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "So: some background before I begin. \n\nI’m 19 and I’m that kid who hasn’t really had a rebellious phase and usually does what my parents say. I wouldn’t say I’m an angelic kid, I just don’t really like arguing because my father can get violent when he’s mad and I don’t have the energy to enter into debates either.  (My mom can be scary too but I blame my dad for making her that way because he throws things at her and I can think of 10 occasions where he has hit her and kicked her...not like the movies where she gets a black eye or whatever but it has caused her a great deal of emotional pain and 2/10 times, physical pain) I don’t want my mom to get hurt by my angry dad too. \n\nAnyways, I have made snarky remarks or shouted back at him when it gets too much but I usually back off and apologise eventually but not today. A point of contention between us is usually the career I’m going to pursue in uni and today was no exception. I would want to do early childhood edu or mass communications (those are my interests) but he always insists on me being a doctor because the pay is high (Yup you guessed it, we’re asian!) but I know deep down he wants me to pursue medicine for two reasons 1) Because he himself failed the medicine interview because he said something wrong 2) Because all his friends have children that are doctors of lawyers.\n\nThe agreement we settled on was this: If my A level grades are good enough, I would just apply for Medicine in University X for the lols. But at the same time, I will apply for Accountancy (a ‘compromise’ course between the two of us because Accountancy is the next best thing) in University Y. I can choose to reject Medicine in University X in the end and I don’t have to do anything to buff up my resume for it. (In Singapore where I’m from, your resume is quite important to get selected)\n\nAll of a sudden today he insists that I participate in a community project that does eye check ups for the elderly. I said no because that was not what we agreed on. \n\nIts really not that I don’t want to do community service but I’m starting work soon and I have million of things I have to do. Also, his purpose is not for me to provide goodwill to the community but for me to get into a course that I hate. \n\nHe knows Medicine is bad for me because Medicine is a competitive course and I am REALLY REALLY easily stressed. But he shouted at me and said that even if I committed suicide after two weeks he would send me off happily! (twice with so much vigour you would think he was possessed because I said nothing vulgar or in a loud voice) + I should go to my room and shut the door TIGHT. (the emphasis on the word ‘tight’ insinuating I should suffocate myself to death I guess?) I felt super heartbroken because he knows I have entertained serious thoughts of suicide multiple times throughout my life (once was just 3 months ago)\n\nI then shouted back at him that I would not even want to breathe the same air as him (which to be fair is a really elementary and lame retort) but he came charging towards me saying that I need to take it back and apologise with the loudest voice I have ever heard. In my fear I closed the door and locked it before he could do anything to me. He continued to shout at me saying I am a bad daughter for shouting. \n\nThe thing I feel bad about is that, not only did I make him angry at me, he is now angry at my mom who stood up for me. I also revealed by accident that she told me privately that she would support me in whatever course I do (something we both know might incur his wrath). Within minutes he began throwing things around and raising his voice at her which is making me scared af. (things have cooled down between them for now though)\n\nAITA the asshole for making my father upset and also creating the risk that he may hurt my mom? I used to think he did love me (he is really really nice to me when he isn’t mad) but he just told me to die and recently he seems more obsessed with his image rather than my life? \n\nPs: I have a sister who is keen on medicine and he doesn’t even shout at her while he calls me names like fat pig (I am slightly chubby), ugly, idiot and points his fingers violently in front of my face like a maniac. He is really proud of everything she does, even if rude towards him, and happily says that “Haha, this is karma for when I was rude to my parents. She’s indeed Papa’s daughter.” The thing is when he’s lonely I always talk to him, keep him company, hug him etc which she doesn’t do in the slightest. I feel so heartbroken that being a doctor is all he cares about, really, but thats besides the point.\n\ntl;dr - Dad who wants me to do Medicine but I don’t want to. Proceeds to tell me he’s okay if I died and starts throwing things at my mom because he’s pissed off. ",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I are both first-years attending the same university. We both take a pretty heavy course load as we plan on at least double majoring and potentially even graduating early. I say this because the amount of work we do puts us both under a lot of pressure and sometimes it feels to me like there is too much to handle. When I do begin to feel overwhelmed, I like to just hang out with my friends or have some alone time where I read, watch Youtube, or do something of that nature to relax.\n\nShe, on the other hand, is very much someone who likes to spend every moment together. We have even had a conversation about how I, personally, \"recharge\" alone after we spend a lot of time together, but she is able to \"recharge\" with me, and, furthermore, prefers to be with me while doing so.\n\nShe is always jumping at new opportunities to do anything together, sometimes even bringing up trips that her friends plan and asking if I would like to join, and if I say no, she tries to refute any reason I could potentially have not to.\n\nI mean, I do completely love spending time with her, but we spend all week together. We eat almost every meal together, sit together while doing homework, she tries to cuddle while I try to work, which is ok, but sometimes logistically impractical, and she expects to be invited anywhere I go. Pretty much any waking hour spent not in class, she wants to be together. We also hang out with our friends together whenever either of us hangs out with them, which is probably part of the problem. Sometimes she will hang out with our friends without me but almost never vice versa. When I do happen to do something without her, I can't tell her about it without her getting jealous. Especially if it involves something she could have been a part of otherwise. We also have an issue where if she asks if I would like to join her in doing something and I say no, she gets noticeably disappointed, so I am weary of saying no.\n\nI was afraid to tell her that I was feeling overwhelmed by the amount of time we spend together, but decided to go ahead and be honest rather than pretending nothing was wrong.\n\nWhen we talked about it, she was obviously very upset and told me that it seemed like we've been spending less and less time together. I agreed that this was probably true, and that it was probably a result of me feeling like I needed to make more time for myself. She said that the point of a relationship is to spend time together and that if you don't want to, it's because you don't like or care about that person. I made it clear to her that I do want to spend time with her, just not *all* of my time. She still feels like she loves me more than I love her or that I don't love her or that she isn't enough for me. I have verbally expressed to her that I love her, love spending time with her, and that she is entirely enough for me and that she shouldn't have to be enough for me because she is amazing as is. She replied that she doesn't understand how that could be true because I don't want to spend time with her.\n\nI don't want to lose her over something like this and am worried that I've made her insecure and irreparably damaged the relationship. I don't feel that being honest about it was wrong, but I do regret hurting her.  AITA?",

      "description": "I have been working as a Legal Assistant with a law firm for just over six years and walked off the job yesterday in a fit of a rage.  For these six years, it has been a wonderful relationship -- my employer is a solo practitioner and I was his first and only Legal Assistant until yesterday's events.\n\nMy employer recently hired a new Associate who took it upon herself to treat me like absolute shit.  As a Legal Assistant, my duties are LEGAL related, ie; editing and drafting documents, calendar management, processing client payments, filing documents at court, phone coverage, etc.  However, the new Associate assigned me her PERSONAL duties:  Grocery shopping, driving across town in traffic to buy her favorite chocolates, making returns to clothing stores, driving to her house to let maintenance technicians in, etc.  She yelled at me a lot.  I would get panic attacks and dreaded coming in to work.  I would have no problem performing these duties if I was a PERSONAL Assistant, but I am a LEGAL Assistant and my objective is to ensure everyone in my firm has their LEGAL responsibilities in order.\n\nAt first I obliged, seeing as she was new and I figured my employer would have a word with her.  This went on for two months and every day I grew that much more resentful.  Finally, I had a private meeting with my supervisor a few weeks ago and even typed up a note detailing my frustrations and how I am being taken advantage of.  He promised me he would speak with her, but her demands continued.\n\nYesterday was the last straw; While working at my desk, I overheard her talking about me to our Receptionist.  She wasn't exactly pleasant - stating how I'm not up to par with her standards and how she spoke to my boss about me.  She was telling our Receptionist how much they pay me and said she wants to lower my pay.  My blood started boiling and I could feel myself about to lose my shit.\n\nI have no idea what came over me, but I walked to over to our filing cabinet, pulled out all of our folders, and dumped all of their contents to the floor.  I imagine it was about 40-50 clients worth of papers.  I then grabbed my things and walked out of the office before telling the Associate \"Go fuck yourself, you stupid bitch.\"  She was absolutely shocked.\n\nOn my home, I was seething.  Still pissed off when I got home, I texted my boss saying I will not be returning to work Monday and that he'll have to find himself another Assistant.  Both her and she have tried calling, texting, and e-mailing me, but I haven't responded, except for one text where I sent her the middle finger emoji.  \n\nThis morning I felt a twinge of guilt, as I know it was HER that made me miserable and not him .. but then again, there was no loyalty there.  Fuck you Sweta, I hate you!",

He has three kids, one of them is young enough where I spend my time taking care of her during the day. I was upset for feeling under appreciated for all that I do around the house. I started a fight with him on purpose about not cleaning up after himself and said I needed some space. After I left, I bought a weeks worth of time at a hotel with some cash that he gave for emergencies. I stayed at the hotel for couple days and then called him to say that I needed a break. On the second to last day at my hotel I met someone at the bar and I brought him back to the room. We didn’t do anything physical but we were in bed together. I am unsure if I need to tell my boyfriend about what happened since it happened while we were on break. Am I the asshole for cuddling with someone else while on break?",

      "description": "Well I guess I should start from the top, this all happened about a year ago when I was in high school, I started talking to this girl my friends new over snapchat. This started around September. One day she approached me at lunch and recognized me from pictures from me with my friends. We talked a bit and exchanged social medias and stuff and later that day she snapped me, we talked till about 2 am that day and got to know each other a bit. This continued for a couple weeks and then one night she told me she didn't trust people because she was sexually assaulted. It was a bit random but I told her I felt bad for her and felt bad for her situation. and then the conversations changed a bit to how much she liked my friends as people. I didn't mind it at first because I was just happy to be talking to someone. Then things got a bit more repetitive and she would talk about only what was previously stated and her obsession with my best friends dog. To the point where it was her phone background, she didn't actually talk to my friend but screenshotted everything she could find on the dog and would constantly talk about stealing it in a joking manner most of the time. One day she also told me she would let me die if it meant saving their dog out of nowhere. Although I found it a bit odd I kept talking to her and whenever I wouldn't respond for a while (like a couple hours or so) she would freak out (not at me specifically) and think the worst case scenario like I died or something. Yet when she would do the same thing and I would ask about it she would just waive it off as something normal. I just kinda went with it and made an effort to respond as much as I could to her messages and snapchats we kept talking about it. This continued for a few months and we had hung out a couple times as well in person and those seemed to go well, she seemed a bit more normal then and more relaxed. Another note is that around March she told me she was planning on going by my house on my birthday, she found out where I lived when her friend dropped me off at my house one day. She made it very clear she was planning on coming by multiple days and then the week before in may she asked when I'd be home that day. I told her when and didn't have time to make other plans with my friends because I had a trip later that day. Then the day my birthday happens I hear nothing from her and ask her if she was still coming and she just kind of waves it off saying she can't come because she doesn't have a ride. Although this would have just been unlucky, she sends me a pic on snap of her later hanging out with her friends (who would have given her a ride) while im still at home. As the days passed on she started to open up a bit more and talk about how toxic her friends are and the stuff they would do around her and to her. She was pretty sheltered and her friends would always talk about sex and stuff which made her uncomfortable. She'd always ask for advice from me and I'd just say to stop hanging out with them. I'd offer to hang out with her and stuff a few times and she had accepted but never actually made herself available so those plans would fizzle out. That was a bit disappointing but I kept talking to her and stuff and the conversations continued. One day she straight up asked to come over to my house and I was working that night so she said she'd come by there. I dont hear anything from her for a couple hours and find out she just went to go hang out with her friends somewhere else instead and never comes. At the same time she would still talk about how she hated her friends and stuff but keep hanging out with them and post it on her social medias. She would always say stuff like I'm her only friend and I'm the only one who listens to her and she would say stuff like she loved me and cared an stuff and how I'm her best friend. Eventually, graduation happened and summer time took place. I was preparing to move across country in a few months and only had so much more time to spend with my friends. She would always talk about how much she would miss me but never make the efforts to actually hang out in real life over the summer. Eventually her graduation party came around and she gave all her guest formal invites. She had told me for months that she would want me there but as the time came closer she talked about it less. When she handed out invites all of her friends received invites while school was still in session (3 weeks ago in the middle of may) and all I recieved was a text message the week before asking if I wanted to come. It was slightly irritating because she   knew my work schedule and knew I had to request time of in advance. I still managed to make time to go last minute though. While I was at the party I met all her other friends who she seemed a lot more comfortable with and she didn't really talk to me much during the event. Then a few more days passed and and we still talked a bunch and out of nowhere she calls me a no-life for not leaving the house for one day. I knew I wasnt one which made me a bit confused why she'd say something like that. When I called her on it later that day and she was apologetic and stuff, I tried to ignore it. We hung out one more time and then she stopped texting me all together. She also started snapchatting me less too and when I asked her about it she just said she was sad even though she clearly was having fun with her friends and posting it on social media and stuff. At that point I decided it wasnt worth putting effort in to a one sided friendship, relationship, or whatever you wanted to call it and I blocked her on all platforms. I still feel lingering guilt about the situation and I figured talking about it on this sub would help a bit for my conscience.",

      "description": "This is a fucking story (literally!), so allow me to explain. And for sake of clarity, I’m gonna be using fake names. \n\nI met Olivia in middle school, and we have been friends through college (we both graduated as well). In high school, Olivia started a relationship with Roger. They lasted 5 years, up through our last year in college. I am great friends with both of them. They both tried to stay friends after the break up. \n\nShortly after the break up, Olivia got into a relationship with a mutual friend of her and Roger’s. All that matters here is that after sleeping together, she found out she got HPV. I don’t know all of the details, but iirc it re-introduced some ovarian cysts she had previously, so it was bad. Anyways after almost a year, they eventually broke up too. It’s worth noting that Olivia would go to Roger for any problems she was having in this [toxic] relationship and that she ended up cheating on the guy with Roger (with protection) near the tail-end of that relationship. \n\nRoger developed some sort of depression this past December for seemingly no reason (I talked to him for a good 2-3 hours about it, and we couldn’t pinpoint a specific reason aside from hormones probably acting up &amp; weather changes)(he doesn’t have any guilt about sleeping with Olivia while she was in a relationship because the guy was horrible to her). I mention this because when we talked about it, he told me that he talked to Olivia and decided to stay on no-talking terms with her for a while - which I thought was great. Clearly they’re way too emotionally attached to each other and haven’t had enough time to heal from or process their 5-year relationship. Roger came to this conclusion when he realized that he would still get very jealous over Olivia talking to him about other guys she was interested in. \n\nThis is where it gets important: From there, one of Roger’s best friends, Jack, started talking to Olivia and they started hanging out more. And one thing led to another and Jack and Olivia slept together. Roger does not know about it. And finally, I know about all of this because my best friend Jane told me about all of this. I, Roger, Olivia, Jack, and Jane are all part of a pretty tight-knit friend circle. Olivia and I aren’t as close as we used to be and I’m sure she prefers talking to Jane about this kinda stuff, although Olivia personally told me (and Jane) about everything up through her sleeping with Roger. Jane has dealt with a lot of Olivia’s drama, so she vents to me about it. \n\nAccording to Jane, Olivia and Jack slept together twice, first time without protection. I asked her if anyone told Jack that Olivia had HPV, and it seems like he might not know. When I asked if Jack should know, she didn’t know how to respond, but seemed like she wouldn’t mind if I told him. From Jack and Olivia’s perspectives, I am technically not supposed to know any of the details in this paragraph and the last one. So my question is: WIBTA if I withheld this information from Jack? If I told him, I’d probably tell Jane that I’m telling him, which it seems like she would be fine about. Jane doesn’t wanna get involved or push the matter because she has too much going on in her life as is (we’re all in our early 20’s). And I’m just concerned about how Olivia and Jack would respond if they knew I knew about this information that Jane told me. \n\nThanks in advance for any and all replies!",

      "description": "Long story short, we're moving and planned to rent our side of the duplex while we're away for a year or two. My parents think I'm being rude by requiring my sister and her husband to sign a lease. \n\nWhen we announced to the family that we're leaving my sister and her husband immediately expressed interest in renting the place. I was ok with the idea since i can easily check in and they would be reliable enough to help with anything the tenants on the other side needed, if i asked them to. \n\nI mentioned to them the terms of the lease and what i expected from them as I would be giving them a discount in the rent in exchange for some help,  ie mowing the lawn and cleaning the snow (with my snowblower). They didn't really say much about the lease but seemed weird. \n\nWhen my parents heard about it they thought I lost all sense of decency. I explained that it was a normal lease that would make things clear between us. Protecting me and them. \n\nNow my sister is also saying weird things and i feel this is all a red flag. AITA?",

      "description": "TLDR at the end\n\nOkay so context: last year of high school, finished exams, and this is our first party in a long time where we can just let loose. A girl friend of mine had been working so hard for these exams and really sent it this night. She usually handles her alcohol well, better than most, but she was really, really drunk - minimal inhibitions. Now my other friend - he's a bit of a lightweight, also somewhat known to get away with the odd bit of harassment here and there just because he comes across as harmless.\n\nThe night starts to get out of hand, vomit and messes etc. I decide to take it easy and stay in control to help out the host (good friend of mine), as do a number of people. In the midst of this, the two aforementioned friends had been getting progressively closer. While I initially thought it was harmless and told myself to let it go, it didn't sit right with me. Then - while helping a friend who was damn near in shock (he was shivering, pale, intoxicated), another friend points out to me that they ended up kissing somehow and he appeared to be taking advantage of her - in a sense that she could barely take care of herself and he should be being responsible instead of selfishly going about his own agenda. I then proceeded to slap the ever loving shit out of him. While all three of us managed to work things out and, funnily enough, ended up closer as a result, am I the asshole for doing that?\n\nTLDR: Friend who is girl gets very drunk, guy friend who should know better takes advantage of the situation, I slap him as hard as I can.

      "description": "Alright, I confess that I have no idea when it comes to romantic relationships. It's just that so far I have always been comfortable with doing my thing, so it came as a surprise when someone asked me out.\n\nAt least, I think someone is asking me out. She asked me if I was free sometime soon, because she was bored and wanted to hang out. I know her fairly well, but besides the casual talking when we pass by each other we were never that close. Maybe I am reading a wrong signal here.\n\nI talked to my friend about it and he said I should just say no if I didn't like her instead of leading her on. But at the same time its not as if I dislike her, I just never held any romantic thoughts about her, or anyone so far as of now. My plan right now is to first go to the date, then tell her if I see it working out or not, although right now I'm not sure if I should pursue a romantic relationship with her. I see myself probably saying no after the date, although I really don't know what will happen. Do you guys think I am being too selfish?",

      "description": "Hello all, I posted this in another r/ place or whatever it is called (sorry I'm new to this).\nI want to get as many perspectives as I can because I am between a rock and a hard place and it is giving me some heartache.\n\nI have been dating my Chinese (this is relevant) girlfriend for 3 years. We have a great relationship and we are fairly sure we are serious about one another.\n\nShe has met my parents, but she is very hesitant to introduce me to her's. Now, I do understand why. Her parents are very conservative and likely wouldn't approve of her dating a foreigner but they are very keen to see her married. They regularly try to set her up on blind dates and now that it is Spring Festival, where unmarried women in particular get a hard time, she is going to be subjected once more to heavy criticism from her family for being 'single'.\n\nThis sort of thing is quite common in China so I am trying to make accommodations for it. Principally this: My girlfriend gets a lot of pressure to go on these blind dates and she does sometimes cave. She goes on these dates solely to keep her family off her back, she tells me everything that happens, no intimacy happens in these dates, she turns up, does the minimum, makes her excuses and leaves. She discloses everything about these to me which I appreciate and I understand the social pressure she is under is quite large, but even so I can't deny that I feel a bit hurt by it.\n\nThe main thrust of the problem is this though: I totally understand her hesitation in telling her parents about me. I understand completely that she risks possible ostracisation from her family. I would not dream of going in over her head on this and forcing her hand. BUT We are stuck in a rut. We agree we are serious, but we cannot take our relationship further without her family finding out. And, some may think this selfish but I am not content to stay in this somewhat covert state indefinitely, and the date thing is something that I am losing patience with. So, reddit, what can I/we do? Also, am I being an arsehole?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 8 years. We bought a house two years ago and have been evenly splitting the bills. We both work full time— he works on medical equipment and I work at a call center. \nA little back story, I graduated from college in December of last year and applied for grad school and got rejected. At that time I was working part time and my boyfriend encouraged to get a full time job elsewhere with better pay and benefits—I was still making out my equal pay and was comfortable where I was but I could see where he was coming from — so I started working at a call center in May. I hate it. To me it feels monotonous and I just get so bored. A couple days ago I expressed this to him and he just went off. He said that I had it easy and that I could never last at his job and that I take him granted. He likes to throw in my face that without his job we wouldn’t have a house (he put $2000 as a down payment when we closed on the house). I never have denied it but he likes to bring it up any chance he gets. I said that I understand his job is hard and if he’d rather not hear about me complaining about work then I won’t or I’ll warn him ahead of time when I’m venting and not to take it so personally. He then goes into this rant about how I take everything personally and then he brings my weight up. I’ve been struggling to lose weight as I have gained quite a bit after getting this job, as well as having hypothyroidism. It takes longer for me to lose weight now and he talks about how he prefers how I used to look and how I had so much going on for me then. He still finds me attractive but wishes I were smaller. This all happened because I said I was bored at work... AITA for even bringing it up to him?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my mother that her extension of an invitation to a friend of a distant family member for our wedding was inappropriate?",
      "description": "Hi AITA,\n\nToday we had a family lunch with myself, my parents, my fiance, and her parents. It was brought up that my godmother will be attending our wedding but her husband can't make it. My fiance and I were informed that in his place, a close friend of hers and my mother's side of the family will be coming.\n\nSince the beginning of the planning experience, we have been adamant that no one is allowed a plus one of their choosing; anyone who has a spouse or a significant other that is known to us and who they have been dating for at least 6 months was extended an explicit invitation to bring them along. My godmother's husband was invited explicitly, but obviously this friend was not. We have been completely fair about this and have actively turned down requests that others have made for plus ones that we did not invite.\n\nMy fiance and I were both upset that my mother made this decision, and after a stressful day of moving to a new apartment and dealing with our family being around the entire time, I didn't want to ignore this and decided to nip it in the bud as soon as possible. I called my mother when I got home and told her that she needed to reach out and explain that the friend can't come.\n\nMy mother has been my rock-solid source of reasonable emotions and comfort for my whole life. The last thing I expected from her was to break down on the phone and tell me that I'm acting like an asshole, which is exactly what happened. She told me that other people in her family know this friend and are excited that they will be coming, and have emotional investment in both my godmother and her friend coming. My godmother won't come unless she can bring this friend.\n\nI told my mother that I didn't think I should feel like an asshole for not wanting people that I don't know to be invited to our wedding without my explicit permission, and that it's unfair that we have turned others down and now this gets to be an exception. Through her tears on the phone she expressed that she couldn't bring herself to turn this friend away now, so I just ended the call by apologizing for making her cry because that wasn't what I wanted at all. I told her not to turn the friend away and to just let it be. Now she is mortified knowing that this decision upset myself and my fiance.\n\nAITA for trying to exert some control over our wedding and the guest list? I love my mom and I hate the thought that our relationship was strained over this, but I don't want to let that be the reason that wedding decisions are made without my fiance and I having input.\n\nTL;DR: AITA for telling my mom to call my godmother and explain that her decision to allow my godmother to bring an unknown friend in place of her husband to our wedding was uncalled for and is not approved by my fiance and I?",

He paid £650 six years ago and the one he is demanding is around £649. I have found one that is the same brand, the same size for £499, but only has one USB instead of the three he tells me he needs.

      "title": "AITA for emailing my classmate",
      "description": "Context:\nToday in my college speech communications class we had a guest speaker tell us about the opportunity of using the Toastmaster program to improve our public speaking ability. The organization does not require payment and is an optional way to help yourself in the class, as was stated by the speaker, a member of the organization. \n\nFor a portion (roughly 15 minutes out of 50) of this presentation a classmate of mine, let’s call him/her Alex, left the room which they later mentioned was because they did not feel well. When Alex returned they sat down and listened until the question section of the presentation. Alex then ask the speaker “Why should any of this matter to us?”  The speaker responded politely and briefly restated what the program is made to give people a chance to improve their public speaking abilities which can be useful for any job interviews that people our age will soon encounter or just for the class we’re taking. (I couldn’t remember the quote but that’s the gist). Alex then replied “So are you trying to sell me something?”  The speaker again politely responded saying “No, I am just here to let you know about our program.”\n\nOpinion** \nThe way me and my peers understood these comments, due to body language and tone, was aggressive and accusatory. I was aware that Alex was present when it was stated in this presentation and previous class periods that this was an optional and free program. \nMe and a few other classmates were very frustrated with this, furthered by a build-up of other unnecessary events of passive-aggression toward teachers and general disruption that had occurred in the past. (Again, this section is opinion, do what you will with it)\n\nI took the matter into my hands and decided to email Alex. Their first responses were sent in 5 separate emails over a period of about 5 minutes. They are split up with blank lines. Here is the chain, in order:\n\nMe: \nAlex,\nToday in our Speech Communications class we were given the opportunity to hear about a free program in which we can voluntarily improve our communcation skills; something that proves useful especially when job searching (might I remind you we are at the age of near-constant job-searching and are currently in a class in which we give speeches for our grade). If you wish to participate or not is none of anyone's business. This presentation was given by a man who decided to devote some of his time to informing us of these opportunities in a clear way so we could take advantage of them. Your comments were extremely rude and uncalled for. I am not in your head and therefor don't know whether you had a bad day or what may have triggered such comments to this kind speaker, but I would ask that you think more about what you say in the future. What was said may have seemed to you as harmless at the time but I assure you with the support of my peers that it was not okay. All I ask is that you take a second to be aware of the situation and what the impact of your words have on other people. \nThanks,\nMe\n\nAlex:\nThat's not what the teacher or presenter said. All I ask is that you leave me alone, before I lecture you on how instead of @ me what you should do is come talk to my face\n\nI suggest you respectfully stay away from me, and if you want to talk to me you must use a mediator. I am not dealing with your feelings or your peers' feelings. I am dealing with men with logic. Please do not bombard me with your opinions when I never asked for them. I do not appreciate your message, and I definitely do not consider your email to be friendly at all.\n\nI got complimented by both of them. I do not need to be patronized or be made to feel inferior for using my freedom of speech \n\nSo please speak good or stay silent \n\nI do not expect any encounter from you to be positive, and don't need your advice. \nResearch hypermasculinity before you talk to me. \nResearch sexism before you email me. \nResearch respect before you look at me. \n\nMe:\nPerson,\nI’m very sorry if my email came across as attacking your gender or anything else about you. My intention was to let you know how the things you said came across in hopes that you would maybe take a second longer to see what the possible results of your actions can be. I also do not mean to discourage free speech, but instead encourage a thoughtful use of it.\nThanks,\nMe\n\nAlex:\nI DON’T NEED TO BE REMINDED OF WHAT I SAY. I AM AN ADULT AND I AM AWARE OF WHAT I SAID. IF YOU FIND ME IRRITATING, THEN DEAL WITH IT. YOU CONTACTED ME TO WARN ME ABOUT WHAT I SAY. I GENUINELY DON’T CARE ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. I REALLY DON’T KNOW YOU, BUT ALL I KNOW IS YOU ARE HURT BY MY ACTIONS FOR SOME REASON. GO MEET WITH SOMEONE WHO CAN UNDERSTAND YOU, BECAUSE I CAN’T. IN CASE, YOU ARE WONDERING I TYPED ON CAPS ON PURPOSE. IN CASE YOU WEREN’T WONDERING, I AM UNAPOLOGETIC. IN CASE YOU CARE, PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAKE ME HATE THIS SCHOOL. IN CASE YOU WON’T LEAVE ME ALONE, TRUST  ME I WON’T BE NICE. BYE!\n_______________\nEND CHAIN\n_______________\n\nSide note: I realize some of her arguments were clearly unreasonable, such as believing I was attacking her gender (maybe she’s had bad experiences in the past that led to her quick jump to conclusions), my question here is should I have just done nothing?\n\nMore Context:\nI go to a small academy of about 1200 students with difficult majors and almost a need for teamwork because of this. Each class is generally close-knit and we are taught to take leadership positions and help our peers. \n\nThis most definitely contributed to me thinking I should say something but again, am I the asshole?\n\nAlso I’m on mobile, sorry if formatting is weird.",

      "description": "My grandfather just passed away over the weekend.  To give some background, I have not seen him in about 8 years due to my mother and her parents getting into a fight over a disagreement on how she was raising us.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \n\nAbout a year or two ago, Mom and her parents started making amends. I do not know how or when it started, but suddenly my siblings were seeing them again, but I wasn't because I was away at school.  I'll be honest for this post, I have been avoiding them for the most part.  They have been absent at very important moments in my life and did not attempt to be there.  Why should I make the effort to be there for them when they weren't for me?  Either way, I heard from my mom that Papa was not doing well and then he passed away over the weekend.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \n\nWith that all caught up, last night, my sister sent a message to all my siblings and cousins saying she was making a memory book for the funeral with all of our favorite memories of Papa.  She said it didn't matter how short it is, and if we couldn't come up with something, that's okay.\n\nI spent the past few days trying to find any memory I had that I could send in.  I couldn't think of anything that would be a story to use for it.  My sister messaged me tonight asking for it, so I responded with, \"I honestly don't have anything... I've been thinking about it for the past few days.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \n\nMy mom almost immediately responded after I sent that.  \"You really can't think of a single memory?\"\n\nShe then mentioned some memories that were vague from when I was young.  My dad sent messages after as well, \"You have NO memory of Papa?  All the other kids and cousins remember but you can't come up with anything?  You need to come up with something, we have a million pictures of him with you kids.  Write somethings down and send them to your sister.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \n\nThey both proceed to send pictures and other messages of me with my grandfather, but I still couldn't come up with anything.  I felt pressured and I know my sister is a good writer, so I sent a message back at her.\n\n\"I can't think of anything significant to add that would be good for this and mom and dad are texting. If you came up with something, you can name your price.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \n\nShe said she would come up with something if I sent 50 bucks her way.  I agreed to it, so she gave me a story that was related to some of the memories mom suggested but personal enough to where my mom wouldn't remember.  I sent her 50 bucks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \n\nReddit, am I the asshole for not having any memories to add for the funeral so I paid my sister to make one up for me?  Thank you for reading this far and I will accept the verdict before the wake tomorrow.",

      "description": "Long story short; before my son was born I always said I didn’t want to have his hair cut short. I really like the idea of allowing my son to chose when he wants to have his hair cut, and how short he likes to keep it.  I work as a receptionist at a men’s hair salon, and I constantly see parents bring in their 1-2 year olds to get adult haircuts and I just don’t  understand why. I think it’s ridiculous to put kids through that much stress when they could just have hair for a little while. Also my son has beautiful curly blond hair, and it’s just really cut and would be a shame to cut it off just yet! \n\n  My son’s bangs are definitely long by now, but he’s good about brushing them out of his face, and he usually asks for product or a hair tie if it’s too bothersome (he’s 2). If his hair is washed correctly, then it will stay out of his face pretty much the whole day. He actually enjoys brushing his own hair, putting product in, and it’s kind of a good way to teach him to take care of himself! His dad (we aren’t together), hates that I won’t cut his hair. He hates it enough that we fight about it almost weekly, and have taken to just not talking about his hair at all, as to not cause an argument. \n\n  My son’s dad says that I am being selfish and vain, keeping my son’s hair long because it’s cute to me. He says that I make him look like a girl when I tie his hair back. However, whenever I do my son’s hair, whether it be in the bath or tying it up, or even putting a little product and brushing, it’s not only a cool bonding moment, but it takes me literally two minutes of my day. I feel like his dad is projecting his feelings about long hair on men onto our son, but now I can’t decide if I’m completely unreasonable or not. \n\nAm I being an asshole? Or is this argument as stupid as it feels to me? \n\n\nTLDR; I don’t want to cut my son’s hair, his dad says I’m being unreasonable. ",

Now yesterday i got a new headphone but since then it makes a kind of cracking noice in the left pair and it was really disturbing although it wasnt loud. Now today i pointed it to my father and he first of all said it wasnt there and things like it aint noticable and all. Then he said no seller would show u each and every pair for testing so be fine with this.\n\nThen after some time he took out my old headphone and said look its still working and showed me some videos (the problem with that pair was that we could hear background music but not what peeps were saying in the video like the audio output wasnt complete) then again i pointed this to him and he threw the headphone.

      "description": " So my GF and I bought our first house at the end of December(barely 2 months ago). The second weekend there, we had a bad storm and it knocked down a large section of our backyard fence. Apparently, the wood back there didn't get replaced during the renovation probably because it was shared with 2 other houses. One of those 2 houses is owned by a guy who is renting it out to some people, the other house is lived in by the owners who've been there over a year. The 3 of us agreed that we would seek out a cheap but worthwhile resolution, and split the cost 50/50. With them sharing 50% and me taking a whole 50% to myself. Fair enough.\n\nI was referred to a guy by my realtor who offered to do a fix, for cheap. In hopes of gaining our business for future larger projects. He came out, looked it over, and assured he could lift it back up and put in some new posts and a few new boards and it'd give us a few years to save for a full replacement. Only $500. So that's just $250 to me and 125 to each of those neighbors. Awesome.\n\nExcept, one of the guys(the guy who owns but doesn't live in it) keeps pushing for this other bigger company he got a quote from, to do a full replacement. It would be high quality and last a very long time, etc. That's cool and all, but it'd be about $1600. I'm pushing back, insisting I'd prefer a cheap repair for the time being. My guy hasn't been able to get started because it's been raining a lot lately, so that's delayed this getting done. In the meantime, this other guy keeps pushing for that more expensive company. \n\nI'm still pushing back, trying to stall him while I get something set in stone from my repair guy. I feel like they aren't being \"sensitive\" to the fact that I literally just moved in, and I'd rather not put over $1,000 into the fence right away And with the new fence, it's just a few hundred to each of them. Almost feels like the guy is using this as a means of getting a brand new fancy fence on the cheap, with me paying the brunt of the costs. \n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting to save money in the short term, so we can all evenly split the cost of a full replacement a few years from now? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\nFirst month in new house, backyard fence falls over in a storm. I agree to pay half of cost to fix, with 2 sharing neighbors splitting a half. Now they want a full expensive replacement, which would mean they get a new fence for a few hundred and im stuck paying over 1000. I want to stay cheap for now and do a temporary repair.",

      "description": "I know a lot of posts on this subreddit are obviously YTA or NTA, but I'm really not sure about this one so here it goes.\n\nI started seeing this girl recently. She has been great and it has been going fine, but here roommate isn't exactly the coolest. She is super NYC fake rich white girl, a vibe that I know well as an NYC resident. I don't usually care that much as there are a lot of fake people here in NYC at my age and I have learned to deal with them.\n\nI had hung out with my now girlfriend and her roommate before, but she \\[the roommate\\] was always extremely standoffish. She would never talk to me directly, usually jump at the opportunity to mock, and was just unpleasant around me. Whatever! Fuck fake people I have 10 million others to connect with.\n\nHowever, me dating my now girlfriend has sparked up the instinct part of every white girl wherein they are determined to become besties with you because you are now dating their friend. My girlfriend even said she wants to \"re-introduce ourselves\". This REALLY rubs me the wrong way because she has been a majorly uncool person to me before and now I auto-magically gain acceptable status. (If she wanted to be cool she would have before!) I really don't want to \"re-introduce\" myself and been actively saying no to invites to events by my girlfriend because I really don't want to be around this person. I know this seems kinda petty, and I'm sure that she would behave more appropriately now that she knows we are going to be in closer contact, but that fucks me up even more cause I really don't want that fake-ness in my life.\n\nAITA for not giving her a second chance, or am I justified in just blocking her out?",

After we had to get the taxi to pull over on the way home I decided that instead of us sharing a bed like we normally do, that I would set her up on the futon in our garage (mainly used as a gym).\n\nMy theory was that there is concrete in the garage so that if she was sick it was easier to clean up and she seemed okay with it but I also know she wasn’t going to demand to sleep in my bed when she had asked to stay over in the first place.\n\nBefore going to bed I set her up with pillows and blankets, a bucket, some water and some painkillers for when she woke up in the morning. I also have set my alarm so that I can wake her up for work if her phone dies over night.\n\nI did the best I could I still feel awful.

      "description": "I made some good friends at my old work place. We bonded really well through some tough times. Even after many of us subsequently left the company we stayed in touch. I've always had a tad of social anxiety so I'm really grateful to feel so welcomed and encouraged to be myself in that office. In some ways, we were a close group of friends. \n\nEarly this year during our meet up, my friends mentioned that they'd like to visit Sam's hometown (Sam's part of this friend group). They invited me to join, so we got talking about visiting a couple spots, but specifically they wanted to hike up a real tall mountain. I'm diagnosed with some health issues so pain and fatigue are with me all day, much less when I'm doing a potentially 2 day hike. I expressed my interest with joining them but mentioned briefly of my anxieties of doing a full hike. As it was still 3 months away from the trip date, the conversation was put on hold.\n\nMonths went by and nothing was brought up. Recently, I saw that they've been posting up photos of them traveling to the hike destination. I felt totally blindsided and left out! It's quite upsetting to know that my friends didn't even bother to double check with me if I wanted to go and just stopped contacting me. Half my mind is bent on ceasing contact with them since we are slowly losing touch anyway. But at the same time, maybe it's not reasonable for me to feel angered, and I shouldn't expect other people to always look out for me.\n\nAITA for this anger?",

      "description": "I moved in to these apartments 9 months ago, and these were the nicest apartments I’ve ever lived in. I got a new puppy 4 months ago. He’s getting potty trained, so I have to walk him often. We’re usually outside 6-8 times per day. This is where my problems with my neighbors occur. \n\nFirst, some background on them:\nTwo months ago, these new neighbors moved in to my building. They moved into a first floor, two bedroom apartment right next to the bottom of my stairwell. As far as I can tell, they’re two guys in their early 20s plus a girlfriend, who’s probably the same age. They’ve never been upstanding neighbors. They stand out on their patio, which is at the same level as the sidewalk, and smoke cigarettes and weed throughout the day. I’ve caught them smoking blunts with three to four other people at noon on a Tuesday before. They’re pretty careless. Sometimes when I’m walking my dog in the morning (5.30/6.00a) they’ll be out there in what i can only describe as a, we-stayed-up-all-night-getting-wasted intoxicated stupor. I don’t mind the drug use. Truly. I used to be there myself when I had a roommate in my early twenties. \n\nThese neighbors recently adopted at least two cats. I say at least two because I’ve seen them laying on their window sills. But recently I’ve seen those two cats, plus two others wandering around our building at all hours of the day and night. I think they’re stray cats they decided to bring in. They all appeared around the same time.\n\nI recently caught two of those cats humping before breaking it up by throwing rocks at them. Soon there may be cat spawns. Sometimes these cats stay out all night meowing loudly, and other neighbors in adjacent buildings have also heard them and complained to me during their, and my morning/evening dog walks. \n\nI’ve seen cat food and water bowls left on their patio, as well as in corners of the parking lot, and in other public spaces nearby. This morning my pup started sniffing a bush and was met with hisses and scratches by a hidden cat. He recently discovered that he likes the taste of cat poop and tries to dig out and eat the poop from their cat-poop landmines outside. I’m worried my dog might get sick by eating their poop because I don’t think they’re giving these cats de-worming medicine, or flea prevention. \n\nAnyway, I want to report my neighbors to the front office because they’re making it awful to live here. My concern is that as a reformed pothead, I don’t want to snitch on them. What if they get a drop in visit and they have paraphernalia left out? That’s an eviction according to the lease agreement. I want to them to get rid of the cats or keep them inside permanently, not get evicted. I’m trying to restore the harmony of my life, not ruin theirs. \n\nI haven’t talked to my neighbors about it and quite frankly I don’t want to. They don’t seem very friendly and I doubt they’d be reasonable about it.\n\nWIBTA for reporting them? ",

      "description": "HI Reddit! Burner account because my (31F) friend (32F)  / husband (36M) and sister (28F) know my real reddit name.\n\nMy husband and I married at age 22. We wanted to have children right away - some people know that they are just meant to be Moms, and that is how it was always with me. From a young age, I was always the girl who played \"House\", had a million dolls, etc. But! as sometimes is the case, God had different plans for me and it took me forever to get pregnant. We saw many doctors but never got a diagnosis - it was almost just like bad luck. Which was frustrating, but my husband and I got through it. During this time, we spent a large portion of our money on fertility treatments, so despite having stable jobs, did not have lots of liquid savings.\n\nDuring this time, my BFF was more or less supportive. We have been friends since we were babies, despite being polar opposites. I always thought I would do anything for her and vice versa.  She was the Maid of Honor in my wedding and I was the same for her (she sadly got divorced after her husband turned out to be a lying POS and an alcoholic and I was the person who came and picked her up from his house in the middle of the night). She never quite understood why I wanted to have kids, but she always let me talk to her about our fertility issues (and in turn I always tried to talk about Other Things, even though, as anyone who wants a baby will tell you, it was on my mind a lot).\n\nFast forward to last year, my husband FINALLY got pregnant. I can not tell you the emotions that came over me in finally conceiving, carrying the child to term, choosing a name with my husband and bringing our baby son into the world. My BFF was the godmother and was in the room when I gave birth (we were both nurses), even though she didn't really understand my choice to become a mother (she once called my son \"crotch fruit\"). Five months ago, my husband and I were crushed to learn that our son had a congenital illness that would require \"elective\" surgery if we wanted him to live. We couldn't afford the $100K+ surgery he needed, and I had had to quit my job when I had him because of other issues that he had that required full time care. We were embarassed, but turned to GoFundMe to raise money for our son's surgery. We are not natural fundraisers, but have raised about 95% of what we need so far\n\nThree months ago, my friend adopted a cute dog named \"Rex\" from our local shelter. It's a cute dog but has knee issues that make it unable to swim. My friend became obsessed with the \"poor dog not being able to swim\" and found a vet that would do surgery to correct the dogs knees. Unfortunately it needs \\~$20K of surgery ($5K each knee). My BFF heard about the success we were having for our GoFundMe and immediately set up a GFM for Rex's knee surgery. **To be clear - Rex is not in pain and can run/walk/chase but is just not a good swimmer.** My friend thinks not swimming is hurting Rex's quality of life though and wants to take him to a doggy day care with a pool.\n\nWhile I know my friend isnt \"competing\" for the same dollars that we are, in a way she is - we have all the same family / friends and the exact same network since we worked at the same hospital. She even used one of the same photos we used in our GFM (our son holding Rex). It just seems insensitive to me that when my family is going through the fight for our son's life she is also hosting a GFM to help her dog become a swimmer. Everytime I see my BFF I have to fight through tears because I don't want to hurt her feelings about Rex's swimming. She's asked several times why I haven't donated yet, and I feel like eventually I am going to break and get angry.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Context: I have a full time job during the day, and when I'm not working that job I have a side job I do with art. My husband's the main reason I started my side business, he kept encouraging me to do it, and it worked out for the best, because I can get commissions and help keep our finances in check. However, at times he can be very selfish (I feel). Like, he will be sad that I will never do art for HIM. He's never angry by it, just sad and whiny. So, I've drawn pictures for him in the past and even gone as far as to make reference sheets for both characters of ours and do a monthly poll that was just our characters, etc. The thing is, with my full time job and this side job, I don't have much time to spend doing free art. Hell, I can't even draw the things I want to draw anymore. But I can't say that he doesn't do anything either; he makes dinner everyday for us and does all of the laundry while I\"m working. He brought that up last night during the problem we're currently dealing with. This time it's a bit different. A couple months ago I got a custom daki (Google for reference, dakimakura) and was so happy cause I got custom art of my favorite character and it was unique (only I had this daki with the particular images on it) because I told the artist I would prefer them not to post it and even offered to pay them extra (they didn't want extra, but I think I threw in a tip anyway). It feels special to me. So NOW my husband wants me to do the same for him, to draw him two images for a daki AND to not post anywhere. I tried to explain to him that that's how I get more business, through exposure, but he seems to think that if I post it, then it won't be special to him anymore? And I tried telling him I wouldn't post the full res, but it didn't seem to matter. He thinks I don't care about doing anything special for him, and that he tries to contribute as much as he can by doing dinner every night (it is literally every weeknight, not going to deny that) and laundry and feeding our dog, etc. and he is upset that I won't do the same??",

      "description": "A couple weeks ago, I was watching a movie alone with one of my best female friends, \"Mary.\" We started cuddling (which wasn't out of the ordinary) but she soon became more touchy than normal and I kissed her. After a brief pause, she kissed me back and things progressed from there. We've been physical since.\n\nOriginally, we wanted to keep everything secret- we share the same friends (3 of whom I live with) and had our fears about their reactions but after that first night, I was terrified and needed to talk to someone. I had risked not only my friendship with Mary but with our mutual friends as well. Mary also used to have a fling with a friend from my social organization, Drew, who I heard still had feelings for her from a mutual friend (but I did not really believe this because he was/is active with other people, did not speak to me about his interests in Mary personally at all, and had called things off with her months ago). I decided to talk about what happened with my friend and roommate, Bill, who was understanding.\n\nMore and more people found out. First, my other roommates, James and Brent, who caught Mary leaving one morning. Both were furious that I would risk ruining our friendships and treated me as such. Brent was even angrier because, from his perspective, I had betrayed Drew. Eventually, Drew heard about the situation without my knowledge, to which he reacted extremely negatively. Drew hasn't reached out to me, but I want him to know I wasn't trying to hurt him and truly didn't know he felt so strongly about Mary,\n\nSeveral mutual friends are angry at me now, and are essentially \"ghosting\" me. I just want to talk this out with them but no one wants to listen, even though I meant no harm to anyone. This whole situation wasn't planned, it just happened. Notably too, the blame seems to be disproportionately falling on me despite the fact that what happened between me and Mary was mutual. \n\nI have had feelings for Mary (on and off for three years) but our situations had never aligned until now. I know I really like her but I don't know if that is just because I’m close with her and attracted to her or if it's something more. Few of my friends seem to care that I feel conflicted.\n\nMy biased issues with this situation are as follows: If my friends have beef with me they can talk to me not just treat me like I don’t exist. People are acting like Mary can’t make her own decisions. Mary and Drew have straight up had months to make a move if something was going to happen.\n\nSo please, reddit, am I the asshole for this? I'm going to talk with Drew to try and clear the air, but most of our mutual friends are treating me like dirt. Most of the mutual friends between me and Mary are also ghosting me, treating me like garbage and acting like I have something to apologize to them for. Do I? Is it all my fault that we both mutually hooked up? Should I have ignored my feelings because one of my mutual friends potentially still had feelings for her?",

She is currently undergoing a diet which seems to be helping with her symptoms, but isnt taking any other medications. However, her mother has mentioned that a man named Tim White has found a cure for MS (to which i tried looking him up, but to no avail). Her mother continued on how she was going to help pay for the treatment, which involves injections of a chemical that the body no longer produces to combat metal toxicity. While my knowledge of MS isnt great, my research shows that any ‘cures’ are all about helping with symptoms, and there is not actual ‘cure’. The treatment would be between 6-24 weeks, and cost tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe asshole part of this is when my gf asked if i’d help pay for her to get the treatment from the man, i said i’d give a very very small amount because i dont trust or believe this guy, and that if there was an actual cure, why is it only this one guy who knows about it? To which my gf and her mother ranted about how the big pharma companies would kill him if he was found out, because they would lose money.\n\nMy gf is now saying i have a closed mind, and that i need to open it to these type of treatments, and that the pharma companies are just greedy and want sick people to stay sick so they can make more money.\n\nAITA for not supporting them?",

I feel kind of bad for saying no, but I don't feel like it's fair for me to have to go out of my way so much when I'm not even going to get the food. There are also PLENTY of sushi options within a five minute walk of our campus, but he'd rather go to the far one, because it's cheaper. AITA for saying no to this shitty sushi place again, even though he likes it? ",

      "description": "So, to give some background I've been with my husband for around 13 years \\[high school sweethearts\\] and I'm 8 months pregnant with our first child. My BIL and SIL have a 6-month-old \\[the first grandchild\\] and have been together for 3 years. BIL + SIL moved close to us and his mom still lives where we're all originally from. My MIL has always shown a preference for my SIL ever since her and my BiL got married - which tbh, my SIL is amazing, and a great person. I love her too. MIL and I have a decent relationship overall, and communicate regularly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, when my SIL was pregnant with niece my MIL was enamored. Everyday asking how SIL was feeling throughout her pregnancy, sending her pregnancy gifts, sending boxes upon boxes of gifts for baby \\[which went against SIL wishes, as she told everyone to not buy any gifts until after the baby was born as they do back where she's from, but that's another story.\\] My MIL always wanted belly pictures and cried when they first initially told her they were pregnant. I know all this because we share a group chat in a chat app, and have for years. We also saw her reaction to the baby announcement because they taped it - it was honestly very sweet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, husband and I finally get pregnant \\[we had some trouble\\] and I'm excited to move into this new chapter with MIL  - but that hasn't been the case. When we announced our pregnancy to her, her reaction was \"You waited this long to tell me?\" \\[Note: We told her within the same week she was told about my niece - 13 weeks\\]. That's the video my partner and I have to look back on. I have received 0 pregnancy gifts, and when she came out to visit us she brought my niece a box of gifts, and brought us 2 onesies - which I tried really hard to be as appreciative as possible for. Throughout the visit, she didn't ask me once how I was feeling, and only asked to touch my belly after my husband asked her multiple times to feel our baby move. \\[This was her final day on a weeklong trip\\]. I also try to send her weekly updates on his size, and I get a smile emoji back -- god this sounds so petty, but if you see how she responds to pictures of my niece \\[in and out of the belly\\] there's a clear difference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, onto the AITA moment -- something I've complained about to my husband is the fact that my MIL has not been really showing any concern with how I'm doing throughout the pregnancy. Last night, she sent me and him a private message asking to make sure that she had the correct date on my BIL and SILs anniversary, which is this weekend, because she was sending them a gift, a gift card to a restaurant, and a card. \\[Our anniversary was 2 months ago.. and well, we got nothing\\]. After not responding to that for a while she then sent, oh, and -me- how are you feeling?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was a bit put off by being what I considered an afterthought, so I didn't respond. My husband came up to me a few hours later and didn't think I had seen it. I explained my PoV, and he was just kind of quiet. After I asked him if he would like me to respond, he said that he understood where I was coming from, but that I had previously complained about her not asking me how I was doing, and that by not responding I was just reinforcing her to not ask me again. He also mentioned that I might be being overly sensitive due to being 8 months along right now and that his mom was/is so much more excited about my niece was because it was the first grandbaby vs second, and it's not a slight against me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was feeling pretty strongly about this last night, but as I see her messages to us go unresponded to I can't help but feel like an ass- she is also the kind of person who will take this as a major slight against her and it will cause problems. AITA, or being too petty? Or can I claim this as my hill to die on?",

My little siblings are age 14 and 15. \n\nMy boyfriend works far away so the only time we can see each other is on the weekends. So almost every weekend I go to his place and spend Friday night-Sunday night unless I have a lot of studying to do. \n\nMy mom recently got a new job that requires her to work nights from 7pm- 7am. She told me she doesn’t feel comfortable leaving the kids home alone and she wants me to stay home on the weekends she’s working. I told her I will always be available on weekdays but I can’t promise her that I’d be there every weekend. Weekends are my only days I can do anything because I’m in school and clinicals all week and I just really don’t want to be limited with where I can and can’t go. Am I being totally selfish? ",

Last year I did not see him at all over Christmas break, which is 5 days short of a month for our university. I asked him if we could try to see each other over break, as we have been dating longer and I think it would be nice to do fun holiday stuff together. Our families live 5 hours apart, so seeing each other would really require one of us staying with the other's family. We made a plan that he would stay in town for several days to visit with my family, and he seemed happy with this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, he breaks the news that the three days he said he would spend in town with me were now reduced to one day, and it would be spent with his cousin who I barely know (long story). I expressed my sadness to my BF, and he got angry and said that I \"didn't want him to spend time with his family\"  because I wanted to see him one time over the holidays. Part of the reason he couldn't stay longer was because his mom didn't want him to drive home alone, which would have been the case with our original plans. He's a grown ass man? He can drive 5 hours himself??? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "My daughter is a full time university student without a job.  I support her, pay for her school, housing , insurance, gas etc. I allowed her to use my 2013 car and purchased a new one for myself  when she graduated high school.  It has high mileage now ( about 100k miles) and was having some mechanical difficulty so last month I put $2000 into it to fix a wheel bearing and the air conditioner.  I haven’t even received the credit card bill yet.  The car is now running fine.  Friday I get a call from my mother from the car dealership that they are there buying a new car for my daughter who is on spring break, i need to sign over the title to the new one for a trade in and call my insurance company to add the new vehicle.    Obviously a 20 year old driving a new car that requires collision coverage is expensive.  \n\nI told my mother I do not want to trade in a car for less money than I just put into it, need to check to get an insurance quote to see if I can afford the extra insurance on the new one and she needs to NOT sign a thing until I investigate.\n\nMy daughter is a great kid, text me that it wasn’t her idea and they will leave right now and I shouldn’t worry about it.  Of course, I felt awful because how often does someone get a brand new car offered to them?  I said I’d look into the pricing and let them know later.  The insurance is 3700 a year, about 200 more a month than I pay now.  I called my mother Friday night and told her I wasn’t happy about not being consulted and I don’t really want to trade in my old car.  “ why do I even try to do nice things?!”\nShe hung up on me.  \n\nAs I thought about it, I don’t need the other car and would be paying insurance on it until I can sell it. Furthermore, it was really the $2000 I just put into it that burns my butt, which btw, my mother knew about. \n\nUltimately, I caved, sign over the title and added the new car to my insurance.  My daughter said she would get a job to pay the extra insurance but she’s pre med and I want her to maintain her studies so she can get into a good Med school in a year and a half. \n\nTo add insult to injury, my mother wants us to lie and not say she’s the one who bought the new car so her other grandchildren don’t feel it was unfair.  Which isn’t happening.  Her rational for buying it is my daughter doesn’t ever ask her wealthy grandma for anything unlike the other grandchildren and this is her way of making it fair.  So why the lying? \n\nAITA for not only not feeling grateful but for being extremely pissed this happened without my being consulted?  ",

      "description": "Since about May, I have been feeling as though I have been acting as my friend's personal therapist.\n\nHe's currently realised he's going through depression, anxiety and body image issues and, as I have also been through these three similarly, I have been offering insight when he has asked for it. Over the months, I have also had to tell him multiple times I CANNOT be his therapist because it is a lot to ask of a person and I have my own mental health to keep in on top of. I've also had some moments where I've really questioned if my friend is manipulating me to elicit intimacy from me as I think I fulfil some kind of romantic role for him (but that's another story! I have a boyfriend and we both think it's a bit whack).\n\nAnyway, the other day, he invited himself over for 4 hours to talk at me about all his problems, cried, obv got hugs, he's depressed, he's lost weight, he feels hopeless, nothing is positive. I try to steer it somewhere positive but am met with resistance or apathy.\n\nThere's only so many times I can say the same things before I have to get out, right? I can already feel this feeling settling in my bones. I wake up next to my boyfriend every morning and often my first thoughts is worry \"what's happened now\" as I check my phone to see the messages from my depressed friend.\n\nSometimes it's fine, and he's not using me as a personal therapist, but it's often enough to make me feel like this. There's other weird stuff too, as I've mentioned, but that's another post entirely.\n\nAITA for wanting to cut ties?",

      "description": "I know this already sounds bad but hear me out.\n\nAt our local mall, we have a play place I like to take my 2 year old son to so he can let his energy out. The play area is an open area with large soft decorations the kids can climb on. It's enclosed in a square but there is no door or gate to prevent kids from leaving (and I suspect so parents don't just drop their kids in and walk away). There are benches within the play area where the majority of the parents sit. Most people will watch their kids play but a lot are usually distracted by their phone. \n\nMy son is a runner and will tear out of the play area in a flash so I always stand at the entrance/exit because I have to watch him like a hawk and will redirect him if he's trying to escape. \n\nMore than a few times I've stopped children to leave because people aren't paying attention but today this one parent in particular would *not* pay attention. I stopped his (around 18 month) child twice but he didn't acknowledge me or say something like \"Whoops! Thanks, I was distracted for a second!\" This guy wouldn't get off of his phone (texting or internet browsing, I'm not sure) so his kid kept wandering away. After the third time he didn't notice her leaving- I didn't stop her but waved to get his attention so he would. Again, he said nothing. The FOURTH time this happened, I did nothing (I'm not a monster wanting a kid to get abducted, I was still watching her out of the corner of my eye but I was waiting to see how long it would take him to notice). \n\nAbout two minutes later, he saw her wandering behind the benches, ran out, picked her up in a huff and very loudly yelled at me for not stopping her because I'm the one at the exit. Then all the other parents were nodding and throwing *me* dirty looks. I took my son and left after that.\n\nAITA here? Does standing near the exit automatically put me on unspoken guard duty? ",

Son is on the spectrum and is very particular of what he'll eat (hates pizza, cheese, pasta).  We found out 2 years ago my wife is Gluten Intolerant, she has Celiac's Desease and gets very ill if she ingests gluten.   I take particular care when cooking for her as well as factor in what to cook for my son, it can get cumbersome juggling both requirements.\n\nWe talk about her finally figuring out she can't eat gluten \"all of the time\".   For years it's been a struggle for her until she figured it out and it's a topic that comes up a few times a week.  Last night I made a pot roast and used a corn starch slurry to make the gravy.  She comes up, looks at it and says, \"I can't eat that,  you used flour for the gravy, I'm gluten intolerant\"! \n\nI looked at her and said, \"Do you really think I'd make that with flour?  Do you think I'm a fucking idiot\"!?   I just dropped the utensils, walked away and went upstairs for the night.  I haven't apologized and either did she.  She did eat supper which I passed on,  I was too pissed.  I can't believe she would think that of me.  I haven't looked her in the eye since.  Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Kitty is well taken care of - regular vet checkups, toys and playtime, cuddles, dry food with a snack every once in a while (rice, tiny bits of cooked chicken/fish without (fish) bones), but when it comes to being let in our (tiny) garden, he can be a bit of a twat. \n\nThe second I let him outside, he keeps an eye on the door and if he sees me closing it again, he comes rushing right at it to be let in again. If I let him in, he starts loudly meowing and pawing at the door to be let out again. \nIt's been very windy the last few weeks and I understand he wants to be inside if outside scares him, but getting up every 2 minutes to let him in, let him out again is a bit annoying if he does it every damn time -_- \n\nWe don't have a cat door atm. We're going to look for some renovations and a new garden door, along with a (lockable) cat door is among our priorities. We don't want him to go out at night, but at the moment we're like, \"going outside means staying outside for a while\", not changing your mind the second he goes outside. Building character, a bit?\nI let him in if he looks like he want to be let in *urgently* but not when he simply sits down and meows if he's not even been two minutes outside. \n\nSince it's a cat, and not a human being though, I'm wondering if I'm being an ass. \nJudgement please, let it rain down on me.

      "description": "Well I had a bunch of backstory planned for this but it would have been to long so I will skip straight to the point.\n\nRight  before the holidays my girlfriend and I were on shaky ground. The  relationship was starting to fall apart but not quite. We were  originally planning on her spending the holidays with me but that was a  few weeks away so we agreed that I would come see her. My roommate and  his girlfriend wanted to go there for some tourist things so we  carpooled and were going to try to make a weekend out of it.\n\nFor  months now her family knew they were getting 2 really expensive cars  delivered on that day. One for her mom and one for her. I knew this  going up and I was completely okay with it. Her parents did not want me  to come with them for this so that helped with that decision. So the  plan was I would come up and check in to the hotel on Friday, and she  would spend the night with me. Then we would get up and have a nice  breakfast at 930 so she could leave to get the cars with her parents at  10. We agreed she would be done at 12:30 so we could get lunch and that I  would work on my massive paper for school in the meantime. My roommate  and his girlfriend took the car to go do the tourist things so I was  left at the hotel for a few hours while she got the cars. I knew this  ahead of time and was completely okay with it since I needed the time.  This was the plan.\n\nSo she called me at  12:30 pm as we thought and told me that she was now going to help her  parents clean out their 3 car garage to fit all 3 of their new expensive  vehicles and that it would take a few hours. I asked if there was  anyway she could just wait one day and do it on Sunday after I left. She  said no because she was worried about the car getting dirty and  scratched by leaves blown by the wind (her words not mine). I then asked  if I could come to help clean the garage, that way it would be faster  and I could still see her. Her parents would not let me do that either  or so she said. So I expressed to her that I was upset that I drove 6.5  hours to see her, and paid for a nice hotel only to see her once at  dinner, for an hour after dinner and for breakfast. I was not  disrespectful or even angry in tone just clearly disappointed and upset.  She hung up then finally arrived at the hotel at 5:30 pm.\n\nHer  parents were not making her help and she had 2 other siblings there.  Its not like the car could not have parked in their driveway safely for  one night right? Or that the garage could not wait until Sunday after I  left? Or that I could have just been included? Anything other than just  sitting in a hotel by myself all day.\n\nAITA for being upset about this? I was completely fine with getting the cars  I just was not fond of the last minute need to clean the garage for 5 hours is all.",

A little bit of back story; I started working in a contact centre about 6 months ago and the main role is to answer phones. The majority of my collegues are in their late teens/early twenties so there is a reletivly high staff turn over. A role for the Social Media team opened up about 3 weeks ago and I applied thinking that this will be a great opportunity and to get off the phones.\n\nThe interview comes around and falls on a Friday. Personally, I smashed it and built an excellent rapport with my new managers. After a 3 day weekend; I come back on Tuesday to a 15mins meeting/feedback from my interview. I was suprised because the wait time for feedback was 2 weeks. \n\nGood news! The managers thought that I smashed it aswell and gave me the job on the spot with an immediate start. \n\nI couldn't be more happy about the role and whats ahead. The only thing is, I am not allowed to say anything to my collegues because noone else knows their fate. A few candidates have also come up to me and asked how I'm taking the 2 week wait and whether I'm excited to find out. \n\nKeeping this a secret until I full start the new role is really hard because I know so many people will be upset and angry that I recieved a promotion with a sweet pay rise while they are stuck being shouted at down the phone.\n\nAITA for wanting to tell people about this?",

      "description": "I’m a single mom of 2 kids who are in school from 8:30-5:30 every day I have them (50% of the time). I’ve been in a relationship for about two years and my boyfriend (BF) has been pretty present with my kids. \n\nRecently, I started a new job that’s about 30 min away from where I live and 7 min away from my kids’ school.  BF also started a new job that’s within walking distance from my apartment. I work 40 hours a week + a lot of overtime and don’t take a lunch. BF works about 30 hours a week with a few breaks a day between appointments. \n\nI get up with the kids each morning (7:30) to get them ready for school, drive 40 min to take them there, then pick them up after work and drive 45+ (traffic) min home, arriving at about 6. BF wakes up at about 8:30 to get to work at 9, some days not until noon.  \n\nGetting home at 6 means late dinner for my kids. I’ve just been buying fast food for them on the way home, but that’s expensive and unhealthy.\n\nToday I came home even later because I needed to feed the kids, get gas, and stop to take the youngest to go potty. I was exhausted, had a terrible headache because I hadn’t eaten all day, stressed, and overwhelmed. After working another few hours when the kids went to bed, I was going to bed (11:30) and asked BF if he could take over having dinner ready for the kids on the days they’re here. This would be 3 days/wk max. BF’s response was to give me all the reasons why it would be hard or why he didn’t think he could. He said he works until 6:30 most days so he wouldn’t be able to have it ready. I said it doesn’t have to be fancy, even just sandwiches in the fridge, or I’d buy ingredients if he could just throw them in the crock pot before work. Again, his response was kind of defeatist. \n\nI got upset and argued with him before walking to the bathroom to cool off and pee for the first time all day. When I came back, we discussed it a bit and I told him it was frustrating for me to take care of everything for everyone and finally ask him for one thing, only to be met with his concerns/excuses about it. I said that when I ask for help, I want him to take the problem away, not lay more on. He was really upset and kept arguing. It was about 11:45 and I said I needed to be done talking because I have to wake up tomorrow and do it all over again. He wouldn’t stop, so I got up and went to the couch. He followed me and kept talking. I told him I couldn’t talk because I had to sleep but he kept going. I finally said, “I’m not doing okay. I need you to stop.” He then walked away, still talking, to the bathroom and came back a few minutes later to sit on the couch and continue talking to me while he got his shoes on.

      "description": "This happened two years ago I had just turned Eighteen as my birthday is within two weeks of Christmas.\nSo, my family live nowhere near eachother and it's often hard for my side of the family to travel up north to see my Aunt and her family every year so we often go every other year, or sometimes once every three years.\nAnyway, this was the first Christmas since my sister had left for university and I didn't have any money and I was still in college so I hadn't seen her all year.\nWell Christmas dinner comes around and there's my Aunt, Uncle, my cousin and his wife alongside their two kids and my other cousin's son alongside me and my parents and sister, my dad didn't sit at the table as he was actually really sick at the time and the drive up the day before had really exhausted him so my aunt let him eat in the living room, now, you'd think as I'm legally an adult now my aunt would start thinking of as one, like she did to my sister. Nope. Didn't you read the title? Of course not, this stays true to this day, for my birthday last year my mum and dad got me a really nice bottle of black spiced rum and my aunt sent them a message saying \"That's an inappropriate gift for him!\" \nAnyway I've got off track. So I go to sit with my dad since, I knew if I didn't I'd have to sit with the children and I am not really a fan of children and these kids, are just little goblins, the oldest one always uses big words to sound smart and will often say he's smarter than me, I normally just ignore him, The second eldest kicks and punches me and will do so given any opportunity, the youngest I don't really have a problem with since he's so young and doesn't do much.\nMy aunt tells me I have to sit at the table so I do, don't wanna cause any arguments, it's Christmas,  I sat next to my sister, and my cousin's wife, says \"Oh, can you sit at the end with the rest of the children I wanna sit and chat with your sister.\"\nI just sit there in a stunned silence for a second and go \"Okay sure.\" And move, again, Christmas.\nSo the meal goes on great, my sister knowing I'm a little bit upset keeps looking at me and asking if I'm alright. \nNow, this is the height of vine, when things like bottle flip, 9+10=21 and Damn Daniel are still popular and these kids start screaming these at the top of their lungs and the second eldest, my cousin's oldest grabs a handful of vegetables and throws them at me and laughs with a mouthful of chewed food.\nAfter that lovely little event I pick up my plate and go sit with my dad, where it's silent but we can still hear what's going on in the other room.\nMy aunt asks me to come sit back at the table and when I say no, she gets my mother involved, my poor easily stressed mother who could tell I was stressed already because I got that from her. My mum wanted me to do what I wanted to do but to stay on good terms with Aunt got me to come back with my aunt saying \"Your mother who has a hard time getting around got up to get you back so don't be rude and come sit back at the table please.\" I see my dad roll his eyes because he knows what she's done, I am really easy to guilt trip especially when it comes to my mum and dad since they're getting old, they're both in their fifties.\nI reluctantly return to the table and endure the mess that is my cousin's children.\n\nWhat do you think people of Reddit? Am I the asshole here? \nAlso I'm on mobile, so forgive terrible formatting.",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for over two years, lived together for over a year. We're both in our 30s.\n\nWe laugh at my joke that we should never go to ikea together, but at the same time, it's probably true.\n\nI want to repaint the walls new colors, rearrange rooms, etc. They are the same color as when he bought the house well over 5 years ago. He could probably live his whole life happily never changing anything. There are things he agrees with me about, such as the color of the cupboards. But then there are things he doesn't want to change. I was scrubbing the bathroom today and realized that not only are the cupboards the ugly color of the kitchen (he agrees), but the bathroom, bedroom and kitchen contain different shades of the same blue and brown. I'd like to repaint it all. He's not pleased with my revelation.\n\nOnto the location of the bed. My reasoning to move it is that it's right against the kitchen wall where roommates use the *loud* microwave. Also, all the upstairs plumbing runs through that wall, including *loud* showers, toilet flushes, etc. His reasoning not to move it is that it takes a lot of work. Which was pretty much his reasoning for not painting walls.\n\nOnto the bedroom dresser. I want something aesthetic, a touch more feminine, and an in-between of us both. I don't want to disregard him completely. I always hated when I saw that happen in relationships on television: the male being disregarded completely. But right now there is a hunk of metal on the dresser, almost 1.5 feet by 1.5 feet. It's a coin door for one of his arcade games. He has three arcade games in the living room. (Getting him to agree on simply *rearranging* the living room took over a year; it was like pulling teeth, and it hasn't happened yet. I'll never ask him to put them in the basement or in another room, though. He loves them and I love that about him.) I suggested today that we put it on a shelf by his games because it would go with that aesthetic, and we could soften up the bedroom. He didn't respond, which maybe suggests that it's possible: he usually gives a reason why we shouldn't.\n\nTL;DR: I don't want to change everything about my boyfriend's house. But I've realized that it's my home too, and I'd like it to make it *feel* like home to me without overwhelming my boyfriend and taking away his identity.",

My stepdad was already irate about me having left some dishes in the sink the night before. I apologized for that, and didn't realize I left such a mess. I was saying something to my mother, I don't really remember what, when my stepfather interrupted me and started saying something else. I kindly told him that I was talking, and to please not interrupt me. I tried to have my tone and words as nice as possible, because I didn't want to make him even more upset. It didn't work, because he immediately got into my face, cornering me into the chair I was sitting in and began to scream in my face. He would not let me leave the chair, even when I tried to squeeze out. Eventually I did manage to squeeze out of there, and yelled at him to not get in my face. \n\nI'm starting to think I was wrong to tell him to please not interrupt me. I'm not sure it warranted being cornered into a chair and screamed at though. AITA?",

      "description": "My wife and I have been together just over five years total (3 dating, 2 married) with our 2nd wedding anniversary coming up in December. She's prepping the house for the holidays and is in an overall happy mood. She also has a trip to her grandparents this weekend, she usually visits them once a year around this time. This year will be a bit different as I plan to pack my things and leave her while she's away this weekend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory, in March of this year I discovered my wife was having an affair with a coworker about 20 years her senior. Basically they were chatting using a shared apple account. I don't want to get into too many details. The gist of it is she was/is unhappy with our marriage, developed feelings for her coworker. This spiraled into her hating me for about six months while she explored dating her coworker. This involved a few late nights at work as they trained for a 5km run together, did some swimming dates and even got tattoos at one point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI on the other hand spent those months trying to win her back by showing her how good a husband I was (cooking, cleaning, finishing some house projects). When nothing changed I accused her of having an affair, which she flatly denied, so I provided evidence of the affair (text messaged and phone calls) but she still denied it. They were just friends. In May i suggested marriage counselling and we had a few sessions leading into June. In counselling she admitted to the affair, which was a huge relief for me, and seemed to be coming around to wanting to work on our marriage. With the help of our counselor I gave her an ultimatum, she could continue the affair and I would leave her, or she could end the affair immediately and we could move forward and work on our marriage. She broke down in tears and said she wanted us to work on our marriage and that she would break up with the coworker the next day at work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following day I asked her about how her coworker took the breakup and she said he took it well. Life went well for about a month until I caught the pair texting about meeting up in another city where her parents live. I didn't lead on that I knew and later that day she mentioned she was going on a trip over the weekend to visit her parents. I didn't stop her but called her about 10 minutes into her date and called her out. She called me a liar and hung up the phone. When she was back from her trip she apologized profusely, told me she broke if off with her coworker and to show that she meant it, promptly quit her job. We went to another marriage counselor in August and are still seeing him every few weeks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for me, our marriage was done after she lied about the ultimatum and have been leading her on since July. I would have left earlier but we recently bought a home last year and the breakage costs would put us both in debt if we sold. So I've stayed, but talked with our broker about potentially selling. We will still owe a few grand but would survive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I the asshole for leaving my wife before Christmas and our 2nd year anniversary?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: A year into our marriage my wife has an affair, give her a 2nd chance but affair continues. Plan to leave her this weekend",

      "description": "So college has begun a few months ago and I met this two girls „Mary“ and „Jane“ and we started to hanging out and study together. \nJane got a crush on a guy relatively quick. I’ll call him „guy“. Somehow we managed to get a drink all together after class. And guy was so annoying! He just kept bragging about himself and telling us how amazing, smart, educated and outstanding he is. It was hard to have a conversation with him since it was totally natural for him to interrupt someone talking. We exchanged meaningful looks with mary. After a while I had enough and excused me to leave. Jane insisted me to stay and offered another drink. I said ok but that’s the last one. So then he told something about a topic we didn’t ave much clue about. He started to run us down and said „As hard it his, being uninformed about this topic makes me wonder how you guys could attempt college and unfortunately I think that is associated with dumbness. But glad I’m here and I’ll clear you up. Must be your lucky day. Ha ha ha“ After hearing his ego pushing self love all evening and then it turning into humiliation I got angry and asked him:“ before you honor us with your information we didn’t ask for, I have a question. Which subject do u want to prepare for your bachelor thesis? I think  ‚How I boost my ego by humiliating other people so I can feel better myself because secretly I have low self esteem and am a crying little bitch when I’m alone“ He was shocked and just said what. Jane also was shocked, yelled at me there is no reason to be an asshole, he just was trying to help and that she was enjoying listening him and that I should take a leaf. I replied with: „yeah no wonder you kissing his ass, you are the obe who has a crush on him.“\nHer face got red and she started to stutter, whilr he seemd embarrassed and didn’t say anything. She grabbed her things and left. I told I’m done here and left,too.\nJane sent me a huge text later blaming me for ruining her opportunity to get a date with him and that she is too embarrassed now to make another move.\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "Context: I'm a 19 year old female in a strained \"relationship\" with my on and off again \"boyfriend\" of 1.5 years who is 21 years old. We are currently broken up but we still continue to see each other and act like a couple and do couple things which honestly makes everyone I know absolutely  furious. This makes it impossible for me to talk to them about anything pertaining him which has caused me to go to reddit for some unbiased opinions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here is what happened. He is currently sick with a cold and is acting as if he is dying. He has gotten me sick as well which I will admit is my fault because I still wanted to see him and cuddle and kiss knowing he is sick. I woke up just this morning with the cold and it is barley affecting me with my symptoms being a sore throat, cough, runny nose and head ache. He has the same symptoms as I do and has not left his bed and missed every class he had on Friday. On the other hand I have gone and ran many errands as well as took both my large dogs out for their hour and a half weekend morning walk in the 30 degree weather. I called him around 1 to ask if we still were set to hang out today and watch a movie. He let me know sure but I wasn't aloud to sleep over like originally planned because he still wasn't feeling well. I was upset but kinda brushed it off  because we are working on boundaries and I'm trying to be more understanding of other peoples feelings. (I have a mental illness where I struggle with empathy and overly strong emotions.) I said ok, asked if he was alright and if he had taken any pain killers for the head ache or anything else for the cold. He told me no and this is when I told him I also have gotten sick and don't really feel all that bad. He told me viruses affects everyone differently and that I need to stop giving him suggestions. I was confused and told him I just wanted to help him. This is when he told me that it was just annoying and that he never asked for my help and to just stop. I immediately started to cry (overly strong emotions alert) and told him that was very mean to say. He told me I didn't need to come over then and to just stop patronizing him. I just cried into the phone for a moment and told him I'd talk to him later, he scoffed and said ok and I hung up. As I said earlier I struggle with empathy and often put my own feelings over others and have hard time understanding when I do something wrong. Its something I'm really trying to work on but I'm just not sure if I was really the ass in this situation or not. Please let me know what you think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.

      "description": "So I've know this girl for about 3 years, let's call her C. C and I became friends in school, we were very similar cause we both had terrible family lives and both struggled with mental illness. We where best friends and even dated for a while, she had a hard time making friends cause she was akward and weird like me. During out friendship I noticed some red flags: \n\n1.she was very unstable and would always treten to kill herself  2. She was obsessed with me  3. She did not take to rejection well. \n\nThese things will come into play later. After a year she randomly left school and I didn't see her for a year, I later found out she was in a school for the mentally disabled and got into self harm and drugs. I had completely forget about her. Since then my life took an entire 180, I got into therapy and medication and got so much better till I didn't even need therapy anymore and I was the happiest i ever been. Then she came back. \n\nThis was about a month ago, she came back talking about how great she was doing and wasn't depressed anymore. Then the next day she told me about how terrible and depressed she was. The reason I wanna cut her out is because she brings me down, and remind me of who I use to be and am not anymore, and I just didn't wanna have to worry about her 24 hours a day. I can't tell her that, one time one person didn't wanna come to her birthday party and she ran to the bathroom and thrented to kill herself, she's done this to me also. Yah she dosent take rejection well. She's such a negative influence, am I an asshole? ",

He reached the door first, opened it and then held it open when he saw me approaching. I didn't have anything in my hands, not carrying any heavy boxes. I fully intended to open the door myself, so I pushed open the other side of the door and walked thru. As I passed by, he said \"You're welcome\" (sarcastically, obviously). And I replied with \"I didn't say thank you\". He went inside, I left and I continued on with my day. Here's the thing, I hold the door for people all time. I do it because I want to, not because I want a thank you. If you walk around doing favors in life for strangers because you expect something in return, you'll be sorely disappointed.",

      "description": " \n\nMy  ex asked me to cosign a  vehicle because he had no credit. I wasn't  comfortable with that, but I  was ok with putting a used vehicle 100% in  my name so that I had control  and if it went bad I would just wind up  with a spare vehicle.\n\nThe  agreement was  that once paid off I would just sell it to him for $1. The only other  financial tie we still have is that  he owes me roughly 3k for paying  for a summer of camp for his daughter when he couldn't afford it.  Originally he was supposed to pay that back  with his 2017 tax return,  but since we had split up by then he told me  basically to go screw  because the breakup was still pretty fresh. He  later apologized and  promised he would really pay it back this year with  his 2018 tax  return. But over the last six months his current  relationship is  falling apart (he cheated on me with her and moved in  together after  dating 30 days so this wasn't shocking) and he needs  those taxes to pay  first, last, and security on a new place to live. We  made a third  agreement that he would pay back what he could when he  could and that  after the car was paid off he would continue making the  same payments  to me monthly and I wouldn't sign over the car until the  summer camp  debt was paid. Over those six months he hasn't ever paid  over the  regular payment and specifically told me that even though he  got  roughly a 4k tax return he insists he can't afford to even throw an   extra $50 or $100 at his debt.\n\nI told  him that if I didn't see some effort  to pay something towards what he  owes I would have to really consider  selling the car in June (when it's  paid off) and getting what he owes me  that way, instead of staying financially connected. He lost his temper saying he's a single dad and he has no money and he can't handle the way I speak to him.   Things got heated in the conversation because I feel like I've been more than accommodating and he constantly uses what will happen to his daughter as leverage. I said he could make an effort or I could come and   grab the car today. His temper and pride got the better of him and he told me to come get it and I did.\n\nHere's why I feel conflicted. I know he doesn't have the credit or the money to buy a car now without spending 100% of his taxes on that and leaving him living with a woman he hates for another year. He could  lose his job if he can't get there leaving them in a very  precarious  financial position. I am financially very  comfortable. I  asked him to try more for the fact that someone cheating  on me and  being generally a terrible human being when we split up means I  don't  feel like going too far out of my way to make this easy for him and I take it personally when he continues to take advantage of my resources  when I know that was a large factor in why he wanted to be  with me at  all.",

Then I realised how fucking stupid I was being, apologised profusely to all involved, and three of the mods all agreed to put it behind them. Then, a day later, a debate about Israel was going on.(referring to Trump's remark about the Golan Heights)(political debates are fairly common on that server) The debates, as debates about Israel often do, shifted to Palestine. Basically, the server host (a Jew as well,not sure if he's practicing it or not) was saying about how Israel was \"returning the Jewish historical experience to Palestinians\", in a tone that suggested that Palestinians deserved it. I replied saying it doesn't make it right, and he told me \"I saw what you said, tread lightly, especially around the Jews\"(he was essentially saying, \"shut up or get banned\"). That really rubbed me the wrong way. I just replied with \"ok\". AITA?",

My sister asked for a piece, but I told her no. She then asked to me to grab her one too (she didn’t really want a whole pizza, but since we didn’t want to share was going to eat one). There was only one pizza left, and I claimed it. I did feel a little bad because there wasn’t anymore pizza, but there were other microwaveable meals and some leftovers and I didn’t want to give up 1/4 of my lunch.\n\nMy mom got home from the grocery store as I was eating my pizza, and my sister complained. My mom reminded me we had the cinnamon raisin bread I love, and suggested eating some cinnamon raisin toast and give her the last piece; I agreed because I was tired of fighting and the toast is legitimately delicious.\n\nSince then, my sister has made several snarky remarks about my inability to share food (I’ve never liked sharing food, and she’s always teased me about it, but the snarkiness has intensified since the incident).\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to give up 1/4 of a personal pizza?

Some girl who fancies herself in charge of birthday celebrations at work the other day tried to confront me in front of others about my birthdate and I politely told her that I think birthdays are for kids and I havent celebrated my birthday since I was a kid and I detest the \"happy birthday\" song. A white knight fellow who was at the confrontation, perceiving the fact that the birthday lady was getting upset at my polite refusal, strongly implied that I was being rude and that they could just go find out my birthday from HR. (I dont know if thats true) The whole thing was approached as if they were adults and I was an obnoxious teenager thumbing my nose at basic decency. I stiffened my back and firmly told them I'm an adult, asking politely to other adults to stop prying into my personal life and this would be the end of the discussion. It has not been mentioned since but I had heard that the birthday lady cried afterwards and does not like me anymore. Am I the asshole?

      "description": "TL:DR - I'm leaving my job and want to tell one of the managers she's a bag of shit. \n\nI'm leaving a job tomorrow and have been trying to decide whether or not I should email one particular manager and finally be honest about what I think of her.\n\nTo put it in context, she's selfish, rude and insulting, lazy and more. She's terrible at the job and at every opportunity passes work to someone else. With me being the complaints handler, that is often me.\n\nShes completely incompetent and has made no effort to learn anything about the business or industry she works for, there are now agents who are one month into to working there who know more than she does.\n\nHer whole team of about 10 staff has filed at least one report each about her and I myself have raised two formal complaints (complete with investigation and evidence to support my points) and nothing has happened. The reason for this (as has been confirmed to me by another manager) is that she's the only female manager, and firing her would result in a lack of diversity amongst the management team.\n\nSo - would I be the asshole if I let her know that I think she's entirely the wrong person for the job, and the fact she's put no effort into learning makes her a bad person? I'd word it 'democratically' of course. I've been torn because I also want to maintain my professionalism. \n\n",

      "description": "One of my better friends since high school is getting married to a girl whose family I've known even longer than him, she is batshit crazy, as well as her entire family.  I was very clear with him that he should've never started dating her given everything I fucking know about her and her family, but what does my numbnut of a friend do?  \n\nAt this point, all her friends are having babies, so she has baby fever all the time... And you guessed it, she stopped taking her birth control and other medications without telling him, AS THEIR RELATIONSHIP OF A WHOPPING SIX MONTHS WAS COMING TO A CLOSE, and she's pregnant.   They had literally already broken up when she found out (and THEN had the fucking nerve to ask him to pay her next months rent, that kind of person).  At this point, I'm trying to give advice the best I can, between getting the fuck out and going for custody if he actually wants the kid (she's like documented crazy, so I didn't think it'd be too difficult) and he *moves. the. fuck. in. with. her.*  \n\nSo now, the kids like 1, we only talk when one of our sports teams waxes the other, and I just got a wedding invitation in the mail.

      "description": "My first post and I'm on a mobile so apologies if the formatting is wrong.\n\nSo I'll start off by saying that I have never and would never cheat on my boyfriend, so in a way this whole thing is pointlessly hypothetical, but it's still been bothering me. We've been together for over a year and are both in our early twenties. He's always had trust issues, mainly due to low self-esteem which wasn't helped when his last (long term) girlfriend left him for someone else.\n\nSo basically the other day he told me that if I cheated on him he'd revenge-cheat on me. He's mentioned this before but it was a lot earlier in our relationship so I kinda figured the more he grew to care about me the less this would be an issue. Apparently not. I'm hurt that he's the kind of person who would want to hurt me, even if I hurt him. If he cheated on me, I'd be distraught, but I'd never do anything to hurt him because I love him. I kinda feel it should be the same for him. I'm also hurt that he even considers the possibility that I'd cheat on him, because I never would.\n\nJust a bit of background regarding our relationship, I'm not sure how relevant it is. When I first started going out with him I was already in love with someone else, unreciprocated, and I'd never made any attempt to be with this person either before or during my relationship with my boyfriend, so it was merely an internal struggle of mine. He found out about this and was extremely hurt that I hadn't told him about this when we first got together. We hadn't even said the L word to each other at this point. This, I think, has made him trust me less than he otherwise would.\n\nSo reddit, WIBTA for getting upset at my boyfriend's plan to revenge cheat on me if I ever cheated on him? ",

      "description": "My dog, who I'll refer to his name (Max), has been sick for a few years. Before I say anything else...yes, he's been to the vets and we make sure to give him the medication she gave him. As well as get more of it when necessary, or near out of meds for him.  \n\n Max has been coughing during changes in weather more so than any other time. I've been taking him to the vet and we've been getting medicine for max. He's got a heart murmur and apparently fluid around the heart. The medicine he is on is helping him. But whenever max starts up, my step father sits here and demands the dog be caged because \"he doesn't cough in the cage\"...which is a blatant lie as I've heard him multiple times coughing. The fluid pills and another medicine make him drink more and urinate more. He wouldn't be able to signal when he needed out and he wouldn't have access to water, as he dumps it instantly. \n\nI also feel that it isn't right to put max in the cage all day and have him just placed away from everyone and the other pets over him occasionally having coughing fits. As if he's just some piece of property of something. He's started to play and be hyper again most days. The coughing has drastically gone down. Both in how severe and how long. Normally I wouldn't get into arguments, but I'm honestly on the verge of exploding. \n\nThe reason being he claims he deserves peace...yet has made my childhood a living hell. Max isn't isn't coughing as much or as bad and less often. But never let's anyone else get peace. Especially when I was little. My step father would just wake everyone up yelling and cursing, going off and cussing about some random thing, accusing someone of moving something of his when he moved it, blasted stupid preachers all day and night to where we hear it anywhere in the house, spys on phone calls of outs, etc. Still does, unfortunately. But he knows that mac is going to remain like this unless something else can be done about his heart murmur. Ironically pointed out how much better max is doing on this medicine only hours ago. \nBut AITA for not wanting to have to put my dog in the cage constantly over this? And not wanting to subject him to that? ",

While I was dropping my girlfriend off at the train station, I found a dog in the street, he had no collar but was friendly and seemed well fed so I assumed he wasn’t a stray, after knocking on all the doors of houses on that street, I found out which house he belongs to, however no one answered the door after I tried knocking many times, I left my contact info with their neighbors and decided I’d come back tonight or as soon as they called me, and took the puppy back to my house. I didn’t feel right leaving him in their yard with no fence. The thing is, I have never owned a dog and don’t really know what to do with one, so idk if it was irresponsible of me to take this dog into my care for the day, but it seems better than just leaving him?

Today I received an email from the coach of the other team. He stated that we exhibited unsportsmanlike behaviour by allowing the score to get so big and that one of his players was considering quitting football due to the result.\n\nTo give some more details, at no point during the game did he ask me to take our foot of the pedal. In addition I took both of our strikers off with 20 minutes to go (they had 6 goals each at this point) to let the Centre Backs have a go up front. \n\nObviously I feel bad that some of his players felt disheartened due to the result. However I have always distilled in my team that they should treat the game as if it's 0-0 at all times. He also never asked for mercy during the game and seemed like a good sport about the result at the final whistle. Had he asked I probably would have told my players to go easy on them from that point.\n\nSo AITA for letting the score reach 19-1?",

      "description": "Sorry for the book -- TLDR at the bottom.\n\nSo, for some context -- I found my current flat mate (26F) via craigslist. She moved into my (30M) apartment at the end of September and signed a lease that goes through August of the following year. Everything is great and we get along pretty well -- we enjoy similar music, both musicians, have similar sense of humor (all things I vetted before offering her the room to move into so not a huge surprise). That said, on December 9th she says that we need to talk and she basically said that she needs to move out. That she was naive with her finances and while she can afford the rent, she doesn't have as much money left over after paying rent to do things she wants to do. I told her that I understand and that I've been in that position before. I said that we can work something out but I was very clear in that I'm not going to just let anyone move in and also told her that it might be a hard search because pretty much no one moves here (Chicago) in the winter for obvious reasons (she's not from here so may not have been something she thought about). She said that she totally understood and that while she would like to move out January 1st (tomorrow) and that if we haven't found anyone by then that she would cover rent until we found someone and then even up with whoever moved in. We're all on the same page. She goes out and finds a sublet at a new apartment with much cheaper rent for a January 1 move in date.\n\nSo the next day a put up a craigslist post and some posts on facebook and what not. No responses. She puts up a craigslist post as well and gets no responses as well. Then, around December 27th we get a few people interested. On the 28th 3 people came by to check out the apartment and the room. First 2 dudes were nice and all but just didn't seem like people I have really any interest in living with. 3rd person is a lady around my age -- seemed cool then dropped a bomb in that I would have to be okay with her parents staying in the apartment for a month over the summer as they visit from India every summer. Yea, no. \n\nSkip to the next morning and I was talking with my roommate about the room situation and she says \"so we need to make a decision on which of the guys you like best in the next day or so.\" Hot blinding rage. She has a friend over so I just say \"yea, we can talk about this later after I think on it some more.\" Later that day when she returns home by herself I told her that I don't think I like either of the guys enough to live with them. I also told/reminded her that I'm not going to rush into a new roommate just because it's most convenient to her and tried to make it super clear that I think I'm being very understanding and actually letting her break her leases. She comes back to reality and kind of says \"yea, i know, i was just hoping you liked one of the guys.\"\n\nToday I get home from running some errands and my flat mate says \"I need to message those 2 guys and let them know about the room today.\" I responded \"Oh, sorry -- yea, I dont really think I'd like to live with either.\" She kind of gives me an \"oh reeeaaallyyy but they were both very nice.\" I said \"yea, but living with someone in a not huge apartment is more than someone just being nice.\" She goes radio silent, puts the food she was eating down and walks into her room and closes the door and hasn't spoke to me since. Clearly she's super annoyed with me. All that said, am I being the asshole here? I feel like I'm being pretty understanding but maybe I'm not?\n\nTLDR: Flat mate is broke and wants to break lease and move out. I say fine and now she's annoyed with me that I wont let just any random person move in.",

      "description": "So me, a male and my female girl friend were having a hypothetical conversation about if we got married and had kids. Keep in mind this isn’t serious at all and kind of a joking conversation. But she insisted if we got married that she would keep her last name and if we had kids that they would also take her last name. I said I was willing to compromise with her and the kids having both of our last names but she disagreed and said she’d compromise by having two kids and one gets her last name and one gets mine. Again this is all one big hypothetical joke which doesn’t any impact on our relationship, I’m just trying to figure out who the asshole is lol.",

      "description": "So, my sister (24F) and I(25F) moved into an apartment together in December 2018. The agreement was she would pay the rent ($890) and I would pay everything else. This was because I had just started working at a stable job (12/hr) while she already had one (15/hr). \n\nHowever, in January 2019 she decided to quit her job to start a business and drives Uber to make income. Now, she wants me to start paying half the rent as well because she says she doesn't make enough money to do anything. \n\nThe problem is she is confused on why I expect us to go half on all the household bills because apparently I make enough to afford it. I pointed out I have an excess of money because I don't have other personal bills (ie car note, insurance, furniture bill,etc). \n\nMonthly Household Bills:\nRent $890\nComcast $150 (phone,internet,tv)\nTmobile $154\nGrocery $200\nGas $110\nElectric $50\nMisc $20\n\nMy personal bills include a marta bus pass, $5 student loan, $50/wk allowance while she has a car bill, car insurance, furniture bills, student loan payment.\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for expecting my fiancé to invite me to her bosses party?",
      "description": "A little background on us – I am a 35 year old male and my fiancé is a 34 year old female.  We both have professional careers that sometimes spill into our personal lives.  The work doesn’t stop at the door kind of jobs.  We’ve been dating for a little over 2 years.  We just recently had a son together 2.5 months ago.  As of right now her parents are living with us for the first 4 – 6 months to help us adjust to working and taking care of the little one. Those details aren’t exactly relevant but I wanted to paint an accurate picture of the situation. Since we’ve been dating I have invited her to multiple events with my friends or after work activities. She has met all of my close friends and colleagues on multiple occasions. She of course always has the option of declining but the invitation is always extended. \n\nHer boss typically throws parties at their residence once or twice a month.  It’s seems to be a pretty common thing. I’ve gone to the last 2 of these parties with my fiancé and it isn’t exactly my type of crowd but I don’t mind going and interacting with her colleagues.  This isn’t a “work” event; I would describe them as mixers to mingle socially.  There isn’t a work topic or project discussion.  It’s just drinking alcohol, eating food and discussing anything and everything.  Other people have brought their significant others to these parties and it didn’t seem to be a problem.  I was specifically told by my fiancés boss that I’m invited anytime. \n\nThey’re having another party tonight but this time my fiancé told me she doesn’t want me to go.  “It’s a work thing and everyone else doesn’t bring their significant others every time.”  She said she doesn’t want to do things with me all the time and she wants to be independent and have her own life. I can totally understand wanting to have your own space.  I also want my own space sometimes but socially I’ve always thought that couples should go to things like parties or mixer events together. We should make an attempt to share our lives and grow together.  This is what I’ve always thought and believed based on my peers and examples from my family growing up. \n\nMy fiancé and I also barely spend any time together. Last week she worked late every night until around 8:30 – 9 or so and she said she liked the freedom and feeling of being able to do whatever she wanted.  I start getting ready for bed around 9:00 pm because I go to work earlier than she does. So last week we really didn’t spend any time together at all. Unless I make a specific point and say we should go out on a date and spend some alone time together, it doesn’t happen.  She spends the vast majority of her time with her parents or working on a project at home or at the office. \n\nAITA for expecting her to invite me to her boss’s party? I’ve also been told that some of the behavior she’s exhibiting could be related to postpartum depression.  This is probably not the sub to ask that question but does anyone have experience with it? \n",

      "description": "\\[Background\\] When I was younger, 13-15 or so, I would go over to my Aunt's house across the street almost everyday after school. My Aunt said it was fine to me and my parents. I came by regularly because my grandma often cooked dinner and my cousins were fun to hang with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while, I heard some comments being made that I was rude and spoiled because I didn't always say \"hello, how are you aunt\" to my Aunt every time I entered her house. Now, even though I had a lot of social anxiety growing up, I would still say hello or greet my aunt if she was nearby when I went to her house for dinner (which, again became a regular established thing after school by both parties). But often, she was watching tv, or in a different room, I just feel like that's awkward to go up to her, say hello, and then retreat into a different room where my cousins were. The same \"rude\" comments happened again but with not always saying bye (if they are in their own room or look busy, I just would rather leave silently) when I'm leaving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I get that saying hello and a proper greeting to someone isn't hard, which I always do when I'm visiting someone's house for the first time and meeting everyone. But I just feel like in my established situation greeting someone \"properly\" I see almost every day, every-time is just isn't that big of a deal. AITA?",

      "description": "My husband, infant daughter, and I were happily living in a rental home that we planned to stay in for several years. We had painted and made the house our own. My MIL lived close to us but wanted to move 2 hours away to be near my BIL and his daughter, so she stayed with us while her house was being built. She asked us to come move to that area, and she offered to pay for our down payment for a new home there, and that we could live with her in her new home until we find our new house.\nWe moved in with MIL, and had picked out a house we loved and the loan officer said we were all set and ready to go, as long as we were still being gifted the down payment. We then checked in and asked them if they would still be able to help us with the down payment, and they said they couldn't as they were no longer in a good financial situation.\nMy MIL then apologized to me later about not being able to pay for our down payment and I told her we completely understand and that we’re just SO thankful that they even offered.\nShortly after, my husband and I decided to rent a place of our own - primarily because it was hard for my MIL to work with the noise from my 1 year old. We are now trying to pay off our debt and saving for our second baby.\nFast forward a couple of months and my BIL has been living with MIL since we left, and started dating a wonderful girl. They shortly got engaged and are now getting married in fall, and they want to buy a house now.\nWith the wedding costs AND now buying a house my BIL/SIL realized maybe they wouldn’t be able to afford it right now. So they asked MIL if she would be able to pay for the down payment and she said “Yeah maybe I’ll have to talk to my husband” and so they assumed she wouldn’t be able to. Keep in mind his parents are now in WORSE of a financial stress than before and their debt has more than quadrupled since we last brought up our down payment, we know this as my husband helps his mother with her business and finances and she told him this herself.\n\nSIL and I were talking about how MIL has backed out on things, and so I brought up our down payment. SIL replied with how they realized they probably can’t afford to buy a house right now so they told MIL they are going to put that on hold. MIL then told them “Oh if it’s about the down payment then don’t worry about it! We’ll take care of that!” My heart sank, I was in a mix of emotions. I felt extremely happy for them, but at the same time I felt betrayed that MIL said she couldn’t pay our down payment, but then is now doing it for someone else. I reacted positively to SIL, but inside I felt really hurt towards MIL. They are now looking at the same houses we were.\nI feel like I'm being entitled by being upset, but at the same time it just feels wrong that my MIL said she couldn’t help us and then helps someone else. I just feel so hurt.\nSo AITA for feeling upset at my MIL?",

      "description": "Quick fact; My son is a month old, and he’s pretty hard to get to sleep, and doesn’t like to stay asleep if you try to set him down. \n\nSo my boyfriend works full time doing IT work, then he comes home and wants to play on his computer the rest of the night until he goes to bed. I do not work, and I stay home with the baby every day. \n\nThe thing is, the baby is extremely exhausting. He likes to eat all the time, like every hour, and he eats a lot. He also doesn’t like sleeping if he isn’t being held, and he will fight falling asleep as long as possible, which is very draining. I am the only one who wakes up at night for the baby so my boyfriend can sleep for work, but he only sleeps about 4 hours at night, then fussed for another 4, leaving me feeling so shitty the next day, and I can never get a nap in, or really do anything that requires two hands or I will be listening to a lot of crying. When my boyfriend gets home he takes a 1-3 hour nap, then goes downstairs to play on his computer, really not spending any time with me or the baby. \n\nAt around 9, I like to play a few rounds on my own computer (about 2 hours), so I let the baby lay on me while I play a bit, but sometimes towards the end of my games he will wake up and be upset I’m not giving him my full attention, and he will cry. I usually give him a pacifier and lay him in the swing between our computers, but if he drops the pacifier and starts crying, my boyfriend will just let him cry, and give me dirty looks if I let him cry for more than a few seconds. Today specifically, I was nearly begging for a nap, so my boyfriend took the baby downstairs, and then played his game. 30 min later he came back saying the baby was crying so he must be hungry, making me get up, and pretty much not getting a nap, and then I end up getting mad at him, telling him he’s a parent too, and he shouldn’t expect me to do everything all the time, and he counters with the “I work all day, and I did the dishes/started the washer/cleaned something”\nLater he took an hour nap.\n\nAITA for not caring that he works and still expecting a break when he gets home? I’m sort of sleep deprived so I can’t tell if I’m being irrational and I should just be happy that he’s supporting us, or if I need to have a more serious talk with him\n\n\n",

While she did say she was worried about me coming in between them and ruining their relationship (which I totally understand) she said that she would be an adult about it and told me to go ahead if I was interested. Her and her close friend hung out later that night and a few hours later my ex texted me and told me that their relationship was already ruined and that she couldn't handle the thought of me and her together and she has since blocked me on everything. Also to add, me and her friend had not said a word to each other at this point, so it wasn't like it was something I said. I feel conflicted because on one hand I should've just been smart about it and as soon as I saw they were friends just unmatched and moved on but also I feel like my ex knew from the start that me and her friend together would make her uncomfortable and she should've just been honest with me and this whole thing could've been avoided.

      "title": "AITA for knowing my partner struggles with mental health problems and letting her know that she was the culprit to the downfall of our relationship?",
      "description": "We met on an online mobile app game known as PUBG mobile. Out of hundreds of thousands of people that play, we ended up coming across one another. Turns out, we lived 20 minutes away from one another. Not seeking love nor nothing, we ended up falling for one another. The connection was unreal, never had I ever connected with someone as much as I do with her. We shared all the same likings and dislikes. It was as if I was looking at a mirrored image of myself, but her being female and I being male. We both believed we were destined to be together, as if we were the universe’s fated partner for one another.\n\nAs time went on, I ended up finding out about her mental health. Nothing new to me, as I too struggle with mental health. The times she was at a downfall, I wrote passages for her. Now, these weren’t cliche in my personal opinion. Some ended up being about 15,000 characters long, roughly about five pages long if processed through a word document. Some passages were just reassurance but other times they were centered around motivation. Words flowed ever so smoothly when it is I tried to help her. I know what it’s like to struggle with troubled thoughts, so I poured my heart into what it is I wrote. I never felt the need to write her anything worth meaning, it was something I genuinely enjoyed doing. Many of times I also ended up talking to her in a loving manner until she fell asleep on the phone. An effort I tried to do, so she could end up seeing that what she sees from my passages, can also be heard from my voice. It wasn’t something I took off the internet and copied and pasted, it was just pure raw emotion. This is something she adored and appreciated. \n\nI ended up facing my share of struggles throughout the relationship in which she’d comfort me. Just knowing she was on the other side listening to me,  brought me a sense of tranquility. I never asked her to produce passages as I did for her, which she never ended up doing. I was completely fine with that or so I thought. \n\nOne day while I had promised her a passage like no other she had ever received, she agreed and took the day to hang out with friends. I sat down and devoted my Saturday, typing away and constantly deleting stuff, because it wasn’t good enough. Only time I took a break was to use the restroom. Several hours had passed and she messaged me requesting to see what I had typed out. I expressed I wasn’t done, and she ended up getting extremely upset. I then had to wrap up what it was I had written in order to satisfy her need of getting to read what took me so long. After sending her this said passage, I received a response I quite frankly wasn’t expecting. I was told it took nine hours to write a mere two pages worth of writing. She stated that she envisioned herself writing more in that time, and even saw an author writing a chapter or more to their book in nine hours. Which enraged me, because she had never even wrote something as simple as a paragraph for me. I spent my whole day editing the passage, and trying for everything to flow ever so perfectly. It felt as if I had wasted my day. Before this I had thought she appreciated everything I did for her, but this planted a seed of doubt in me that she didn’t. \n\n\nThere was many things I ended up doing for her to show her I truly cared for her. I don’t have means of transportation as of right now, so I’ve ended up walking to her house - a 15 mile walk from where I reside. \nA walk that was supposed to take three and a half hours, ended up taking five since I ended up getting a sprained ankle along the way, not to mention there was a strong winter flurry here in Chicago at the time. Being how shitty this generation is, I personally think other males wouldn’t even drive that far, and in those conditions unless they were getting a sexual favor in return. \n\nThroughout the relationship we both told each other’s every move. What our plans were for the day, where we were, who we were with, and so forth. I personally initiated the start of us doing so, since I wanted her reassured and for her to begin trusting me, she ended up doing the same. This is the point in time where she started expressing how I couldn’t go on Facebook for the simple fact that other females uploaded profile pictures of themselves. She accused me of being on Facebook several times even when I wasn’t. After showing her undeniable proof that I wasn’t, she still doubted I wasn’t on. She thought I only went on to check out other females. I ended up deleting the app and messenger, and it still showed me being active on Facebook. She could use it, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t go on YouTube or watch television if there was a female in whatever it was I was watching. Whether it was a movie, a show, or a music video, it was me being unfaithful according to her, because I’d be “checking out” the females in it. Again, she could do watch anything she desired, but I couldn’t. Although she never said she could, she did it anyway, and got mad if I mentioned anything on how unfair it was. \n\nWhen I had first met her, she expressed how she never wanted to hear an insult coming from me to degrade her. I didn’t see why I would, and I promised her I wouldn’t. Reason she didn’t like it is because of her previous partner did it, and she ended up carving the word into her skin by means of a blade. Whenever it was that we argued, she ended belittling me so much to the point where I felt inferior. From calling me every name in the book to expressing how horrible I am as a human being. A cold heartless person. Again, she could do it, but if I did, it would be game over. There was a time I couldn’t take much more, and I ended up deleting her as a friend on Snapchat. This is something she had done towards me multiple times, and not just on Snapchat. I’d be deleted, blocked on all social media, and even my number. I did it once and she was engulfed in rage, it was as if I had done the worst thing imaginable. \n\nThere were many things she did that didn’t settle well with me, these are just a few of the things that transpired throughout our relationship. Anyways, I ended up breaking things off with her due to this reason. It was something that was affecting my mental health. She’d have narcissistic tendencies. Where rules would apply to others, but not to herself. Where what she said mattered, and nothing I said had any significance to it. I ended up telling her everything it is I did for her, and tried making her feel horrible for making me feel this way. Sorta like rubbing it in her face. Although enraged, I held back from using profanity. I made sure she knew that she was the culprit to the ending of our relationship. Knowing she struggles heavily with mental health problems, am I the asshole for leaving and making sure she knew that her insecurities and manipulative behavior is what got in between us? \n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Thursday night gf and I drove over 3 hours to go visit her family for the weekend.   I’ve met her parents and sisters before, but this is the first overnight night visit.   It’s been fucking miserable.  \n\nWe got there kinda late.  I was really tired from driving and just wanted to go to bed.   Gf slept most of the way and they were excited to see her so her mother and sisters stayed up.  I learned that I would be sleeping on the couch.  The same one they were all sitting on catching up.  So I just sat there quietly until about 2:30 when they finally went to bed.   I crashed.  \n\nAt 6am her father woke me up to tell (not ask) me to help him feed the farm animals they keep in their backyard.   I’m always trying to make a good impression with the man so I faked cheerfully said sure thing.   I’ve never really been around pigs and chickens so I didn’t know what I was doing.  So I asked him exactly what he wanted me to do.   He treated me like I was an idiot for not knowing and talked to me like you would talk to a little kid.  Whatever, I did what he said.  \n\nWe did a few other things around their coop and pen things that they have.  The whole time the man was irritated at me even though I did everything he said.  He said we were done for now and went into his garage.  So I went back inside and took a shower.  I was wide awake so I basically just sat on the couch on my phone until 9ish when my gf’s mom woke up and came out to start breakfast.  \n\nTrying to be nice I asked if I could help.  She asked me what I knew how to make and I told her pancakes.  She said that sounds good and she would make the eggs and sausage.  I’m a messy cook so I threw on one of the aprons.  Of course gf’s dad came and thought it was funny.  He said that looks about right.  And it’s good that I’m good for something since I’m useless on “the farm”.  \n\nGf and her sisters woke up soon after.  Her father complained to her about me right in front of everyone.  He said a lot of shit, but what bugged me the most was how was I gonna take care of her if I can’t even feed some chickens.   I’m 27 and I guarantee I’m make more than this man ever did in his entire life.  I have no problem taking care of her.   Gf didn’t say much.  Just laughed mostly.  \n\nAll day today this man has been taking jabs about me to them and directly to my face.   I don’t care about making an impression on him anymore.   I’m getting really close to my blow up point.  I know it’ll look really bad if I gf and I leave early, but I’d rather that then lose my cool and blow up at this asshole.  ",

      "description": "Backstory: So my friend and I have been best friends since we were kids. Most of our friendship has been long distance since her family moved out of state. We have been there for each other through everything...well up until recently. \n\nAs adults, our friendship went from talking every day to maybe once a week at most. When we do talk, it's always very one-sided and she talks for most of the phone call. When it's my turn, she always seems disinterested. For instance, I was talking to my sister about this very issue and the friend texted me saying we could try to talk. I was excited and talked a lot, but she was silent or preoccupied so I felt like an ass by the end of the call, which lasted about 10 minutes. I wouldn't be so sad about it, except she only will talk to me when shes driving home from work. She won't call on the weekends or evenings. She won't have a conversation through text, most of the time if I text her I dont get a response at all. Even when I have gone through some serious mental health problems, she still didn't put forth any effort to reach out, it was all me. I don't usually reach out after work or on the weekend anymore, she has a 6 month old and I know that must be time consuming. But now I dont really reach out at all. I feel like I'm having to force the a one-sided friendship. I wonder if maybe it's time to go our own ways, but I feel like a total asshole for it. ",

      "description": "A couple months ago I stopped in a Target on my way home from work to grab some things. I ended up in the electronics section where they had some TV's marked as clearance. I saw an LG OLED in that section and figured it couldn't hurt to check the price. It was marked as an Online Item (meaning someone ordered it but never picked it up according to the associate working there) and was marked at $244. \n\nI had been wanting an OLED for quite some time as I'm a sucker for a pretty picture, and had been slowly saving up to get one (seeing as the cheapest I'd ever seen one new was $1200, and it wasn't a necessity I knew I'd be saving for a while). So shocked at the crazy price tag at under $250 I called my wife to make sure she wouldn't kill me for spending $250 after spending quite a bit on Christmas and she was okay with it, I asked the associate if the sticker on the box was the actual price. He said it was the right price so I asked if I could buy it. \n\nEventually get home and set up my new toy, giddy with excitement like the child I am, I started a video to see how good it would look, at which point my wife snapped a really cute picture of me and my daughter standing watching the TV. She posted it to Facebook with a caption along the lines of \"Look how cute they are playing with his new TV!\" Someone commented asking if the TV was a Christmas gift, she gave a TLDR version of events saying how crazy the price was on the TV. Another one of her friends then comments and basically says I'm a terrible \"roll model\" for purchasing the TV, not informing the sales associate that the TV was $1500 online and that I should be ashamed that my dishonesty could end up costing that person their job finishing up the comment by saying my his parents raised him with values and mine didn't. \n\nI let my dad humor take over by replying saying \"That's okay I prefer being a bagel model to a roll model anyways\" to which he responded again saying I have no morals and was in the wrong for buying an item I knew was priced lower than it had any right to be. \n\nTruthfully I don't care what he thinks, he's not my friend and my wife barely knows him either, I'm just curious if I'm actually in the wrong for seeing a great deal and pouncing on it. \n\nTL:DR- TV at Target was priced $1250 cheaper than it was on their website so I bought it. Facebook friend says I'm a terrible person for buying TV for that price rather than informing them it might be priced wrong (although I did ask if it was priced correctly) ",

I’ve never really had to face any racist remarks towards me, except a few here and there, but I know that it doesn’t feel good being insulted for ones own heritage. I can’t stand racism, it pisses me off to no end when people are racist. Which is why I’m here, am I the asshole for telling my dad off?",

My school was running one of those bone marrow drives where they take a swab from your cheek to add your DNA to a database, and if they find you to be a match to someone who needs bone marrow, they give you a call. My issue with it is a ton of people were signing up who were openly saying they had no intention whatsoever of actually going through with the donation procedure if they got called. I'm of the opinion that joining this database if you already know you won't donate is a huge dick move as you're clogging up the system and giving the recipient false hope that they've found a match.

      "description": " My brother (22 M) and I (24 F)still live at home which isn’t uncommon in Sydney. He’s 22, and I'm almost 24. Neither of us are currently in a job that financially supports us independently. As a result, we're still living at home, saving money.\n\nFor *years* now, we have shared a bathroom upstairs (minus the toilet) and I am constantly unhappy with the state that it's when used by him. I have no issue if his room is messy. However, a communal area to be treated as such as if you're not sharing with other people really grinds my gears. I love him but he thinks he's Marie Kondo because he fucking loves mess.\n\nI’ve asked him not to leave his boogers on the shower walls. I've had to ask him multiple times to clean up his pubes that he's chopped off and left on the floor. I've purchased a basket forour laundry but he refuses to use it and leaves his clothes scattered. The bathroom mats he doesn't use and leaves the bathroom tiles wet. The list goes on. I don't even know if Marie Kondo could fucking handle him, honestly.\n\nI've tried both polite and aggressive methods over many years. I've sat him down countless times politely. On my off days, sometimes I snap. I'm only human and I do apologise to him. I've learned to take a breather before I say anything. I'm getting increasingly irritated that I have to remind him *over* and **over** politely basic common sense, cleanliness and tidiness.\n\nSo, the other bathroom that's downstairs (the only other bathroom, we don't use our parent's bathroom) near my room includes a toilet, which I use for washing my face, brushing my teeth and my daily bowel movements, that's it. It's not as nice as the one that we have to share. The shower downstairs is in awful shape. I could just move there and fix it up a bit, right? I guess I could but I think that resorting to move my routine there would only enable his poor habits and I don’t want to give him the satisfaction of having a nice bathroom all to himself.\n\nAs I mentioned, I use the bathroom downstairs solely for washing my face etc. The layout of this bathroom is poor. The towel rack is right next to the toilet, and as such, for a while I used to dry my face towels there. A month ago, I did this petty thing where I got sick of politely reminding him constantly to shut the toilet lid when he flushes. I don't want toilet water splash on my face towels. I wrote on a piece of paper *\"Please close the lid before flushing, thank you\"* and had it where you couldn't miss it - above the flush. It worked! He made some snarky comment about it, but it worked.\n\nNow, 'm thinking of doing this but for the bathroom. *\"Dirty clothes go in here\" \"Step on the mats instead of the tiles so the water drips on them instead\" \"De-clutter the basin\" \"Clean up your pubes\"* etc.  WIBTA in doing that? I feel as if I can't treat him as an adult, and at this point I honestly don't know what to do anymore. If I end up doing this I won't care if I sound patronising.",

The battery was dead and I just jumped it so I will be using it frequently again  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;PM: Well, if you dont drive it every day it would be easy to park along the curb.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: It was my understanding that the space was allotted to our unit. I don't understand how there could suddenly not be enough space?  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;PM: Well because when you moved in there was so many tenants without cars there was an open space for you but there's really only 14 spaces so it was a gift and now things have turned around and so I'm asking for some help\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't respond, but if she prompts further I plan to tell her no, I will not volunteer. \n\n  \nHer comments strike me as unprofessional and pushy, but in the spirit of neutrality here are some concerns about myself:\n\nI’m wondering if I’m just being stubborn and it’s not worth all the pushback.

She’s always told me she’s had trouble sleeping even before this job, but has also told me that when I’m there lying down with her it’s easier for her to fall asleep. I’ve never had any issue with this and even when she switched to overnight tried to lie down with her even if I’ve just woken up myself.  Recently I’ve had to stay up or I’ve had things going on throughout the day and I’m not able to lay down with her and if I’m being totally honest with everyone some days I just don’t  want to lay down the entire day. Here’s the issue. On the days when she asks me if I’ll go lay down with her and I’m either unable or unwilling to go with her, her demeanor will immediately change and she’ll bring up how she probably won’t get sleep today then and things of that nature. I’ve never called her out about it or anything like that but recently it’s been weighing on me that maybe I’m being selfish or shitty for not just laying down with her. I love her to death and want her to be comfortable and happy I just don’t want to lay around at all hours of the day. So what do you say guys. AITA?",

      "description": "Hi, I am hosting a family new years party and want people to bring a drink/snack. My cousin is in his early 30's and has 2 kids, who hate my kids and once damaged  my TV by pushing it over. They are also very picky eaters, meaning that I would have to make something for them. Apparently he was trying to see how sturdy it was, his father then wanted to pay me for the TV but didn't want to pay the actual price I paid (it was a quits expensive TV at the time) . My cousin also had no intention of bringing anything or helping in the preparation of drinks/snacks but wanted to take some home for his GF who had other plans. I told him that I would rather he stay with his GF as it would be easier for the both of us. He then told me he wanted to come but couldn't afford a drink as he spent too much on Christmas presents as he bought a fancy ring for his GF and a new gaming pc for himself but couldn't afford a cheap drink. \nI then told him that he could come if he could provide a drink and food for his kids. He told me the same sob story and asked if I could buy drinks for him and he would pay me back. I refused due to his previous record in loans. \n\n\nTLDR: asshole cousin wanted to come to New years celebration but couldn't provide food for his picky kids or a drink for the adults, and his kids broke expensive TV last time they were at my house, so I told him to go with his GF to her celebration and that he could only come if he provided food for kids and drinks for adults \nAITA \n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for trying to get my parents to divorce?",
      "description": "Hi, so I am 15 years old and for most of my life my parents have constantly argued every single day and they tell each other all the time they want a divorce, they aren’t happy, their a terrible partner, and etc.  I hate hearing them argue out of the blue over pointless things, and most of the time it’s my mom screaming at my dad for unreasonable things and for awhile I never got involved, I would just try to cancel out the noise when I was little. But over the course of a few years the arguing never gets easier to hear, despite my wishes for it to be. So I started to intersect in their arguments which may not be wise because it’s ultimately between them but sometimes it gets too hard to listen to. Anyways, so a couple of years ago I had an argument with my mom that I always tend to think about. One day I found messages that my mom sent another man that were sexual and they were talking about a meet up and etc. This also isn’t the first time I’ve seen questionable messages that she has sent to another man, the first time I was really young maybe around 9 and I brought it up to my dad and my mom told me to tell my dad it was a joke. So anyways that second time I found messages I was really angry and I texted my dad everything and sent him pictures of everything. I was also being impulsive and messaged my mom and told her what I found and how it was stupid of her to waste all of my dad’s time to be with her if she’s in an unhappy relationship. So my mom got home and went apeshit on me and basically was telling me how that’s just how people talk and that my dad and her were fine before I got in the way and started telling him this stuff. So for awhile after that I’ve kept trying to tell my dad to just get a divorce because he’s always complaining about my mom, and I hate that they bring me into their problems and complain about each other to me as it affects me too.  But my dad keeps telling me once he has a stable job he’ll leave (my mom is the breadwinner in my family) and I was recently told my mom would have gotten a divorce with my dad if she wasn’t at risk to lose things that she’s worked hard for. \n\nEvery time I intersect one of their arguments it’s always my mom bringing up stupid little things to my dad and I tend to be very blunt and harsh towards her because what she’s screaming to my dad about is not important. For example, my dad went out for lunch today with his brother (she also went out for lunch yesterday with a friend) and my mom created this huge deal out of it and turned it into she does everything and he does nothing. Which could be farther from the truth, my whole life my dad has supported my brother always trying to make us happy. So every single time my mom brings up a small thing and creates it into an argument I always tell her that she does the exact same thing and she’s being extremely hypocritical for screaming at him for doing something she did yesterday. Every time I tell her how hypocritical and immature she’s being she starts turning it around on me telling me that I’m ungrateful, unappreciative, entitled and etc. Now I feel like I’m always being bitchy to my mom which I hate doing but every time I try to have a conversation with her she turns it into how my dad does nothing everyday. So I keep telling my dad to just leave and I tell my mom to just leave and neither of them do it, despite them always saying they want to. \n\nOverall, basically what I’m trying to get at is that I’ve been trying to get my parents to divorce for a couple years now and I’ve told close friends that I have and they all think I’m fucked up for trying to ruin a marriage, but I honestly believe that it’s been ruined for a while and I just want them to finally get the happiness they want and be with other people.  I love both of my parents I appreciate everything they’ve ever done for me and the support they’ve given me throughout my life. But growing up in this type of household of hearing constant screaming every single day has affected me so much and I just want them to get a divorce and be happy. But I don’t want to rule out other possibilities that I might not understand, for example perhaps they have some sort of arrangement or decision, or maybe they don’t want to get a divorce because I’m still just a kid to them (I’ve brought up that I understand divorce to them and they shouldn’t not get a divorce because of me.) Honestly I wish this wasn’t how I felt about their relationship, I would love to have parents who are together forever, but I want to be realistic about this which is understanding they shouldn’t be together despite my wish for them to be. Anyways, am I the asshole for wanting my parents to divorce? ",

      "description": "This will be long but I'll try to explain this as clearly and succinctly as possible. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nA few months ago I ended up getting involuntarily hospitalised for a suicide attempt. I got held for a week as the suspected cause was a bad reaction to medication. \n\nMy mother informed my boss (I couldn't contact my employer directly) and she was very understanding.\nI went back to work as soon as I was released. My employers continued to be nice and kept saying \"If you need anyhelo just ask\".\n\nI was doing my job very well by all accounts and worked on big holidays to make up for my absence. However it all seemed to suddenly go downhill when I took them up on their offer. \n\nThe workloads had increased for everyone, but strangely they'd gone up most for me and another colleague who's quite ill (a chronic illness). \nOne day I called and asked for assistance with the day's workload (I completed 95%). No one answered twice but I left a message. I ended up not being able to complete all my tasks after 9 hours and clocked out. The manager proceeded to scream at me and the next day my boss said \"getting help isn't part of your salary\" and that if I couldn't do the job I couldn't work there.\n\nAfter that I never failed to complete all tasks despite them steadily escalating but their treatment of me also declined, including being mocked for my physical appearance, the way I talk, what I eat and performing multiple checks on me per day to see if I failed anything despite me having the best customer feedback. \n\nNow I appear to have been soft fired, meaning they've changed my contract to an hourly contract and they're giving me about 50-70% less hours.\n\nSo AITA for taking so much time off then fucking up that day? \nAre they the assholes for their actions?\nBoth? Neither?\n\nTL;DR I tried to commit suicide, week long hospitalisation, employers initially understanding, devolved into workplace harassment and removing most work hours following a bad work day.\n\nNote: All this treatment was also aimed at my sick colleague but her employment is safe as she's been there for 15 years and has an ironclad contract. \n",

      "description": "So my wife (46F) and I (40M) have a problem that she is not as interested in sex as me and for the past half year we’ve have sex about once a month, leaving me deeply frustrated and worried about our relationship. In an attempt to get her back to feeling in a more physically romantic way I arranged a romantic weekend away from home. After a great dinner and several pubs we get back to where we are staying. Listening to music, chatting away, in the sofa together, I start making a move. We are both into it although she is finishing off a cup of tea at the same time as we are getting it on. We are well into the trousers off and crotch-grabbing stage, but she’s suddenly back in the kitchen. Back to me on the sofa again, but then after a minute back in the kitchen again. I’m wondering what’s going on and then the penny drops - although we are quite far into foreplay she has decided to make another cup of tea. As she comes back over, she can tell something is wrong and asks what’s up. I am honest about the fact that I am upset by her priorities: me not feeling very desired by her is a big problem for me and so when she decides to make more tea (with all the faffing that involves) when we are already quite into foreplay for the first time in a while, it indicates to me that her priorities are far from what I’d like them to be. She tells me I’m being silly: she’s just thirsty (her last cup of tea was too small). I tell her she could have just drunk a quick glass of water instead. She tells me I am being too controlling. I tell her I’m not stopping her drinking tea; I’m just upset that she prioritises that in the middle of foreplay, especially as our (lack of a) sex life is a really problematic issue for me. She tells me I’m needlessly ruining a good evening and I need to apologise. I tell her I’m just being honest about how upset I am about her priorities. And so on in circles. She has now gone to bed and I am still on the sofa contemplating the sexless years of marriage to come until our children grow up. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Right away this sounds like I'm just looking for sympathy, but I'm honestly conflicted. I'm usually the type to stay out of other people's personal lives unless asked otherwise. \n\nAnyways, I'm a junior in high school, and my friend is a freshman. She's a nice girl in general tho rather immature at times and the adopted sister of one of my best friends since I was small. She was in the foster system for most of her life and has had a lot of emotional trauma. Anyways, I bowl for my high school team and so does her boyfriend, whom I've known for many years. Before we bowled in high school together, though, we bowled in a Thursday league together. This is where it gets a bit messy.\n\nIn leagues, he bowled for the team that teased and bullied me both behind my back and to my face for a good five years if not longer. Insults ranged from calling me garbage to just calling me a bad bowler. It didn't bother me too much, but I always had high self esteem when I was younger. I had been away from him (and his team) for two years between when I started high school bowling and he started, since he is also two years younger than me. \n\nA couple of weeks ago I had to interact with him as a high schooler for the first time. He berated me for my sexuality (which had been told to him by one of the girls on the team) and made fun of my boyfriend and my bowling. I also found out he was making fun of me behind my back, predominantly about the fact that I tripped and twisted my ankle while I was bowling (I'm quite clumsy). Again, it doesn't bother me much. Teenage boys or stupid.\n\nThe next week my friend tells me she's dating him. I don't say much at first, but eventually tell her all the things he (and his friend, who she also spends time with, and was also on the team that made a lot of fun of me). I expected her to be understanding. Instead she screams at me, telling me I don't understand him and just because he says some things doesn't mean he's bad. She also tells me to grow up. \n\nQuite frankly I'm confused but feel terrible. AITA?\n\ntl;dr my emotionally messed up friend is dating someone who bullied me as a child and is mad at me for telling her he might not be right for her.",

      "title": "WIBTA if I broke up with my BF because he refuses to get a therapist?",
      "description": "I (24 M) met my boyfriend (26 M) around 2 years ago. Our relationship started out great, but last year we broke up for a few months because my BF is severely depressed and having a serious relationship while battling depression was a bit too much for him.\nI was super shocked back then cause I had no idea he was going through all that (he‘s the type of guy who conceals his emotions). Anyways, I gave him the space he needed and said he could ring me up and ask for help any time.\n\nA few months later we got back together. I was a little suspicious cause something as serious as depression doesn’t just go away after 4 months. Whenever I tried to talk about it he gave me vague answers and changed the subject though. I didn’t want to make him uncomfortable, so I stopped asking. I figured it may have been just a depressive episode and wasn’t a permanent thing.\n\nFast forward to today and my BF is constantly in a bad mood, looks sickly, and doesn’t eat or talk much. You can just tell that he’s feeling miserable. I sat him down to talk about it and he confessed his mental health has gotten worse again. Naturally, I suggested that he should seek some type of professional help but he just blatantly refused, saying stuff like „It‘s not like a doctor can cure me“. I told him that I know how hard it is to take that first step but I really want him to get help. Of course no therapist can magically cure him, but at least he‘ll receive proper counseling and medication. I even said I’d help search for a therapist and go with him if he needs someone by his side - but it was like I was talking to a wall. Bottom line is: Therapy isn‘t an option for him.\n\nNeedless to say, worrying so much about him and constantly arguing about the therapy thing is slowly starting to impact my own mental health.\n\nThese days I often think about breaking up with him because the whole situation is just so damn frustrating and overwhelming. Even though I care for him and try to make sure he’s okay 24/7, I am NOT a professional who can handle serious cases like him. I can show support and be there for him when he needs a shoulder to lean on, but that’s as far as it goes.\nOn the other hand, just breaking up with him like that simply feels wrong. I might have my limits, but how could I let someone I love and care for down like this?\n\nTo make things worse, both he and other people have often pointed our how important I am to him. My BF constantly tells me that he doesn’t know what he‘d do without me and even his parents (the only other people who are aware of his mental health problems) have told me that I‘m possibly the best thing that’s happened to him in the last few years. Before you ask: Yes, they‘re just as frustrated about his refusal to get help as I am.\n\nNow that I‘m having all these conflicting thoughts, I really need to know: Would I be the asshole if I broke up with him?

My sisters boyfriend is older than me and works as a waiter. He has a degree in economics so I said if he sent me a resume i'd consider hiring him and we spoke for a couple hours about how he could improve his situation and I said I would  help him out. He sends me the resume and it's pretty bad 2.1 CGPA, no internships, no experience, he went to a pretty low ranked school, didn't play any sports etc. I would never hire him if I didn't know him. I spoke to him and said I can't hire him and he starts explaining his situation saying he was depressed in school etc and I just said I can't do it I have people on my payroll that went to an Ivy league, have a 3.8 gpa and internships every year, nepotism can only take you so far I would have definitely overlooked 1 or 2 negatives but an entire resume of negatives is something I can't overlook. I just feel bad about maybe giving him false hope and I seriously don't see a way out of being a waiter and I couldn't think of any advice for him. idk he was just emotional about it so I feel bad\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA For hiding my mother’s things around the house?",
      "description": "Obviously, by the phrasing and lack of background the answer seems clear so let me clarify. My mother ever since I was a young child has constantly moved my items into hidden locations in the house, forgets she puts them there, and then gets mad when I accuse her of losing my items and/or when I get angry for her moving them. She says she likes to keep a tidy house and everything should have a location. I understand this in theory, but seriously how irritating was my laptop on the kitchen island that you had to put it in the nightstand of my brother’s (he hasn’t lived at home in years) bedroom. \n\nSo after so many years of this, especially my big ticket items being moved right before I return to university I decided to do the same thing to her so she can understand how annoying it is. So I took her iPad and I put it in the electronics cubby under our basement tv, essentially no one ever looks there. At first, I intentionally didn’t tell anyone where it was, but after a few days I genuinely forgot. She comes looking for it about a week later (her work vacation) and can’t find it on her designated place of on the coffee table. She immediately is upset thinking someone stole it. She searches frantically around the house. When she finds it and asks who put this there I of course say me. She immediately starts crying asking why I would want to intentionally do this to her in revenge  for something she feels every mother does. She says that I just don’t understand parenthood or that this is her house and my items are in her way. \n\nSo now I feel kinda bad, but I genuinely think she’s in the wrong for always moving my stuff and NEVER telling me where she put them. I understand it’s her house, but it shouldn’t be that hard to not touch someone else’s personal items if they are not directly in your way. My dad refuses to weigh in. My mom says she’s thoroughly disappointed in how I can ‘demonize’ “loving motherhood”. \n\nTLDR: mom hides my shit for 20 years, I hide hers once, she cries and  says I demonize her loving maternal concern for my organizational skills.

A group of people in my class were talking about Oscar winners and how some were well deserved and others not so much.\n\nOne person from this group was browsing winners through their phone and started ranting about how only white actors/actresses won an Oscar for best leading actor/actress, and that black actors won best supporting actor/actress. This really pissed her off as she thought that the Academy was being racist with their decision to not award black actors/actresses as best actor/actress. So I told her, “Maybe the white people simply did a better job of acting in a leading role than the black people.” \n\nShe then started to get really pissy and also started to call me a racist for what I said. I believe that the award should be given to those who did the greatest job in acting. Rami Malek and Olivia Colman both performed very well in their films which is why they were given the award.

      "description": "Keep in mind that this is indeed a high school relationship! I want to make sure all judgement is based off of accurate info! \n\nabout 4 months ago, I broke up with my girlfriend after 2 years of dating. After about a year and a half I felt that there was no reason to have her in my life and for her to have me in her life, but due to her steady struggle with depression and bipolar disorder, I felt obligated to stick around and help her in the sense of “mental health security” if you will. I showed signs of disinterest so that I wouldn’t be leading her on, but because she was so focused on the bad parts of life, she didn’t see that I was losing that romantic connection with her. Because of the 2 years of her depression, the negativity got to me to the point where I felt trapped in one spot as my moral compass demanded that I sacrifice my own well-being to assist her, not necessarily as a responsibility but as an act of human decency. The main reason why I wanted to stick around was because I knew that she was a dependent person and she always told me that a relationship only works with effort, and I tried everything I could to just be there for her, but the continuous cycle was putting me into my own state of a negative disposition. I knew that if I was unable to help myself, there was no way I would be able to help her anymore. \n\nAs horrible as it felt, one day when she questioned my behavior, i decided to tell her the truth. Initially I wanted a break, meaning that I wanted to pause from the romantic stuff, as well as taking a break from taking care of her every single time she felt upset. I thought that it was unhealthy for her to end up depending on me all her adolescent life to the point where she won’t know how to help herself growing into adulthood. The more I thought about it, the more i realized how she only brought negative energy from my life that at the same time highlights our incompatibility: disapproving parents due to a thick religion barrier, an almost polarizing foundation of opinion, and even a big difference of self-interests. So upon days and days of thinking, I told her that I didn’t want to go on a “break”, but a full on breakup.\n\nI don’t regret my decisions as now things are going great in my life, and I hear that she has gotten over it now, I think that i’ve made the right decision, assholian or not. \n\nI am however only a kid getting out of school soon to pursue greater things in my life, so I know this may seem like one of those “you don’t know what love is” scenarios, but I still would very much like to know if I ATA, for I improve off of criticism and all opinion (in my opinion) is a valid option to learn from.

I was one of his only friends and the first person he came to with everything. \n\nA few months into our friendship, he came out to me as trans and I told him I still cared about him, not to tell people he knew wouldn't react well, etc.  He didn't heed this advice and came out to everyone in his life throughout the next week. His abusive sibling started treating him even worse and he attempted suicide several times that week.\n\n Again, I was his closest friend and one of maybe 2 people he really opened up to. I wanted to be there for him unconditionally so I never established any boundaries, which was super irresponsible, even considering that I was 14.

      "description": "Tom and I started dating in January of this year. After 3 months we realized while we enjoyed hanging out, there was no real romance between us and we decided to stay friends. In September we decided to rent a house together (with his brother as the 3rd roommate) since we are similarly financially stable. We double/triple confirmed with each other that moving in together would effectively rule out any future romantic entanglements as it would get very messy, very easily. \n\nA friend of mine, Jen, lives about 2 hours away but is taking classes about 15 minutes from my house. Most of her classes are in the afternoon or night, but she has one morning class. I offered up our guest room (after checking with Tom and his brother) for her to crash in, to make her mornings a little smoother. She came 1 night a week for about a month but after we realized the 3 of us got along it has moved to 3-4 nights a week.\n\nI have known Jen since we were 12. She dates like a hurricane. She bounces from guy to guy, in love one minute, ghosting them the next. She has /occasionally/ had some overlap between boyfriends or has been willfully ignorant of someone's relationship status. I don't really approve, but she's a grown woman and can do what she wants.\n\nShe joked early on somewhere around the lines of \"Who do you have to sleep with to afford a house like this?\" and I didn't take it seriously as this is her sense of humor. She has dated and broken up with 4 guys this year, the most recent breakup the first week of November.\n\nOccasionally Jen will get to the house before I get home from work and she and Tom will watch tv together. But all of a sudden I would come home from a weekend away and find out she had stayed the whole weekend. I told her I didn't mind if she stayed there while I wasn't there, but to give me a heads up first. She has done it a couple times since.\n\nShe and I had a girls night out last week and she was joking about how dating my roommate would be such a convenient commute. I brushed it off but she kept making jokes like that throughout the night. I finally said, \"Please don't date my roommate. Whatever drama you inflict on him I have to live with.\" She got very quiet and changed the subject. I felt like an asshole for taking a joke seriously.\n\nAnd now I have found out that they have already been dating/sleeping together. I caught her coming out of his room this weekend, along with some other irrefutable proof. She doesn't know that I know.\n\nAITA for confronting her, and telling her to stop? I feel like it's a dick move to date an ex, even worse when I specifically asked her not to, made all the worse that she's doing it behind my back and lying to my face. Or is this all completely high school drama and I need to get over myself?\n\n\n",

Things were going well for a few weeks we did catch her out in a few lies but didn't make to much of an issue of it.  \n\nHowever she told my wife that she had been seeing a new boyfriend who is 19yr. Had a big argument over it and after it she posted some stuff online saying 15 and 19 is not a big issue and is legal  (N.S.W Australia) it is not.  We talked to her Nan and she thinks we should try and control the situation by not letting then be alone. \n\nSo wife and I talked and decided it was no longer worth our time to try and help her. We packed up her stuff while she was at school and moved it to her Nans. While we did it we found bottles of alcohol, used condoms and a pregnancy test as well as a knife.

      "description": "I recently moved into an apartment complex, been there for about 4 months now. We have assigned parking up until about a month ago the spot to my right was vacant. The person on my left assuming it’s a family always backs in their van directly on the line I assume because they load their family in on the other side and park towards the top of spot. We have pretty deep parking spaces I’ve learned to live with this by parking my car further back so everyone’s happy. I now have someone parking on the right of me now a new neighbor and for some odd reason they always turn their wheels when they park to the left. Keep in mind we are on flat ground. But they turn their wheels unnecessarily onto the line if not into my spot completely (will attach photo to show) I don’t know why but I’ve been getting very irritated lately because it blocks my door and makes it difficult for me to park because both neighbors park closest to my lines on each side now most days I can angle my car in to the point where me and my girlfriend can get out but very tightly but some days when I see it I get really upset probably more than I should and have my girlfriend get out and I park into my space straight and block the person on my rights door just so it’s difficult for them to get into their car. Hoping that they would thing wow I should stop parking this way. I also look at the car to the right of them as well to see if they’re making them park that way and that car is parked perfectly normal every time. I’ve seen them one time and asked them very nicely if they could stop turning their wheel to the left before parking because they’re always on the line and she scoffed and walked away. I don’t know how else to solve this problem. I could just suck it up and park so everyone wins and angle my car in but considering we pay $125 a month to park I don’t feel like I should have to park so uncomfortably every day. ",

      "description": "This happened a while back, but I still wonder if I was the asshole. \n\nI(30M) am a single father of 2 kids. I started a group chat on FB messenger, I named the chat in reference to my kids and included both my parents and siblings(I'm 1 of 6 kids, kinda big family) with the purpose of seeing if someone can watch my kids 2 days during the week the following week. I was also trying to get a head count for 1 of my kids' b-day party that was a few weeks away, too. The whole purpose of the chat was a head count and a sitter for 2 days. My daughter was turning 5, and wanted to make this year memorable.\n\nNow, my brother is a good guy, his wife is a sweetheart, too. He rarely goes on FB and usually turns it off for a few months every couple of months. So we text and talk on the phone more often. \n\nI start the group, send the message out. He is one of the 1st people to reply. His reply was \"wife's grandpa died this morning\" and then everyone is giving condolences. \n\nI knew the guy, nice guy, I felt bad, but I was pissed at my brother. They all seg-wayed and no one was discussing the purpose of the group. I texted him separately and I told him he was being asshole to just announce it to a group created for help with the kids and a head count. He tells me it was just easier to do it to the group.\n\nI got even more pissed.\n\nI tell him he should have started a new group or texted/call us to announce a death, not high-jack the thread about my kids. He says he didn't know the thread was about my kids, like bro, you didn't just see the paragraph 2 comments above yours?\n\nAfter back and forth, I left the group chat. I called everyone individually to get a head count and see what days they might be able to watch my kids the following week when I worked.\n\nHe started a separate group chat and made the announcement again, but we all knew already.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So last May I graduated a high school program called International Baccalaureate (IB). IB simply put is a two year program where the most important examination takes place at the end of your senior year at May. Usually universities give out offers based on what your school teachers predict what you will get in your IB final exams and many students need to match that offer given in order to confirm their enrollment.\n\nThere are many whatsapp study groups for IB subjects and students from all around the world come in and discuss the subject material. This is because the subject syllabus is predetermined by the IB organization so basically every IB school student learns the same material. \n\nWhat's stupid about the examination system is that the entire world is divided into two zones. North America and the rest of the world. My school is located in Australia which meant we took the exams first and there was basically a 3-6 hour window before other nation students in Asia / Europe took the exams. \n\nI came out of my Math exam and I opened whatsapp and saw people begging on the group chat, literally pleading that students who finished first tell them what was on the exam. Like fuck you buddy, that is so unfair. What pissed me off even more was that there were people offering to help students. \n\nSo I told the group chat I finished my Math exam and to add me if they wanted 'my thoughts'. And then I told them basically to start studying really hard for questions that were not on the exam.  I told them over and over to study these stat functions that were only in the higher level syllabus and everyone thanked me and left. \n\nAfter I did that I got a little spooked so I uninstalled whatsapp and fast forward to now I moved to the States for my education so my old number is defunct.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "my gf and I have been dating for about 9-10 months now and last night we got into an argument. This is my first relationship (Im 19, shes 18) so sorry If I'm a bit naive. \n\nI'll start from the beginning of the day, I was going to my morning lecture and my gf was asking if she could come along halfway through just so we could be together which I have no problem with. I said sure but just let her know that my friends were there too because we're all attending the same course at the moment. After I tell her this she says she'd rather not come because she's a bit shy around my friends which I understand. \n\nFast forward after the lecture when we are meeting for lunch as we agreed. we have lunch and after we finish she says she's going to go and do her driving test which she's been studying for a while now and we both knew it was today. So she asks me to come along and I hesitate for a bit because I know I have a pretty big assignment due at the end of the week that I should be working on, but I do come along cause I know its a big day for her. so we go there and she passes :D, and both walk together on the way to her train station cause shes going to go home and after she takes her turn off we part ways for the day. \n\nNow the plan was I go back to the uni and do the assignment but my dad whos supposed to pick me up calls me on the way and tells me hes going to drop by in 5 min (hes the only way I can get home as buses don't go past my house) and he wants to do his exercise at the pool before he drops me off at home so we go and do some laps and stuff. by this point Im exhausted cause it was a hot day and we were doing some laps, so I know I won't be able to work on the assignment this tired and decide to relax for a bit. Now I'm kind of an introvert so I just like to be by myself while I recharge, so I don't message my gf much while I'm relaxing. \n\nNow after about 2 hours at home (around 8ish) I try giving her some calls to video chat but she doesn't pick up and doesn't say anything at all about them which is weird so I know somethings up because she normally messages me if she can't pick up, at which point my mum walks in and says dinners ready so I leave it till I get back. When I get back I try to call her again and no response so I message her and ask if she wants to call and she says no. so I ask if she's feeling ok which is where she tells me its taken this long to figure out something wrong. so we launch into an argument which goes for a while which she tells me she has had a terrible day and she feels like she needs to ask me to see if she had a good day. I tell her Im sorry and I know I have been pretty closed off but I have been stressing about my assignments and uni so I haven't had much time to think.\n\nIts the next day now and she hasn't responded to any of my messages and it's around 2 in the afternoon which is the first time an argument has gone on this long. I understand she must have had a rough day and I know I should have asked sooner while I was relaxing but she keeps telling me I should just know when she's upset to which I tell her she needs to communicate if she's feeling upset or angry because I can't always pick up on it. AITA here? do I need to change some of my behaviours? and also any advice for me to repair things?",

      "description": "Background info: our household is me, my husband, our two teenage daughters and my parents. Due to my mom and dad living with us all of our meals are rather traditional as my dad won’t touch anything else.\n\n\nMy daughters are not really into the meals we make so my eldest decided to pretty much cook for herself. She will occasionally eat with us, but most of the time she buys stuff with her money and eats whatever she likes. \n\n\nI don’t exactly like it, but anytime we tried forcing her to eat our food she’d throw a fit so I gave up. \n\n\nIssue:\n\n\nI was planning to cook with use of ground meat today but realized I forgot to buy it. However, there was some meat apparently bought by my daughter. I took it and cooked a meal that I know she likes and also that the rest of family likes.\n\n\nHowever, when she came home and realized I used it she got really irritated with me. She asked me if I took it and I said that yes I did, but I cooked something she’d enjoy. She said that it didn’t matter what I cooked because she had a “meal prep” in mind and now she can’t. \n\n\nI have to say that I felt a little offended by her making a fuss about it so I told her to just quit complaining about it and “meal prep” something else. \n\n\nShe blew up then and told me that I need to pay her back for the meat I used. I laughed because it’s ridiculous, the meat she bought costed pennies and it’s not like I ask her to pay back for the food I buy to feed the family, right? \n\n\nShe then told me that this is exactly why her and her sister don’t like me and that unless I pay back she won’t speak to me. \n\n\nMy husband heard everything so I asked him to discipline her, but he said that he’s on her side as she paid for it herself and I’m not only an asshole to use her stuff, but also an asshole because now he will have to pay back money I “owe” to her so she doesn’t feel hurt by my “unfairness”. \n\n\nAs of now no-one except for my parents speaks to me. Am I insane to think she overreacted and made me look like some kind of villain? Or am I the asshole here? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Ok this is long and complicated and I don’t need validation bc I’ve got plenty of invalidation and validation I just need yes you are a dick or no you’re not!! \n\nI started seeing a guy at a new job about a year ago, he basically begged me everyday to get drinks with him, which ended up in sex I don’t remember very well. I was trying to make friends, I was single, I figured why not have some fun. It ended up honestly being a little traumatic and then ended up in lots of sexual harassment at work that I couldn’t say anything about because... here’s the good part....\n\nI was THREATENED\n\n “I will end your life if you tell anyone this” and he was my boss and an ex gang member with blood on his hands. He had my address and my family’s address. I wasn’t taking any chances with this guy and I have a history of being the victim of violent men so, you know, I was super scared and cautious. \n\nAbout a week after, I met a guy I instantly fell in love with, and we dated for a few months before making it official. He asked me if anything happened between me and the boss and I denied it over and over again until I started to drop subtle hints. I eventually was under so much stress and just wanted to be happy with my new boo so I told him, expecting him to be mad but to eventually understand. A year later, he hasn’t been able to understand.\n\nI lied and fucked up big time but I didn’t cheat but that’s how I’m being treated. My relationship might be over after a year because of this. And I’m fucking broken and alone and empty right now. So mad at myself and so ashamed.\n\nAfter I told my boy he became so upset and then suicidal and was hospitalized twice. I was there every step of the way, helped him through everything. Found him a job, a doctor, a therapist.\n\nI’ve talked to some people about if and it’s about half and half. I’m an horrible person or a misunderstood victim.  ",

      "description": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI have been recently introduced to Reddit and r/AmItheAsshole has helped me pass time and read interesting dialogue and viewpoints. Now, I’d like opinions on a recent decision of mine as I don’t have anyone to go for advice. \n\nSome backstory:\n\nI’m a single father. My wife had passed away due to a brain aneurysm during her sleep. Following this, my relationship with my son had began declining as he was never as close to me as he was his mother.\n\nDuring the sophomore year of high school, my son was called into the office for making sexual remarks to a fellow female classmate. After hearing the principal discuss what had happened, along with the witness statements of those who saw my son doing this, I was extremely disappointed, but figured it was partly my fault for not being a stronger role model to my son.\n\nI doubled down and grounded him during his suspension. This included no electronics and the required him to come straight home after school for 2 weeks. He immediately became insufferable and stomped around the house for a while, but eventually began giving me the silent treatment which was fine by me.\n\nAfter a couple of months without incident I began noticing my son spending almost all of his time on his computer. I had become suspicious of what he was doing since he began locking himself in the room almost immediately after school, only coming out for food and bathroom use.\n\nOne day he had fallen asleep in his room with his PC open, usually he falls asleep at his desk with it off, and I go in to turn off his light and let him sleep there, since he’s quite grumpy when he wakes up.\n\nNow, I’m a huge believer in privacy. But there was something that told me I needed to look at his PC. So, curiosity got the best of me and I had begun scanning the screen. Immediately I noticed lots of foul and sexist language in what seemed to be a chat room. \n\nAfter this, I began scrolling up and uncovered numerous comments that came from my son which went along the lines of this.\n\n“Whenever I see her in the halls I just want to pull her into a classroom and fuck her asshole.” \n\n“Maggie’s a cum devouring whore.”\n\nThese comments and views towards women and people in general made my stomach turn. I have no idea where my son developed this ideology but it scared me especially since my younger daughter also lived in the same household. \n\nI was conflicted on what to do, since I had violated my sons privacy. But I also uncovered some violent and possibly dangerous behavior that I felt needed to be immediately addressed. \n\nSo, I unplugged my son’s PC, keyboard, mouse, and other equipment and stored it deep in my shed.\n\nWhen he awoke hell broke lose as he immediately began screaming at his little sister for stealing his personal belongings. I quickly spoke up before it escalated and removed my daughter from the room before explaining what I had seen on his PC. \n\nHe began calling me a beta male and said that one of the reasons my wife died was because of my inability to care for her. This alongside the anger he showed towards his younger sister I quickly became very upset and went to the shed and broke his PC, not his other stuff, just the main computer. \n\nMy son shrieked the entire time after discovering what I had done. After around 20 minutes of screaming he finally went into his bedroom where I don’t know what he’s doing now.\n\nI’m very conflicted as I had always thought I was raising my son right, but I have no idea where these ideas came from that are influencing my son. I think it may be a friend group from school or strangers online.\n\nI don’t know what to do, and don’t know if I made the right choice. Should I stick to my guns or should I apologize? I have no idea, but first I guess I have to ask.\n\nAm I the Asshole here?\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "About two years ago I purchased a home in a party neighborhood in a college town. Previously I lived right next to a bar, so I am used to noise. I’ve also lived in a fraternity house, hence noise isn’t that big of a deal for me.\n\nAnyways, my new neighbors are in their late 30s and run a trap house. So they sell drugs to college kids. Which I don’t really care care. However they were extremely loud on weeknights. Like hard core parties on a Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. \n\nAnyways, all this noise was started to affect my work performance so I began to repeatedly call the police. This did nothing. \n\nHowever,  things started to look up when the trap lord went to jail for beating the trap queen. While he was in jail I was able to sleep. Sadly the trap queen bailed her lord out of jail( actually this has happened several times, so I can’t remember if she bailed him out this instance). Anyways, I was pissed so I installed a security camera to point directly at their front door. They were mega pissed (threatened my bodily harm) because it was affecting their drug business, and I eventually took it down but afterwards they were much more quite. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Just last night, my mom said she wanted it to make a gift for his grandsons, which is entirely possible, but I think it’s more of a cover up for what she really wants to do.

I discussed this with her and she feels like I am just trying to back out of living with her and I don’t want to be with her while this is just not the case.

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom, this one's quite long\n\nOk so from the title this must sound pretty shitty. But before you judge me, there's some backstory.\n\nLast summer (around june or july), I was in a games lesson (I'm a 14 y/o male) and one of my best friends (we'll call him A) and a girl from my year (we'll call her F) are talking. Now, I used to have a crush on F the previous year but have never spoken to her, however I think she knew about the crush because she's friends with A. Anyway, I join in and at the end of the lesson I walk home with F (as I walk along the road she lives in). For the rest of the school year (which is about a month) I start hanging out with the rest of her friend group. There's a smaller group (consisting of F, A, a girl and a guy we'll call AS) which sometimes hang out with a bigger group (there's like 30 of them I won't bother naming them all). I tend to get on with the people within the smaller group, however in the bigger group they often act like they don't want me to be there. I'm really insecure about my relationship with them as I feel they're too \"cool\" for me and that they don't really like me. The smaller group have a group chat with me on. \n\nDuring the summer holidays, we discuss maybe watching a movie, however AS (he's super rich) wanted to go to this fancy restaurant in town and sneered at me when I suggested McDonalds. After this I went non contact with them until september (not intentionally, but that's another story).\n\nWhen I am able to rejoin the group chat, it's dead. By that I mean no one ever chats on it and no one ever responds to me. I learn from A that the group made another group chat and that they talk shit about me on it behind my back. That evening over text I confront F. She doesn't respond for a few hours so I send a text calling her a \"manipulative bitch\". She says \"if you were a sane and communicative person...\". This really annoys me as I have aspergers and she is calling me insane. She also calls me \"hopeless\" and \"difficult\". This was in around October. After all this A denys ever having told me that they talked shit about me.\n\nI felt like a total arsehole after, and so I sent her a message saying how horrible I was. She couldn't even be arsed to reply.\n\nOn Friday A was talking to F and A asked me why I was such a dick to her back then. I need to know, Am I The Asshole?\n\nTL;DR close friend betrays me by making another group chat in without me and talks shit about me behind my back. When I confront her, she doesn't respond. So I call her a \"manipulative bitch\". She then mocks me for having a mental illness. When I beg her to forgive me, she doesn't respond.",

      "description": "I’m a (21F) student living in a flat with two (24M) (25M) roommates. We share a living room, bathroom and kitchen. \n\nA few months ago the 25 year old started dating this girl, they would sometimes have dates at our flat where he would cook for her, and she would spend the night sometimes. I had zero issues with this. \n\nBut recently, it seems like she’s just sort of moved in with us. She’s almost always here, and while they usually stay in his room, I still get annoyed because I never agreed to another roommate and she doesn’t pay rent. She has her own key and does her laundry here. We have a cleaning schedule but she’s not on it, which is annoying as hell since she always makes a huge mess out of the kitchen and she doesn’t ever take the trash out. Plus anytime I walk into the kitchen I’m forced to see them practically dry humping and or making out. \n\n Another complaint I have about her (and I admit, this one might be a little silly/petty) when she arrived and sees me sitting in the kitchen or living room, she doesn’t say anything to me. She barely acknowledges my existence. How  are you gonna come into my house and not even say hello to me?\n\nI get that you wanna spend time with your boyfriend, but every damn day? Can’t they ever go to her house? \n\nAm I being dramatic for being annoyed by all of this?",

      "description": "So my aunt and uncle and their kids, specifically their 7 year-old boy, have come down to visit my family for the week, and they are staying in our game room/guest room for that period of time. \n\nMy 7 year-old cousin saw my PS4 in the room, and he wants to play on it. Here are my reasonings as to why I don’t want him on it.\n\n1. I do not like people touching my stuff. I’m not trying to hide anything, I just do not like it when people grab my stuff, mainly from experience where people have taken my things and they came back broken or don’t come back at all.\n\n2. My cousin is addicted to screens. My aunt and uncle are the sweetest people in the world, but when it comes to taking care of their kids, they’re  not really good at it. Basically, every time the kids scream or whine, instead of disciplining them or taking care of them, they just give the kid their phone and leave them to whatever they do on it. The 7 year old in particular would take my uncle’s phone, play games on it for hours on end, drain the battery, then go to my aunt to repeat the process. When that battery is dead, he would come and watch me on my phone, begging me to use it. Now that he has found my PS4, he’s begging me to play on that, too. \n\n3. Despite letting him do whatever he wants on the phone, my uncle and aunt are strict as to what they can play, watch, etc. basically, nothing Rated PG-13, or rated T or above. I don’t even have something like Minecraft on my PS4. The lowest rated game I would have on it would be Destiny 2, which is rated T. For reference, I am 17, he is 7.\n\nFor the time being, I have told my cousin that “the cable is broken, the PS4 doesn’t work” for the time being. AITA for not letting him play on it?",

She thinks we’re hooking up and what not but we’re just friends.\n\nWhen her best friend got mad at me for hurting her by talking to him, me and the guy decided we would keep our friendship a secret. She said I’m trying to be like them too much but I’ll never be them, I should find my own friends instead of theirs, I’m an introvert so I should stop trying to be extroverted and if I actually cared about them, I wouldn’t be talking to him.\n\nWe met a few days after that and the next they, they found out. My friend started texting me saying how friends don’t do this (she’s into him; then again she hooked up with him while her friend was totally in love with him), how fake I am and accused me of wanting to sleep with him the next time we’re supposed to meet (we weren’t supposed to meet at all). At that moment, I’ve decided I’d had enough.\n\nTold her that I wouldn’t be sorry for being friends with someone. She has friends who she was introduced to by other people and that’s okay, but when I do it it isn’t for some reason? Told her I’ve had enough of their toxic behaviour and that it’s okay with me if she doesn’t wanna talk anymore. (But, of course, I still somehow managed to apologize.)\n\nThey both tried to be threatening in their texts but when they saw me irl a few days after that, they put on their hoods and started running away. Then her best friend came back and tried to confront me. Her: “You haven’t texted me back yet.” (she texted me that day as well but I didn’t have the strenght to argue with two people at once) Me: “Yeah, why would I? I talked to [my friend], it doesn’t concern you.” Her: “Well everything that happens to her concerns me.” Me: “I really don’t think so, she’s almost an adult. She should resolve her problems herself.” (meanwhile, she was standing a few feet behind us) Her: “Wow, I thought you were smarter.” Then they just left.\n\nHaven’t talked to them since and I’ve never been happier.\n\nAs far as their toxicity goes, they talked to me only bc I usually have money on me. Always paid for their stuff and food, never got paid back, never had anything paid for. Saying stuff like “If you don’t buy us [X], you can go home.” “If you actually liked us, you’d buy us more.” “If you have money you can come, we don’t have any.” and so on. But guess who’s easily manipulated and always did what they said?",

      "description": " \n\nPosted this on [r/confession](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession) yesterday and someone said to post it here.\n\nI used to troll and shitpost a lot back in 2009/10, then moved onto this as it felt like a step up. Years back on Facebook these strange \"most beautiful teen competition\" pages were popping up and gained a lot of popularity among young people posting pictures of themselves on there, and as you can imagine it also brought a lot of creeps (, worth adding that I was around 16 then so I would see posts saying my friends had posted on them which is how I found out about them).\n\nI originally intended just to find out how quickly and how many friend requests and dms I would get after posting a pic in these pages, which turned out to be an absolute fuck ton within seconds. So I'd make a very real looking profile with pictures that wouldnt show results on reverse search, all normal looking pics in a few albums, to make it seem legit (fake profiles are usually obvious so I made a good effort of it).\n\nOnce the dms and requests started flooding in I started checking out the guys profiles just being nosey then I stated noticing a lot of them were engaged, married or in a relationship so I would always talk to them and see where they took it. (I would only start if they started with me).\n\nSo after having conversations long enough to get some good evidence of them being creepy and unfaithful, the more depraved the better, and it got really depraved sometimes and it wouldn't take long (usually about 10 mins), I would message their partner a \"sorry to tell you but I think you should know...\" message along with the screenshot, then I would send a screenshot of that conversation to the guy. Reactions varied, from threats, panic, hysteria or just being instantly blocked.\n\nI've never told anyone about this but I always found it enjoyable, I only did it for a few months or so but I'm not sure how many relationships I must have caused to end. I still can't work out if I'm a piece of shit for it or not.\n\nWorth adding I wasn't whiteknighting / looking to save any fair maidens, I didn't care about the women, I wasn't doing, just wanted the reaction from the guys, I think cheaters are pieces of shit anyway so I had no problem doing it to them for fun",

      "title": "AITA for feeling this rush of anxiety and rage every time my girlfriend has this weird tone with me?",
      "description": "So backstory, I'm a 22 year old freshly graduated college graduate more than likely on the autism spectrum, highly functioning. My social skills are fine once I warm up to it but I do have my moments. She's 20, still in college, and we've been dating for about 9 months now. We met on Tinder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a pretty introverted person and reserved if I don't know somebody. However, I'm a very social person when I want to be, especially with my friends. I basically have different modes I can go into, but most of the time I'm pretty quiet and introspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we started dating she was great! Awesome personality, very caring, loyal, etc. and would come to see me almost every weekend (we went to colleges right next to each other, about 40 minutes away). I did not have a car so I would also try to come out and see her with the resources I had, whether it be housemates, her picking me up, etc. the first 4-5 months were awesome! She would occasionally throw in a political jab for no reason as I am a moderate conservative (who does not like Trump) and she's an EXTREMELY progressive liberal feminist. We've had our arguments recently about her saying she wants me to move in with her once she graduates and move out to her home city. I've told her listen, I don't know about that quite yet, I need a stable job first and I need to evaluate the situation. I can't just quit and find something else in a week... There's more to it than that but that's not really the point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point is that whenever I disagree with ANYTHING SHE SAYS, she gets this really bitchy tone and becomes snarky. This has been a thing since I graduated college... I don't even wanna talk to her when she gets like this, I feel this rush of anxiety when I know it'll happen. Here's an example,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGF: Oh wow I really like that cake she's baking!\n\nMe: Yeah, I think it could use some frosting but otherwise I like it too.\n\nGF: \\*Ummmm well it looks fine without it hahaha soooooo....\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith this AWFUL undertone and attitude. Like... She's not even joking when she says it like that. What's the point? I'm not even FULLY disagreeing with her? Most of the time I have to say something like, \"I know that's what I meant,\" or, \"I know that's what I'm saying.\" That's the thing, not even FULL on disagreements and she gets like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nI got absolutely heated with her because she was hanging out with this guy that lied to both her, her best friend, and I over many things. The guy was some friend of her's that was really good at math but otherwise a lying, sociopathic piece of garbage. He came over to her house when I was there and somehow abortion got brought up. (oh boy...) my GF is pro-life, as I am, and I stated that to her guy friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, he texts her and accuses me of spouting racist comments and saying all these bad things about minorities. Like WHAT? I'm not a racist... What the hell did I even say? I told her about this and she goes, \"Um well I mean you ARE a conservative...\" and does this really condescending laugh. Are you kidding me? This guy flirts with you behind my back, compliments you in ways that cross the line, and offers to massage you and, \"let me know if you guys don't work out\" was one of the texts he sent you that you NEGLECTED to tell me about... And now you're defending him for made up things to make me look bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI exploded. I basically said I'm tired of you being like this when you weren't before, I'm tired of you hanging out with this guy all the time, and I'm tired of you denying that you do anything wrong. Every time she gets this attitude I just feel so anxious because she has such a strong personality and I feel like if I say something back, she's gonna fire away, which she has at times. She tells me, \"Well you need to tell me that I do this because my mom also gets mad at me but I don't know that I do it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMind you, I DO tell her when she does it, but not ALL the time, because that's not healthy and frankly I shouldn't be in a relationship with somebody just to point out flaws all the time. Give me a break. I'm not perfect but I'm always the one apologizing. I BEG her to apologize and she rarely does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yes, after begging her, she cut off that toxic friend of hers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't get it... Should I be doing something differently? She isn't always like this but some days she can honestly be a complete and utter bitch over any slight difference of opinion. She also goes through my phone (only when I'm with her) because if I say no, I'm not hiding anything (which I'm not) and she'll go, \"OH okay then let me see it if you aren't hiding anything then!\" Ahhhh... Okay, cool. Lose-Lose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then she'll read all my group chats, texts that she wants to, and finds nothing of me talking shit about her or bad mouthing her. Shocker, right? 0-40, try again. It's really annoying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've mentioned in the nicest way that I think she's really insecure and defensive over some personal issues she has. She's not fat by any means but she's slightly overweight, she's very hairy, she has a big nose... I told her that I did not think any of these things were an issue but she's always asking me if I love her, if I think she's ugly, if I'm mad at her, etc. which leads me to believe she's a very insecure person. She denies it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do I do? I've already confronted her about her attitude she has some days, her looking through my phone (which I NEVER do to her because I trust her...) I've never dated anyone like this and it's really annoying. I've expressed to her how I feel and she doesn't get it. I told her that I feel like she's gonna start a fight with me over stupid things and I get major anxiety and don't even want to be around her. Am I an asshole for feeling this way?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend is normally awesome, but has her days when she's a total bitch. I told her she needs to stop her attitude over innocuous disagreements and it took her forever to cut off this awful guy-friend she had. I think she's really insecure but will not admit it. It has made this relationship less fun for me because she's so overbearing over stupid things. Was not like this in the beginning. ",

      "description": "  A little background first. My ex girlfriend/babymomma and I split in a horrible way possible...to the point I had to get a restraining order against her. Not only did she keep 90 percent of my belongings but she also kept all three of the vehicles I have purchased over the past three years. I put them in her name because at the time I didn't have a license. \n\nMoving foward:Today I was catching a Lyft to homedepot to get some supplies for a house that I'm working on. We are at a stop light and I look across the intersection and I see my truck... well kind of knew that was gonna happen right! It's nothing fancy but it was a good little work truck and I had promised it to my son for when he turns sixteen. \n\nLow and behold who do I see driving it!!! You guessed it my very own cousin!! So... I call him and say hey.... so your the one who bought it? He response was \"I needed a vehicle and the price was right.... \" ok I can get that he did need a vehicle and it's been years sense he had one... so my next question was so.... how much did you but it for? His response \" that's between her and I and I'm choosing to stay out of the middle of your all shit....\" wait what!! Not like him at all first of all. He's not one to bitch up. Me: I asked a simple question I dont care that your driving it and bought it. His response still..\" none of your business\" humm see now he sounds guilty as fuck of something if nothing it feels like he has take her side over his own blood. I told him if he wanted to stay out of it he should of stayed out of my fucking truck and he knew dam well that the truck was pretty much stolen from me and he driving it around but I'm supposed to ok with this? \n\nAITA for being pissed? Yes I'm equally mad at her still and come to find out he bought it for 1200 bucks when I offered her 2000. Like I said it was nothing fancy but it was mine and promised to my son and she took that from me out of spite!!!",

      "description": "This is an alt account, for reasons I'll describe in the post/story.\n\nBackstory: I've used Reddit over 2 years now. I almost exclusively use mobile on Android, but I don't know all the facets to the app. I hadn't put serious thought into making an alt until today, as I never saw a need to. This meant my casual-browsing account was also my porn-viewing account, and I didn't have any consistent qualms with this.\n\nCut to me browsing the Home tab. I'm enjoying the front page when, to my dismay, an untagged NSFW image rolls through. It's explicit enough to make you uncomfortable, if you were to notice this on my screen in public. This isn't the first time I've had this happen, so I go to my typical response. I comment, asking why an NSFW post isn't tagged. Almost always, within an hour or two the post gets properly tagged. I have unfollowed one sub for consistently not tagging posts.\n\nToday, I got a new response. My comment, asking for the post to be properly flagged, received a reply telling me: \"you're on a very NSFW sub. unfollow\". I replied pointing out that the sub asks users to tag their posts if they're NSFW, as well as adding my concerns about casual browsing. That reply received a similar response.\n\nWhen I posed the situation to a friend, he suggested making an alt account and showed me how easy it is to switch between accounts on mobile. So here's the alt.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting people to tag NSFW posts accordingly?",

I had an idea, that seeing as I was gonna clean the dishwasher anyway, I could put all this stuff in here before I gave it a clean.\n\nSo I loaded it up with the shelves from the shower and bathroom, I took the toilet seat off and put it in there, as well as the toilet brush and the holder (definitely the most controversial item). Anyway chucked them in for a hot wash and they came out great. After than I gave the dishwasher a clean.\n\nI told me girlfriend of my great idea, she thought it was weird but didn’t really care. Telling it to the rest of my friends was a different story. I thought it would be funny but half of them were visibly losing respect for me, only one person marginally defended me (but more out of sympathy)\n\nAnyway, thought it would be funny little story now they’re a few are saying they will never eat/drink anything at my house again.

      "description": "Backstory on my husband's family: both my BIL and FIL are drug addicts, mostly into the hard stuff like heroin.  However, my BIL was in a great rehab facility for a few years with his own little but growing family.  My family have bought them clothes, grocery gift cards, even electronics to help them out.  We were so proud of the BIL and his family for trying to stay off drugs and working to move them out of rehab.  An example of what we do for them: One Thanksgiving weekend, I drove 140 miles round trip (twice) from home to the facility to pick up this family so they'd be home for the holidays. \n\nOne day, BIL gets kicked out of the facility. Not 100% sure why but whatever the reason was, BIL couldn't return for 3 months.  We get the call and we told him, \"Move in with us.  Let's find you a job...\" all the supportive stuff.  Instead, he moves in with his father (my FIL) and they start smoking.  Years of rehab down the drain.  It was like all the support we gave him didn't matter.  We tried talking to the FIL as well but he didn't care... he had his drug using best friend back (FIL and the rest of the in laws need their own thread).\n\nWe don't want to be anywhere where they're present.  It's just an argument waiting to happen.  The in laws are pissed at us that just because they took everything we've done for granted, we're still supposed to see them and support them, including buying them more stuff, giving them rides, etc.  Just because they're family? It's as if it's expected of us to continue providing support (not many have stepped up to the plate but we're still the bad guys...bunch of friggin hypocrites). Now no one talks to us.   Am I/ are we the assholes?\n",

At first, me and my mom gave him excuses like “____ wants to do this” or “I want to do this thing.” But then, we couldn’t keep it up for much longer and we said that I do not feel comfortable there, and that I feel unsafe there, and that I want to stay at my mom’s because I feel dangered. He did not take that very well. He tried to get legal involved but my Mom shut that down, and he also said that I couldn’t choose and I have to go. He’s talking shit to my brother about me, and begging my Mom to encourage me to go over there. He also texted me about it in an angry way, so I blocked him. He talked shit about me and my older sister to my brother, saying that my older sister’s grades were bad, and to not be like her. (She has a learning disability, not down syndrome or autism. she averages cs or ds) So, then this happened. He used a different number, and texted me trying to shame me, and calling me mean and disrespectful. He’s started trying to threaten me saying “I’ll disable your phone.” But he obviously can’t do that. AITA?",

      "description": "AITA?\n\nHi there\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster, and I’d sincerely appreciate your thoughts on a recent in-law / car related issue.\n\nTLDR:  in-laws presumed they could borrow my new and kinda special car, I jokingly said ‘not so much, take a cab’ - shit hit the fan.\n\nSo, I have a pretty good relationship with my in-laws.  We share good conversation, chat about golf / local sports / the weather etc, share a bottle of wine and overall have an OK time.  Up until recently I’ve (almost) looked forward to their company.  Very decent people, no doubt about it.  \n\nProblem is that my wife and I moved half way around the world from them a few years ago, and have since had two kids.  And when the in-laws come and stay with us, they stay for quite a while (~3 weeks in our apartment).  \n\nThis wasn’t so much an issue at first, but recently it has become difficult.  It’s to the point where I exile myself in the apartment or sneak out to do “work” or run errands just to get away.  The chatter from their side is endless, and extremely one-sided (always about what they’re doing / who they know / how much [x] person in the family or friend circle is earning etc etc... with no real interest in how we’re getting on).\n\nAnyway...  things came to a head recently, and I’ve been spending weeks trying to figure out if IATA on this one instance.  I suspect I might be. \n\nI had just bought a near-new car, which is a bit special to me.  It’s a pretty unique mercedes, customised heavily at the factory, not entirely normal to drive (800+hp) and it is expensive to repair / maintain.  A scratch in the rims would cost quite a bit to fix, and my wife and I are the only insured drivers.   I’m a car fanatic and keep everything in perfect order all the time.  Nobody has ever driven the car but me and it’s in showroom condition.\n\nAs I was about to leave for an o/s trip, and the in-laws had two weeks left at ours, my father-in-law said ‘just leave me the keys to the Merc”.   I jokingly said ‘alright, so long as you’re careful and don’t curb the rims’.    The car does have a baby seat in the back, so the in-laws could theoretically run my son to school in it each morning (as I usually do on my way to work), but secretly I absolutely did not want them using the car.  Keep in mind there’s no immediate need for them to use it - my wife’s car is available, and my son’s school is a $10 cab fare away (which we would always pay for).  \n\nFIL’s request for car keys came up again the next night, just as I was about to leave for the airport (‘so where are the keys?’).  I tried to play it off with the same kind of joke again - ‘haha what about the rims, and probs easiest if you just catch a cab’.  That’s when shit really hit the fan...  The in-laws (both MIL / FIL) were seriously pissed, saying I didn’t respect them or trust them, they would lend me anything and how could I refuse them, how dare I put material things ahead of family etc etc etc.  \n\nI ended up leaving the keys and apologising profusely, not because I felt sorry but I’m a pacifist when personal relationships become confrontational.  Things have been a little tense since.  (they did use the car during the 2 weeks I was away, with no harm done).\n\nSo:  AITA for (impliedly) refusing to hand keys to my new car to the in-laws?  Do I have a right to say ‘no’, even if the in-laws have lent my wife and I use of their cars in the past?",

      "description": "First off, apologies for the text wall, I’m on mobile so there’s hardly anything I can do about it (to my knowledge). So I started dating her about 9 months ago (not very long, I know), and I was quickly immersed into a world I have never seen before. Since she is with narcissistic/abusive parents, she is very depressed, while I am not. I always try to be there for her when I can (school gets in the way) and support her through what ever happens. Unfortunately, she twists words or situations a lot, even when I mess up and she talks to her friends about it. This always pisses me off, and I’m started talking to her less and less. Her twisting the words is making it really hard for me to trust her. So whenever she talks to me about her (seemingly) narcissistic parents, I always have a doubt in the back of my mind whether what she’s saying is truthful or not. One night I brought it up, said how I couldn’t really trust her, didn’t believe some of the stuff she was saying about her parents, situations, other friends. I said she over reacted to a lot of things. She of course jabbed back at me, calling me a dick for not believing her, yelling “break up with me if you want then!” and telling me “It’s just how I was raised, I know nothing else!” So reddit, AITA for not believing her?",

      "description": "TLDR: GF and I are doing long distance. We like to see each other once a month. She was going to come to me this month. I told her any weekend worked for me. She picked this one. She is on her period. I am mildly annoyed (I have not said/done anything because of this annoyance). \n\nLonger version: \n\nBasically the TLDR. The reason that I got annoyed was because IMO one of the big reasons (but not only) for seeing each other is the physical intimacy. Her being on her period (which I know she cannot control) limits our activities. \n\nShe is more or less regular and uses a calendar app to see when she 'should' get her period. From my POV, it would make more sense for her to schedule her visits when she knows that we most likely will be 'in the clear' so to speak. Even though she cant control when she has it, she can, for the most part, anticipate it. And I understand if she did not have a free weekend for the rest of the month, but, to my knowledge, she has at least one more free weekend.  \n\nI haven't done or said anything (and don't plan on) and I am sure we will have a great time and I am excited to see her. And I would like to think I am being understanding for the physical side of things(not her fault for having her period etc.). I am just mildly annoyed at how she scheduled her trip. \n\nAITA for having this reaction?",

      "title": "AITA for asking that my girlfriend quit weed?",
      "description": "My girlfriend and I are both high-school aged. We started dating nearly four months ago. We started talking a bit before I started liking her; she hit up me first. She mentioned that she did weed and I didn't think anything of it because I wasn't romantically interested in her yet.  \n\nI ask her out and the day after, we're on call and she tells me she's high. She asks if I'm mad, and I say no. She falls asleep on call, and in that time I realized that I was very unhappy because I am personally against weed/smoking, and I didn't want an SO that did it. I told her this the next day, and she said that she would stop for me.  \n\nThen about a week later, she \"asks for permission\" to do it again. I repeat my feelings. She regularly \"asks for permission\" until about two weeks later when I go out of state for the night, and she smokes, feels guilty the next day and tells me. Towards the end of November, we got into a bit of an argument over it and when I got home, she texted me a lot about how she hated her self, she would rather have me happy than weed, and she promised she would never bring it up again. That promise lasted maybe a week or two before she started bringing it up again.  \n\nAbout a week ago, we had a pregnancy scare and she told me that if the test ends up being negative, she is going to smoke to calm down. I regretfully told her that I'd be fine with it considering the stress she was under. A couple days ago, we argued about it again.  \n\nMy stance: I get very bothered when I even imagine her doing it, more often than not just the thought of it puts me in a bad mood almost immediately. I never realized how much I was against weed until I started dating her. I have told her many times that I am not comfortable nor willing to be in a relationship with somebody that does it or smokes in general. It's a very big turn off for me. I have tried many times to become more accepting and open-minded but I cannot help being bothered by it.  \n\nHer stance: She has been doing it since about March or April, 2018, I believe. It started out as something to help calm her down, relax her, but progressed into doing it for fun with her mother, who provides it for her. In her words, she could quit it anytime she wanted to, but says that, because I ask her not to, it only makes her want to do it more. She says if she had to she would choose me over weed, but she really does not want to make that choice. Many times her reasoning for doing it has contradicted itself; one day she says \"I'll stop after I'm 18, high school is what's causing all the stress\", the next day she says \"After I'm 18 I should be allowed to do it because I'll be an adult.\" She told me recently that when she was giving me these reasons she was just trying to say the \"right\" things.  \n\nWhat we agree on: My girlfriend and I are very much in love with each other and want nothing but to spend the rest of our lives together. We accept that either way, no matter what the outcome of this issue is, there will not be complete happiness for either of us. We both agree that we are partially in the wrong, I am unable to change my ways, and she is too stubborn to stop.  \n\nSo, kind strangers of reddit, I ask you, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So let me start off by stating I'm not looking to start a witch hunt, so I'm trying to give as less personal info and stuff as possible while still giving enough information to understand the situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago there was a kickstarter I really wanted to support because the thing in question was something I could see becoming a really great product, and the person behind it was someone I had always respected. The problem was that kickstarter requires credit card, which most people in my country don't have anymore because it's seen as pretty outdated. So I talked to the person behind it and asked if we could back it in any other way. After a few times and several ways of trying to get in touch they publicaly stated that they would start accepting paypal donations  as well. Since I trusted them, I agreed and donated through paypal(May 27, 2018). The person clearly stated several times that they wanted us to donated and e-mail them PERSONALLY (This becomes important later) with our transaction info and other things required for the kickstarter. After a month or so, I had still hadn't gotten a reply, so I e-mailed again because I thought \"well, they might have missed it who knows\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI waited, and waited, and waited. I popped in on some of their online livestreams to ask about it and the answers was pretty much the same everytime: \"Yeah I read you e-mail this morning you will get a reply very soon\". So in november I went to reddit to look for answers. (And yes I realise this is enough info for people to know exactly who I'm talking about but that's not import here) There I found a thread, with several people who had the exact same issue. Months had passed and no one had gotten a single reply on anything. Now obviously this was a public complaint, so surprise surprise we got a reply. Sort of. \"Yo I'm sorry but e-mail me and cc x person we'll sort it out.\" So I did. No reply, and the CC adress was a fake one as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn february 10th, 2019, I e-mailed once more. I asked for info about my payment, but I also mentioned that they would be  starting a 2nd kickstarter for the same thing soon, and I felt like I should warn people if I kept getting no reply. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got a reply to this one. Within literally 30 minutes. And that's what left an extremely sour taste in my mouth. The moment publicaly talking about this is mentioned, they're suddenly able to reply? It might have been fine if they just gave info about my payment, but instead I got a very hostile reply. They basically said I shouldn't complain, that they weren't able to do customer supportfor 2500 people personally(Which was BS because they literally asked for it), and cancel my order. I replied stating once more that I didn't want to put them in a bad light, but I needed some pressure to have them reply, I was sorry that was my mistake, but okay. I haven't heard from them since and my money is still gone. Am I in the wrong here?",

      "description": "I’ve known her for about 4 years now. We met in college and then I moved away after freshman year. We maintained a pretty strong and consistent long distance friendship. Last year around this time I flew her to Seattle to do a cross country road trip with me. We fought the whole way. Which was surprising because we had never fought before. Then last month for Thanksgiving break I went down to DC to spend some time with her and the trip was awful. She picked a fight with me on the first day and kept referencing it multiple times during the course of the trip. Also her personality was just really loud and obnoxious, and rather embarrassing. \n\nBut the catch is, about 2.5 years ago she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. And it’s steadily getting worse. I don’t wanna bail on her when she needs me. But is it wrong to only continue a friendship because of sickness? ",

      "description": "\n\nA few months ago my girlfriend and I talked about moving in together. We are both tired of making trips back and forth to each others place, so it would be a lot easier for us. I don't want to have to pay for a place I would be hardly using.\n\nA friend of mine is moving back into town, who I used to live with in the past. When we talked about her moving back a few months ago, I told her there was a chance I would move in with my girlfriend, and not her. Fast forward, I told her my decision and she is incredibly upset, calling me selfish and not thinking of her. Note, I offered her my old room where I was renting with a good mutual friend, who is enthusiastic about it. All four of us would have cheaper rent as well. My friend wouldn't have to worry about finding housing. \n\nI get that she is more comfortable living with me, as we have been friends for years, but I am ready to move forward with my girlfriend. I am frustrated that she is so upset with me about this decision. It hurts that i am called selfish for wanting to move forward in my relationship. AITA?\n",

      "description": "I'm not sure how to start these things, so I'll start from the beginning. Certain details, including names, have been modified or omitted for the sake of anonymity. I've also omitted my personal thoughts at the time, choosing to summarize them at the end. The post is rather long, so please bear with me.\n\nI (19M) had been doing this foreign studies program in a certain European country since September of last year. The class consisted of what would be considered \"international students\" in that country, with at least 90% of the class population originating from China. Due to having lived in that country for eight years of my childhood and one of my parents being Chinese, I was fluent in mandarin. Most of the people doing this program are either taking it as a prerequisite for graduate studies in this country or for occupational purposes. As I was sitting in one of the first lectures of the semester, I noticed a rather attractive Chinese girl (19F) attending the lecture.\n\nI had the opportunity to introduce myself to her the other day when one of my Chinese friends asked me to get him a drink from a vending machine. When I found my friend attending a language class, I noticed the girl that same class. Due to my cultural background, my competence in the language they were learning exceeded the class material. However, I attended the class anyways as a pretext to meet this girl. As we were introducing ourselves, I didn't hesitate to mention my Chinese background. She came up to me after the class and remarked on it. She was impressed by my mandarin fluency, and so we exchanged social media information.\n\nAfter having multiple conversations with her, I came up with the courage to ask her out on a date. I invited her to come with me to a local park, where there would be a local music concert. We spent the whole day walking in the park, talking about our lives, and learning about each other. We had dinner together, but we split the bill. We were so engrossed in our conversation, that we actually forgot about the music concert and ended up arriving late. It didn't quite matter, since we had a good time anyways. After the concert, I walked her to the bus stop. As we waited for the bus, I pondered whether the night had gone well and whether this girl had same feelings for me as I for her. On one hand, we hadn't had much romantic interaction such as kissing or making out, and she did insist on paying for her own meal. On the other hand, she was willing to spend an enormous amount of time with me, consistently laughed at my jokes, and we did have some sort of physical contact (such as hand-holding, dancing, and hugging). Before the bus arrived, I made a joke that caused her to laugh so hard that she pulled a facial muscle, and ended the night on a good note.\n\nThe problems began when I tried to ask her out on a second date. She always seemed to be busy whenever I asked; either she had already made plans, or she didn't sleep well the night before and needed a nap. It was harder to approach her, since I didn't know her friends, but I didn't let that stop me. I decided to get to know her friends, and soon they knew me well enough to include me in their conversations. The girl, however, would still act somewhat distant. At the same time, we would talk quite often on social media, so I wasn't quite sure what was going on. At one point I decided to talk to her in private. I asked her what I had done wrong for her to ignore me. To my surprise, she insisted that she hadn't been deliberately ignoring me, and that I had done nothing wrong. I then asked if she had time to hang out, but she made the excuse that she had slept very late last night and needed to take a nap.\n\nThe problems only continued to get worse. She would always insist she was too busy to hang out, yet would also tell me about what she had been doing with friends over the weekend. I decided to consult friends, both hers and mine. My pursuit of her was no secret, for I had been quite open and honest about my feelings since the beginning. When I asked her friends for their opinion on the situation, they told me that the girl was rather shy and really had been busy lately. They also insisted that she genuinely enjoyed spending time with me. My friends, on the other hand, told me that I should give up on her for my own sake. They told me that in Chinese people were extremely indirect when it came to dating culture, unlike me, and that I would be disappointed if I wanted the truth. My friends forced me to consider the possibility that she had no feelings for me, and whether friendship was an option. I decided I'd consider it.\n\nEventually, I decided to confront her (again) some time in November. I told her that I liked her. No response. That I think she made it pretty clear that she didn't like me back. No response. That she had been ignoring me lately. It was then that she opened her mouth to insist that, once again, she had not been ignoring me lately. She said that she had been busy with studying for the exams we would have to take in order to finish the program, but she genuinely enjoyed spending time with me. She told me that she had never been in a relationship before. I told her that was fine, and that we could just be friends. She promised me that she would definitely be free in February. I then made a point of not bothering her to ask her out. We would continue having conversations, and she told me at one point about how she threw up after drinking 23 shots after going out to eat with friends. While she was supposedly studying for exams.\n\nEventually we took the exams, and left the country for winter break. When we got back, we were approaching the end of January. As I was talking to her, I asked if she was done with exams. She said yes. I asked if she had free time. She said yes. I asked if she was still down to hang out. It was then that she came up with her worst and last excuse. \"It gets cold during winter. My room is really messy, and I feel too lazy to go out.\"\n\nLet me explain to you what had been going on the whole time in my head. From the very beginning, I was quite clear about my feelings. I introduced myself to this girl because I was interested, asked her out because I liked her, and believed her because I had feelings for her. I had been conflicting internally over these feelings for a long time. Part of me thought that I should take a hint that she wasn't interested, that she didn't owe me her time, and that we would be happier if I gave up on her. The other part of me insisted that if i gave up so easily and didn't trust her, it would trivialize my feelings for her. There were periods of time where I tried to give up, but that would just make me depressed and plunge me into a perpetual state of despair. I liked the me that was in love with her. That me was brighter, happier, and more optimistic. However, I wasn't delusional. I had seriously considered the possibility of just being friends with her. I know many guys complain about the friend-zone^TM , but I thought that if I liked her enough to date her, then I definitely liked her enough to be friends. I felt mature enough to handle a friendship without letting my feelings get in the way. I recognized that her indirectness would make it too frustrating to date her, but we could definitely still be friends.\n\nHowever, I feel like there is something seriously wrong with the way she had been treating me. I'd understand if she didn't have feelings for me and outright rejected me. I'd understand if she came up with a valid excuse for why she couldn't date me specifically, such as my ethnicity, even if it was completely made-up. However, for her to give me excuses such as \"I'm busy with exams\", \"I promise to hang out in February\", or \"I'm very lazy during winter\" is straight up humiliating. Forget being a couple, even friends wouldn't tell blatantly obvious excuses. For her to tell me these low-effort excuses and then disprove them herself by telling me about hanging out with her friends, it felt like a slap in the face. She doesn't owe me her affection, nor does she owe me her time. But if you tell someone you enjoy spending time with them, that you want to be friends, it's expected that you treat them like a friend, or at least a fellow human being. I've always been direct and completely honest with her, so I do feel like I deserve at least to be treated with the bare minimum of respect. I at least deserve the truth. Friends don't lie to each other, nor do they make each other wait three months for a promise that they'll break later on. I should've made this clear to her long ago about how I felt, but I was too caught up in my happiness at just being around her that I held it in. But after hearing the words \"I'm too lazy\", I just couldn't.\n\nSo I kind of went off on her. I asked her if she really thought I would believe her excuse this time. I asked her if she knew how I felt. I asked her if she wanted to be friends, then why did she treat me this way. I asked her if she thought I deserved an explanation or not. I told her everything that I had been holding in. We didn't get to finish the conversation because we had to go to class, but she promised to call me that night. I told her if she blew me off this time like she did before, I would never forgive her.\n\nShe did end up calling me that night. I asked her for an explanation. She told me that she had never been interested in the beginning, and that she didn't know how to tell me. She confessed she lied to me about the deliberate ignoring and the excuses. I asked her if she had considered how I would react to the excuses she gave, she confessed she hadn't and wasn't sure what to do. Then she started breaking down and crying. She told me she didn't know her actions would make me feel this way, and that she hadn't mean",

He told me a long time ago that he was romantically interested in me and I made it very clear that the feelings were not mutual but we could still be friends. He actually told me one point that he was in love with me. Anyway, friendship continued but he tried to flirt every so often. I told him that it made me uncomfortable and that I felt like it was disrespectful to me and my relationship. He's living in another state now for school. He was in town for Christmas. He texted me to let me know and try to find time to hang out. In the middle of this he made some flirtatious comments and I just stopped responding. So we didn't hang out. I'm not exactly bummed about it since he makes me kind of uncomfortable anyway. To be honest, the main reason I've maintained a friendship with him this long is because the kid I babysit loves him. Anyway, am I the asshole for just ignoring him when he tried to flirt and would I be the asshole if I just cut him out and told him I didn't want to be friends anymore? ",

      "description": "Okay so this is going to seem like middle school drama because it is. Sorry to clog up your feed with this. \n\nSo my school offers a program that’s letting sixth and seventh graders go to Costa Rica. (I’m a seventh grader.) me and a few friends started  a private group to fundraise. We were already a group of five people and we need to raise 2.5k per person within the next year. \n\nAnyways there’s a girl at our school who we’ll call D. D tends to be a control freak and a little bit sensitive. She has self-diagnosed anxiety and is pretty quick to involve school counselors in very small issues. \n\nSo me and four other people have created a OneNote page, a discord thing (IDRK how discord works), a schedule for events that work for all of us, we’ve gotten all of the legal papers from property owners and county health regulations, allergen info, etc. we’ve put a decent amount of work into this. \n\nSo a few days before the a bake sale D is trying to join our fundraiser. This is after people have left after concerns of not making enough money. We tried to be as nice as we could about telling her that she couldn’t join. \n\nThe day of the bake sale D sends a very long text to an individual member of the group asking to join and the tone it created made it seem like she was trying to join behind our backs. To be fair to her this probably wasn’t her intention but she made us out to be very assholey for setting boundaries. \n\nSo after we respectfully told her again that she couldn’t join we thought it was over. We continued to sell baked goods and it went okay. \n\nThen midway through D writes on Instagram where she has a decent following (500ish followers) that they should start a separate fundraising group and not let us in. \n\nWe ended up ignoring this and eventually sold out of cookies and other goods. We made about $100 which is less than a hundredth of what we need to raise so you can see why we wouldn’t want to have to fund another person. \n\nSo now I’m wondering AITA? Also sorry for bad formatting I’m on mobile. \n\n",

      "description": "My wife and I of 4 1/2 years are currently separated and don’t live in the same place but have remained together because in spite of some difficulties we’ve had, we both believe that we will remain together in the long run. I currently live about an hour and half away but I still see her and my son regularly when I get the chance. I’m 39 and she is 36. Like most people my age, I only have a few good friends and most of them work or live quite a ways from here. Two are literally half way across the country. \n\nAnyway, so last night I was talking to one of them and this particular friend enjoys a lot of the topics I enjoy, like for instance, last night we went on and on from topics like  why Germany was not responsible for WW1 (definitely WWII though) all the way to how he universe is astonishingly young when you consider that there is enough gasses to fuel stars for trillions of years. These are topics she doesn’t readily discuss with me and that’s fairly normal and no fault on her end. \n\nHer major complaint with me was that she called in when I was talking to him and I let it ring and then texted her that I was talking to my friend (which she knows pretty well. They grew up within about 10 miles of each other and went to church together). She said he was asking for me and that I could have called him back. I suppose that part is true but I didn’t think it was a huge deal and I wasn’t aware that he had asked until after I talked to her this morning. I feel kind of bad since it was him asking and I guess I could have called my friend back. It was one of those convos though that was rolling and very enjoyable. She also claimed that guys don’t talk on the phone for two hours and that “something was going on” which may be the heart of the entire position. \n\nI sent her the call time log and this post was her idea. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Y57KUNO.jpg \n\nI will accept your judgement. I realize I had an option and I did not take it but AITA? ",

As always, this isn’t as cut and dry as the title suggests. Keep in mind I’m highly emotional right now so this may seem ranty and grammatically incorrect. \n\n   I’m a very anxious person. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder and social anxiety. I had one friend who I would hang out after school with. I’ve known from the beginning we were a toxic combo but I always figured I’m too smart to get truly entangled with someone who was abusive. Our relationship was entirely platonic because I wasn’t interested in him in that way but he was obsessed with me. I have countless letters explaining not only how much I meant to him but destructive behaviors he would do because I was so sick that I couldn’t be with him. (I told him I didn’t want a relationship because I was in a horrible mental space which was entirely true but it wasn’t the whole story). He was so obsessed with me he told me he had a couple of possessions of mine like socks he kept. I can’t be more specific because of the .00000009 chance he finds this he will know it’s him. \n\n     Summer came and went and he got a girlfriend which was amazing for me because we could just be friends. We started hanging out a lot more which was conflicting for me because (this is pathetic I’m well aware) i loved the feeling of hanging out with a person. It makes me feel like such a normal teenager which rarely happens. \n\n     The flip side is the actual experience. Every time I’m hurt both physically and emotionally but you can’t place the blame on him. He enjoys watching others in pain so his favorite was choking me but I’ve had bruises from biting and I’ve been spit on and pinched and slapped across the face. I never told him I didn’t want it but I never said anything remotely close to I did. He also talks a lot about his hardships which granted he has a very rough life. I’ve been pushing therapy for years and offer other suggestions but he never tries a single thing aside from heavy drinking and drugs to cope. But none of this mattered because I had a friend! A worthless, mentally ill, untalented sack of nothing had someone who enjoyed my company!!! I was so lucky. Even now I slightly crave that. \n\n   Here’s where the break started. I confessed that I was bisexual a couple months ago which is huge for me because I come from an extremely religious upbringing which has damaged me in more ways than I think I fully understand. I told him that I honestly feel a little ashamed because of not only my environment but also because Ive seen it viewed outside of the LGBT+ community as just a fetish. He told me he would always support me and I felt like I was on cloud nine. Then it became a running gag that I was gonna steal his girlfriend. Don’t know exactly where that started but it just became a thing. \n\n     Then New Year’s Day I get a text  from a number I don’t have saved. It’s his girlfriend who send a vagina picture saying my friend said I wanted to see it. It was all a joke. It was just meant to make me laugh. But I wasn’t laughing. I was crying. I am so genuinely sorry if you were genuinely violated but this made me feel kind of that way. Also I’m still a minor for a couple of months so is that illegal I don’t know I don’t care too much about that. I don’t know if it was just « new year, new me » energy but I just blocked them on everything and when I saw him in school I didn’t talk to him at all. \n\nI know this may not be the right place to post this but I genuinely can’t think and my dads in the hospital so I can’t ask anyone else cause I want everyone to focus on his wellbeing but I desperately need some answers. Am I the asshole? Should I tell him why I gave him the cold shoulder? Is it better to be alone than to be in bad company? What can I do from here. Thanks to the one person who will read this lmaooo.

      "description": "I graduate law school in May and my mom lives 5 hours away. She recently told me that she is too afraid to drive up here (she has a serious fear of driving long distances) and may have to miss my graduation if she couldn’t find a ride up here. I asked my best friend, who said no because it’s understandably out of her way, and I asked my Dad, who also said no because him and my mom had a long and messy divorce (but she would be on the way for him, so it would be more reasonable for him to pick her up). \n\nAs I was laying in bed last night, I started crying because I was thinking about how upset I would be if my mom didn’t make my graduation. Suddenly, I got a notification from Hopper that there were $135 plane tickets from [airport an hour from Mom] to [where I am]. Since prices were around $500 last I looked, I booked her a one way flight. I figured I could drive her back down after the ceremony and it would be all good. \n\nI send her the itinerary and expected her to be grateful that her daughter made arrangements for her to be there. Nope; she said I made a mistake and that she can’t do the flight because: she doesn’t have a ride to the airport (an hour away), she has no one to watch the dogs, she doesn’t trust my 6 y/o nephew (who is autistic and who she takes care of full time) around his birth parents, she doesn’t want to do an hour layover (flight would total 5 hours, the same amount of time it would take driving). She said she wants to find a different alternative and that I should have conferred with her first. \n\nWell the ticket is nonrefundable. Which is fine, I feel better at least knowing I did what I could to get my mom up here rather than feeling sorry for myself that she wouldn’t make it. But am I the asshole for not conferring with her first? She has over a month to make arrangements for a ride to the airport, someone to watch her dogs and my nephew. All of this can be done by my brother (who isn’t going and who I don’t want to attend for various reasons I won’t get into). \n\nBesides, what alternatives are there that she wouldn’t need someone to watch her dogs anyway?? I feel like she’s making excuses and just.. doesn’t want to go to my graduation? I would be really sad if she wasn’t there and honestly embarrassed because my professors have talked about wanting to meet my parents. \n\nMy dad said he’d still think about picking her up on the way (he’s remarried and he said he really doesn’t want to be in a car with her for 5 hours.. understandably) but it’s likely a hard no. He said he’d also ask my brother (who I’m not a fan of) if he would drive her up (if my mom asked, my brother would immediately say no). \n\nTLDR: Bought my mom a one way ticket to be at my graduation and she was not happy that I didn’t ask her first. She’s making excuses for why she can’t make it and I’m not sure what else I can do to get her to come. ",

      "description": "Okay so I’m an adult now (25). I have certain immune system issues. I have horrible allergies and asthma. These issues developed when I went away to college and lived in the city for the first time. I had surgery a few months ago on my sinuses to remove polyps so I could breathe but they’re already starting to re-grow. \n\nAnyway, my mom didn’t breastfeed me. Based on what she says she had no real reason not to. She just didn’t wanna do it. (She’s weird and I think she honestly has body issues and doesn’t like to be touched, which made for an interesting childhood experience). \n\nI just feel like her decision was super selfish. I’m well-aware that there’s no way to know whether that would have prevented my immune system issues. So I’m not arguing that at all. But I can’t help but feel resentment that there was some chance that breastfeeding could have helped somehow. Maybe built me up more. (I don’t know; as you can probably tell I have 0 medical training and am just speaking based on my own amateur research). \n\nI’ve actually talked to my mom about this and she’s super dismissive, which is normal for her. Am I justified in feeling this way or AITA for holding animosity over something like this? (And I promise this isn’t some kind of pro-breast milk campaign. Again, I have no medical or scientific training and I would be happy to accept that my thinking is way off base). ",

      "description": "First off, I am pretty sure I'm not the asshole. But I know I'm really heated right now and that I'm probably having trouble seeing other points of view. And, ya know, I wanna vent.\n\nImportant backstory: if you look in my post history you'll probably find the hick university I call home. We have a tradition (well, we have many traditions) that involves dunking your class ring in a pitcher of beer and chugging it out. This usually involves a big party and merriment. \n\nAbout two months ago, 8 of my friends and myself started planning this party. We set a date and started getting a guest list together. The semester picked up and we all let the party plans simmer in the background for awhile. One of the girls had to bail, but gave us plenty of notice and invited us to her dunk she was doing with other friends. We were sad, but we all understood. \n\nToday, a few of us started to ask what the plans were and if we should start buying stuff. The party is in two weeks, but they'll be a hectic set of weeks. Since it will be at my house, I want to be prepared now.\n\nCue friends A, B, and C dropping out. In all fairness to C, she let us know awhile ago that she would have to be rather quick because of an early morning obligation. For A and B, I was livid. They kept saying how they'll be busy so they will only stay for an hour or so and then leave. They added that, since I told everyone they'd be responsible for guests that weren't in our immediate friend group, that they'd get their guests to leave when they do. Even though it's at my house, I see every person dunking as a host. And, really, I see them bailing as not wanting to hang out with me. Maybe that's a \"me\" issue.\n\nMore backstory, perhaps, is that A and B have consistently bailed on hanging out before any get together or major plans. We made plans to travel, and when it came time to buy tickets they bailed. We made plans to go eat, or see a movie, or do anything and they bail right when it's time to commit. Until that point they seem to be enthusiastic about the plans. Their excuse is always that they're 'busy.' This is where I went off because, in my opinion, that's a shitty excuse. It's like saying that you're more busy than everyone else, which is not true. We all are swamped, this is COLLEGE.\n\nAnyway, it came down to the group chat blowing up with back and forth annoyances and A saying that B was crying and that we should feel bad. I went off again, saying that that was manipulative and that I don't really care. \n\nRight now we're all cooling down a bit. AITA?",

I usually try to do some core exercises after I'm done with the main part of my work out. I'm laying flat on my back doing some leg raises which makes me breathe pretty hard, those things kick my butt. After I finish out the last set I'm just laying there eyes closed while trying to catch my breathe and I hear someone say something so I open my eyes and look up to see this girl standing over me. \n\nI take one headphone out and say \"hi, were you talking to me?\" and she said \"yeah, I asked if you wanted to be out of breath like that later tonight?\". I don't have much experience when it comes to these kind of things so I was really uncomfortable, I laid there for what seemed like 5 minutes trying to come up with a response. I eventually was able to say something along of the lines of \"oh, thank you for the offer but I'm not really the hook up kind of guy, I'm sorry.\", little did I know all hell was about to brake loose.\n\n She immediately starting yelling saying things like \"wow, you must be gay or something?\" \"are you calling me a slut?\" and other obscenities. She then asks me \"what are you a virgin?\" and I say \"not that it's really any of your business but yeah, I am.\" Other people at this point have taken notice to her less than friendly attitude and ask what is going on, while half the people are trying to calm her down I get taken over the side and I explain what had happened between me and her. They asked her to leave the gym for the rest of the day which didn't go over well with her so they ended up having someone escort her out. I'm not really sure If I should have reacted in a different way or if there was something I could have done to prevent that from happening but I can guarantee you I won't be going back there anytime soon.",

      "description": "I've been dating her about 5 months. The first few months of our relationship were very \"innocent\" I guess you could call it. She's pretty conservative (not politically or religiously, just like personality/showing off) so I never really saw her without minimum a t shirt and shorts on. The most we did was make out/touch, fully clothed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really enjoy her personality, and I think she has a very pretty face. Recently, we've started to actually become more sexually involved. An issue has come up though. I don't feel attracted to her physically. She is on the heavier side, which I never really noticed much or paid attention to before since she was always covered up and we weren't really doing anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel pretty terrible about this. I want to be attracted to her, and I want to have a strong desire for sex with her but I don't. I think she's pretty, but I'm not sexually attracted to her if that makes sense. I know this isn't normal for me, since with my ex we had sex very frequently and I always had a very strong desire and I knew I found her incredibly hot/attractive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur relationship is otherwise fine, so I feel like I'd be a huge fucking asshole if I break up with her basically because of her weight. But I don't really see a sustainable relationship with someone who I don't find sexually attractive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR starting to become more intimate with girlfriend, but I'm realizing I don't find her body attractive and don't have a desire for sex because of it...would it be wrong to break up with her?",

      "description": "I've been dating my girlfriend for two and a half years (both age 26) and she just moved in with me. I never knew what her eating habits at home were like because she eats totally normally at restaurants and seems to appreciate complex flavors. At home, she eats ingredients piecemeal and it's really weird. For example, she will eat plain pasta and she will take bites from a block of cheese, but she will never make mac n cheese. She'll make a completely plain omelette for breakfast and later when she's feeling peckish she will go eat an entire green pepper. That kind of stuff.\n\nShe snacks constantly and never eats \"a meal\" as one would traditionally think of it unless we are eating out. One of her favorite snacks is canned tomatoes. Our fridge is now full of cans of whole tomatoes, and when she gets hungry she will open one up and just eat the whole thing right out of the can. There are a couple different kinds of vegetables that she will eat straight from the can without heating up, seasoning, or anything, also pumpkin pie filling sometimes.\n\nI've asked her about it and asked her if she wants to maybe try something like meal prepping, and she just says she doesn't want to spend hours every week making food just to end up eating week-old food on the tail end, and she says she just doesn't enjoy cooking and hates washing dishes.\n\nI just think it's so weird. I kind of want to sit her down and tell her that she can't just eat ingredients but I don't know what angle I could even come from here.",

      "description": "I run a Discord server full of artists and I had befriended someone - nicknamed ART - there that had recently opened their own Discord server, and invited me to moderate. I accepted, wanting to be nice to my new friend.\n\nART and a bunch of other users were talking, and they had mentioned how they wanted a steam game, but didn't have a PayPal at the time, or a way to obtain it. I then purchased a steam key, and sent it to them out of nowhere. They were incredibly grateful, and asked if they could do a drawing for me. I declined this offer, because I felt like the value of the game I had bought them didn't line up with how much their art was worth, but I responded by asking them if they would rather do an art trade, to which they accepted. I drew my end and excitedly awaited what they would send back.\n\nA month goes by and I completely forgot about it. I DMed them I would be really excited if I could commission some art from them. They told me it was fine, and that I could just ask for something. I hesitated, but eventually agreed. I remembered back to when we did the art trade and just figured it was all part of that anyway, so I didn't think anything of it.\n\nIn December, they responded, saying that they had completely forgotten about it, and I was happy with the response and assumed it was just a mistake. Another week goes by, I inquire again, this time telling me that they were busy with other commissions. I didn't take it so positively this time, writing out a long winded message telling them that it wasn't alright to keep telling me that they'll do it, and I felt like they were just abusing my trust and friendship. I sent the message then headed off to bed.\n\nI woke up in the morning to find that not only did they demod me from their Discord server overnight, stating later that they were worried I had done something to it (which doesn't make sense, since Discord logs everything), and that they didn't owe me free art. I responded back saying that the initial piece of art that I gave them was part of an art trade they initiated. ART told me they were sorry they gave off the impression it was an art trade, and I quickly left their Discord server.\n\nThey still frequented my art server, and I didn't want to bring off-server drama there, so I kept my mouth shut, as they occasionally asked why I didn't like them anymore. I eventually responded, telling ART it was because I felt he scammed and abused me for free art and to get me to moderate his server. ART started apologizing, asking if there was anything that he could do to repay me, to which I responded with drawing the other half of the art trade. He didn't respond, but I just assumed that he would draw it. I haven't heard anything from them since.\n\nAITA for continually bothering him about something so insignificant, or am I right to be upset that he offered several times?",

      "description": "I helped myself to some beer and a small portion of fries a nice luxury snack to have whilst watching a game I'd been looking forward to. After I got into them, I noticed my girlfriend, who has been staying at mine for a few weeks, had woken up and was on her phone. She had been asleep when I went to heat the fries.  \n\n\nI got through about two thirds within a few minutes, and then walked over to the bed with the remaining third. Now, there were not many in the dish, as I had only made a small amount to begin with. I asked 'do you want some?'. She didn't answer and just looked at the fries, and then at me, and then at the fries... I thought she was considering whether she wanted them or not, so I just put them next to her and walked back to the TV.   \n\n\nAs I walked away she said, very sternly, 'don't treat me like a dog'. I was surprised and asked how I had done that. We had a bit of a heated conversation. She said I should have offered her the fries as soon as I had realized she was awake - she doesn't want my leftovers that I have finished with, the way you'd feed a dog. She said it was 'dirty' and equivalent to a chef eating from the plate before serving you your meal, and that I should not have just put the fries next to her and walked away, as she didn't say yes. I was on the defensive I gotta admit - I said I was just being considerate, that I didn't make many fries to begin with, that she had done similar things in the past, and that I thought she was making a problem out of nothing.  \n\n\nShe said she wants to leave my place (she hasn't yet though) and never stay here again - to which I said I thought she was being ridiculous. She won't talk to me at all now, and I'm wondering if I handled this really badly or if there's something I'm not getting? AITA?",

This doesn't mean I completely rely on him, I only even see him once a week. We support each other but we are not each other's life support. I'm extremely lonely and get bullied and harassed a lot on my campus, I'm exhausted every day and I'm sick of the pain.\n\nMy boyfriend knows how much going abroad meant to me, and did his best to support me but he and I were both upset that I would be missing his 18th birthday and high school graduation, as well as many other milestones. We planned to stay together long distance.\n\nI learned today that I was not accepted into the program and I'm devastated.\n\nWhen I told him, his immediate response was joy because I'll be staying here with him. He was saying things like \"we can go to the beach together\" and other plans... which I know were with good intent but honestly upset me, not because I don't want to do those things but because he was thinking about his contentness with me being here rather than me being miserable.\n\nI texted him explaining my perspective and how I was upset with him for not empathizing with my disappointment and honest fear for this upcoming year, and he became upset as well. Not because of me, but because he thinks I'm mad at him.\n\nI love this man to death and he is the sweetest and kindest person I know, not to mention the only person who tolerates me. I would never want to hurt him and he has never in our relationship made me mad or uncomfortable.\n\nAITA for being upset that he's not acknowledging how miserable I'll be and instead is focusing on his feelings of my situation? Of course I feel a little selfish for saying this but it's the circumstance, not me.",

We were given a brief to work on a VIP client animation project. \n\nWe were doing this alongside our full time studio job as well... going home after 9 hours and killing ourselves on this project. After two months we had two weeks till deadline and we were pretty much sorted. However, the third party go between wanted to add a third person.\n\nWe were against this person, we know them to be cocky and unreliable. But client agreed. We guess that this was because this was a very sensitive project and it was odd to hire two white animators to be the faces of who made it...\n\nWell, since the two weeks this guy worked on it, he didnt do as we asked and was just awful and unreliable as we thought... \n\nWe had the opening evening and it was very fancy and nice but we were very angry to find that people were talking as if he was leading the project and not me or my friend... worse is he got two jobs off our work and tried to not tell us about it... And worse still is he said \"I think I can replicate it anyway\".\n\nAn article was written about it and his name was plastered over it... we were described as graduates and my friends name was spelt wrong.\n\nSomeone else wanted to write an article and myself and my colleague decided we deserve credit for the misery we went through... And we said in our response that we didn't get full credit and this guy didn't work on it as much as people first thought. He did 2 weeks to our 2 month.\n\nThe article isnt out yet, I'm not sure how I feel.\n\nI am thinking this might be petty of us but we've lost out because of this lie.

      "title": "AITA For Giving My College Prof A Bad Review?",
      "description": "So A bit of Backstory. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a 21yo(F) currently in my first year of college. One of my first required classes was, obviously, a College level math course. Due to some severe anxiety and a hearing disability I decided I would be better off taking my Colleges online classes rather than the brick and mortar classes. My online math class started off pretty well, the teacher put up an announcement stating the class was starting, where we needed to go to submit assignments, ect.   \n\n\nThe problem didn't really start till after the second set of assignments were due. (Basically you had two assignments due every two weeks, a hand written review test of the chapter and a set of worksheet that added up to like 100-120 math problems). The first week went fine, I submitted my stuff early. The second week I ended up waiting till two days before the due date for the assignments because I got sick. I logged in to the school website to start my assignments only to find that they had been closed early. Emailed the teacher, got no reply. Called the teacher, got no reply. I sent a copy of my assignments in via email and wrote a complaint to technical support in case the problem was with the website and not the assignment. Tech support got back to me and told me that the assignments had been closed by the teacher and not them. I ended up letting it go and took the hit to my grade for not submitting the assignments. Just to make sure, I did the next four weeks worth of assignments in the next three days so they wouldn't be missed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen came my midterm. It was a whopping 500 points. Now, this is in a class that only had a max of about 1,500 points available to be scored. My final exam was also 500 points and then the last 500 was divided among the review tests and the worksheets. I studied like hell for my midterm and I took as much time as I could to let the information sink in. Five days before the midterm due date I went to take it. Only to find it closed. I emailed him 12 times. Called him 22 times. I drove up to the college to try and get in touch with him only to find out his classes were in the central college (About an hour away from me). I ended up having to go into my academic advisers office, in tears and having a panic attack, because I thought I was going to fail his class since that midterm was 1/3 of my grade and I had already two assignments worth of work. She called the Dean of Education with me sitting beside her and I had to explain what was going on while still having a panic attack. The Dean emailed him and got a response back within 10 minutes and the assignment was reopened with an extended due date.  (I got 489/500) The professor then went on to do that with two more assignments (After the mid term I just shotgunned the rest of the assignments because I couldn't go through that again so I didn't get caught up in that whirlwind again.)  \n\n\nAbout ten days before the end of the  semester the college sent out course performance reviews. I gave him a *scathing* review. So Scathing, in fact, that his boss The Dean of STEM called me and asked why I was so negative about the course. Now, I have several friends that have the same major as me and two of them ended up taking this guys class. However, they took the in school class rather than the online one. I ended up telling them about the review I left and they both got incredibly angry with me. They said that it wasn't fair for me to have given him such a bad review, that they're classes went perfectly fine and he was such a nice guy, and that I probably negatively effected his peers view of him and other things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't intend to hurt the Prof. I just wanted to give my honest opinion about the course. But now that I'm going over it and I have my friends opinions on the guy I can't help but feel bad? Like I and a few other people in his online class had a horrible experience with him but his normal classes all love him? AITA here? Should I not have given him such a bad review even though I had a negative experience?",

      "description": "My husband and I have been together for almost 13 years and have had no problems sleeping together in the same bed until I fell pregnant with our son in 2016. My pregnancy made me more sensitive to sound and seemed to coincide with my husband starting to breathe heavily and then to snore.\n\nFor most of my pregnancy my husband refused to accept that there was an issue. During that time I tried earplugs (so many different brands and materials). None of them blocked the sound of him snoring. I also found the sound of my own breathing and heartbeat irritated me further. I tried listening to music, Audiobooks and white noise. I could still hear him. Finally I started to move to the then spare room. I could still hear him through the wall but it was a vast improvement. \n\nMy husband hated me moving and made it as difficult as possible to do so. My mum gave me a mattress for the spare room so he moved my daughter into that room to prevent me from using it. He says he struggled to sleep if I'm not beside him. \n\nOur son was born in September. I then had to contend with snoring and a newborn waking up throughout the night. After around 6 months my husband tried a couple of snoring remedies with very little success. I found myself on the sofa, more often than not with a newborn. My sleep deprivation got so bad that I wanted to die.\n\nFinally my husband realised how much I was suffering after I told him I didn't want to be alive anymore. For the past 4 weeks he's slept on the sofa with the odd night of him attempting to share a bed with me. On those nights I'm usually on the sofa by 10:30pm having given up on trying to sleep beside him when he's snoring within 10 minutes of getting into bed. We no longer have a spare room as my son is in there. \n\nHe tells me it'll get better that we'll work it out, that I need to think about it more positively but after more than two years of this I've had enough. I don't want to try anymore because when I do I end up having to move and find it difficult to get back to sleep. I would rather sleep in separate beds permanently. My husband hates the idea of us not sharing a bed and makes me feel guilty for feeling the way I do. I \n\nSo, AITA for wanting to sleep separately and how can we solve this conflict in our relationship? ",

      "description": "So I’m [M20] almost done with my 3rd year in College. I want to be an actuary someday and NOT dependent on my family. I have held min wage jobs before but I also struggled with ADHD/depression a lot. \n\nSo last year I started going to Church 1 that my mom does not go to regularly. Met really nice folks and made some friends. Fast forward over winter break until this semester. I’m taking 18 credit hours and studying for my first “entry” exam to be an actuary. It’s been 4 weeks where I skip going to Church 1 and my mom gets mad then more mad since I don’t go to Church 2 with her. She’s known to blurt things she won’t hold her end to, mainly out of emotion. \n\nSo this is the tricky part. My dad has been an alcoholic his entire life and divorced my mom last semester. I had gotten ahold of spike by accident (synthetic marijuana), and had a psychotic breakdown at the beginning of last semester. It validated his belief me and my mom are bi polar. So now this morning I stayed up late because of my anxiety and I have a bit of depression worrying about school work and such. I skip again for the fourth week and my mom says something along the lines of, *If you’re gonna be an atheist you can live with your dad.* \n\nOk she has literally told me I’m her joy since I was born. She loves me unconditionally and without me she would be very emotionally unstable because of the divorce. I’m what she lives for basically. I feel like the asshole but then again if I tell her I don’t believe in God then I have no idea if she would turn into the asshole or worse become depressed and angry. \n\nI just don’t want the weight of religion holding me down and making me regret every decision I make concerning my habits/priorities and girls. I do want to get married and like I said, not be dependent on my family. ",

Her and I get along just fine, but she will hate my sister to the end of time, different story. But my dad decides to drop the bomb that after he is gone, he is leaving everything to his wife, and nothing to my sister and I. And to be clear, not my mom, but his second wife. This took me by complete surprise. I guess I didn't really think about it, but now that he said it, it kinda hurt. I wanted to talk to him about it, but how without just sounding greedy? So he tells me she is supposed to leave anything left to my sister and I when she dies. Now, his wife has 2 sons of her own. Her oldest hates everything about my dad and his side. The youngest is oblivious to the world, so who knows what's going on with him. But how is this plan supposed to work? What's stopping her from leaving everything of his to them? Again, she hates my sisters existence. Should she pass without a will, her sons take everything. My dad tried telling me he wanted to leave all of us kids something. But after he got sick, he had to lower his life insurance, so now this is the plan. Give everything to his wife and hope she leaves my sister and I something in her will. But to me it seems he is leaving them everything. Am I the asshole for being hurt by this? Should I try and talk to him about it?",

      "description": "My SO and I just moved in together (literally, yesterday was moving day) and we had a nightmare move. We started at 9am and went until 6 this morning. There are a lot of reasons it went so long, but it mostly boils down to us being unprepared and underestimating how much stuff we really had.\n\nWe’re all moved in and this is the first day all week (we moved throughout the week in the evenings) that we’ve had to relax. I was excited because we were going to his family Super Bowl party- I love his family and it’s always a big to do anytime they get together with friends, family and plenty of food present. We had asked his Dad if they could watch our dog during the move, and he canceled at the last minute due to his live-in girlfriend having the flu. No big deal, we scrambled and found a good (if a bit expensive) doggy daycare to look after her. \n\nWe show up and my first sign that something is wrong is that his Dad doesn’t hug me or say hi - this hurt my feelings a little since he hugged my bf and my bf’s friend who walked in behind me, but I understand I’m just the GF. A bunch of people were already there, and surprisingly one of them was the live-in girlfriend. Not only was she there, but she was animatedly telling stories, serving food and seeming very much like she didn’t have the flu. She ignored us completely and acted like we weren’t there. My bf and I exchanged a look and started grabbing food. \n\nThis would have been it, but his childhood best friend came over and we started talking. He owns a moving company and asked us how our move went- we relayed our saga and he proceeded to grill us on why it took so long and generally giving us a hard time. I apologized to him, thinking we upset him by not hiring his company, but he just kept giving us grief over the move and eventually walked away. At this point, I felt very overwhelmed and a bit hurt- after a horrible move, the last thing I wanted to have to deal with being interrogated and ignored. I ended up leaving shortly after, and have been wondering ever since if I overreacted. I know I’m tired, but AITA for being upset by this? ",

      "description": "My mother and I have a...somewhat tense relationship. Whenever we have to interact for long periods of time, at least one of us ends up in tears.\n\nMy mom is/has bi polar disorder, and when I was growing up, she was undiagnosed.  She's also an alcoholic. Which means a lot of drunk nights, unreasonable punishments, yelling, shoe throwing, and all kinds of other things. For example, one night I remember vividly, it was my older brother's prom night. He was worried about something about it turned into an argument between him and my mom. My uncle had just brought over some golf clubs so a whole bag was sitting out in the open. My mom proceeded to grab one of them out of the bag in the middle of their screaming match. I have no idea what she was planning on doing with it, but I grabbed the club and wouldn't let go. She was also physically abusive at times to my older siblings. Not so much to me, but my older siblings can both recall plenty of times she'd done something to them as kids. ...and that's just stuff from before my parents split up. In fact, I was even told that the reason they split up was because of how she treated my older sister.\n\nAfter they split, things were still really bad. She gets mad really easily and she's always yelling at me, or getting upset about something when we speak. I'm very sensitive when people yell at me, likely because of all the fights I witnessed as a child, so I tend to cry when I'm yelled at. My mom would say things like \"you have nothing to cry about\" and \"oh, now you're gonna act like I'm mistreating you.\" Basically phone conversations or visits with her always lead to arguing and tears, and I really would rather not put myself through that.\n\nBUT ON THE OTHER HAND. My mom is now medicated, and really trying her best to have a good relationship with me. Some of the disputes we have lead to me saying something that I don't think is innocent or hurtful, and her getting upset and crying, and saying that she should leave. It feels like she's trying to guilt trip me, but also it's also very possible that my own mother is very hurt by things I didn't intend to be hurtful. It should also be noted that she lives out of state and I live with my aunt and uncle. She seems really upset that her kids don't live with her, and apparently other family members have been saying hurtful things to her about how she \"gave her kids away\" even though that's not what happened at all. My sister has also told me that sometimes my mom calls her, crying, talking about how she wishes things could have been different, and that we could have a good relationship, or that she wishes she could have died instead of our father. \n\nNaturally, hearing these things, I feel like a real sack of shit. Still, though, it's hard to get past the childhood trauma, and the fact that we're always hurting each other in some way when we're interacting. It seems like she's really trying to make things right, but I've been trying for a while now too, and it's hard with all the negative emotions surrounding her. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So upfront, I'm not crazy about my brother's wife. She's kind of a princess, more than a little icy/aloof, and we've never clicked. So I might be less inclined to give her any leeway than I would other family members.\n\nI'm the de facto family photographer and we recently all got together for my niece's first birthday (brother and SIL's daughter). At one point, I gathered everyone together--my parents, my aunts and uncles, my brother and SIL, and my niece--for a collection of photos to commemorate the occasion. \n\nLater, I was showing my brother the group of photos on my camera and he really liked them. I asked if he had a favorite and he said they all looked great. At this point, SIL was looking over our shoulder and said that she liked pictures 1 and 3, but really hated 4 and 5 because it looked like she had a double chin (she was leaning over to kiss niece on the head and it definitely gives that illusion). \n\nWell, the problem is that picture number 5 is the only one where my mom looks amazing. My mom is really camera shy and tends to be tense until the very end. It's the only photo where she is smiling and looking like her usual happy, beautiful self. Everyone else looks good and it's only my SIL who is in an unflattering position. So I said I'd think about it, but then later posted that photo on Facebook and got that one printed for my parents' house, as well as to send to my brother. I do a lot of post-processing work and print on my own dime, so it's a lot of work for me.\n\nWell, now my brother says ITA because there were lots of photos that I could have used but I went with one of the ones his wife asked me not to use. Which A) I didn't actually ask her opinion and B) she just looks like she has a little double chin, it's not the end of the world. She's kissing her daughter, it's sweet. But my brother says that it was niece's birthday photo and an important occasion for him and his wife, so SIL's opinion should have been taken into consideration more than usual and that she mattered more than my mom in the pic. \n\nIf it matters, we all only get together a few times a year because we all live in different places so it's not like we get the chance for large family photos a lot.",

      "description": "I am relatively new to the subreddit and decided I should participate more than just by casting judgement on others. I guess it is my turn to be judged.\n\nThis happened some time ago.\n\nMy grandfather and I were super close. Essentially he played the role of my father. We were best friends.\n\nHe worked as an operator at a steel refinery. He was one of the guys that controlled the huge machines that put the billets on the rollers etc. It was a physically toxic environment which resulted in emphysema as well as lung cancer.\n\nNear the end of his life, he suffered a heart attack which landed him in hospital. The family rallied around him, and we would take turns visiting him, taking care of him, taking his favorite snacks / magazines etc. We all spent a lot of time in the hospital with him just to make sure he wasn't lonely.\n\nAt this time, I was in training for a new job and was in the final evaluation phase. During the last week, we were called to the hospital by the doctors on three different occasions to \"say goodbye\" - the doctors were convinced he wouldn't make it through the night each time. Granted, his organs were shutting down one by one and was basically only alive because he was hooked up to a dialysis machine. \n\nKeep in mind, each time we got the call from the doctors, we all took our turns saying good bye. He was no longer conscious at this point. We were all shattered, basically having our final words with him each time. Each time we got the call, we dropped everything so that we could go through to see him.\n\nOn the day that he died, we got another call from the hospital saying that we should come say good bye to him. This time, I refused to go. I had already said my good-byes and was way too emotionally raw to have to go through it again. Part of me felt that we would just get the same call the next day, and the next after that. I think I was in denial that he was actually dying, telling myself that he will pull through it. Needless to say, he passed away that same day, and since then I have carried a lot of guilt with me for not going the last time. \n\nAITA for not going one final time? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I babysit my friend's 8 year old daughter 2-3 afternoons a week. (she has a 2-2-3 custody set up with her ex-h) I pick her up from school and she hangs out at my house and does her homework for about 2-3 hours before my friend gets off work and picks her up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe agreed (in writing) that she'd pay me $20/day for this, which isn't a ton, but her kid is quiet and well behaved, so it's not really a lot of work. This was going just fine for the first half of the school year, every other week she'd pay me $100. Since the beginning of February however, she's had one excuse after another as to why she couldn't pay me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first time it was legitimate, her car had a mechanical problem that needed to be fixed for her to drive it safely, sucks, but that's life and I wasn't upset. The 2nd time she didn't pay was a bit fishy because she claimed that  her work had a problem with it's payroll software and thus she would have to wait an extra week for her check. She works for a large bank and so I didn't quite buy it, but I figured she had another life emergency pop up and was embarrassed. (After this week's issue, I asked another friend who happens to work in IT at said bank about it, and she confirmed there wasn't an problem.) I gently reminded her that she owed me $200 by this point, and she assured me I'd have the full amount on the next payday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis Friday comes along and I notice she's posted a *huge* haul from Sephora on facebook, easily $250 worth of stuff if not more, with the caption that she'd needed to treat herself on payday. This irked me a bit, since she always complains about how she's short on funds, but I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt since she could've had a gift card or something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy faith in her was not rewarded when shortly after seeing this post she called me up to tell me that she had an unexpected expense and wouldn't be able pay me once again. While it might not have been the best choice on my part, I brought up that make-up didn't seem to be something that was more important than paying for childcare. I admit I was a bit short with her, but I didn't raise my voice or insult her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis set her off and she told me that I was classist by saying people with a limited income should never buy themselves nice things, and that life was so hard for a single mom and I'd never understand. (I'm honestly not sure I'd class someone with 50-50 custody as a single mom, but that isn't a hill I want to die on)  I wasn't in a mood for a blowout so I just told her that if she couldn't pay me she'd have to find alternate arragements for her daughter going forward and ended the call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then she and mutual friends have been blowing my phone up calling me insensitive. Some friends have come over to my side when hearing the full story, but some are still saying that I should cut her some slack because money is tight for her.",

My grandparents are annoying people who interfere in the smallest of things. It's most what turned my Dad into the crazy person he is today. But that really isn't a good enough reason you know to be this kind of an asshole.\nMy whole life I've wondered why I never take a stand against him. So today I did. I legit blurted out \"Why do you always yell why can't you just talk to us and discuss stuff\".\nGuess what, he just yelled more and ran away. He's never apologised for his actions, he doesn't take an effort in anything. If we talk even a little rudely to him he'll scream at us like God knows what we've done. My mom is very emotional and I've inherited this. I try so hard not to cry but I do idk why.\nI just want to get a good job and get my mom and leave the place. He would be all alone, and maybe that would finally make him regret.\n\nWe tried therapy years ago, didn't work. What do you expect of a man who doesn't listen to anyone even on the smallest of things. My mom can't leave him because of society and money issues, she's never agreed to on this topic. So now the only thing I can do is move her out when I earn. ",

(According to him it happened around 2 years ago)\n\nI didn’t know him very well and I am a nice person, so I tried to be helpful by telling him what he went thru was unfortunate and since he seems so hurt by it he should seek help. \n\nFor the next few days Rod continues to send me massive paragraphs about how his female ex-friend leaving him hurt him. \n\nRod would continue to send me messages about how hurt he was, clearly looking for sympathy. And knowing me I tried to be nice and tell him he should move on. \n\nRod would continue to message me about this before I told him to stop because I have already told given him all the sympathy I could.  Him whining about the same thing so much everyday annoyed me. \n\nFor a few days we talk more but about our personal interests. But it doesn’t last long because he starts whining again about his female ex-friend, but this time he wants to get back at her.  \n\nHe gives me her phone # and tells me to message her a scripted paragraph about how she messed with the wrong person and how hurt he is. (Rod’s # got blocked by her) I told Rod I did not want to be part of his drama. Rod for the next day persists that I message his ex-friend after I repeatedly say “no”.  \n\nEventually Rod gets me to cave in and I say “yes”, but I chose not to actually send his ex-friend any message and lied to him saying after I sent the message I got blocked.\n\nI don’t talk to Rod for awhile and he reaches out to me saying he wants me to message his ex-friend’s friend on Instagram for Rod (All of Rod’s instas are blocked by said friend). I decline again saying I will not be apart of his personal drama and I tell him he needs to move on and I will try to help where I can. \n\nI also tell him again he needs to stop trying to involve me in his drama or I will stop talking to him. \n\nA day or two later in the middle of a decent conversation he asks for my Snapchat so I can message ex-friend and ex’s friend *again*. I tell Rod that he should know I will not message these people because I want no part of his drama and it annoys me since he is sobbing about his problems to me and wants me to fix them. \n\nI don’t hear from Rod for roughly a few weeks and during that weeks I feel like a rock is lifted from my chest. \n \nRod reaches out to me after awhile and wants me to draw him beating up his ex-friend. I decline after he begs and begs me to draw this twisted fantasy if his. I don’t hear from him for a day and he asks again and I decline some more. \n\nThat was the final straw. I had been asking Rod to stop asking me to do things for his personal gain and tried to get him to solve his own problems but he never really changed like he said he would. \n\nI have now blocked him and I feel somewhat bad since he apparently has put so much trust in someone he barely knows and tried to use.( I gave him very very little information about myself)  AITA??

      "description": "So I was with a seriously troubled girl for around 18 months. She was lovely and kind, but came with a lot of baggage that I couldn’t really handle in the long run. That being said, I had my baggage too. We both met in Narcotics Anonymous, and had gotten sober at around the same time. Eventually we started going to NA meetings together and we started dating. \n\nAfter around a year and a couple months, she relapsed and it really caught me off guard because things seemed to be going so well for us both, but addiction is a really unforgiving disease. I took care of her and told her everything was going to be okay, and she’d be able to get sober again. I took her to see her sponsor but she panicked and ran off. I went after her and brought her back to my place. She promised that she’d stay sober and asked if she could stay with me for a while. I said sure, and she was living in my apartment. \n\nShe stopped going to meetings after a few weeks and thats when I started finding dirty needles in my trash bins. I sort of panicked and didn’t want to believe it, but I confronted her about it and she started crying. That’s all I needed (but didn’t want) to see. With a heavy heart, I told her that for the sake of my own sobriety that she’d need to pack her things and leave. It was really hard to do, but I told her that she needed to find some help, and that help wasn’t with me. \n\nShe said, “you’re such an asshole, you were the only one I trusted!” and that really resonated with me, having lived a life of constantly losing trust. I’ve been thinking about it for a while and I’m really not sure what I could’ve done. I felt like I just left her to her own devices and gave her just another excuse to shoot up. So am I the asshole?

      "description": "Background: my \"friend\" is nearly 500 pounds, is on oxygen, and has type two diabetes. His A1C is between 11-12 even though he is on two different types of injectable insulin and metformin, plus he turns down the oxygen output on his tank from 5 (where the doctor said it needs to be at), to 2 or 3 to make it last longer, but turns purple and passes out because of it. He constantly leaves his medications and testing supplies at home, and makes up stories from his doctor to excuse what he did. He's had these issues for years, and seeing him not take responsibility for himself kills me because I've watched my father (d2014) and my grandmother (d1991) kill themselves because of their diabetes. He knows this, but still behaves like a toddler who needs someone to change his nappies when he messes himself. So on Tuesday 11/6 he, his girlfriend, another friend, and I had plans to see Bohemian Rhapsody at noon, drop him off at a gaming store, then the rest of us were going to vote, and afterward his girlfriend was going to meet up with him. He would be away from home for two meals, and for approximately 13 hours, so he would need his meds, his testing equipment, and three oxygen tanks (each lasts between 5-6 hours).\n\nWhen we picked him up he walked out of his house with two tanks and his gaming bag. He argued about getting another tank, and whined that he didn't want to carry it. He suggested that he wouldn't need them, but eventually got them after arguing in the rain for several minutes. I asked him if he had his medications and testing equipment, and he said he did. I agreed again, and he again said he did have them. So, we went to the theater, and watched the movie. Afterwards, we congregated in the lobby, and his girlfriend informed us that he had purchased and eaten two bags of Swedish fish and a 32 oz soda, and he wanted to stop somewhere for food because he felt weird. I wasn't surprised at his actions, and asked him to pull out his testing kit and insulin so we could gauge where his sugar was and deal with it. He informed me that he left that stuff at home because he didn't need it.\n\n....\n\nKeep in mind that I specifically asked if he had everything, including his testing kit and his meds, before we left because we wouldn't have time to doddle, and he told me he did have them. Twice.\n\n....\n\nSo, I flipped out. I yelled at him, calling him a childish, disrespectful jerk in the lobby of the theater, then I walked out, and tried to ignore his whining while I drove him home. Until he made up a very convenient story, saying that his A1C and sugar numbers were really good lately so his doctor reduced his meds and only wanted him to check his sugar in the morning and before bed. The thing is, his girlfriend had gone with him to his last appointment, and was able to disprove every word he said. I was still fuming from earlier, so I swore and yelled at him again. He got upset, and said that I didn't need to swear at him, and I told him liars don't deserve respect.\n\n....\n\nI feel badly for reacting so poorly, but I do feel justified for yelling at him because this is a constant problem with him, and yelling is the only thing that he takes seriously.",

      "description": "Hi guys I’m in college (f21) and the school i’m currently going to wasn’t what I expected so I applied to transfer to other schools late last year. I told as few people as possible because I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it in case I don’t get in and have to stay in this school. i’m living with three other girls and one of them I told because she’s like my older sister and i’m the closest go her and the other had a friend who had transferred out of the same school so i wanted to ask her friend for advice. the third one is an international student and there’s not really a reason I didn’t tell her but as I said I just wanted the least people to know as possible. with this third one, she gets homesick a lot and is always saying how her parents want her to come back home and she wants to transfer. a few days ago we were all together and one of my housemates who knew about me wanting to transfer asked me where I applied. the third housemate didn’t know anything and she kept saying “why didn’t you tell me? if you did i would’ve transferred too.” and I explained myself and apologized. I know I fucked up by not telling her and i’m glad it came out now rather than at the end of the school year when she would’ve actually hated me. I gave her some space and then talked to her and told her let’s talk things out I know it’s my fault and I don’t want there to be any tension. she said it’s fine and just repeated that if I had told her then she could transfer too and I thought everything was fine. we got a little drunk about two days ago but she was sober and drunk me brought it up again and she said things like “I can’t believe anything you say anymore.” and “I have trust issues now” and when I told her the schools were nearby and she can come visit or vice versa she said “i’m not going to visit you or invite you here” not gonna lie that hurt and I haven’t talked to her all day. I talked about it with another friend who brought up the point that yeah I fucked up but I didn’t stop her from transferring herself; how was I suppose to know I was the only person keeping her here? that logic made sense to me and honestly now i’m mad because I know I can’t fix what I did and I know I fucked up but she’s mad at me because she can’t transfer anymore?? how is that on me?? please give me some perspective I have so much other shit going on in my life right now i’m so overwhelmed ",

      "title": "AITA for “being triggered” by my boyfriend setting rules for my pregnancy weight gain?",
      "description": "Hello, long time follower, first time poster. So my boyfriend knows that I have a lot of body image issues. I am a little overweight, and I struggle with it. I’ve tried a myriad of different diet plans and exercise routines over the years, but nothing seems to stick. My boyfriend and I both really want to have a big family, and I’ve confided in him before that I can’t wait to have a baby, but the thought of being pregnant gives me a lot of anxiety because I don’t want to gain weight.\n\nSo last night he calls me out of the blue, and says he just wanted to say “I love you so much, and I can’t wait to marry you and have babies with you because you’ll make such a wonderful mother...” and my heart is so full hearing this, and then he goes “...but I can’t have you go and ballooning up each pregnancy. You’ll be 300 pounds by the time we’re done having kids, and I’m not having sex with no big fat slob” and when I pushed back, he doubled down and set me guidelines of how much weight I am allowed to gain each pregnancy, and that after birth, I’ll get one month to “relax”, then two months to get back to my pre-baby weight, and then I’ll get pregnant again, and repeat.  \n\nSo we fought about it. I said he was being insensitive, and treating me like a sex-and-baby machine and not a human being. He tried to say he was only worried about my health (his dad died when he was a child from diabetes) and I was okay with that argument, but in trying to explain his health concerns, he kept digressing into such gems as: \nI’m not gonna stay married to you if i don’t get hard looking at you\nDo you want our kids to be embarrassed by you? Do you want them to say “daddy, can you drop us off as school instead of mommy, because the other kids make fun of the way mommy waddles?\nI love you, but my love is conditional, and the condition is not gaining more than 30 pounds. When the scale hits 31, I’m signing the divorce papers.\nIf you told me not to weigh 300 lbs, I’d say “sure thing, babe, you’re right” but the fact that you won’t agree to it means that you must actually WANT to weigh 300 lbs, so if that’s your goal, good luck but we’re breaking up if that’s what you want\nDo you want our kids to be fat fucks too? You want to give them insulin shots in kindergarten because you and the babies sit on the couch all day feeding each other Ding Dongs? \n\nWe’ve had a lot of fights in the past around my boyfriend being blunt by nature, and me being overly sensitive by nature, but I really think he was out of line. And the whole conversation came out of nowhere, which really makes me feel like my weight is something that was just eating away at him and he had to get it off his chest. But should I just let it go if he insists he’s only worried about my health? With his family history, it’s understandable that he’d worry about obesity and have a bit of a complex around it, and he is insisting that he’s not asking for too much so I should just agree to it since gaining minimal weight is also what I want, so I shouldn’t fight him and we just be in agreement?\n\n",

      "title": "WIBTA If I told my friend/coworker I don’t think she’s ready to have a dog?",
      "description": "Today my friend told me that last night she bought a puppy, a 7 week old cocker spaniel to be exact. My friend  is in her late 30s, has never owned a dog, lives alone in her condo (no yard) and is one of the most particular and picky people I know. For example, one night she declined a dinner invitation before a show we were going to because she had taken out a chicken breast to thaw.  Last week we were going to go out to dinner but the restaurant was closed.  She wouldn’t choose another restaurant because that is where she wanted to go, she asked to reschedule for the following week instead. I know these are food related pickiness but I feel like it’s a representation of her personality overall.   I have also witnessed her have a meltdown when little things have not gone exactly as planned.   She’s a good person overall, but just very set in her ways. \n\nWe’ve bonded over our single life in our 30s,  and I will admit I am a crazy dog lady.  I have a 2.5 year old dog that is essentially the best thing in my life.  She told me that last night she was on a puppy spotting website, saw this dog, and bought it because it was cute and $300 off.  (My #adoptdontshop heart hurt to hear that). She also told me that she sees how much joy and happiness my dog brings me so she “wanted to try it out”. She also “joked” that she can always gets rid of it.   I “joked” back that if she did that I would never speak to her again.  \n\nI tried to explain how much work puppies are and asked her what her plans were when the dog flew in from Missouri (we live in Mass). She told me that she isn’t planning on taking any time off when she gets the puppy because “her puppy will be tough and she doesn’t want to waste her vacation time” which means her 9 week old dog (it’s coming in two weeks) will be spending a minimum of 9.5 hours in his crate between work and her commute.  I don’t leave my adult dog home for 9.5 hours a day, let alone a puppy.  \n\n\nI am extremely anxious for the well being of this puppy.  Like I said above, she doesn’t have a yard and I’m not even sure she understands what goes into potty training a puppy. Puppies ruin things, they eat things they aren’t supposed to, they can cost a lot of money between the vet, food, heartworm/flea treatments, training, potentially day care.  I just think she sees the “it’s cute” side and not the “did you really just throw up your own poop on my bed at 3am” side and I just don’t see it working out well for either of them. So, would I be the asshole if I told her she’s not ready for a puppy?\n\nAlso to add, she’s met my dog and was so nervous around her and yelled when my dog barked.  It takes time for my dog to warm up to new people and the barking terrified her.   She truly has no experience with dogs. ",

      "description": "Some girl in our senior class is planning a cookout at a lake for senior skip day in a couple of weeks. She’s rented pavilions , will provide some of the food (you have to bring something if you want to attend) and is doing most of the planning for it along with her friends. This is not a school sanctioned activity it is something that she is personally doing \n\nShe’s invited a majority of the senior class (our class is pretty small with only 102 seniors) with the exception of some kids. Most of these kids not invited are kids she considers unpopular or just doesn’t like. One boy came up to me and said he and his friends would like to attend and asked for the location of the cookout. He told me that he, along with a lot of other kids didn’t get invitations to attend. I told him he’d have to ask her if they could go but he asked me if I could ask on their behalf since I know her better. \n\nThey kept on asking me for the location and time and I kept telling them to ask her. They kept bothering me until I told them that she didn’t like them and didn’t want them there or else they would’ve been invited. I told them I didn’t feel like making a case for them because she’d just get mad and tell me that since she planned it she decides who goes and who doesn’t. I feel like she has a point it’s not right for me to force her to invite people she doesn’t want. I wanted to avoid an argument I knew I was going to lose so I just let them get excluded AITA?",

      "description": "(Possibly NSFW?)\nSo, the backstory for this is that my best friend of a few years recently became really good friends with this guy. He's a bit older than us and he's been dating this girl who's another friend of ours since last summer. They're very in love and they're very different people. He's always been known as sort of a manwhore and she's a very conservative Christian girl. He began going to church for her and changing his demeanor completely. He called down and began to seem much more mature.\n\nHe was very aware of the fact that she was saving herself for marriage before they began dating and knew exactly what he was getting himself into. Recently, he started texting my best friend and flirting more than he ever had. He's always been one to make dirty jokes and flirt with even his male friends, but this was very different than the usual jokes. He sent her a list of everything he found attractive about her and at some point he mentioned how pent up he was because his girlfriend won't do anything more than kiss him.\n\nEventually he brought up the idea of sending each other pictures and messing around. She told me all of this very soon after it happened and seemed to feel no regret about any of it. She wanted to continue everything with him and apparently fell in love with him because of this. He sent her random dick pics and said \"Maybe one day, baby,\" in response to her wanting to have actual sex with him if they ever \"accidentally\" ended up alone.\n\nFast forward to a few days later and he texted her that he regretted the whole thing and they could never do it again. He said he loved his girlfriend and didn't want to lose her. She was extremely upset about this because she believed he loved her back and wasn't happy with who he was dating. I thought she was being insane because he was finally coming to his senses about how what they did was wrong and she still didn't see it. I didn't tell her any of this.\n\nThat day, I was talking to a very close friend of mine (I've known him for 9 years) and was ranting about how I wasn't sure if I should talk to the guy, who I'm sort of close with, about how he needs to come clean or tell his girlfriend myself. The next day I found out when my best friend began screaming at me that my close friend had accidentally let the whole situation slip to someone who told the guy's girlfriend himself.\n\nThe girlfriend is a very nice girl, she hasn't even broken up with her boyfriend because she believes he won't do it again, but she's obviously destroyed by the whole situation. She broke down and told a bunch of people that I was the one who let it out and now there's a whole hoard of friends of that couple and of my best friend who are pissed at me for telling someone.\n\nMy best friend thinks this is the worst thing that's ever happened to her because the guy won't talk to her anymore and she \"just wants to be friends\" now. She thinks the only thing she did wrong was telling me, not helping a guy cheat on his girlfriend.\n\nAITA for getting involved?\n\nTL;DR: I told someone about a mutual friend cheating on his girlfriend while trying to figure how to help, and now everyone we know has heard about it.",

      "description": " Sorry for the throwaway but this story has many identifying details as it is and he knows I reddit. \n\nFor the first two months after our baby was born I've been sleeping on the living room couch with the baby on a bassinet, or sometimes we'd fall asleep breastfeeding on the recliner, not ideal but oh well. Our room is on the second floor and baby would wake up every 30 mins to 2 hours to feed or just because. He was colicky. I didn't want to wake everyone in the house and the kitchen is next to the living room so it was easy to make him a quick bottle. I barely got any sleep but otherwise this seemed to work out. \n\nNow that the baby sleeps longer at night we went back upstairs to sleep. If he wakes up in the room and starts fussing I just BF him until he passes out again a while later. Problem is he's not a quiet eater, he grunts, moans, slurps, and flails occasionally so his dad wakes up. I do take him downstairs if he starts crying. His father refuses to wear the earplugs he would use during my late pregnancy when I started snoring. He also refuses to be the one to sleep on the couch. He doesn't want to go to bed before 1 or 2am, and when I usually leave the room he can sleep for at least 5 more hours since he doesn't get up early either. \n\nMy husband doesn't have a very demanding job, or one where a sleep deprived (which I don't believe he is) mess up could cost someone's life so I don't think it's necessary that I break my back on the couch for however many months this lasts. He says since I stay home all day with the baby I should sleep when baby sleeps so I can stay up all night on the couch with him. This is a joke cause he barely naps during the day now. \n\nHusband is now threatening to stop going to work if I don't let him sleep. That if the roles were reversed he would do anything to let me sleep. It's my family's business and granted he doesn't get paid much but he knows he can \"afford\" this because we live with my parents rent free. Although my dad might kick him out if he starts missing work on top of everything. I told him I don't appreciate the blackmail. If that's the right word for it.\n\nI am absolutely mortified. My parents are saying he's the asshole for demanding I sleep on the couch. They say they slept together all the time when we were born because that's what partners do, but I'm inclined to believe they'd be on my side so I want some outside perspective to see if I'm the one who's being unreasonable. Thanks.",

She has known him for about 7 years. I didn’t really know him just that they were friends. Eventually we all started playing video games together over the internet. He seemed cool enough. I however am incredibly socially awkward when meeting new people and was not overly friendly with him. \n\nEventually my gf and I started dating and after a while he interrogated me to make sure I “was good enough.” I laughed it off and was fine with it. Then though he calls her and tells her he likes her. He claimed to me this was just a prank to see what she said. I didn’t care, we can all take jokes. But he’s kept it up. It’s been 4 weeks now and he won’t let it rest. He is constantly made “jokes” about it and told friends it’s true. \n\nI became very uncomfortable around him and almost cold towards him. Normally I could over this but he also makes derogatory comments about me, such as when I said “69 damage headshot! Nice” as a joke. But then he replies with “With your right hand forever”\n\nTL;DR My gf’s best friends has made “jokes” about wanting to date her and other stuff.

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend of about 3 1/2 years moved in together about 8 months ago. We each pay part of the bills and my parents pay for our rent while I'm in school. About two weeks ago we went to the store and bought groceries, among those groceries was some snap pea crisps, and we split the cost. If you don't know what they are, they are basically a healthier chip replacement that come in significantly smaller bags than typical bags of chips (closer to the personal sized bag of chips than a full bag).\n\nAnyway, over the last two weeks I have been snacking on the snap peas to avoid eating something less healthy while I play games. After barely more than a week and a half I had polished off a bag (again the bags don't hold much), and then yesterday my girlfriend comes home from school and asks where they are/are there any left, to which I answered honestly, no. She was annoyed that I had eaten them all, claiming that I should have left some for her seeing as she helped pay for them and wanted some too. \n\nWhile I did know that she wanted some, we usually end up needing groceries about every week-two weeks since we have sworn off eating out/fast food and prefer not to buy too much at once to avoid things going bad. She says that it is my job to leave some for her which I would typically agree with, but I had waited almost two weeks and didn't want to have to eat something less healthy for a snack, so I figured if she wanted some she would've eaten some. \n\nShe leaves stuff to go bad or get forgotten often. There is a Tupperware of mac and cheese in the fridge that is growing limbs as I type this that I was told not to eat. I also have been told to leave an avocado or two in the fridge so she can have some, which I started doing and have now thrown out many brown mushy avocados that I would've been very happy to eat. We have argued about this a few times in the months we have lived together and figured it was finally time to get an outside opinion on it. She wants me to mention that the roads are bad here (snow/ice because we live in Idaho) which is why she doesn't want to stop on her way home from work to get stuff for herself which I told her to do since she will sometimes go weeks/months not wanting to eat something and then all of a sudden want that thing with no warning to me that I should leave it available for her even though 9 times out of 10 that thing will go bad or get pushed to the back of the pantry and get stale.\n\ntl;dr\n\nI got in trouble for finishing a bag of chips without waiting for my girlfriend to decide she wants some even though she lets stuff go bad every other time I wait.",

We both drive late 90s vehicles and only have liability. We decided not to file a report because then work would get involved and it since my car would be deemed totalled insurance would most likely want it in exchange for a few hundred bucks. I'm only worried about replacing the bumper and lights because I have to since it holds my license plate in place, the back door I dont care about. Right now its looking like I'm going to be paying 500-700 hundred between replacement and someone to put it on correctly. His truck has absolutely no damage just paint from my car.

      "description": "This is going to be a LONG one guys.\n\n\nI'm a 22 year old who runs a small poke (think subway with rice and fish). I have no shift leads or assistant managers. I solely run the store on my own. I do scheduling / ordering / deliver to storage / work on the line and kitchen / etc. I work 6 days a week 95% of the time on my own. I'd say per hour average, 8-10 hours. I get paid 2300$ before taxes. I do not get compensated for my gas or any of the times I do a good job.\n\n\nThere is a general manager, but he helps out by basically ordering what I send to him. I cannot trust him to deliver my cucumbers on time much less help me maintain the store. When I come back from my day off, everything is a mess. He doesn’t restock the store nor even tell me what’s missing. \n\n\nI went from a regular weekend line worker to a manager in about 2 years. I still work in the FOH and know the kitchen very well. I understand how it feels to be a worker and I feel like that's an important part of being a manager. I am friendly with all of them and while I do have my favorites / friends, I do not treat them (work wise) any differently. If I get one of my friend employee coffee, I will offer to buy everyone who is working some (out of my own pocket)\n\n\nI've never been a manager before. I know I'm too nice. I don't really do write-ups and I always tell them about how I felt before I was the manager. I never want to take advantage of my employees. All of them are college students and I want them to do better than me in life. \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have my faults. I come in late on days sometimes because of partying. Schedule is getting made later than usual. I leave at 4 sometimes because I cannot handle being at the store. I know about my employees's personal life, vice versa.\n\n\nWe recently sold an older restaurant and now my GM wants to take away my salary and pay me 12$ hourly. He said it would only few months. He said he would basically be me until they found another store for him to run. \n\n\nI don’t even care about the pay, but it is a slap to the face because I’ve been putting in so much work be basically demoted. He wants me to continue doing what I do now for an hourly rate. It’s difficult to calculate and  they would lose more money by putting me on hourly. \n\n\nPlus, if I’m basically not the manager, why should I do all the extra stuff that I do? \n\n\nI just don’t want to let anyone down. I feel like a horrible manager right now and this decision is making me feel like I’m not enough. \n\n\nSo guys, AITA for basically wanting to quit? \n\n\nAny advice would really help me out. Thank you for reading this. ",

      "title": "WIBTA if I choose not to attend a rafting trip with coworkers because I don't want to bring my spouse along?",
      "description": "For context, I work at a company with about 80 employees, and a coworker is planning an overnight white-water rafting trip that's first-come-first-serve with spots for about 24 people (invite is extended to all coworkers and their plus ones).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was really looking forward to attending the trip (and initially RSVP'd yes) prior to hearing that our plus ones were invited (I really like hanging out with my coworkers!). When I first heard about the trip, I told my spouse I had planned on attending. The first thing they asked me was if plus ones were invited. I told them I wasn't sure, but I'd let them know when I found out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward three weeks later and I now know plus ones are invited. I just revoked my RSVP and I feel like I'm going to crush my spouse's feelings for doing so, since it seemed like they wanted to come on this trip (it was the first thing they brought up when I told them about the trip).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to attend the trip without my spouse if other SOs are invited, because my spouse may think I'm excluding them for bad reasons (e.g., they're going to think I don't want to hang out with them, or I want to be away from them, etc.). I went on an overnight trip with my coworkers from a previous company two years ago and my spouse was having some trust-issues regarding a certain coworker who I'm good friends with, and I don't want him to have these issues again with my new set of coworkers, so I'd rather just have none of us attend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thought-process / reasoning below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I'd feel bad if my spouse took a spot that a coworker could have taken\\*\\*. I know, I know, other people are inviting their SOs so I shouldn't feel bad, but all of the other plus ones being invited are people that we (coworkers) know. They come out to our company's happy hours, holiday parties, etc. Even though I've been at the company longer than a lot of the people inviting their spouses, not many people coming on the trip have ever met my spouse. My spouse doesn't attend our events mainly due to noise-anxiety (tinnitus-related) &amp; the fact that we live a bit farther from the office than the others (30-40 minute drive).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf my spouse knew the rest of my coworkers, I would feel comfortable bringing them along. Yes, this would be a great opportunity for them to get to meet my coworkers, but it's also a trip with a limited number of spots. Our happy hours and events happen frequently, do not have a guest-capacity, and some (the monthly ones) are tolerable as far as noise-anxiety and loudness are concerned (according to my spouse).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I'm also afraid of putting my spouse into an uncomfortable position regarding tinnitus and sleeping\\*\\*. This is less of a concern because my spouse is an adult and clearly if they knew there was a risk they wouldn't attend the trip, but I still can't help but worry a bit. My spouse struggles to sleep at night due to their tinnitus. They often sit in the kitchen with the faucet running in order to fall asleep. My spouse wouldn't have that option in a shared cabin with coworkers. They've struggled with sleeping on overnight trips in the past  and it would be difficult if they felt trapped on this overnight trip that's about 4 hours away from home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR- My spouse was looking forward to attending an overnight trip with myself, my coworkers, and their SOs. WIBTA if I decide that neither of us will be attending the trip?\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "When my parents got divorced, I stayed with my mother. I was 16 at the time and we didn't get along very well, she was (and still is) very religious (like long skirt wearing religious) and she would judge me for everything. She was never violent to me, but I just didn't feel loved by her and remember being a very very sad teenager. Now, despite being very religious, she had a lover while she was still married to my dad (omg, what a sinner she was!) and when my dad left, this lover would come home all the time. He was (still is) even worse than my mother, he was very dishonest but yet he would judge people for their sins constantly, not even people in their church liked this man. Since I was very disatisfied with all this, one day while my mother was at work, I took my bed and my stuff and went to live with my father's mother. I know this was not the right way to do so, but I was a teenager and I was (still am) afraid of confrontations. That morning was the last day I saw her (or maybe the day before, I don't remember). She never spoke to me again and she went on to tell my family I ran away like a thief. This deeply hurt me and I had no interest in speaking to her either.\n\nA little after that, her relationship with this lover got stronger and her relation with everyone in her family got weaker. Apparently this man convinced my mother to act dishonestly about an inheritance, but I don't know the details quite well and I am afraid to ask. That caused her complete isolation from everyone in the family, except with her mother. It was through her mother that she tried a to regain contact with me a couple of times during the past year or so, but it has been very long and I didn't want to deal with that and I am doing great without her. I am now much more happy because I always felt that she didn't like me as a person, so I was able to do my own life without caring too much about her. \n\nToday I am 26 and we have not spoken or seen eachother since that day when I left, 10 years ago. I honestly have not missed her at all. My grandma and my uncle gave me everything I needed to succeed in life and thanks to that I have a wonderful offer to study in another country for 5 years. I have told everyone in my family, but my mother. I guess her mother will tell her. But everyone has been asking me if I don't plan on talking to her before leaving. All they say is: \"but she is your mom\". Well yes, but we don't have any sort of relationship. They got me thinking about it. I honestly care so little about her that it didn't even cross my mind to say goodbye to her. From what my grandma says, I do cross her mind. So WIBTA if I don't say goodbye to this person?",

I told my friend that it's true and I can see that there's some pros and cons with living at home and moving out on your own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him that I need to respect his parents' decision even though I didn't agree with his mom's perspective that moving out would mean that he's going lose money. He's 26 years old and he doesn't even know how to make coffee or tea. I think it's overdue that he needs to grow up and be on his own. But nonetheless, I didn't want to move out if his mom didn't want him to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a week, I go over to his place to hang out. I saw his mom and I told her that I didn't want to upset her and I told my friend that I wanted to respect her decision. She then proceeds to tell me that I am an asshole for putting ideas in him and that I am only wanted to move out because I don't like my current place right now. At work, she then proceeds to text me all of these messages continuing accusing me of giving my friend bad ideas and being greedy and that I was putting the blame on my friend now by saying that I wanted him to talk her and respect her ideas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, I would've saved like $150 a month but screw this drama. I am not planning to go on with this because I realized that if anything happens to her son then I automatically get the blame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Suggested my friend to move out with me. His mother accuse me of giving him idea, me being greedy, and that I am making it looks like it was her son's idea by telling him to ask his mom for permission.",

      "description": "My partner and I have known each other for a year, and we have been in a relationship for approximately half that time period. He is a very sweet dude, a huge fan of Star Wars and superheroes. I myself am a bit of a geek person who enjoys watching anime, reading Manga and building model kits. We both come from a similar background and meet up every weekend.\n\nDuring December of 2018, there was a marriage in our family which required a huge number of guests to stay over at our place. I had informed my partner around a month in advance, and he wasn't very happy with the idea of us not being able to meet up during that time (believe me, I was the designated driver and the youngest so I am responsible for alot of things). My So believes that I should be striking a 'balance' between family and this relationship and that he makes the extra effort to make time for me. I told him I appreciated it and that I would try to do the same, but there would be days like these where communication would become tumultuous and that he should be mentally prepared for it. \n\nFast forward to this last weekend, where now we have another new pair of guests to look after. Between December and now, my SO were meeting up every weekend. I had informed him in January that this family was going to be staying with us, yet still just yesterday he exploded over text about how I was not giving him time. We are both working professionals, and my job usually involves staying in late after hours and sometimes even working over weekends. I had offered to join him for a spot of tea if the day allowed me, and that he should confirm with me before finalizing. During that time, my family broke out into an incredibly serious conversation and had me share my opinions and suggestions too. My SO attempted to contact me but IW as away from phone. The conversation was so intense that I forgot about the tea spot. When I checked my phone back, there were 8 missed calls and and a long message about giving him 'false hope' and how that hurt him.\n\nI apologized for the lack of communication and asked for his understanding, yet still I was bombarded with how I wasn't taking out the time for him. I normally don't let things like these bother me, but isn't this kind of borderline obsessive? We both live in a country where LGBTQ rights do no exist and there is a possibility of being persecuted should we ever be found out. We've been making plans to move abroad and even opened a joint account in preparation for the future.\n\nTl:dr partner and I have gotten into an argument about how 'false hope' is hurting him, despite us hanging regularly over both days of the weekends. I have tried to get his understanding but he has made me feel like this is my fault. AITA for wanting to balance my responsibilities with family and my SO in a culture where this kind of a relationship is considered taboo?",

      "description": "So basically, yesterday was a huge day for our store... it was insanely busy, and a perfect time to hit some quotas for us. However, we were struggling a lot to hit the quota of our memberships.\n\nTo break it down, my store has two different types of memberships; a lower price, and a higher price (the higher price allows for additional savings, free shipping, money to be earned back by the member, and so forth). If our quota for selling the more expensive memberships isn't hit, we get talked to about our tactics, and we have to sell EVEN MORE. Plus, we don't get a bonus or anything like that at the end of the year. \n\nSo yesterday, we were doing awful for these types of memberships. So my manager, in the last hour of the store being open, tells a couple of the cashiers, and a supervisor, to offer it to the members for FREE. That's right... free. These memberships cost upwards of $100 a year. And he is giving it to them for free.\n\nSo I questioned him on it. I asked him \"why are you giving them away? And how are you going to make up for the money lost for them?\" \n\nAnd he responded with:\n\n\"Well we need to hit our quota, and I'll just write them through the system. I'll do a CFT so they won't show up in the money system for the store.\" \n\nSo basically, he is hiding that he is giving these away to members from the boss. These $100 memberships that he is just GIVING AWAY. Besides that, he has been known to pull other shady things (treating customers like shit, reselling used product so that they can add additional warranties and promotions onto the product, giving promotions to his friends and coding them for other areas of the store so that they get more money/hours, stuff like that). \n\nI just feel like he is being super shady and greedy, because he knows that if the quota isn't hit... he gets a talking to.\n\nWIBTA if I went to a higher up with these concerns? I feel my manager has some shady practices, and is hiding them from the boss. ",

      "description": "I became friends with a girl and long story short we became pretty close and I opened up to her about things I hadn't told anyone about. This was a hard time for both of us. She had just gone through an abortion, I was in an all around bad place but the biggest thing is that my best friend went to prison for possession of certain illegal images (which completely floored me). But things were okay until recently a mutual friend and I started talking and things started adding up.\n\nThings I had opened up to her about: immigration, my anorexia, my (now ex) friend going prison... I found out that she had been complaining about me talking about them. I felt so betrayed because it was the first time I really opened up to anyone and some of the comments she made hurt me very deeply. \n\nSo I stopped talking to her. I sort of hope she would reach out to me but she never did. Recently a friend tried to reconcile with her, and this girl apologised to her, and I wasn't hoping to be friends again but I have to see her around so I was hoping to at least be civil.\n\nAt the time I stopped talking to her, so did her best friend (for comments made about her), and her boyfriend of 3 years (which I only found out a while later). I was still not talking to her on the anniversary of her abortion. I apologised for the way I handled the situation but she wouldn't accept it. She feels that the things she said were not hurtful enough to warrant my not speaking to her. I'm extremely hurt by comments she's made minimising the struggles I've been going through and that she now continues to minimise. But was I wrong to stop speaking to her at this time?",

      "description": "This is the first time I'm posting a story on Reddit so forgive me if i do anything wrong.\n\nContext: This story has a long set up so tl;dr at the end. it involves me, my ex friend Kim and her friend James but these aren’t their real names and the ending takes place a few years ago. I also tried to post this a little earlier but I passed the word limit so a few details were left out\n\nSo Kim and I met each other in high school around the ninth grade, but Kim was friends with James since the seventh grade. James was the type of guy to date girls then break up with them when he was bored and always compare Kim negatively to the girl he's currently only really using Kim for attention when he's single which she’d put up with because she had a crush on him since they met. Kim is usually a pretty strong willed person and wouldn't take that kind of treatment from anyone else, so I'd try to tell her he's not being a genuine friend to her, granted I had a crush on Kim at the time but I was also trying to look out for her as a friend, and Kim would always ignore what I said \n\nCut to a few years later Kim and I graduated from High school and James I'm pretty sure failed his final exam. At this point Kim and I became really close friends but I suffering a case of r/niceguy syndrome especially since I confessed to Kim earlier and she rejected me, along with seeing my current crush date a seemingly asshole. Anyways Kim tried to \"prank\" me twice already, once saying she made out with James and another saying she sent him nudes and regrets it so I'd freak out knowing what kind of person he is and try to console her, which she'd get a kick out of. \n\nKim and I eventually started growing a bit distant since we’re in different colleges and she started replacing me as her closest guy friend, which made me kinda jealous. Then one day Kim tried to pull one of her pranks on me saying this time she started dating James, but I remembered her past tries so this time I attempted to call her out on it, but with me being a little salty about falling for it the last two times and being a little sad that we're growing apart lead me to respond along the lines of \"OK but when and yes WHEN he breaks your heart I will not be there to console you this time i will not even be a shoulder to cry on, instead ill laugh and i say i told you so when you realize you should've believed me when i said he wasn't a good person\". So I was thinking I'd successfully called her out and now waiting for the \"Aw shucks you got me\" she instead said \"Wow.... I was trying to share something serious with you but this is how you react, James was always right about you\" and then blocked me on all social media. \n\nTl;dr my friend tried to tell me she was dating an asshole from our past and I thought it was a prank since she tried some of a similar style on me before. then I aggressively called her out on it thinking it wasn't serious.\n\nSo am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'm expecting to be an a-hole because it seems VERY petty and I feel like I need to hear it from someone else to validate my feelings.\n\nA bit of background: I'm staying at her house until I get enough money saved up to move out and do whatever it is I want to do. We get along exceptionally well, me and the family, and I'm basically a second son to them. I help out whenever possible (biggest thing I'm doing for them is assisting her husband with renovations at his MIL's house, which hes been needing for a good while) and do my best to be a good house guest. From my conversations with them, they enjoy having me over. Specifically relevant to this story, however, is that they bred a dog for me 3 years ago and so I live with them and my dog, who they assist in caring for along with 2 other dogs.\n\nSo I got my dog a $180 pet bed. Why? He tears up any and all beds he gets EXCEPT this one because the cover is durable. So I get a text this morning from her saying that the covers zipper got stuck and she decided to still put it down on the ground, leading to my dog eating a good chunk of the corner. I didnt read the bit about the corner getting chewed, so I was absolutely chill about it, figured it wasnt a problem, and called the pet bed sellers who sent me the warranty email and told me that the cover should be replaceable, all they need is a picture. I go downstairs to get a pic and I notice that the bed is tore up...still usable, just that the corner is now opened up and missing a bit of volume. I call my friends mom up and ask her what happened and she tells me that she decided to put the bed on the ground knowing that the zipper was broken because \"it was so cold I had to\". The thing that frustrates me about this is that she knows my dog chews up all the beds we get him (she had gotten 2 beds recently from Costco and I had gotten him one from Target before getting the new one...all of them he tore up) and she also knows that the beds cover was the SOLE reason why this bed has survived for so long without damage, so to just set it down knowing that it was busted and hoping for the best, in my opinion, was stupid. My other reason for being upset is that we didnt split the bill on this: I paid for the entirety of that bed. I dont have much money as it is (currently looking for work, just recently got let go from the military), but she was going to go out and buy another bed that was guaranteed to get eaten up, so I wanted to eat that cost for her and just get a bed I know he wont destroy, so to hear her be so nonchalant about the damage (her reasoning is that the warranty should cover the bed as well, when we dont know if it will) was pretty upsetting when I made a decision basically for both of us (she insists on taking care of the dog alongside me, however I can see someone pointing out that I'm an asshole for even having her help me care for my dog at all). \n\nI really dont have much room to be upset, considering they feed me and provide me shelter and are very loving and caring towards me, but I still FEEL like I have some room to be upset, as this was, frankly, a very stupidly easy to avoid situation that she could have seen from a mile away, and my ideal resolution is to have a conversation about it and plan out what to do if it happens again. Nothing crazy. But I was pretty frustrated talking to her about it over the phone and I just wanna know...AITA for being upset over this, and regardless of whether I am or am not, what would be the best way of addressing this problem?\n\nTL;DR: Friends mom, who I'm living with pro bono, accidentally facilitated events to occur that wound up having my $180 pet bed get eaten up by my dog when the situation was completely avoidable and I'm upset about it.",

But that's not the problem.\n\nAnyways, to make a long story short, we got into a argument about addressing my what I considered my brothers racism. She said that she wasn't racist, and I replied with \"If you aren't racist, why dont you stop your kid from saying racist stuff?\"\n\nShe then yelled at me for criticizing her style, and saying I wasn't grateful, enough, when she was a kid, she would've been beaten, etc...\n\nAnyways, was I in the wrong for criticizing my mom?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We both have children, from previous marriages, and have both been divorced 5+ years. \n \n On thanks giving, we had my parents and her parents over for dinner. I did the majority of the cooking, as she did the cleaning and getting our children put together. I tried to clean as many dishes, as possible, as I cooked. After dinner I finished cleaning all the dishes, as well as the counters, stove, table and swept the floor ( Single dad instincts kicked in). \n\nAbout 2 hours later the Mrs decided she was going to bake cookies with the kids. I retired to the bedroom for a shower as they decided it was \"them\" time. Afterwards I went into the kitchen and saw dishes piled out of sink. I said nothing thinking she would handle it. The pile remained for two days and I was met with an attitude and a cold shoulder for not addressing is. AITA? ",

      "description": "I'm 30, and have always been called hard-hearted and cruel by my family. I hate drama and don't hesitate in telling off a family member if they're being stupid, which is why I've removed myself from them for the most part and live quite far away. I also am extremely empathetic and very sensitive to situations. Sorry this will be very long.\n\nBackground: My mother is a nagging narcissist who insists on having her way. My dad is a lifelong addict who has recently relapsed. They are codependent and emotionally and verbally abusive to each other.\n\nMy mother would call me nearly daily to unload on me and vent all her frustrations with my dad. Arguments, sex life, I heard it all, and none of it positive. I don't make much money, but offered to pay for therapy and couples therapy for my parents, and rehab for my dad. I was shot down every time. Their solution was to \"pray to God\" for help, and buy a timeshare (that they can't afford) against my advice. The whole of last year I reluctantly acted as a pseudo-therapist and mediator between my parents. It was awful.\n\nThis past Christmas I traveled to my hometown, and my dad showed up drunk and high. The next day my mom screamed at him so much he admitted himself into the hospital for suicidal and self-harming thoughts. I encouraged him to go, and my mom blames him and me for the extra medical bills.  Lately my dad will leave for a couple of days at a time when they have arguments, and my mom will call me to vent.  She visited me a few weeks ago for the first time in three years on extremely short notice, and it came out that he told her to get out. She told him she would visit me then, and he told her to \"stay there\". She did go back a couple of days later. \n\nA few days after she returned, she was venting to me yet again, and I just couldn't take it anymore. Told her they needed to divorce because they were toxic for each other. She hung up on me. The next morning my dad was blowing up my phone about how selfish and uncaring I was for telling them to get a divorce. How he had raised me to be a good person and couldn't believe I was being so self-centered. That I was ignorant of how marriages work because I haven't been married for decades like them. I didn't back down, but since then have cut nearly all contact with my parents, and refuse to initiate any. My mother has called me twice since, but the calls lasted less than five minutes when she realized I refused to talk. \n\nAm I the asshole for interfering in my parents' relationship? For telling them to get a divorce? For punishing them with no contact? Part of me says no, but the rest says I'm being petty about the whole situation. ",

      "description": "Hello all,\nThe other day I was at a Barnes and Nobles book store looking through their stuff. While glancing in the young adult section, I found a book that intrigued me (\"Fault in our Stars\", YES I've never read it before). I decided to take it and sit by a nearby chair and flip through a couple of the pages. I was pretty much hooked within the first couple of pages, and I ended up reading a few chapters. I spent about 10-15 minutes reading this book, which I'll admit, is a bit long. After this, a cashier walked over to me and said, \"Sir, are you going to buy this book? I've seen you over here for fifteen minutes\". I replied that I was considering purchasing the book and that I didn't read a ton of it. She said that if I didn't buy the book I would have to leave, and she seemed annoyed by my presence. I didn't talk back to her at all and I wasn't annoyed at her. People typically never get annoyed at me for talking normally to them, so I feel as if she was annoyed that I didn't buy the book after 10 minutes. I later put the book away and bought another book, and left without saying anything else.\n\ntl;dr : I read an unpurchased book for 10 minutes at a store and the cashier got annoyed at me. I later put it away and got a different book.\n\nSorry for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile.",

      "description": "I am a 16 yo Male living with a grandparent. For the past few months since we moved to a new town, my grandmother( and only legal guardian) has been growing more and more strict about every facet of my existence. It's not nearly as bad as some kids for sure, but there's one thing in particular that's been starting to bother me more and more. \nSo for some starting context, I moved in with my grandparents at 7. My grandpa passed when I was 13, and we moved from our old house in August. In the new town, I have not been to a single place that is over a 4 mile round trip. My grandmother lets me use her extra car to drive around when I need to.\nSo I'm not allowed to go to the house of friends whom the grandmother hasn't met the parents of. This caused a problem when I'm September I said I was going to one friends house, but we ended up at another friend's house that was closer to school. It was about a mile closer so not that much. My grandma apparently drove by the friend's house that I was supposed to be at, didn't see her car, and immediately reported it as stolen because I want where she expected. \nSince this fun incident, which is not the actual issue I have, I have had to take pictures of the odometer off the car and show them to her everytime I go somewhere. If I forget I can't drive for a week, even if I could just go out and take the picture then and there. I'm also not allowed to see friends. \nThis leads to me just leaving the car at the school so she thinks I'm there at some made up school event or practice and leaving with a friend. I forgot to take a picture today and had a 15 minute argument in which I defended my lack of memory while getting called an idiot. I always have trouble remembering things so this is fair. \nUsually I would just deal with having to be driven to school but I have a gift for my girlfriend hidden in the backseat of the car that the grandma doesn't know exists and would absolutely flip her shit if she found it. So I somehow convinced her to let me drive this week. \nSo my grandmother never treated my older sister anything like this while she was my age, or even while she was 2 years younger than i am. She was allowed to do whatever and my grandma was fully aware she was doing much worse things than me. She was a rebel in school and I'm just a borderline autistic nerd. \nThe question is, am I the asshole for wanting to be able to go out the front door and not be watched and screamed at for every unexpected thing?\ntl:dr I'm a kid i want some peace and to be able to leave the house occasionally without being followed everywhere.

      "description": "Ok so I’ve been with “A” for six years. Love him, we click on all levels, this is the relationship I want for the rest of my life. His parents are another story.\n\nHis parents don’t like me, are mean and weird, and only really talk to me when they want me to pick up their younger children or dog sit. His mom has given me passive aggressive compliments and his dad is creepy and rude. They once told him to get out of their house at 21 if he’s going to have a video game in his room. His dad wouldn’t tell him his SSN to get off his phone bill so A could buy his own. His dad told the customer service lady but not his own son. Not my problem, I don’t interact with them much, he’s not too happy with them either.\n\nA has gone to boot camp and as such we don’t talk to him except through snail mail. My dad, who was in the same branch of the military, knows someone there who can tell us really tiny tidbits and they’re very few in between. Like “he just did x”, for example. Most people do not get this with their loved one. It’s very lucky and I’m sure some people would pay money to hear what’s going on with their kids or siblings at this time. \n\nI’ve been relaying the bits to his mom because we’ve been together so long I feel it’s just something I should do. I had a tentative date of his graduation. I texted her this info. My little brother just finished boot camp last year from the same branch, so I know the drill for it. I told her he’ll graduate this day, the tickets have to be picked up a day early, no exceptions. That night we might be able to take him to dinner. Keyword “might”. And then the rest of the weekend depends on all his stuff being processed and it’s not up to him. His date can change for any amount of reasons, especially if he fails something. I’ve been in an all military family for 20 years now. My dad was an instructor at the boot camp my boyfriend is at now. All my cousins go in. When their parents can’t fly up we’d go since we lived 20 minutes away. Graduation is something I’ve had to sit through a bunch of times, same thing each time. \n\nWell despite having my dad been an instructor there for 5 years, history of going for family, and being told it by someone working in that area and actively seeing him every few days, his mom starts in with an attitude. His parents always think they are in the right. They always think they’re better than others and know more. I told her all the info about graduation then she hits me with a “Well I’m going to ask his recruiter to get the CORRECT information”. His recruiter does not know anything about what’s going on. I told her he has no contact with him. Her reply: “Well I’d feel better hearing it from someone else other than you.” Ok. \n\nI’m not telling her anything anymore. Am I the asshole? Should I keep telling her about her son or just let her dangle? ",

We are both students and in our early twenties.\n\nAfter I knew him for a while I told him how I really want to watch Veronica Mars with him someday as this is my favourite show. I found this show when I was about  13/14 and I was going through a tough time and didn't really have any friends. I still now watch this show whenever I feel really down as it makes me feel better. And I always joke that I took a lot of Veronica's personality.\n\nHe did not seem like a huge fan of the idea but said that he would watch it with me someday.\n\nNow last week I wasn't feeling great and my bf is on holiday rn so I couldn't turn to him, instead I turned on Veronica Mars. We also just finished watching the good place so Kristen Bell was fresh in my mind and I was in the mood for a rewatch. I sent him an Instagram message joking about how I was watching it now that he was gone bc he never wants to. I sent him another clip just because it was funny and I thought he would enjoy it. \n\nSince then when he asks me what I'm up to I have responded honestly and so a few times the answer was watching Veronica Mars. \n\nThen tonight I was watching it again and I expressed over text that I wanted to watch this with him bc I really do think he would like it. He sent me a gif as reply and this started a gif conversation where I sent him Veronica Mars GIFs and he sent me random ones. He later tells me that he was telling me with the GIFs that he was annoyed, something I didn't pick up on bc we have loads of conversations over GIFs and they are always just jokes, never serious. \n\nHe then tells me he is legit annoyed bc he feels pressured and like I won't leave him alone about it. I will admit that over the last 2 weeks or so I have been very into the show again but I don't see how I can have pressured him. I never forced him to watch it, I mention it occasionally but never make him pick a time or place. He brought up how I turned it on during the summer, which is a low blow bc it was literally my birthday and he was sick and told me to watch whatever I wanted. I have seen his favourite show a million times, it's literally what he turns on for background noise. And I don't mind as I quite like it, but not even nearly as much as him. And he won't even give my favourite show the chance...\n\nAITA for being hurt that he wont give it a chance?\n\n",

      "description": "This is came out longer than expected, sorry for that. There's a TL;DR at the end.\n\n\n\nI'm 22, studying on uni, and I sometimes make use of a lasercutter in my mom's store to make some extra money.\n\n\n\nA friend of mine commissioned me a lasercut clock with a special shape. I designed the model, cut it, paint it, adapted the clock hands, and decorated it with vinyl wrap. Because I didn't spend much and I know this guy I decided to charge 15 bucks for it.\n\n\n\nHe was in town only for the night I was delivering the model, and we decided to meet at 8:00pm on my mom's store. Anyways I wanted to go to the movies with my girlfriend and the movie theater we wanted to go to was about an hour away. It wasn't doable for the movie if I went out after 8.\n\n\n\nThere's this woman who works on my mom's store. She's around 31 and I've known her for at least 8 years, let's call her Karen. She said she had to fix some paperwork and she would go out at 7:30.\n\n\n\nI ask Karen if she could hand my friend the clock at 7:30 and she was okay with it, so I texted my friend and asked if he could make it for 7:20pm and he said no problem.\n\n\n\nHappy with my genius-level of arrangements I drive away into the sunset to pick up my girlfriend and go and watch our movie. \n\n\n\nThen suddenly as I'm waiting for my girlfriend to come out of her house Karen texts me with a question: \"How much did you agree to charge for the clock?\", I thought she just wanted to be sure so I answered $15.\n\nShe then joked that the guy gave her $20 and she was texting me to tell me that she's keeping $5 haha... eh.. was it a joke? Yeah it had to be, right?\n\n\n\nHere comes the AITA part\n\n\n\nI go pick up my money next day and she just hands me $15 and I feel some relief and say:\n\n\n\n\"So you were joking, huh? About the other $5\"\n\n\n\nShe then told \"Oh! You want them too!?\" in a sarcastic tone and then proceeded to take them out of her pocket and put them in my hand.\n\nShe told me that she had plenty of those and that she didn't need my money but that I shouldn't expect any favours from her in the future.\n\n\n\nI was gobsmacked, I didn't know if she was playing or not. I remained calm and said we could leave the money there and she could later ask my mom and whatever she told her she would do. I knew my mom would know that it was my money. But she said she had already told my mom about \"the tip\" she received.\n\n\n\nI was actually getting angry, I was charging $15 for my work and she wanted $5 just for being there after we agreed there wasn't any payment for her favour. \n\n\n\nI swear I tried to discuss the situation, she just said in a really sarcastic voice that I could take it and leave. So I just did that.\n\n\n\nI would have given her the 5 bucks if she told me she needed them or something or we could have split them, but she decided to keep them and just hand me $15. I felt I was rewarding her pettiness if I didn't take the money.\n\n\n\nLater that night I mention the situation to my dad and he said that I fucked up and that I should have left her the money and that my mom would have given the $5 to me. Then when my mom got into the conversation she also said that I screwed up and that Karen was a very valuable employee that was doing me a favour.\n\n\n\nI met up with my friend a week later or so and he said that the money wasn't a tip of any kind.\n\n\n\nAITA for taking the money?\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Ask a friend for a favour and she decided to keep extra money I got paid. I took it from her and my parents said I was in the wrong.\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my sister’s fiancée constantly sleeping over our house?",
      "description": "I’m 19f, sister is 27f, fiancée is 30m. My sister and I live with our parents. Other things to know: I have really awful sleeping problems. Right now it’s a good period but still if I am woken up by people a few times before actually falling asleep I do not sleep for hours. I have work and school so this causes trouble sometimes where I cannot sleep for over 24 hours. Even if I sleep well I’m tired by getting up early and coming home late.\n\nMy future BIL moved to our city a few weeks ago to be closer to my sister. He stayed the first couple of nights here before settling into his apartment, which was fine, I didn’t really care, was just excited to see a new chapter for them. Then his apartment had a few issues so he stayed longer, which I totally was for. Then he went to sleep over there after the problems were fixed. \n\nHowever, he will come over for hours at night (which is fine) until it creeps into midnight, then one AM, and he then stays the night with no one really knowing except my sister, because “his apartment is just so far” and poor thing can’t drive so far this late. Staying over means usually staying until late afternoon of the next day too.\n\nProblems with this:\n1. My sister and future BIL talk so loudly I can’t sleep and have to suffer through the next day\n2. I am repeatedly told to be quiet because he is sleeping in the guest room. I don’t even know he’s there. It’s a minor annoyance but I just want to be able to grumpily wake up for school in peace without my mom angrily telling me to open my closet door more quietly.\n3. I want my privacy! I want to lounge in comfy clothes and eat and chill (my parents are very strict with guests so I cannot eat unhealthy/any more than a small portion in front of them and have to appear polished and well dressed). I want to go downstairs in my PJs when I can barely open my eyes before school to stuff my face with cereal but then there is just my future BIL lounging down there. \n4. They keep fighting so I keep having the awesome opportunity to be around their awkward silences and tense arguments\n\nSo I come home after a long ass day of work, and then I hear he’s staying over again. This is the THIRD TIME THIS WEEK he is staying over without a good reason and I confronted my sister by saying, “Really? You can’t keep just letting him stay over. I can’t sleep with you two talking until one AM.” She got so pissed and just snapped at me and said she can’t even talk to me. She said it’s okay because our mom allows it. My mom has been whining to me about all of this too but she was quiet and just said it’s okay. My dad is pissed off about him staying over so much. None of us want this. They’re all scared to argue though except me and now I’m wondering if I am the asshole. I mean, I don’t want to tell the guy he ISN’T welcome in our house because he just moved here and that’s awful. I just want my sister to stop offering/allowing it. \n",

We've pretty much been hanging out sometimes when neither of us have classes, about half the time with her friend there too. We started taking naps together while cuddling because she asked too. Also kissing, because she asked me to kiss her. However, we talked about it and both agreed we don't want a relationship yet.\n\nAnyway, there's a girl I talked to a few times on instagram but we never met. She sent me a message a few days ago saying something like \"we should meet up\" and I was like sure. We decided on today.\n\nWe met on campus and talked for about an hour before she had to go. This was not a date or anything, purely a friendly thing. But then the girl I've been seeing texts me very angrily saying she say me talking to some girl. She said mean things like \"fuck you\" and \"how could you do this to me\". I tried to explain myself but she was very mad.\n\nSo AITA?",

Work at an upscale restaurant, Friday's are usually huge. Some little nerd I've never heard of came in and caused some commotion with the Insta-crowd and I guess he's sort of locally famous rapper who's appeared on really big name tracks. He and his \"posse\" get sat in my section and proceeded to run me ragged. They sent food back, ordered compicated special requests every time I stopped by which cost me precious time on a slammed night. The rapper himself sent his food back...3 times and wanted me to pour his water from Voss bottles he had brought in that I had to open in front of him \"for his safety.\"  They were such a pain, I had to drop most of my section costing me serious money. They had an automatic 18% but with a bill a little over $1200, it was still light for a typical Friday. \n\nDude made a huge deal of handing me one of those fake black cards that are made to look like an Amex black but really it's just a low limit mc/visa. I ran it...declined...ran it again and it was declined. I didn't want to run it a third time but seriously saw a way to get a shot in so I went back to his table and loudly got his attention and said so his whole grouo could hear me \"sir, your card was declined do you have another you'd like me to try?\" He looked like he was going to cry then got angry and whipped out $1200 in cash and said \"we out!\" and told my manager that none of them would ever eat with us again. I got screwed. \n\nManager is pissed at me and said I should have let him handle the card situation. Maybe he's right and I barely made enough to cover the cost of getting to work.

      "description": "I host a private Teamspeak server which is an application for talking to other people over the internet (VOIP) like Skype or Discord that my \\~15 friends and I have used for communication while playing video games or collaborate on homework or just hang out for several years now. I've known one the longest, Cameron (not real name). Over the years, he never really changed and I saw him as immature, but didn't ever really mind letting him tag along with whatever we were doing or playing). Many more years go by and he becomes more of a mutual acquaintance than a friend and he only ever really talks to a couple of people every once in a while on the server. When the game PUBG came out, only 3 of us want to play it, but the game is best with 4 people, so someone suggests we invite Cameron, who also likes the game. After a few weeks of playing it, we had one game where he got particularly mad at me for dying stupidly at the very end which gave the win to the other remaining team. I sarcastically apologized and said that it was only one round and he should chill. The next round, the three non-Camerons of us are playing seriously because everything is lining up well this round, while he decides to go off and play stupidly to spite me. Partially for comedic effect and partially because I was annoyed, I shot him, then proceeded to hold him on the edge of being revived so that neither he nor I could accomplish anything. He gets really pissed and starts cursing, screaming, and raging about it, so I temporarily mute him in the server to spare our ears. He immediately messages me through Steam threatening to leak my IP address on the dark web. I didn't take this threat lightly because we know that he buys drugs and does shit in Tor all the time, so I decide to ban him from the teamspeak server, block him on Steam, and call my ISP to ask for a new static IP. Everyone else decides that it was warranted and that he was toxic to have around anyways, so they sever ties as well. I didn't really ban him over one outburst that he might have only said in the moment and regretted, but a string of asshole-ish things that he had done leading up to that. Fast forward about a year later and he has maintained friendship with those who still go to the same school via physical contact, and they decide they want to start a playthrough of Civilization 6. They ask if I will allow Cameron back on the server, which I refuse. Most of my friends think that I am too stubborn for holding this grudge and that I should just let it go, as I don't even have to talk to him, and Cameron thinks that I am just abusing my power as the only admin of my server to be a dictator and not allow him back. I won't unban him because I have a feeling that he has built some plan to get back at me (I promise I'm not paranoid, he's just like that). So, AITA for not unbanning him?",

      "description": "  \n\nThrowaway account as you never know who’s reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter my daughter was born she slept in her own room in her crib just fine for the first 2 years. Once she figured out how to climb out of her crib the trouble began. We tried taking her back into her room when she would come to ours. Countless hours of back and forth in the middle of the night. She eventually stopped coming into the bedroom and we would just find her curled up outside our door sleeping in the morning. No matter what we did, she just wouldn’t stay in her room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe made the mistake of just letting her sleep in our bed so we could all get sleep at night. I figured she would grow out of it and would eventually sleep in her own bed. While about a month of this was all we could take. She would gravitate to my side of a king size bed and be all over me in the night. I snore, my wife can take that, but it would just wake the kid up and scare her and make her cry. Once again for the sake of everyone getting sleep, I moved to the guest bedroom, once again with the hopes that this to shall pass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward 3 years and well I’m still in the guest bedroom. I feel like my wife and child have developed a codependency on sleeping in the same room and same bed. My wife doesn’t seem to think it’s a priority to get the kid to her own bed and doesn’t want to listen to her cry all night. They naturally have a strong bond between them and that’s great! I don’t begrudge that at all, but it really has affected bedtime. My wife has to go to bed when the kid goes to bed and on the weekends we can’t just send the kid to bed at a normal time and hang out because the kid has to have her mom to go to sleep. Not to mention we have no adult alone time so to speak because, well, we are never alone! I don’t want to rock the boat or cause any bad feelings in the relationship, but I miss my bed and my alone time with my wife!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I forced the issue and demanded we transition our kid to her own bed, or should I just ride this out to keep the peace? I’m not looking for my wife to be the asshole because she is a wonderful wife and mom.",

      "description": "Sometimes my group of friends will have a collective same opinion I disagree with or ask for my input and I’ll be in disagreement. I can’t just simply disagree and state my opinion though they think I’m always an argumentative person. We get along for the most part but over the last five-ten years my taste in music, my idea of fun, and how I spend my time has grown away from the rest of the pack so to speak. We’re all cool people and I enjoy their company, but it’s annoying when they think I’m being an argumentative person just because I think differently about things than they do. So am I the asshole for giving my opinion about things often? I try not to let it linger on when it’s conflicting more so just throw it out there. It’s typically about which music artist is better, what movies are good or bad, what cars are nice, just small things that are completely subjective.",

      "description": "So my ex and I broke up about 5 months ago. It was a volatile relationship and the last 8 months were long distance. We had some issues between us, there was physical abuse on my part and I feel emotional abuse on her part. I think we were both relieved when it was over. I met someone like a week after and we started dating. My ex was not ok with this and we ended up cutting contact completely instead of remaining friends. I was the one that initiated by saying that we shouldn't talk for a bit. Our last conversation she told me that she would tell me that she would tell me if she never wanted to hear from me again, she wouldn't block me, and she wouldn't just simply ghost. She was going to go to therapy to deal with the trauma from the relationship and figure out what she wanted from me first. However, she immediately blocked me from everything on social media. I didn't think much of it, thinking that she was just purging and trying to move on. She got me banned from some local clubs by telling people about the physical abuse, saying she didn't feel comfortable having me around. When my new girlfriend reached out to her saying how having me banned was distressing and how we could all move forward together, she blocked her as well. \n\nAs the months went by, things got more serious with my current girlfriend and I might be leaving the city soon. I wanted her to know that I might be leaving so she could still have a chance to check in with me if she wanted. I just want to be able to help her move on. I also don't know anything about her, I don't know if she's just hiding from me or not, and I am slightly worried about her. I sent her a message on whatsapp and told her that I didn't want to scare or distress her, that I might be leaving the city soon and I am here if she wants to check in. She blocked me. I found out I was blocked everywhere. I sent another message to an old google voice number saying that I would appreciate a check in and she blocked me from there as well. I started to get so worried about her. I drove all the way to her parents house to ask them about her and see if I can help her in any way. Her dad threw me out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then sent a message to my friend, telling him that I had the audacity to show up at her parents house and that if I try to contact her or her family again, she would call the cops. She implied that I was stalking her. I'm not! I was just trying to help her and I was just trying to figure out how to move forward. She promised she wasn't going to ghost and she wouldn't block me and she has. She also promised she would tell me if she never wanted to hear from me again and she didn't. She just sent a message to my friend warning me to never get close. Am I the asshole here??",

I thought it was mutual at the time, but looking back I likely wanted it a little more than she did. Long story short everything was going fine and then it wasn't. She moved out without seeing me and we haven't really talked much since. This is by her design as I really wanted to try to work things out after. She doesn't want any communication with me. I get it, we're broken up.  One of the last things she sent me was the great line of \"I love you, I just love me more\". Got it. Done deal. That was a while back and we haven't spoken in months now. We broke up back in June, so I'm just now getting to the point where I'm feeling not as depressed. \n\nThen comes my cell phone plan, that we all entered into before we broke up. My sister, cousin, ex and myself. Well, in order to clear the mental connection with her, I asked the account holder (cousin) to have her removed from the plan. Take into account this is a discount plan and is saving us all a decent amount of money. I have been met with resistance with both family members that I have approached. They think I'm being petty and childish and so on. I actually got called a 'manbaby'. Am I the assholes for wanting to have my ex off the same phone plan as me?? Am I being irrational here?!

      "title": "AITA For Breaking up with My SO?",
      "description": "A little background. I am 23 and my boyfriend just turned 21. We have known each other since August and become official since Thanksgiving. \nI recently got a full ride scholarship to a University of California campus in my home state so I moved away from my SO at the beginning of January.\nThe long distance has been very hard for both of us. The problems start because I feel he is all talk and his actions don’t reflect his words so I broke up with him. For example:\n\n-I have been the one driving the 6 hours each way to see him, several times now because he plays CC basketball and says he can’t get away on the weekends Because of games.\n\n- I’ve tried to end it because I don’t like the long distance and he says that we just have to wait to see if any 4 year schools accept him on a basketball scholarship and if not then he will maybe move to California \n\n- I told him he had to make the effort for us to see each other because I felt I had been making all of the effort, and he agreed he wanted to get a job to make money so we could split plane tickets to see each other. I made him a resume which got him a job interview for a job making $20/hr not back for a college kid in Arizona. He turned it down because he said it conflicted with basketball season, which he told me only lasts until the end of Feb.\n\n- I came out this weekend to see him and drove the 6 hours each way. I wanted some clarity as to what we were doing. He has the option of working for a certain company and getting his degree online for his top school choice for free and be in California with me- all he has to do is choose that option if he wants it, He said he wanted a serious long term relationship and a life with me, but yet we lived in different states so I wanted to understand how he imagined that would happen. Talking about it over the phone didn’t seem to be the most appropriate so I booked and paid for the hotel rooms myself and drove out on Friday after my midterm. We spent hours having sex in the hotel Friday night, Saturday morning at 8am I bought us both breakfast and he left for a basketball game far away and didn’t get back until 2 a.m Sunday morning the next morning so we didn’t see each other all Saturday.\n\n- Sunday he said his mom needed help with something so I didn’t see him until 5pm on Sunday when he picked me up from my hotel. At one point I asked to download a flight app for him on his phone and he got really edgy about me holding his phone, he didn’t want me on it so I put it down and we went to church, then back to my hotel where we had sex. Almost immediately after sex he said he had to go because his mom wanted him home so he could get a good nights sleep for the interview in the morning. I got upset and told him we haven’t seen each other in 2 months, he was going to leave right after sex because his mom told him to? I told him why not just sleep at the hotel and wake up at 7a.m and he would still have 3 full hours to drive the 10 minutes to his house to get changed for the interview at 10. After some arguing he begrudgingly stayed. Turned the light off and slept with his back to me the whole night. \n\nWhen I txtd him this morning after he left asking how the interview went, that is when he said he turned down the job because of his basketball schedule, the job that was supposed to be so he could earn money so that we could not go 2 months at a time without seeing each other . \n\nI’ve tried to leave the relationship because even though I love him and would give the world to him, he tells me how much he loves me but to me it seems like his actions do everything but show me that. We haven’t seen each other in 2 months and to me it feels like he has prioritized everything else over me this weekend.  He says he wants a life with and a future with me and that he loves me more than anything, but I just feel like he is stringing me along. He knows how much I love him. I only have eyes for him. And it hurts my heart everyday to be apart from him and I’m not the type of person who can be in a long distance relationship. I only want what’s best for him but I came out this weekend for clarity and so he could make a decision, either we move forward together and we let things go amicably. He just won’t make a decision and keeps telling me he will think about it. \n\nI just felt so second rate and last priority to him this whole weekend. I sent him a txt saying I wasn’t feeling so comfortable about this situation after he told me he turned down the job and that I was thinking I was going to go home today instead of tomorrow, he chose basketball practice over coming to see me, so I started my drive back to California and sent him a txt saying that I wasn’t comfortable with how I was being treated in the situation and I was unhappy in the long distance and if he wanted to make a decision to come out and be with me then great but if not that I couldn’t do long distance because it hurts emotionally for me to do so and that I was leaving and that I couldn’t be in this relationship.\n\nI don’t give my love to people and I just finished this 6-7 hour drive home through the desert feeling tired and exhausted emotionally and otherwise. I just want to know, Am I the asshole for breaking up with him or am I over reacting? ",

      "title": "AITA for telling my Girlfriends daughter, that her dad kinda sucks because he and his new family went to Disneyland without her?",
      "description": "I’m currently in a relationship with my Gf of 4 years, and she has a daughter (we’ll call Susie) who is 7 years old, who we share with her Dad every other week. Recently we found out through the new Gf of the dad (through social media, mutual friend who makes shirts) that they had “Family shirts” done for a Disneyland trip. So we ask Susie, “why didn’t you tell us you were going to Disneyland?” out of genuine curiosity. And she looks at us confused has no idea what we’re talking about. \n\nFast forward a month or so, we pick up Susie from school on the beginning of our week, and she’s going on about how much fun she had at her Grandmas house. During a school week. We then found out that the Dad, new GF, and 2 sons, had gone off on a Disneyland trip with out his ACTUAL daughter, during the school week, and couldn’t even let us have her a day early, (but that’s not that important). The 2 sons, are from the new GFs previous relationships, no way related to the Dad. We ask Susie why didn’t they take her too. And she says because then it would be an odd number and not everyone can go on the ride at the same time (or some bull crap excuse like that). \n\nSometime during our week we’re in the car talking about this situation amongst my GF and I. Then Susie shouts, “they said they’re going to bring me back a gift to make up for it, and they’re going to take me next time”. I then say, “whether they bring you a gift or not, they still both suck for not taking you”. So then when she goes back on her week, she ends up telling her dad what I said, and honestly. I didn’t give a shit because I meant it. This if screwed up in my book, how do you exclude a little girl from a trip to Freaking DISNEYLAND. \n\nNext time we meet to exchange Susie, the dad walks up to my window and says I better keep my F****** mouth shut and stop telling my daughter bad things about him, and threatens me, and on and on. Granted, this is the first time I’ve ever said anything about the dad, because drama isn’t my thing. So I get out of the car, (because I ain’t no bitch and am size-ably larger than him, just in case if had to hold my own ground, ididnt want to have to defend myself from the seat of my car) and just explained I wasn’t lying, and asked him man to man, in front of his daughter and my Gf, “Why couldn’t Susie go with you guys to Disneyland?” He had a couple of excuses. That it was his new GFs sons first time going, and they wanted it to be about them, not that my GFs daughter couldn’t go, but because she wouldn’t have enjoyed it as much as someone who hasn’t been there before. He then also said, because she had already been there with us that she didn’t need to go this time (we had taken my GFs daughter to Disney land, the 3 of us, about 2 years ago). He then keeps going back to how he never talks bad about me (even though they do) and that he’s a good dad and that he doesn’t suck. The exchange never escalated past some mild shouting, and both parties left. \n\nMy GF is annoyed that the situation didn’t need to happen, but does agree what the Dad and New GF did wasn’t okay. So, AITA for being honest in front of the daughter and saying her dad and “step mom” sucked. \n\nTLDR: Child gets excluded from Disney land family trip (Dad, Step mom, and step moms sons go, but not his biological daughter) I tell her that her Dad and Step mom suck. Dad attempts to confront me in person, but then put him on the spotlight in front of daughter, and explains that they have another trip planned for her in the future. Also says since we’ve already taken her to Disneyland, it’s okay she misses this trip. Dad claims I’m manipulating daughter, but have never said anything about Dad before. Gf gets annoyed, but agrees with me. ",

      "description": "My apartment has assigned parking in an underground garage. Being that space is at a premium in such a garage, obviously the spaces and aisles are a little tight.\n\nRecently 2 people have been parking in the aisles of the garage. I know they're residents of the apartment complex because I recognize the vehicles. They used to park in assigned spaces and I see them walk to their apartment occasionally, but since each 4BR apartment in the building has only 3 assigned parking spaces it means one person has to park on the street if all 4 residents have cars.\n\nThe way they're parking in the aisles, combined with how the concrete support pillars are arranged, is making it difficult for me to park in my assigned spot. If I have to borrow a truck from my parents (a common occurrence) and they're parked there, it becomes impossible for me to actually get into the spot. It's made worse by the fact that both of the vehicles illegally parked are quite large (one Chevy Suburban, one Ford F150).\n\n[Here's a shitty MS paint diagram showing why/how it's difficult for me to get to my parking spot when they're parked there](https://i.imgur.com/pVl6khU.png)\n\nI've talked with the neighbors when I saw them park there and asked them to not do that since it makes it difficult for me to get into my spot. I've also left notes under the windshield on occasions where I've borrowed a truck and been unable to park in my spot. Whenever I do this they stop parking there for about a week before continuing to park there as per usual. \n\nIn the last notes I left (one on each car) I mentioned that I would be calling the towing company the next time they parked illegally because it was making it impossible to park in the spot I pay for. They didn't park there for several weeks this time, but I came back this afternoon to both of them parking in these spots again. Before I make the call, I just want to make sure I'm not out of line since they both technically live here even if they're parking illegally inside the garage (signs posted everywhere stating that unauthorized vehicles will be towed).\n\nSo, WIBTA if I called the towing company on these vehicles that can't seem to understand why they shouldn't be parking there?",

      "description": "I (female/26) am visiting my brother on vacation for the weekend with a female friend of mine. We're staying in the living room at his apartment with his room about 10 feet from us. My brother does not have a girlfriend and has been open about his sex life/hookups. It's our last night here and he turns to us around 9pm and says I'm have a \"friend\" over tonight. Which clearly means a girl.\n\nSo, I then look at him and then freak the fuck out. \"NO YOU'RE NOT. So you can hook up while my friend and I are in the room next to you?\" He tells me they're not going to do anything and I'm assuming things, then calls me a fucking bitch for saying that and that I can't tell him who he's having over. First of all what male aged ~24 has a sleepover with a girl he's not dating and it's PG. He's told us she's his booty call for god sake.\n\nI know I didn't handle it well. I was in complete shock and disgusted. I'm his sister! WTF! \n\nShe's not coming over anymore thank god... But there's hostility in the air now at the apt. Whatever. \n\nDo dudes think this is ok?\nAm I the asshole for telling him who he can't have someone over in his own house or is that just plain wrong?",

      "description": "My boyfriend has this friend, let's call him Steve. Steve has always given me weird vibes and I tend to avoid him at get togethers. He never did anything blatantly inappropriate, but I noticed him staring at me a lot and he made off color jokes at times that were never bad enough to get upset about but were enough to give me a bad feeling.\n\nI'm a waitress and Steve came into my restaurant with a few of my boyfriend's other friends. They sat in my section so I waited on them and was very cheerful and friendly, as waitresses do. Steve was chattier than normal and I talked to him a bit. After a little of this, I felt like Steve was getting a bit too friendly so I distanced myself for the rest of the meal.\n\nMy boyfriend sat me down that night and said, \"Is there anything you need to tell me?\" I was confused, he brought up lunch and I was like, \"yeah, some of your friends came in, why?\" This goes back and forth and then he tells me that Steve said I was flirting with him. Obviously I denied it because I wasn't flirting, I was just chatting with him and left when I felt like HE was flirting. My boyfriend told me he needed space to process, so I left.\n\nI was really upset with Steve and with my boyfriend for the accusations, and was contemplating ending the relationship over it. My boyfriend calls a few days later and tells me he talked to his other friends and confirmed I wasn't flirting with Steve. I got really pissed and told him that if he didn't trust me enough to believe me initially and then needed to verify my actions with his friends, I didn't want to be with him anymore. He said he was just doing \"trust but verify\" and that he did trust me and this was a dumb reason to break up.\n\nPart of me feels like I did the right thing, but the other part feels guilty about flushing 6 months over this.

      "title": "AITA for pushing hard on my friend who's addicted to pot",
      "description": "Let's call my friend Jack. \nJack is avg smart. Jack's been in a bit of depression. Jack didn't look for a job for 2 years. He was smoking up every day. Sometime 40 bong shots in a day. (Yes jacks friends have had some competition) but then Jack moved in with me. Jack reduced consumption, but was always high. Minimum 4-7 a day. Jack started borrowing money. After a month or two I decided that I shouldn't encourage his behaviour and asked for the money back. I knew he didn't have, but I still did push him to give him some pressure to start looking for a job. Jack started peddling to make ends meet. I wasn't happy with his decision. In two years Jack applied to 12 places and complained that he's doing his best and I am entitled and Rich and lucky that's why I got a job. I told Jack 4 months in advance I am moving because I spent a lot of time and money on travelling. \nI stopped being nice to him. Well I would always be hard on him. I found out Jack had some terrible stories from his childhood. Assault cases. I didn't know how to help him that way. I am not a very empathetic person. I know pain, but I cannot resonate and help someone else. I'm not a psychiatric. I told jack to get professional help. Jack doesn't believe in docs or probably just a miser or maybe just low on cash. \nI finally move on but Jack threw a big tantrum. A huge fight. He broke a couple of doors also in the process. And told I'm the A for leaving him,  ditching him. And that he gave up a lot to stay here. And I explained to him, that I didn't ask him to stay here jobless. I even encouraged him to move cities or countries to get the job he should take. But I was the A. \nAfter sometime Jack resumed talking to me. I was still helping him out, during this time I was starting a business with another friend of mine. It was my friends setup and I stayed as a consultant. I called in Jack as he didn't have a job and told him he can join. He took out whatever came in and I told him once we start making money the salary will be fixed and we can keep the rest for the company. It was running out of my friends proprietorship. I thought he could start a career. I told him he has to be professional and cannot bring in friendship and ego into this. It was my expertise the work he was involved in, and mostly he had to check with me on a lot of the work. He made this into a boss vs employee thing and started mentally harassing me always. He would always put me in a tight spot saying friendship boss etc etc. We have had a couple of fights and it was a tense environment. I was still a consultant. He was primarily working and I gave him leads and told him how to get the job done. Jack said he wants to move abroad so I start thinking of alternatives. After the salary thing kicked in he started asking for equity. Considering all the uncertainties I told him I'll give 5% and that eventually we can bring in more. Moreover I wanted a CTO who can build the tech platform and etc. His skill was helping in building sales,  I agree this is important because I also did that many times. But I couldn't weigh it out and with his uncertainties I wasn't sure of giving out too much equity early on. \nI understand that someone can be upset. It's a low no, but I was ready to listen to and work out something. He flipped it, he threatened me on the phone said he'll demolish the office and became very unstable and I lost it. I also stood my ground and told him to go 🖕. He was still in and out of pot during this whole time. He would be high at work most times. The times he wasn't he would fight with me. \nI eventually decided not to go ahead with the idea and stepped out. Jack came back and worked for another 4 months with 0 productivity. And emptied all the money. I took out only enough to run the company. Anyway I step down and go back into other things. \nHe still blames me for everything and has cut me off. I am okay with it, but he plays the victim card so much I don't know If I was the A or not. \nNow he blames his addiction on me, his career on me,  his financial problems on me. Maybe he won't tell this to our common friends but I am sure he believes this. \nHe still owes me money for the last two years which he said he won't return. \n\n",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nThis happened a few years ago but still feel guilty. Basically what happened is that I was in college and was driving to get some food. After I got my food I saw a stray dog wondering around in the parking lot. It was winter and super cold out so I felt really bad for the dog. I tried to approach and it came to me and was very friendly/knew commands. It also looked like it was in bad shape, hadn't eaten in a while and fur was mangy. I figured it used to be someone's pet but they had abandoned it. \n\nI didn't want to leave it in the cold so I got it to jump I'm my car and I was going to try to find a place for it. It's important to note at this point that I was in college and living in a no-pets allowed apartment. I had hoped to sneak the dog in but either management saw me or someone in the building saw and told management. I got a knock on my door about an hour later asking if I had an animal. The dog was in the living room (within sight of me answering the door) so I couldn't lie. They told me I had to get rid of it immediately, but after I explained the situation they said I had 3 days to get rid of it or I could be evicted. This was on Thursday they said they check back on Monday. \n\nThe first things I did was go out and buy some dog food, and a collar/leash. I gave the dog food, water and a bath. Then I called everyone I could think of to find this dog a place. Some more important details are needed here. As I said I was in college, but my college was far from home (far enough that I couldn't feasible get the dog back to my hometown). Also I mentioned earlier it was in winter, specifically Christmas break when most students go home/aren't on campus (I was one of the few exceptions).\n\n I called everyone I knew but no one was on campus or close by that could get the dog, I couldn't take it home, it was a small town that didn't have a local animal shelter. I called the campus police as I had been told they take care of stray dogs on campus, but they told me the only remove dogs that are a potential threat and it was against university policy to take in strays so of they caught me with a dog o could potentially get in trouble. Also call animal shelters from the next towns over but repeatedly got no response or was told they couldn't take the dog. I went on Facebook and found and animal care group 2 hours away that said they could take him, however they messaged me back the next day and said they couldn't take him until next week. I told them I HAD to drop the dog off by Monday but they said that was a no-go. I didn't help that this happened over a weekend when a lot of places were closed. Including the Vet so I could check to see of they had been chipped.\n\nEventually Monday rolled around and I still didn't have a place so I got the dog back in my car and took him back to where I found him and dropped him off again. My train of thought was I had done everything I could to find it a home, there was no way for me to keep it, at the very least I gave the dog a warm home/food/water for a weekend. \n\nTL;DR Picked up a stray dog, couldn't keep or find him a home so I dropped him off where I found him.",

      "description": "As some background  I grew up with my friend and her husband both of which I was friends with and her husband I once considered my big brother. Hes always been an asshole but everyone just tolerates him. He didnt seem like that great of a husband. To this day they always fight when they go out together with us. And my friend complains they have no sex life and he just beats it off in the bathroom. The few times he has, she complained he was a 6 pump chump. \nLast year my boyfriend's father died after battling cancer and my boyfriend pushed everyone away including me so we went on a brief break while he mourned. My boyfriend and I met with our friend group (at friend and husband's house) for game night every week. After his father's death he stopped showing up. \nOne or two weeks after my boyfriend stopped showing up my friend's husband walked me out to my car like my boyfriend usually would. All my friends had left already and his wife was in the house cleaning up. I dont remember how the conversation started but apparently my friends husband overheard me having a private girl talk with his wife. He suggested that him and his wife were looking for a third. Made this creepy ass comment about how his dick wasn't big but he could do good stuff with it. I was wearing a dress and he reached down and grabbed my upper thigh that was under my dress saying I wasnt as thick as his wife. Said we should talk to his wife and see what she thinks. I just kinda brush it off (hes a general creep and tends to be jokingly touchy with the other girls in our group who also grew up with him). I'm very timid and was creeped out and just wanted to gtfo.\nI get home which was maybe a 20 minute drive and it was like 2am. I already had a text from him saying something more about how I should ask his wife if she would be interested in a three way.I unfortunately forgot my phone charger at their house and texted him saying I needed to stop by the next day to get it as it was my only charger.  He said that he would be there but not his wife. I show up and he leads me upstairs which should of been a red flag as I had never been up there before and my  charger had been downstairs in the kitchen. He leads me to their room and has me close the door, SECOND red flag. I have bad anxiety and at this point I've shut down, deer in the headlights, wtf is going on mode.\nHe pulls back a blanket where a giant dildo and vibrator was on the bed. He apparently had heard me in a private conversation with his wife (who is in one of those pyramid schemes that sell sex toys) that a vibrator she gave me wasn't working. He told me hed give me one of them. Started showing me how the vibrator works (I'm a girl who already owned one I know how they fucking work) and out of nowhere he turns on the vibrator and pressed it to my boobs and then my downstairs. I flinched and stepped back, he did not react. \nHe then proceeds to show me their own personal collection of which he showed several gross clearly uncleaned (he turned it on and flakes flew off I gagged) vibrators and dildos three more of which he pressed against me. He then restrained me with their handcuffs, I was panicked and was just silent and staring. I only snapped out of it when he tried to put a blindfold and gag on me. I snatched my charger and left. I sat crying in my car before I raced out of the culdesac and went to my boyfriends apartment.\nI was killing myself thinking of how I didnt stop him, I was just frozen. My body language was clear I was incredibly uncomfortable but why didnt  I have say anything? This guy who I had seen as a protective big brother that was ruined because he didnt want his wife. He kept asking later if I had asked her and I came to realize he had no plan to ask his wife for a 3-way he wanted it to look like my idea. \nAt a later party all the girls were doing girl talk outside and I nearly puked when my friend was once again complaining about her sex life and mentioned how a long while back they talked about a three way and she angrily stated that theres no way she's sharing him. Then at this Halloween party she nearly killed him when he smacked a girls ass.\nAfter this happened I was caught in a damned if I do, damned if I don't conundrum. On one hand as her friend I should tell her that her husband is a creepy pos but at the same time I know she's full on cheated on him as well. On the other hand if I tell her, they have a daughter. I dont want that little girl having to grow up without a father, my boyfriend and our close friend both had their ex wives take their son's and do everything they could to have them never see them again ( my boyfriend got lucky and is working towards shared custody but his ex-wife is fighting him on it while our friend hasn't seen his son in years). And the more time passes the more I look like an asshole if she finds out. But at the same time I'm also struggling with the fact that someone I saw as a protector took advantage of me as soon as my boyfriend was out of the picture. I'm struggling with all of this...\nAITA for not telling his wife what he did to me?\n\nTL;DR my friends husband touched me sexually as soon as my boyfriend away mourning his father's death. I haven't told his wife out of fear of breaking up their family.",

I yell again \"I'm in the middle of a round of Tetris it will only be another minute or so.\" After about 30 seconds he yells at the top of his lungs \"come here\" since he's being so insistent and I'm about to die I slam down 3 peaces and set down the joy-cons. I come out and he just wanted his water bottle filled... He then lectured me about how I was to addicted to video games and should throw out my switch(that took me 3 months to save up for because 80% of my money gose to bills)  and that it's making me a true millennial. Note my dad  seems to think every thing i do on computers is video games even though i have hydrid college classes I play video games 2 hours a day and do about 5 hours of class work after I get home from classes at 2. He lectures me like this for a while as he berates me and I snapped a bit (this is the 3rd rant he's done like this since new years) and I yelled about how he wouldn't even leave the house to get me tampons when I had ran out of clean pants and was waiting for a loud of londery(the event I am referring to happened when I only had 2 pairs of pants)  he didn't want to leave because football was on and it was about 20 minutes into the game.

I have a very busted iphone 6s (which she busted by dropping btw) and a laptop that isn't in the most mint condition that I would LIKE to have replaced but don't NEED to.\n\nShe tells me I don't need both and that she wants an ipad. At first I thought she was just joking. But she kept pushing it and I was like wait you can't be serious. She was like \"I know you wouldn't anyway cause you don't love me\". I was pretty shocked at this point that she would even say that.\n\nI told her there's absolutely no way I would buy her an ipad and that I'd need to improve some of my very outdated shit I currently have first. Things that I would use for my work. But she kept talking about how she knew girls with boyfriends who lived paycheck to paycheck and bought them a brand new macbook.\n\nI told her pretty clearly that I would first need to buy my mother and father things (just to show them appreciation for all the shit they put up with raising me) before I would even think about buying her an ipad. \n\nI get that she's an art student and an ipad would help up her game. And I know she's been talking about wanting it for quite some time, but this is the first bit of money I've ever had. This is my first job. The fact that she could so boldly just ask for an ipad 8 months into our relationship just left me really sore. Personally I'm thinking about even ending our relationship feeling like she's making it about money.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "I'm seventeen and planning on attending college this fall. I've heard from all my prospective colleges and received nearly all my final financial aid packages. Most offered me decent aid, but not enough to avoid taking on major debt/loans (cheapest college is asking for about $35,000 a year). Aside from their price, however, I can see myself attending any of them happily.\n\nI'm a closeted transgender person from the rural south,  and I'm hoping that college can give me an opportunity to be who I am in an accepting environment. All the out-of-state schools I've been admitted to are very welcoming to LGBT students, with ample accommodations for people like me. They even cover hormone therapy for students on their insurance plans, which is a resource I'll definitely be in need of.\n\nTo appease my parents, I applied to one of their picks, an in-state university (U) that I wasn't planning on attending. My parents, albeit disappointed, were understanding. However, things changed when U offered me a full ride for four years.\n\nNormally, I would be overjoyed, but U has a history of being anti-LGBT, and its location in the deep south doesn't provide much of an escape from campus. U doesn't have student LGBT resources outside a blanket non-discrimination statement and a defunct GSU (gay students union), and from what I've seen from visits and research, \"trannys\" aren't treated very well. Of course, I don't have the complete picture, considering I'm going off of observations from the internet and brief visits, but nonetheless, the contrast between what I've heard about U and the other colleges to is night and day. I was able to find all the aforementioned information about the out-of-state colleges in a few minutes, whereas U's LGBT information is all but hidden. \n\nMy parents, while pushing for me to go to U, insisted they would help cover costs no matter where I went, as they know firsthand how difficult payment can be. I've tried talking them out of it, but they won't hear any of it. I'm incredibly thankful for their generosity, and I feel very guilty for considering options that would require them to pay. I want to talk to them about the issue, but I come from a very traditional Southern Baptist home, so I'm unable to talk to my parents without outing myself/making the situation worse.\n\nI know I'll have to face transphobia wherever I go, but I was hoping college could be a safe space where I could freely express my identity. But, I feel horrible that my parents would pay for college when I have an option to go for free. Would I be an asshole if I turned down the full ride anyway?\n\nTL;DR: Got a full ride to homophobic/transphobic university, am trans and closeted, have other options that are quite expensive, parents insist on helping pay, feel guilty for wanting to decline full ride.

      "description": "A little back ground to the story. We will call the person A. I met A through a mutual friend and after awhile began a friends with benefits situation. We agreed that we could talk to other people but sleep with each other exclusively. We became much closer friends , started spending all our time together and even talked about moving in together. At the time we both had tinders but I let mine go after he told me he saw something more between us. But he continued to use his tinder all the time so I told him he could continue but I didn’t want to be a part of it. He asked me to be his girlfriend and vowed to delete the app. We left for Christmas break and he got sick and had to go to the hospital and since we lived two hours away we argued a lot over when to see each other . We finally got back to school and moved in together . Things were going so well and I was extremely happy with how we were working out. But I began to get suspicious and eventually went through his phone and found all the messages he had been sending while we were on Christmas break on tinder and had even gone on a date while dating me. We stayed together because he vowed to change but I never really trusted him again. He would lie about the people he would go see and I would get extremely upset and he finally broke it off.  We were speaking recently about this and he said had I just been happy and not snooped through the phone we would still be together and I’m the asshole because I went through his phone. His reason was since he had cheated and realized I was the one and was happy I shouldn’t have ever found out because it was none of my business.                                                                         tl:dr ex boyfriend said I was the asshole for going through phone and finding out he was cheating",

I confronted him about it, and he said he's just coping with depression and it's fine. But that threw up more red flags for me.

They grounded him for a long time instead of counseling, and he still won't speak to me 8 months after.

Like, clearly flirting and showing interest. I interrupted and said \"he's married, honey\" and she said \"I have a boyfriend too, I'm just here for the drink\" and I said \"then turn around and ask for the barman\". Then a friend that was with us started talking to her and they left to her table -- she obviously didn't have a boyfriend. I really think I weren't the asshole here but as my husband keeps saying I overreacted and that he's ugly and no one will look at him (bulshit) I just wanted to check.",

      "description": "Hi all \n\nJust a bit of context recently i lost my nan who was the primary carer for my uncle whose 37 and has Down's Syndrome.\n\nIn response to this my mom has had to pick up the pieces and start caring for my uncle, she has always maintained the position that should something ever happen to my Nan she would always take of my uncle. She has since moved into my nan's house and that's that.\n\nIts worth adding that my Mom has two other adult siblings, my aunt and their older brother. Neither of which have expressed any inclination to care for my uncle now or ever and don't want to take any responsibility.\n\nThe problem i have right now is that my mom wants to make me a legal guardian and carer for my uncle should anything happen to her. This would make me responsible for his well being, health, finances etc. Essentially whats expected from a parent looking after a child. \n\nDue to the age of both my mom and my uncle it is inevitable someone will have to care for my uncle after my mom for potentially 20+ years. Thing is she never asked me if this was what i wanted, she just assumed i would care for him no questions asked. When i told her i wanted more time and didn't want to commit to anything just yet, She screamed at me, said i was a selfish \\*\\*\\*\\* and put the phone down on me. I haven't spoken to her in 12 hours or so and i can't stop thinking about it.\n\nOf course i love my uncle to bits and would never want to see him end up in the system/sheltered accommodation but the thought of having to care for an older adult with learning difficulties and health conditions scares me, i'm only 23 and still in uni myself. I had plans to move abroad, go travelling etc. Things i wouldn't be able to do if i had to care for my uncle full time.\n\nI mean if the chips were down and no one else came forward, i would do it. But i would be saying goodbye to my life to care for someone else's.\n\nAITA for not wanting to jump into the fray straight away? Is this something that should be expected of me, even though there are far older members of the family in a better position than me?  Should i accept there are things in life we can't change and this is one of them?",

      "description": "Ok so I'm probably going to over explain this but I feel the context is necessary. Scroll down for the tl;dr. \n\nI work at a bank as a teller and I have this co-worker that sits next to me. Let's call her Lucy. Now my station has a direct line of sight to Lucy's computer as she sits right next to me and our computers are angled towards us in the corner of our stations. I already don't like Lucy because she never does anything at work while expecting everyone else to pick up the slack. She sits and reads the news all day (I know this since I can see what she's doing) and has no additional responsibilities other than helping customers when they come in. She will purposefully ignore people in line while me and my other co-worker are working on our additional duties to where it forces us to help more people than she does. She also constantly leaves her station to go hang out in the break room without telling anyone where she's going. \n\nToday we have a customer come in (while Lucy is missing from her station, again) with a complicated situation that I've never handled before. My manager is in the back helping my other co-worker balance the ATM. I am having to go back and forth repeatedly to the back where my manager is to ask questions about what needs to be done for this customer's account. I am already annoyed because someone should just come up and help me for 2 minutes instead of forcing me to run back and forth while other people are waiting in line. \n\nLucy finally comes back and starts helping someone at her window. I have to again go back to ask a question. As I'm coming back to my station, I see Lucy reaching over my station with a box of Kleenex to give my customer. When she reached over, she spills a drink I had all over my station. She says sorry really softly and goes back to waiting on her customer. \n\nSo now I'm cleaning up the mess she made with paper towels and I get an instant message from her on my computer that says \"make sure you clean that with Clorox wipes after he leaves.\" No apology, no offer to help clean it up or pay for my drink. \n\nAt this point I'm livid. I finally finish up with the customer at my window and she goes to say something to me. I say, \"Don't even talk to me right now.\" She goes to say something else and I just say \"seriously can you just leave me alone.\" She goes \"wow it was just an accident.\" \n\nI tell my other co-worker that I'm going to the back for a moment (to calm down). When I come back Lucy is in my boss's office with the door closed and am pretty sure she was complaining about me. \n\nI realize this may have been an overreaction but it was mostly because I have some issues handling my anger and was trying not to cuss her out for not offering to help me clean the mess. \n\nTl;dr: Lazy coworker spills my drink, gives me a half assed apology, doesn't offer to clean it up or buy me a new one, tells me to make sure I clean it up the right way, then I tell her not to talk to me. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "The reason I am posting this here is because I do have a mental illness and my rationale and judgement has been impaired at times. So what better place to turn to than the internet, where a million strangers will tell it to you straight! \n\nI have worked as a waitress/manager at a cafe for 8 years. The owner and I are friends, I babysit her kid, she got me a phone when mine died, I managed the cafe for a year while she was pregnant. We have history. But one thing that she has always done that is kind of exhausting is that if she is worried about any little aspect of her life, whether work related or not, it bleeds into work and suddenly managing her emotions becomes a whole other job. Like, the whole restaurant has to first cheer her up otherwise we get fretted and micromanaged and yelled at. Because I have been there the longest, this job usually falls to me, and all the kitchen staff and waiters come to me for advice and to moan. \n\nI am a person who usually has a lot of self-hatred, so when she or anyone says to me 'you fucked this up, you are terrible at x y and z', I usually just believe them and go cry in the bathroom or burn myself with cigarettes. But I have been feeling much better lately so when she went off at me today it felt like the straw that broke the camel's back, and I just felt angry at her instead of at myself. So I quit, and now I feel both elated and terrified (for the record, I have another job and I have asked them if I can work there full-time and they said yes, so that is not a problem). Please tell me if I am an asshole, or if this is just what dignity feels like?\n\nContext: We have a regular customer who is a grumpy old racist lady but who comes in all the time so we grit our teeth and serve her. When I sneeze, I sneeze pretty loud. I went to the area behind the bar where the sink is to sneeze, out of sight of the customers, and of course I covered my face with my arm because I am not stupid. A couple of hours later, I got [these texts](https://imgur.com/a/pU71Haa). Racist customer-lady is green, I hope you can understand the rest, some texts she forwarded to me from someone who talked to racist lady.\n\nIt would be really helpful if I could get opinions on this. If I am indeed the asshole, I have a chance to apologise to her tomorrow, but I am SO TIRED of being her emotional punching bag, I think we are gonna have to talk about that regardless, because she is still my friend, even if she ends up not being my boss anymore.

I have a one bedroom with my wife and said \"sure, if you're ok sleeping on the floor\".\n\n3-4 days after the marriage, they suddenly decided to quit the old job, not go back to their rented apartment, the husband moved all their smaller stuff to our house, and they've been living in my living room for about 2 months now. \n\nI would have been fine with it, but my wife has to see her naked with her husband in our living room every morning, have their stuff all around, and eat our stuff for free. Which again, I'd be fine with, but she put a line in the Sand and basically said it's either them or her. So I asked them to leave as nicely as I could by the end of the week. \n\nThey stopped talking to me as soon as I said that for the entire rest of the week, moved to a place they rented soon after, and they have been telling all my family how horrible my wife has been this whole time. Making my mom give me a very angry call about it. I've tried explaining it to everyone, but they say that since she grew up so close to me she thought she could depend on me like a brother, not to kick her out to the street. \n\n\nAm I the asshole here?

      "description": "Sorry for length but there needs to be some context.\n\nMy wife and I are ex-athletes and both over 6 feet. She works an office job and hits the gym about once a week. I have a physically demanding job and lift weights 3x a week. At the end or the day I'm tired and super hungry despite eating all day. It's no problem for me to crush 8000-10,000 plus calories in a day. My wife is a big snacker so we both pretty much eat all day.  All while we dated she's eaten less than me. However over the passed 6 months or so she has been eating on average double what I eat at dinner. \n\nI look at food as fuel and I don't like feeling stuffed after any meals. I usually eat one large full plate of food for dinner. However my wife likes to eat until she needs to unbutton her pants. I'm not exaggerating. She regularly now gets a second plate when I'm not even finished my first.\n\nI noticed that when we are out with other people or with family she always gets more food than me and it makes me feel like less of a man. I know it sounds stupid but something about her outeating me at the dinner table just feels weird. If it was an extra bread stick or something is one thing but its usually another full plate of everything. Also we have strangely similar tastes and often order the same thing without discussing doing so, so it's not like she gets two salads versus my t-bone steak.\n\nThe other night we were eating with my parents and after everyone was finished she grabbed another plate. Afterwards I asked her if she would consider eating as much as me when we eat meals together. I was careful not to offend her and didn't want to upset her. She wasn't offended and said she would and has since then. Now I feel bad, like I'm holding her back or something.\n\nFor the record I have no problem with her weight so that's not the issue here. She has gained about 25lbs since  we got married (5yrs) but since she's so tall she carries it well, and looks awesome.  I assume she'd gain more weight if she kept this up but that isn't why I asked her to slow down.",

      "description": "For context my father recently had a motor bike accident and me and my brother wanted to go see him, but I was on my way to the airport so I could not bring him back. My brother and I agreed that it was better for him to stay behind and then when I got back I would take him to see my dad 3 hours (each way). But my sister offered to come pick him up if it meant he could go only to get a call on the day that he was supposed to be picked up to a very rude \"I cant be fucked because I could not find anyone to feed my dog and she was whimpering\" (her words, our parents also offered to look after the pets.)  now that is understandable she was a bit stressed out. but then after this massive mission getting my brother back home and making my flight costing a fair amount of money, I get a message saying sorry but that she didn't give a fuck that she let my brother down, I ignored this until l got back home and my brother is extremely down and depressed to hear the whole time I had been go she had, had his friends working on her house and hanging out there but asking him not to come because he would distract them (hes a bit slow but he always puts in effort to help as much as he can).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after hearing this I tried to explain that she is the one in the wrong here and that she is being really nasty probably because she feels really bad, and that its not his fault he didn't really believe me and said I was just being nice. I then showed him the message and said she clearly has an issue with you and I don't know why we should talk to her about it.\n\nMy brother just called her and said \"thanks for caring so much about me and having my friends over and asking me not to come it makes me feel really fucking great.\" \n\nthen my sister called me yelling and screaming and I said something along the lines of \"of course hes upset but you have been horrible and I think you should apologize to him\"\n\nmy sister then came to my brothers place and listed a bunch of nasty words into me and him, said she was going to hit me and I threw a few words back but nothing compared to what she said to us both.\n\nP.S. brother has been in a much better mood and his friends caught up to speed and thought that he didn't want to go to her house not that he was told not to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR \n\nI thought sister was being rude.\n\nbrother getting left out and feeling shit.\n\nProve sister is being a bitch.\n\nSister bites my head off.\n\nMore details if you guys want but mainly interested if showing him that message was to far, its more the fact she said sorry to me but said she didn't care about him which I think is really horrible.",

      "description": "AITA? Okay so quite simply I hate my birthday and receiving gifts, Christmas, holidays ect. I have never liked it, even as a child. I'm not quite sure why but I'm happy when no one gets me anything or remembers my birthday. It's just awkward to me and I don't feel good getting gifts or being the center of attention without doing something worth celebrating or entertaining. My best birthday was this last one when all my friends and family just treated it as any normal day. On Christmas if anyone mentions getting me a gift I tell them to just donate something to charity if they really wanna do something. I am fine getting other people gifts and celebrating there birthday or holiday because it's there day and that's what they want. Some people have said its selfish to not let others celebrate my birthday but my argument is if it's your birthday you get to do what you want and essentially be a little selfish. Some people wanna go to dinner or throw a party I just want to treat it like a normal day. Am I the asshole?",

We have never gotten even a thank you from anyone in that fucking class for saving their asses. We didn't have to help anyone. We took time out of our days to put these sets together when other people would not give 2 cents if everyone else was failing. \n\nSo I went in and changed all of the answers to the wrong ones. \n\nThe exam is tomorrow. 😎\n\nReddit, am I an asshole?",

      "description": "My friend (24f) and I (24m), who also work together, had been sleeping together and hanging out a lot over the past 4 months and had become extremely close as we both went through tough times (family illness etc). We were both two total pillars of support for each other and talked constantly. Due to circumstances of working together, not having enough time and effectively the timing not being right, we were not in an official relationship and over Christmas because of the nature of our work (hospitality) we had no private time together but kept talking. Now we are in the new year she has made a commitment to herself, to do things more for herself and not to count too much leaning on other people, which is something I support her doing. I've found out this means we aren't sleeping together, which sucks but I can get over, and that we aren't going to see each other outside of work really much or at all. She did mention to me she was going to be looking after herself more but I just feel totally cut out.\n\n I should be leaving for another job soon and having brought this up with her she said that while concentrating on herself, with me leaving we were bound to see less of each other anyway, but that we are still good friends but it may just be like this for a while. When I said I felt like I had been just cut out of her life she explained that she felt she got too attached during a time when she was dealing with a lot and now she is trying to rely on herself and not other people. I almost feel like just another person at work to her now, it's made me feel like our relationship was cheap because of what she was going through and that I'm disposable.\n\nShould she have explained to me how this new year would affect our relationship?\nShould I be feeling this cut-out and cheap?\nShould I be more understanding of her wanting to concentrate on herself?\nShould I stop talking to her, see if she comes back to me? (Too Passive?)\n\nAITA? (Also any advice appreciated! )",

      "description": "So, this is a compilation of experiences in the past couple weeks in which I think I complained in 'proper' way and was ignored - I guess my frustration is, that I feel like people who make scenes get rewarded, and people who are polite in expressing frustration get brushed aside, but maybe I need to chill\n\n1. Our office uses the local Panera for most of our meeting catering because it's easy to do group orders. I almost always order soup, occasionally soup and salad. For some reason my croutons are almost never included with the French Onion soup, I've mentioned it to admin staff and finally have sent multiple notices to the Panera, and have gotten no response. In contrast, have gone to that Panera in person and witnessed them bend over backward to comp stuff for people who complain loudly in-store\n\n2. At grocery store, in line for deli, it's a long line, but I pull a ticket and wait, a woman comes in after me and pulls a ticket, waits about 30 secs and gets a manager, manager pulls a worker from the back to fill this lady's order - I go up to manager and say there are people in front of her, manager says, 'we'll get you next', I say, 'I'm not next', manager walks away (I also walk away at that point)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Order sandwich from local place to go, when I get home with the sandwich, there's no sauce, pretty bummed as the avocado sauce is the main reason I like that sandwich. Call up the sandwich place and let them know, they ask if I want to come back and get a replacement, I say 'No' because it's still 10 min from home and I don't feel like going back out, employee says 'ok' and hangs up without offering any kind of comp next time, I feel slighted",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to have female friends when I have a girlfriend?",
      "description": "So I (20M) have been dating my SO (20F) for 5 months now. I’m having a couple issues that I’ve been battling with.\n\nWhen we first started dating, things were great. As the relationship developed, she started to get more strict on things that she didn’t want me to do. The thing that is bothering me the most is that she doesn’t want me to talk to, or look at any other girl. She accuses me of checking out other girls more often than I would like her to. Most of the time, it feels random and I don’t know where it’s coming from. I never check out other girls. I’ve been accused of looking at other girls because i was scrolling through Netflix and SFW websites looking for something to watch. I’ve told her that this behaviour seems unfair to me because I don’t like it when she gets mad at me for things that I didn’t do. She denies that she’s mad and says she’s just asking a question but most of the time she either questions it a lot and has a very hard time believing me, or takes out some anger on me for it, especially when she thinks I’m looking at my ex(who we’ve walked by a few times in public). She says that it’s not a problem because she’s allowed to ask me about something that is bothering her. I’ve tried gently telling her that I think this is a sign of a jealousy problem but she took it very badly. I don’t think I have done anything to make her feel like I check out other girls. I don’t watch porn and I deleted instagram because my use of the app made her uncomfortable (i followed a lot of girls that i’m friends with/ have met).\n\nAnother issue is that she doesn’t want me to talk to any other girls. Specifically, I have 3 female friends that I have been platonic friends with for many years and my SO doesn’t want me to talk to them. I don’t intend to spend regular one on one time with them. Two of those friends live away and I see them a couple times a year. I hung out with them once since we have been dating (in a group with 3 other guys) and my SO did not handle it well. She said that for her, it’s just as bad as cheating. I haven’t talked to either of them since, and it makes me feel bad because from their perspective, I’ve cut them off for no reason. The third friend I have seen once in public since we’ve been dating. I talked to her for 10 minutes and she made me feel horrible cause she said “apparently we’re not friends anymore.” This was in reference to the fact that she has sent me snapchats but I never respond because my SO would be mad if I did that. My SO says i should not even want to talk to any other girl. I disagree with that. I think I can hold her as number one, and still have a chat with them once every couple weeks to maintain a friendship.\n\nMy SO doesn’t have any close male friends which I find kind of odd, however she has been treated badly by guys in the past. If she did have any close male friends, I would be fine with her talking to them and hanging out with them.\n\nWe once had an argument because I told her that i was going to hang out with my friends while I was gone (the two girls and 3 guys). She got upset and said that I shouldn’t be hanging out or talking to other girls. I got upset because I think I would be a horrible friend if I ended a friendship because of this situation. She said “I can ask you not to talk to other girls.” I said that she couldn’t ask me to end a friendship with someone based on their gender and if I cut them off, I’m not gonna be able to be friends with them.\n\nI asked my SO if she wanted to hang out with me and my female friend together and she didn’t want to do that.\n\nTLDR: I know that if I have a girlfriend, I should be limiting the time that I spend with female friends. But she doesn’t want me to spend any time with them at all and she doesn’t want me to communicate with them. I don’t think this is fair. I think my girlfriend may have a jealousy problem. \n\nAITA for wanting to have female friends while I have a girlfriend? Should I be more accommodating to her insecurities? Is it wrong to spend time with them if she’s not around?",

      "description": "I live in an area of Canada that regularly gets snowstorms from early December to mid April. Shovelling is a very normal activity to have to do here and since snowblowers are so expensive most people just wake up an hour early on nights when we get 30+ cm (12 inches) of snow and brave the storms to clear out their driveways.\nI’m a young woman who saved like crazy then inherited a few thousand dollars from a close relative so I was stupid enough to sink it all into a two apartment house. I can afford it but my budget is too tight to be able to afford to live alone or to buy a $6000 machine to avoid shovelling. On top of that I work an early shift so when I was looking for a tenant for the basement apartment I made it abundantly clear that snow clearing their side of the driveway would be their own responsibility. I’m not a very strong person to begin with, and I’ve got a few health issues and a physically demanding job so I’m ok with shovelling what I have to but I’m not able to shovel two driveways by myself without a lot of pain and having it impact my work. \nMy old roommate (“OR”) had more upper body strength than me, but she worked a 3 am shift so unless the snow stopped falling after she shovelled herself out, we usually both had to shovel separately. She moved out to live with her boyfriend and my brother (“bro”) moved in instead. He’s got back issues from a car accident two years ago, is suffering from a lot of mental health issues along with having high functioning autism, and relies on me a lot to give him advice on what to do especially in social situations. He’s been taking advantage of a bit in the past so I’m always consciously of how I talk to him and treat him but he honestly likes me giving him advice in a lot of situations since it means he doesn’t need to figure it out himself and he trusts me. He’s very intelligent and a great guy, he just needs a bit of extra help with identifying jerks or weird situations.\nMy current tenant (“CT”) has been living in the apartment for nearly two years now. She’s an older lady in her mid to late 60’s who is very healthy and active and while she pays rent early every month and takes great care of the apartment she’s had a lot of boundary stomping issues since day 1. Her previous living arrangement had her living in an in-law suite with relatives so I feel like she willfully doesn’t understand that I’m her landlord not her new best friend/niece. She tries to come up to my apartment often just to pay social visits, even when it’s obvious that we were busy or sick or sleeping. She would try and call me multiple times a day when I was at work, looked up my fathers number after learning his name and called his house directly, and even looked up the number to his small business to try and get him there. To be clear this isn’t his house and he never indicated to her he was going to help, he just came over once cause he’s super handy and she was claiming for a few months that there was issues with her kitchen fan (there wasn’t). She also has a long history of luring my two cats into her apartment and giving them yummy non-prescription food despite the fact that I’ve explained to her a million times I’m not comfortable with them being in her apartment, that someone is almost always home upstairs to let them back in, and that if they eat normal food they get a few health issues that can threaten their lives depending on how long on it goes. She also then likes to try and carry the cats up to my door and ring the doorbell until someone answers so heaven forbid you let the cats out on a warm sunny day and then have to take a call for work or get a shower. She even started calling me whenever I’d go out of the house outside normal business hours. I had to block her number for a few months to try and get her to back off, and she’s calmed down a bit. I feel like if I were more financially secure I’d have given her notice by now, but like I said she’s at least clean and early to pay rent.\nAnyways to get back to the question at hand: CT  will do anything in her power not to shovel. I totally get the motivation there because I’d probably be the same way, but she never thanks anyone for helping her shovel, never offers to help pay for gas or anything when my neighbours tried snow blowing my driveway for me (they’ve since stopped so I don’t know if it’s cause of her or if they just didn’t want to spend an extra half hour in the cold), and used to try and call me and my father at our works to see if we could help her or help pay $80 for someone to shovel our tiny driveway. She often will be seen standing at the end of her side, pathetically standing there with a big shovel, looking sad until someone comes to help her. And she’s great at sucking people in at first into thinking she should get that help, but when she won’t even help you help her it gets old real fast. Especially since she then will find you again to demand help the next time her problem happens again. She also insisted on having the larger side of the driveway since it’s a few feet. closer to her apartment door, meaning that she has more driveway to shovel, especially since she has a little car she parks at the far end of her side so she has to shovel the whole way, which is only a few feet longer than our side but still more work for her. \nToday is the first snowfall where my brother is around to help shovel and ye old sexist conventions say that a big strong young man should automatically help the “little old lady” shovel her driveway. But he’s got a bad back, has no defence to her social boundary stomping (he’s already enabled her a bit cause he didn’t understand me not wanting to have her come up any hour of the night to “help the cats come in”), and yet again snow clearing was never anyone’s responsibility but her own. I feel like if he does go out on a day like today and helps her shovel she will immediately start demanding he help her every day. He’s got a big history of being used and tricked by anyone who is even a slightly passable liar and would be the type to try and shovel her side first if pressed to and then not be able to shovel himself out.\nOn the other hand, at first she seems like a sweet old lady that’s barely 5’4 and he’s a big and tall underemployed man whose going to be home all day. I’m about to tell him to never help her shovel no matter what, but since I’m the one making that decision for him I feel very conscious of the fact it might reflect badly on him at the first glance. I can see her trying to get pity points for pointing out to neighbours that he won’t help her and I know he genuinely likes to help people but my salty ass doesn’t want to give her another excuse to basically harass us and to get an in with my socially vulnerable bro. \nAITA?\nTLDR: boundary stomping clingy basement apartment renter is a 65+ lady who has to shovel her own driveway but won’t and if you try to help her she won’t thank you, but demand help again next time. AITA for telling my ASD, bad back brother to never help her?",

      "description": "So, in my friend group, there is this person, lets call him Robert, who claims to have some kind of mental issues. He has never told us exactly what he has, but has occasionally brought up that he has OCD, Anxiety issues, and ADHD. \n\nNow, Robert and I aren't on the best on terms, and I have more than once found myself at odds with him. He has routinely stopped me from doing certain things on purpose, such as starting a massive, 40 minute argument over me recording gameplay of an online game we play for fun, and even after i had repeatedly told him the footage was NOT going to be saved to my computer, and infact, deleted it, he continued insulting me over a 5 minute clip of me and another player's messing around. (Note he was not in the game, only in the discord call with us, the only thing that may have been recorded was his discord profile picture and nothing else due to me not recording audio) and also starting a fight after i spoke some german words during a game,(which i had picked up from playing some games with some german words in them and was using for comical reasons) and he starting insulting my pronounciation of the words, and telling me not to speak it (neither of us are German though he does/did take Written German in school before he left).\n\nHe has also attempted to ostracise me from the group itself, trying to misdirect from a lunch meeting by informing me the meeting was next week, when a message sent just 20 minutes ago stated it was the next day, and also continued 'planning' the already planned meeting FOR THE NEXT DAY in front of me when i went afk. (Still made it tho, my other friends were nice.) I got a bit pissed and asked him why, and he blew up, claiming paranoia and Anxiety, which he always does when people question  him about his BS. Along with attempts to talk bad at me behind my back such as saying \" Don't you think_______ is a shit person?\"  ,\"How do you all even put up with him\" and \"We should really stop playing with him, he sucks ass\"\n\nThis is also in addition to regularly interrupting everyone randomly and 'asking' random questions such as \"would you like a waffle\" and \"Lets go to starbucks\" in the MIDDLE of a instense ranked match. This has gotten so bad that one of my other friends told him to \"shut the fuck up\" and he retreated into his \"i have mental illness don't attack me\" shebang.\n\nLastly, Robert has also regulary claimed that he dropped out of school due to his \"mental illness\" as proof but i recently discovered that he does infact still goes to school, just a private one and has for most of the period after he had to \"drop out\". At this point, i seriously do not think that he has any real mental illnesses, and I am really getting sick of his shit. WIBTA if I called his BS out to the group?\n\n",

      "description": "Sorry in advance for any typos and formatting since I’m doing this on mobile. \n\nMe and my sister in law (SIL) have always been close, I took her into our family with open arms and we’ve always gotten along. Over the last couple of years she has been attending school and met her best friend (BF) there. They got very close and became almost inseparable to the point to where you never saw them apart. Over these last couple of years my sister in law has been pushing us to meet and talk because she always thought that we would make a perfect couple, but neither of us ever had time since we both work full time jobs and go to school. Well recently I moved into my first place, SIL and BF decide to help out since it was a lot of moving to do. Well me and BF instantly hit it off, we just got along really well and just enjoyed one another’s company. So we started talking and finally decided to get hang out one night. Well SIL finds out we hung out and instantly gets mad that BF didn’t tell her that we started seeing each other. After some talking everyone got over the situation, but my SIL made me and BF promise that we would stop talking to each other. Me and BF really like each other, so that didn’t last long! We were talking again hours after promising not too speak to each other. Well my dumbass never changed any contact info or did any name changes for BF, so when I was SIL and BF messaged me, it only took one glance to realize we both lied about not talking to one another... Starts this huge fight between the three of us that led to me and BF basically begging for forgiveness for not telling SIL. With some help from my brother, I was able to get back on good terms with SIL, but she refuses to talk to BF. Something about BF withholding information from her so she feels she can’t trust her anymore and doesn’t want a liar for a BF. (Also SIL knew I thought BF was attractive so she couldn’t blame me, but apparently at the beginning BF refused to admit she had any feelings for me or was interested in me at all). Fast forward almost 2 months now and their still not talking, and I now resent my SIL for starting so much drama in my family and turning my brother against BF, so one day I spoke up and told her I was tired of her shit, and that my sympathy for the situation died a long time ago and now she just pisses me off. SIL has uninvited me to her graduation and birthday party later this month and at this point it couldn’t bother me any less because of how upset I am with her. Me and BF are going strong, but this whole situation is taking a huge toll on the relationship. She also feels externally uncomfortable going to any family events if SIL is attending so I always end up going alone or not going at all. \n\nAITA for going behind my SILs back to start a relationship with her BF? Or is it justified because she pushed us to meet for the longest time and is now upset that we finally met and really like each other?",

      "description": "Ok so just some background to the situation. I attend the same university as my friend, but I study under a different School so I've never personally had any experience with this lecturer. I have however heard of her before due to an extremely similar experience another friend had last year in her class, which lead to my choice of advice.\n\nSo a friend of mine was given an assignment to discuss whether or not they believed Millennials were entitled. The feedback they received after the assignment was complete was: \"It was so ironic that your essay came across as so entitled that I showed your essay to my husband and we had a good laugh at it\".\n\nMy friend was mortified. It wasn't that they didn't do well on the assignment that upset them, it was that they got virtually no feedback other than what I quoted and the lecturer's husband doesn't even work in our university and had no right to be shown my friends work, never mind ridicule it.\n\nSo long story short, when my friend came to me asking for advice I told them to go back to the lecturer. I told them to say they wanted actual constructive feedback for their work, and for their work not to be shared with her husband. They did just that and it somehow blew up in their face. I'm not sure how *exactly* it went wrong as the friend is giving me the silent treatment, but I'm pretty sure both the lecturer and my friend have to attend a disciplinary meeting with the School heads.\n\nI feel awful about the advice I gave. At the time I thought it was the best choice of action since the lecturer was being unprofessional imo, but I really didn't want my friend to end up in trouble since their having a hard time in uni anyway. I'm pretty sure they're giving everyone the silent treatment not just me, but I'm worried I fucked up here since I'm pretty much directly involved. AITA?",

      "description": "My friend is not a racist. I know this by just knowing him for many years. However, he often uses outrageous language, most notably \"nigger-faggot\" (as one word, not \"faggot-nigger\" or other variations), mostly as a friendly jab at our friends. I told him he's being racist and insensitive and he should stop saying it. \n\nHe disagreed. He gave me a list of reasons why he should be able to say it: \n\n1) he only uses it around friends (true)\n\n2) he is not a racist or homophobic (true, unless you think using the word makes you one)\n\n3) he is not using it in a racist/homophobic context, as in, it is not directed at any homosexual or black person (true)\n\n4) it's part of his upbringing, the music he listens to, the culture he's part of (partially true)\n\n5) he doesn't like it when people tell him what he can and can't say  \n\nI told him the word makes me uncomfortable, but he says this is irrelevant, and that if I am so upset by it, I should find a new friend group. Notably, he says I have no legitimate reason for it upsetting me (as I am neither black nor gay), but I said the reason is irrelevant because I'm bothered by it regardless. I countered by saying that if he were my friend, he would recognize something that makes me uncomfortable and stop using it.   \n\nSo it feels like a stalemate. We're both doing something the other doesn't want and it's incompatible. \n\nIf we were being dramatic, one of us would end up leaving the group of friends, but most of our friends agree with him, and it's certainly not something I'd lose a friendship over. The only way I see this going is that it's ignored and pushed aside until it happens again.

      "description": "Her (f45)  original ride was another co-worker, who had to leave early for hurting her neck or something. She got the cupboard the other day from work because she thought it looked nice. Some office was being cleared and she found it nice for some reason. \n\nShe knows I (M21) live roughly \n 10 minute drive away from her, so i'm the backup plan. \n\n\nI'd say she's not in bad shape and couldn't carry the cupboard home by herself even through public transport. (It's not too crowded or anything during daytime in Finland) \n\nAnyways.\n\nShe walks up to me 5 minutes before we're leaving work (note that she could've asked for the ride all day since we we're basically working as partners for the 8 hour period), I'm browsing my phone and not paying attention at this point. She wonders around and says something like \"so for a ride to (her home town) would probably cost more than 10 Euros would it?\". I'm like \"Wait, what was that, are you talking to me?\". Then she repeats herself. And didn't think anything just didn't want to bother and said \"Uhh, no can do not going that direction today\" . I lied. I'm going home, normal route as always. Had I taken her home, my drive from work to home would be 20+ minutes longer. \nAfter I said that I'm not going home. Her response was  \"Hmph! You just don't want to give me a ride\" and gave me the finger, not 100% just caught a glimpse because was browsing my phone. but sure did look like it. She also has a bad reputation at work for being this pretty aggressive when things don't go her way.\n \nShe took the train. Saw her at the outside door while carrying the cupboard while having this \"fuck all of you\" face on. Kinda felt bad afterwards and almost offered the ride by saying \"friend cancelled\"  but her face was too scary I couldn't say a word. \n\nAsk for more info if I missed any. ",

      "description": "Using an old throwaway. So, backstory. I am a lesbian, but I was closeted for a long time. I'm 25 now, but refused to acknowledge my attraction to women until about two years ago, and even then I called myself bisexual for a while because I was afraid of being fully gay. I've had several ex-boyfriends from that time, and a shameful number of male sexual partners. It was a bad time, and I'm kind of sensitive about it.\n\nMy girlfriend (let's call her Jane) and I have been together for about 8 months, and she's the first girl I've ever been serious about. She is bi, which I have zero problem with, and most of her friends are bi too. I don't know them that well, but I've met them on occasion.\n\nLast week I was spending some time Jane and her friends and one of them made an offhand comment about us being a room full of bisexuals. I laughed, but then casually slipped in that I'm actually a lesbian, and I got a bunch of weird looks. Apparently they were all under the impression that I was bi. When I asked Jane about it earlier, she said that all she had told them was that she (Jane) was my first girlfriend and that I used to date lots of guys. I got mad, telling her that I don't like to tell lots of people that, but she told me that she sees no shame in my sexual history.\n\nShe said I shouldn't be ashamed of being \"sexually fluid\", and when I angrily told her I am NOT sexually fluid and never have been, and that she needs to respect that. She accused me of being biphobic since whenever I talk about how I've been with men and women I say it as if it's a negative thing, which for me it most definitely was. She also accused me of expecting her to \"turn\" fully gay too like I did. I told her if she tells her friends I'm bi again, I'll call her out and break up with her.\n\nWe've barely been speaking the past few days. She thinks I don't respect her bisexuality, I think she doesn't respect my lesbianism. AITA?\n\n**tldr:** my bisexual girlfriend has been telling others I'm also bi, not gay, and accused me of being biphobic.",

      "description": "This might seem petty, and actually in hindsight, it definitely is, but let me explain...\nMy gf had plans to move a wardrobe from the spare room into the main bedroom, which I knew about beforehand, and I got up early to empty the wardrobe out and throw away some of the boxes it was hiding so we could move it together later in the day.\nI then went out to see captain marvel with my dad and when I got back she'd half-moved around the spare room, the bedroom and the living room without telling me any of her plans. I was then expected to finish what she started while she went out to eat, which I did, but it caused many, many complications and inconveniences - not to her, just me - chiefest of which was that the play area I had set up for the PSVR i bought myself for my birthday last month was no more, and i had to try and set up a new one around her plans for the living room, which in the end I was unsuccessful in doing and have had to give it up entirely, unfortunately.\nI then confronted her and we had one of very few arguments. Typically i will raise something that has upset me once every 4-5 months and it will usually turn into a massive argument usually ended by me apologising for getting worked up.\nI'm willing to put up with a lot of inconvenience or avoid giving my input so she can be happy as she deals with severe OCD (let me just point out that she wasnt moving the apartment due to her OCD as it doesn't strike her like that) and bipolar which require her to live a life of constant inconvenience, so I'm used to not coming first in decisions, and happy to live in second place as long as she can be happy.\nBut today was just one of those days, shed completely cut me out of any decision-making in our home and I was hurt that she didnt spare a thought for me when she was placing my belongings in an ottoman and putting it under a TV, or obliterating the VR playspace I painstakingly and precisely set up, or just leaving me to do all the work. \nSo anyway, I lost my cool and shouted at her. There was no violence involved, I didnt insult her or hit her or anything insane like that. But I raised my voice because I was angry. \nShe did her usual tactic of invalidating my anger, saying things like \"you're just stressed with work and are taking it out on me\" (since getting my new job I have never been happier or more carefree) or \"you're just frustrated because you wasted your time helping me out and you have freelance work to do tonight\" (the work hasn't been confirmed and I'm certainly not upset that I spent the time helping her out), etc, things to that effect.\nAt that point I got more annoyed because I felt like I didnt have the right to be angry about something, as she essentially insisted I'm angry about something else and am just latching onto this event as an excuse to take it out on her. It just feels unfair that I'm not \"allowed\" to shout in anger when I feel I've been wronged.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I just a petty asshole or am I right to be upset?",

      "description": "I stay in a fairly standard apartment complex with fairly standard management. Everything is okay except I don’t really like living here and the rent is probably gonna jump in price this summer.\n\nBasically, there’s a 50$ fee if they catch you leaving trash out. So I share the apartment with my mother-in-law and husband.\n\nThey are both from another country and I was born here in US. Mother-in-law has somewhat heavy accent and whenever she goes to the office she likes one of us to go, not because she can’t speak English well enough on her own, but because it’s easier and faster. I say this because it seemed to be a factor, considering what happened.\n\nMIL received an email last week warning about dog droppings being left out and that they have spies looking for the poopetraters, which was fine, since we got the same email. Now, all three of us are on the lease for this apartment and my husband and I tend to be in communication with the office more often. However, one member of the staff (imma call her ‘K’) sent an email to my MIL only, saying that we’d left out trash and to please pay 50$ ASAP through the online system.\n\nSo that day she told us about it, wondering if we’d left out trash, but no one had. K sent the email right before the office closed and so there was nothing we could do to contest it at the time.\n\nI was home the next day so I decided to go to the office and ask them about it, and get the fee removed. K was out showing an apartment but the property manager was there. (Her name is T)\n\nI told T about the issue and she said she’d have to ask K because the person who sent the email out was supposed to have photographic proof. I sat down to wait for K to return. After a couple of minutes, T told me it would probably be a while and advised me to wait for an email. I gave her mine and my husbands (even though I know she had them already) and said to send us the photos if they wanted us to pay their fee. (I don’t think this was rude, I think it was reasonable to ask)\n\nBy the end of the day we hadn’t received anything from them, not even an update to let us know it was being looked into. Then the next day, around lunch time I received an email from T.\n\n‘We have removed the trash charge from your account. We apologize for the inconvenience.’\n\nNothing from K whatsoever. I get that it’s mgmt job to back up their staff even when they make a mistake but the mistake isn’t even being acknowledged here. My husband said they took the fee off and apologized so I should let it go  but I can’t help but feel like my family is being discriminated against and taken advantage of.. AITA if this isn’t really good enough for me?\n\ntldr; we were falsely accused of leaving out garbage and charged, and I suspect it was because they thought my MIL doesn’t speak English well. We contested the fee and they took the charge off and apologized. I want an explanation, my husband thinks I’m out for a witch hunt. AITA?",

      "description": "This happened a long time ago, but essentially the backstory is that when I had my first car I got a parking ticket. I don't remember the exact details, but everything about it seemed fishy. I tried to google the company (authority?) that gave my the ticket and nothing came up. The timeline also didn't make sense, and after talking to a bunch of people who dealt with similar things I surmised it was a scam and moved on with my life. \n\nA little while later I moved 4 hours away from my home town to go to college, and since I was with an ex who had a car and public transport was pretty good I decided not to bring my car. It was having electrical issues that would have made getting it down to where I moved extremely impractical; there was no way I would drive it on a freeway, but around town it worked. So I let my brother have my car since his was basically totaled. \n\nAfter moving expenses I was extemely broke, communiting 45 minutes daily for a minimum wage job while being a full time student meant I was living paycheck to paycheck and barely making it. One day my brother calls me and say he can't get the car registered because of a parking ticket. I let him know I didn't pay it because I was certain it was a scam, but that I should have followed up with the DMV or something. He tells me I need to pay the parking ticket, and I say that even if I wanted to I could not afford the 60 or 110 bucks it cost. Then I told him he got a car for free, and the least he could do was pay the ticket. \n\nSo AITA for assuming my brother should pay that ticket since I gave him my car for free? On one hand, I get that ticket was my responsibility, and upfront him paying the ticket was not the agreement, since I didn't know about it, but still. It kind of irked me that he assumed I would pay for it.\n\nEdit: based on the responses, I get the impression that people think this happened recently, even though I stated at the beginning of this post that it happened a long time ago. So let me clarify, it's been almost a decade since this ordeal started. I don't have a warrant, in fact my driving record is pristine. I accept that I *was* the asshole, and still *am* the asshole for bait and switching, but back then I explained to my brother that paying that ticket would mean I couldn't eat, and he still pushed on it.

      "description": "Yah, that title needs a bit of explanation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 14 years old, and I have a reddit account. On that reddit account, I'm subscribed to subreddits such as r/memes and r/AmItheAsshole, which, as you know, use adult language. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, my mom checked my account's home page to see what I browse on reddit, and she found many AITA posts with adult language (like asshole and fuck). This caused her to take away my phone that I have the app on (I'm on a laptop currently).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe argues that I shouldn't even have that account because the posts on my homepage use adult languages and are made by adults for adults. She thinks that I'm too young to be seeing such language and that I'll be influenced in a negative way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy argument is that I'm old enough to know how to be safe on the web and not use bad language in my regular life (barely use words like \"fuck\" and \"shit\" in the first place). I've had my original account for about six months and I wasn't really influenced in a bad way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n(If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them as best as I can.)",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo Im having a major inner conflict in recent days. Ill try to explain everything as best I can.\n\nIn my country, there is an oppertunity for young people to go to other countries to work and travel. You can avail of this oppertunity once. Since I was very young, I have dreamed of taking this trip. Its a true once in a lifetime journey. For 7 years now I have worked as much as I can, so that I can afford flights and accommodation, and ensure I am not left lacking when abroad. \n\nI have known some guys for a few years now and they are really great. We have become a really close group of friends. However, when I mentioned that I plan on going on this trip, they all invited themselves to go with me, to the same place. I will admit, Im kind of a mild guy, so I said yeah ok, even though I really did not want this.\n\nGoing with my friends will restrict a lot of things I do. I planned on doing things myself, at my own pace. One guy is quite demanding in that if he wants something, we all have to stop and do what he wants. Another guy, is constantly asking for money, which I find hard to outright say no to. Due to my savings, I was planning on taking a few trips that would cost a bit, and dont want to give out handfuls of money I know I wont get back.\n\nI was really using this holiday as some me-time. Really enjoy myself and do what I want, and dragging these others around with me will really restrict that. Also, it sounds like Im bitching about my friends here. Theyre not bad, its just 2 factors that are putting me off.\n\nIm thinking of just organising my holiday and not telling them deadlines to apply or anything. Would I be the asshole if I did this?\n\nTL;DR: My friends invited themselves to my once in a lifetime holiday. I want to organise my own thing and keep them out of the loop. WIBTA?",

Their wedding invitations came two months ago and I RSVP’ed. Her wedding is in July.\n\nI was talking to my friend yesterday and she told me that she looked forward to seeing him wear his uniform. I was surprised because I thought their wedding was going to be casual and laidback. She also said that some other members of her family will be coming in military attire, including her grand-uncle who fought in WW2. Her fiancé’s friends will mostly be wearing their uniforms too.\n\nI was super shocked and told her that due to my personal experiences with the military (I am a refugee from an unstable country), I would feel very uncomfortable attending this wedding. I would definitely experience some degree of PTSD.\n\nShe was sad that I couldn’t go and was very curt with me after. I definitely felt a change in the vibe. Later, a mutual friend said that the bride felt “pissed off” that I had decided to suddenly drop out of the wedding and that now she had to change many things. I feel bad, but AITA for not wanting to relive traumatic experiences of my childhood? \n\n\n",

      "description": "I’m going to try to condense this as much as possible. My roommate is a friend I’ve had for a couple of years. We are both married and we both have daughters that are the same age. \n\nBackground: She decided to buy a house in the NE United States and move her family there *just in case* she decided to pursue a career there after her current contract expires in a few years. She moved her family into that house and moved to the south by herself where her current job is and now lives in my home for a small rent.\n\nHere’s the problem: she’s cheating on her husband with a guy who is also cheating on his long-term girlfriend. I really wish I didn’t know this information, but she came clean to me a couple weeks ago. Now, my real issue is not so much that she’s cheating on her husband, but that she has no problem sleeping with a man who has been dating a girl for three years. I asked her if she would tell his girlfriend, but she doesn’t want to lose her side-ho. Now, I know my husband wouldn’t touch her with a 10ft pole, but I just can’t trust her alone with my husband after finding out not only about her cheating, but also her deep insecurities that she has literally told me can only be staved off with male attention.\n\nWIBTA if I kicked her out, and if not, how do I do it without mentioning my growing distrust with her character? Also, my husband knows all about this and also wants her out of the house, but his way of kicking her out might not work. TIA",

Changed my password, asked him to send me money for the things he had ordered (about $500 in stuff). Well he didn’t, and then I noticed he was using my Grubhub for food delivery all totaling around $150 by the time I noticed. Now we’re at $650. Again texted him and asked for that money to be sent to me and he said he would. Hasn’t yet. Just got a bill from WiFi and our electric company (still in my name) that he hasn’t been paying and now this is about 1500 total in bills. \n\nSo my lawyer friend and I drew up an invoice and threatened to send him to civil court if he didn’t pay or set up some kind of payment plan with me.

A lot of people are saying that he’s an awful person for not denouncing the extreme alt right people who like his videos. Or that he’s an awful person for having Ben Shapiro on meme review. Or he’s an awful person for all the nazi jokes he made a couple years ago or for saying the N word on stream. And a bunch of other things. If you want to see any of the discussions I’m talking about then just search “Pewdiepie” on reddit and look at the posts that aren’t from /r/pewdiepiesubmissions after reading those discussions and comments I feel like I’m an awful person for supporting him.

      "description": "About a year ago I found out that an old friend (15/f) was trading nudes with someone who worked with a music artist I liked, and this guy was 24/m, so that's obviously pedophilia laws and such. Blah blah blah, he left the music guy's discord server, shyed away from the music dude, etc. etc., pretty much disappeared off the face of the internet. With some other people that had confided in, we broke the news to the music dude about what happened, showed the screenshots and such, and then he got fired, etc etc. But, this guy didn't want to inform the community about what had happened, even though people were constantly asking. I felt they had a right to know, so I told them what happened. Of course, they were all like \"oh shit\" and pretty shocked, and I was later censored from saying things like that and banned and whatever. I view this as one of those things where you either tell the public and cause chaos, or keep it a secret and possibly suffer some great consequences. He wanted to keep it quiet and such because he didn't want everyone to be really shocked and shit. I wanted to let people know because I felt they had a right to know and that since there were police reports and such, the information is available anyways, no point in trying to censor it, right? But I dunno, even after having a year to reflect, I still don't know if I'm an asshole for doing that. So, I ask y'all, am I the asshole here? Because this has been bothering me all this time man.

She thinks it's unfair I'm only willing to see her if I get sex out of it. And I just don't want to have to mind numbingly bored for nothing.",

      "description": "Last night i was showering with my boyfriend, and he starts getting close to me and stroking himself. I try to signal i am not in the mood by pulling away, not touching him, not kissing etc. He proceeds to turn me around to masturbate over my back so i tell him i don't want to. He then says he just needs to come and we do not need to have sex, i tell him still not in the mood, he accepts that.\n\nI still felt kind of bad that he just started getting off on me like that without checking i was in the mood, so i told him this later. Personally i feel it is kind of degrading and uncomfortable to be masturbated on like that.\n\nHe thought i was overrreacting, which made me mad. This led to a whole talk on consent in relationships. He also thinks im crazy and completely out of line by for example saying that you need consent if you want to fuck your partner while they are asleep. According to him this was a very odd standpoint. \n\nSo am i the (overreacting) asshole or not? Because i really don't know if i'm just that rigid or if i'm right to feel that way\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Boyfriend jerked off on me without me being turned on, i thought this was uncomfortable and degrading and told him so",

So I dated this girl for 7 months and it was an honest and trustworthy relationship, we had a bit of a conflict one night and we decided we should take maybe a month to think things through and figure everything out between each other. So we split up and stayed friends that month but gave each other enough space. A month later we got back together and most things were fixed between us. She then tells me a day or two later after we get back together that at some party she was all over another guy and didn’t even remember because she was drunk and tired and hurt over us splitting up. The next day I asked if she regretted it and if she was even sorry about it , she said “I have no reason to regret it and why would i be sorry?” She kept getting agitated because i needed to be reassured of how she felt about me if i wanted to continue this relationship.

My aunt wanted all of us to sit around the table and join hands to thank god for bringing us together for this family meal. Me, being an athiest, asked if I could skip the holding hands part. My mother got very mad at me and whispered very angrily in my ear that I had to respect her religion and things like that. I did it though, but I didn't feel good about it and didn't say amen. I also kind of sulked through out the meal because my mother scolded me in front of my entire family. Which is huge. So am I the asshole here?

      "description": " About 18 months ago, my GF of 3 years, let's call her Marlene, (for whom I was saving up to purchase an engagement ring) wanted to leave Canada and visit with family for an extended stay (about 1 year). We both have been saving for some time to buy a house together (more on that later).\n\nShe insisted that this coop/internship program she was doing for 1 year in Italy would help her career. She said that while \"it seemed like a break\", we'd both forsake other romance interests, check in with each other every day or two, and she was staying with her extended family, so there would be no \"male guests\" allowed to stay the night. I could also Skype with her and her family in Italy periodically.\n\n**I was not on-board with her doing this,** but I swallowed my pride, hoping we'd somehow get through this year apart, and things could go back to the way they were. I stayed away from other ladies, and she checked in almost every night. After 4 months of this, while I did not suspect her of being unfaithful, my heart was broken. I felt like I was pushed into going along with this, and she valued her career prospects more than the health of our relationship.\n\n**I told her numerous times that I wanted to spend my life with someone with whom I \"built a life\", went through the ups and the downs, etc. I was still saving for her engagements ring this whole time, sacrificing social/snack/beer budget money to do so.**\n\n6 months later: ignoring Marlene online, changed phone #, met a new girl, Celeste, (26f), chemistry grad. We’re engaged after 5 months, and her parents match the $50,000.00 we put up for a house. I got a new job that pays 60% more, so I can afford better clothes, food, etc.; and my dream of being married to a loving woman and having a house is coming true!!!\n\nMonth 13: Marlene “comes home early” to see why I disappeared and wasn’t at the old apartment. She finds out my new address and visits. She exclaims “we made it” when I say I own the house, to which I reply “sure, if by **we**, you mean my future wife and I”. I should've been a bigger person at this point, but had to add \"the ring fund was spent on car repairs by the way, as I didn't want to taint this relationship by using that money on the new rings, and **I told you wanted to BUILD a life with someone, not be a meal ticket to be ‘claimed’.**\" Things were even worse when Celeste comes downstairs after hearing screaming and obscenities, and Marlene realizes she use to babysit her years back. I tell Marlene to get off **our** property before I call the cops, and finish with \"find someone else with whom to actually **build** a life!\".\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nGF went on break in Italty I didn't want, but eventually pretended to be OK with. I got a new job that pays a lot, met newer/younger woman ex used to babysit years back. Bought a house in Vancouver, spent engagement ring fund for ex on dinners and car repairs.",

But lately one of the guys in the group has been none stop complaining about pretty much everything. Movies, video games, TV shows, and especially political situations (He's a big Trump supporter)\n\nI don't mind if he doesn't like a certain thing, but lately it seems like that he's shaming anyone who likes the stuff he doesn't. Like if I like a certain TV show, he will go on and on about how bad it is and how I shouldn't like it.\n\nThe thing that's got me the most upset though is how petty he is about my life decisions. Like for example, I don't have a job right now because I'm focusing on my school work and other side projects that I'm really passionate about and that will help me in college. But whenever my friend asks me \"So when you getting a job?\" and I explain this to him, he just says \"I have school to, and I work.\" He also looks down on me for the fact that I'm going to a community college and then an out of state college. Saying how shitty those schools are and how shitty the schools I'm going to are (Even though they're really not in my opinion) and that the major I wanna study (Game Design and Programming) will never get me anywhere in life. Among with many other things like how I get a ride instead of walk to our weekly game night, and that I role-play my D&amp;D character \"wrong\".\n\nI talked to the other guys in the group about it, and while one guy (my best friend) and one of my female friends outside of the group agrees with me, the others don't. They say \"He's a great guy when you get to know him better!\" and sometimes he is a good guy. So I don't know if I'm just being overly sensitive. I just wanna know which one of us is the asshole before I loose a friend over it?",

      "description": "I broke up with my girlfriend about three weeks ago. There were a lot of reasons but the relevant ones were, in very generic terms, a pattern of immaturity, laziness, consistently passing off all financial, household, and parental responsibilities to me, constant absence, and lack of communication. She has a five year old son from a previous relationship whom I adore, is flat broke, and has tons of shit here so I told her she could live here until she figures something else out. Her family also lives about 700 miles away and she can’t move back with them without abandoning her kid to the father.\nShe only has her son on the weekends and only works on weekend nights so I’ve also been watching him while she works because I’d rather him not staying on someone’s couch with her.\nSince we broke up, she’s been avoiding me and communicating even less. She says she’s been looking for apartments but she’s been home napping and watching tv while I’m at work and goes out before I get home. I’ve told her if she’s still living here, she owes me the communication of whether or not she’s coming home and when she expects to be home (AITA there?).  She does this all week until she has her son and then she expects me to be there to play house with her. \nSunday, she went to go stay with a friend who lives two hours away. She keeps telling me she’ll be home the next morning but then at night of the day she said she’ll be home, she texts me saying she’s staying another night. Other than that, no communication. She’ll be home Friday with her son and expect me to watch him, despite not communicating any of that to me, and I’ll do it because I don’t know what else she would do with her son in tow.\nI feel disrespected and used and like I have no control over the situation. I’m thinking of asking the management office to have the locks changed tomorrow while I’m at work, before she gets home (if she comes home tomorrow at all).\nI’ve really tried to be civil and helpful through this and I don’t want to make a move that is going to hurt the kid but I’m sick of her using me and my place on her whim.

      "description": "So me and my best friend (we'll call him Aaron) have been friends for a very long time and have been with each other through thick and thin. I honestly consider him my other half and know him inside and out.\n\nNow I've always known that Aaron was depressed at least some extent because he always talks about it, which wasn't a bad thing...at first. He would always talk about how depressed he was and how much he hates his life, and I would be there to listen to him and advise him to see a therapist or at the very least try and get some anti depressants. I was there for him so fucking much. There were plenty of nights when he was drunk in the bathtub and I sat there talking to him for hours on end about how much I loved him and how I supported him, and thought that he should see someone about this because he needed help and I wasn't qualified to help him in the serious way he needed.\n\nThings started changing though when he started kind of shoving it in my face. There was one night when he cut himself and the next morning he wore a short sleeves shirt and kept the cuts facing me practically all day. When I noticed it I flipped my shit and told him that wasn't the right way to deal with what he's going through. And yes I told someone about it and they tried talking to him too but it was just kind of in one ear out the other. \n\nAnd then it just kind of got worse, he didn't cut himself again but he would start like digging his nails into his palms or slapping a rubber band on his wrist always in front of me. While we drive he'll sigh really deeply and just look like he's in a piss mood or something. At first I would ask y'know \"hey what's going on?\" And he would fight me on telling me but then eventually let it out and it would turn into this big thing.\n\nAt this point I can't help but feel like he does it for attention. Which is common, I know, but I get so tired of it when he makes passing comments like \"yeah, I sped on this street the other day because I wanted to crash into a tree\" and just stuff like that. \n\nIt might have to do with me spending less time with him too. I have a pretty time consuming job and a boyfriend I like to see too, and now when he asks me to hang out he says \"I need someone here because I might do something\". Of course I always go, but I feel like it puts a lot of pressure on me. \n\nI feel bad because I know he has some kind of problem and I've tried so hard to help him to no avail, and honestly I'm just fucking tired of hearing about it at this point, and could care less. Does that make me an asshole?\n\n",

She left behind a daughter, but she had no family left nearby, and so stayed with my gf's family until custody could be worked out. As a part of this, they got her old cell phone, it didn't have a code on it, but it's battery was dead, and it was an older model. My gf asked me if I knew where to get a charger for it, and I had one laying around. I brought it over, and they got into the phone, but it was too late before I realized that my gf's mom had no intention of telling the daughter that they had the phone or letting her see it.

      "description": "Hello, first time posting here.\n\nThis is quite a complicated situation, I will try to keep it short.\n\nSo, I met this girl on a video game a while ago (about 9 months). We got really close very fast and kept spending all of our time together. We got closer and closer and I started developing feelings for her. We were as close - heck even closer than a lot of couples. She acted like my girlfriend in every way, but kept saying she didn't have any feelings. She was jealous and didn't want me to talk to other girls, she was overly attached and if I had to do leave her for even 15min she would hate it. I stopped going out because she said she would feel lonely. \n\nAnyways, the months went by and I've always been good to her. I was kind, but she started getting more and more ... disrespectful. Getting mad - and I mean real mad - at me for the slightest little detail, even when it wasn't done on purpose. Like, asking her to repeat something. We were always on Discord, and sometimes she talked too far from her mic, and I would ask her to come again. She would get mad at me and blame me for ruining her evening. And this is just an example from a long list of small things for which she would completely overreact.\n\nNow, I understood that she was under a lot of stress and that she is a very emotional person. So I kept calm and accepted this because I loved her and the good times were worth those inconveniences.\n\nAlright I am finally getting to the point. So, because she had no friends, I wanted her to be friends with my group of friends. Everything was fine, she was happy about it. But then she had two big arguments with two of my friends. The first one was because she felt attached, and my friend thought she was disrespectful to his girlfriend. Which I agree with. All I wanted to do is to cool things of and not get angry at anyone. So I talked to her about it but she kept saying she wanted to leave and that she hated me for defending him, although I kept supporting her. She accepted to stay only if I talked to that friend less often.\n\nThe second time, was with another friend. They had a debate about meat (she's a vegetarian and my friend a meat loved that knows a lot about the subject from his studies). Both of them are bad at debating. So it got heated pretty quick, I started defending her because this time, my friend went a bit too far. He later came to talk to me about it and I told her, so she went on to face him herself, but by being a prick. This time she got mad at me for not being more angry towards my friend even though they both had their wrongs. Again, I defended her and supported her, but she wanted to leave unless I stopped talking to him.\n\nThere were other instances where she had issues with my friends but they weren't as dramatic, but she hated the fact that she would get \"stepped on\". Now recently, my friends made fun of me - not in a mean way - because I was in the friendzone. It wasn't the first time they made fun of me, but that's just how it is between us, there were no ill intentions in any way. But she felt like I kept getting stepped on, and disrespected. So this time she went ahead and confronted them. You know how it ended, she wanted me to stop talking to them aswell.\n\nI was stupid enough to try and do it because I was too blind. And it got worse between us. She started saying really mean things that hurt a lot without hesitation whenever she got mad. And it happened a lot. For the same reasons as before.\n\nSo I decided to step up and talk about it. And tell her that she was making me regret choosing her over my friends. She told me she would delete me if I ever talked to them ever again. And here we are.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling her that? \n\nSorry for the really long post, but I could rant on forever ...",

But I’ve been there longer than everybody by 3 years at LEAST, even my own boss, except for one other co worker. I have also been a teachers assistant at another  center for two years before. So in total around 6.5 years. i also have all my certifications required. I know I’m pretty young. But I still  Think i deserve seniority at my work. I don’t have kids and I’m not married (yet. I do have a long term boyfriend though and DO want kids) but for some reason it’s held against me. I’m not mad when people call out of work for their sick child. Or need a day off for a dentist appointment. I’m not mad for people taking a random weekend off. Or a mental health day or even a fun day! I’ve had coworkers just say they said fuck it and went to the beach. It’s not like I tell on them either. That’s not really what I care about. But I am super super pissed because I’ve  been working a 6-2 schedule with no break (that I love and is great for me)and my coworkers   think THEY deserve it! From they work more \nhours than me, which no they just work different hours. They have kids I don’t. 1 rude.... 2 we close at 6 weekdays. I’ve worked my shift straight for over a year. And random or shitty schedules the other years. Totally fine. I don’t mind no break and I LOVE the schedule and my boss knows it. I’ve worked there so long and have always wanted it. I’ve never complained about having it. Never complained about anything at all!!!!’Nobody has had anything better to say then they just want it. I think I deserve it since Ive been there the longest and always had the bullshit schedules. I have been at my job forever  have NEVER complained about anything!! My boss has asked me a few times if my schedule is okay, wearing me out, etc and I’ve told her every single time to keep my schedule. Etc. then this week she switched me to 9–6 and my new coworker to MY shift!! I’m honestly so angry and want to tell her to switch me back or I quit. I know this is long and rambling. But aita for telling my boss (I’ll give her say a week or 2) to switche back or I’m just gonna quit ",

      "description": "I'm gonna start off by saying that I'm pretty sure I'm not the asshole, but I just had a shouting match with my brother where he very vehemently insisted that I was the asshole, and my opinion about myself is probably pretty biased, so I figured I'd try to get an objective answer. Also, while typing this I realized how stupid the whole situation is, but at this point I just want to vent. \n\nHere's what happened. My brother wakes me up today, a bit before 8 AM, super panicked, saying I need to help him get his car out, it's stuck in the ice. I get up, pretty groggy, and go outside to see what the situation is. His car was originally in the garage on the right side. My car was in the driveway, also on the right, but all the way at the bottom, by the road. There was an empty gap between my car and the garage, about the size of one and half cars, where my dad's car was parked before he took it to work. It seems like he pulled the car straight out (when I got there, the back of his car was touching the front of mine) and his front right tire got stuck in some ice on the rightmost side of the drive way, and the car couldn't come out. \n\nHere's the kicker. MY PARENTS VAN IS SITTING IN THE DRIVEWAY, COMPLETELY UNOBSTRUCTED. I told him to just take the van, it was free. He said no, how was my sister supposed be dropped off. I said who cares, I'll figure it out, I'm the one supposed to drop her off anyway, and honestly it doesn't matter if she misses a day or is a bit late, she's in elementary school for God's sake, especially since his class was more important ( he said he missed 3 quizzes today). Nope, he insisted on getting his car out. Whatever, I'm tired, I just woke up, I don't care. We tried pushing the car off the ice while it was in neutral, but the driveway is at in incline, and we both are scrubs, so that didn't work. \n\nNow, here is the part that may have been my fault. He suggested that we try turning my car on and backing it out, so his can just pull out. I said my car probably wouldn't turn on, its been snowed in for 3 weeks and hasn't been touched in that time and the weather in Chicago recently was horrible, minus 50 with wind chill last week, so the car had been encased in ice for weeks. I was 100% sure the battery was dead (in my defense, I had just been woken up 30 seconds ago and was still groggy and not in the best state of mind). I grabbed the shovel and  and tried shoveling around the front tire, figuring it was the best option. It didn't work. Again he suggested that we try turning my car on. I grabbed the keys, and what do you know, the cars started right up, we shoveled the snow behind it and it pulled right out. At this point, when he got his car out, it was exactly 7:58, and his class started at 8. We had spent about 2-3 minutes on this whole ordeal. \n\nWe walk back into the house, and he immediately explodes on me. No joke, he starts saying shit like, \"What the fuck is wrong with you, you piece of shit why didn't you just turn your car on the first time, you wasted so much time and now it's your fault I missed class, fuck you...\" etc. I honestly wish I was kidding and I know it probably sounds like I'm exaggerating, but as soon as we walk into the house he explodes on me, cussing me out nonstop. According to him, if I started the car the first time like he said, he'd be able to make class. Now the mature response would probably have been to just walk away, but unfortunately I'm not that mature. I immediately explode back, saying shit like, \"No, fuck you, you could've taken the van at any moment, it was right there, you're an idiot, why are you bitching at me when I woke up to help you.\" Aaaaand we end up having a giant shouting match over who was the bigger dumbass (probably both of us tbh). To summarize/add additional info:\n\n -Brothers car gets stuck in snow, he wakes me up to help him\n-There's another van free for him to use that he doesn't\n-Won't use the other van because \"I need it drop off sister in elementary school\" while I say it doesn't matter because his class (and three quizzes) is more important\n-He initially tells me to try to move my car, I try to shovel out his car instead because I thought it would be more effective (my mistake)\n-When we get back in the house he starts cussing me out and blaming me for making him miss his class because I didn't start my car when he told me to, initiating our shouting match\n-His community college is 0.6 miles away, a 2 minute drive and 11 minute walk (I googled it)\n-He spent 15 minutes trying to get his car out before he woke me up (his words not mine)\n-He couldn't go late because his professor closed the door exactly at 8 and wouldn't late latecomers in (I guess college professors do that??)\n\nWe ended up waking up my older brother, who called us both idiots and refused to take a side, which was probably a good call on his part. He still insists that it's my fault he missed class, I say it's his fault he didn't take the other car and I tried the best I could to help him and that I didn't deserved to be blamed. Looking back, after I've cooled down a bit, I'm realizing just how stupid this whole thing was, but I still think I'm in the right lol. I definitely should've taken the higher ground and not cussed back especially since I'm older ( I am 22 and he is 20) but fuck it I'm petty too. \n\nAlso he had a Reddit account and knows my username, so if you're reading this, fuck you again.",

      "description": "I have been a long-time lurker on my main account but created a throwaway to post because I don't know if my GF uses Reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened during break, and it's really been weighing on me. \n\nA few days ago, my GF and I had planned to hang out, but the day of, she said she couldn't make it because she needed to help a family member move.\n\nWe are kind of long-distance couple: I only come back home on the weekends, so hanging out is tricky for us. She also hangs out with her friends on the weekends as well and not during the week. (This comes up later in the story).\n\nThis wasn't the first time this had happened; it happened once three months back as well but she said that she was with a family member atm. So I was kind of upset that this had happened twice in a row, so I told her how I felt. We don't really have that many chances to hang out because of my weekend constraint, and most times when I try to set up a date, she's been busy. However, she hangs out with her friends on the weekends once or twice a month. We've planned out three dates, and have only been on one.\n\nDuring our conversation, I also brought up how we had only hung out once during our entire relationship (5 months now), but she had hung out with her friends 3 times in the past two weeks. After that, she's been distant, and this morning, she told me that she was upset that I brought her friends into the conversation.\n\nI felt like I was trying to make a point that she wasn't spending as much time with me, but AITA for bringing it up? Am I just jealous?\n\nI will clarify if you guys need additional info. ",

      "description": "I've known this guy for around 7 or 8 years now. For the entirety of those years he's been very demanding, condescending, and insistent that my opinion is not as valid as his is. I'm quite a shy and calm guy, so I just put up with this for the entire time. Eventually, one day, I was really sick, like couldn't leave the bed kinda sick. He calls me and asks if I wanna hang out. I say that I really don't feel well, and he goes on a rant saying that if I was a real friend, I'd come despite the fact that I was feeling so nauseous, and that it's not serious enough to not go out if I haven't gone to the hospital. I immediately block his number, and his profiles on all kinds of social media. My very close friend says that he has the right to know why I don't wanna see him again, but I feel like I've tolerated this for waaayy too long. Am I The Asshole?",

I have a 16 yo son and two daughters, 14yo and 13yo\n. \nWhen they come back from school, I take their phones and put them in my bedroom so they have no access to them. They only get to use their devices on the weekend, that includes their play station or my laptop. My son complains saying that all his friends dont have their phones or other stuff confiscated as soon as they get home. He also complains that he cant have his phone in his room overnight.\n\nThey argue that since their grades and behaviour are good (which is true, most of the time), they shouldnt be \"punished\". Im worried that if they are allowed to use their stuff they will start slipping at school.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "So in June I went on a solo backpacking trip through the balkins for two months . I've been exclusive and seeing my current girlfriend since August. I've been seeing her on and off since Januaty last year. \n\nFrom January to June we had a friend's with benefits situation going on and I really saw her as a good friend who I like hooking up with but I didn't really see myself long term with her. To clarify we've spoken about this and have established boundaries and expectations. \n\nLeading up to the trip I started to develop emotions for her but I wasn't sure if I wanted to commit to her before I left on a solo two month trip. I felt like if I wasn't a 100percent sure I would regret that decision so much. I told her this and how I was starting to feel about her but I wanted my freedom on this trip. \n\nSo when it came time for the trip we've gotten pretty close and she even drove with me and my dad to the airport to drop me off. During the two months we texted almost every day. During the course of my trip I met two girls and we ended up sleeping together. Near the end of my trip she was feeling down and insecure and asked me if I hooked up with anyone and I was honest with her. This led to her crying and a series of arguments saying I led her on, that I essentially cheated on her, and that she can't trust me. We eventually worked it out and I told her I'd commit to her that very moment and wouldn't see anyone else. \n\nNow it's April, it's been awhile and we've had wonderful times together but she uses this as leverage to every fight we've had. Shes having so much trouble letting go and I've apologized so many times and I've tried to comfort her but this just won't seem to stay in the past. Whenever we have any issues it's used as a dagger against me. She says that its not fair for me to tell her she needs to let it go and move on forward because she's the one dealing with the pain of it and that Im not carrying any emotional burdens from it. I feel that if we don't let go of this we can never heal from it. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Sorry if my formatting is terrible, I’m on mobile. \n\nSo I live on a college apartment-style dormitory, where I live in a two bed/two bathroom with a shared kitchen. I’m living with a roommate that I’ve known since high school, but our suite mates are people in college that we didn’t know very well. In the beginning, we were introducing each other and we were cool. However, throughout the year, one of the suite mates started sleeping over at his girlfriends place the majority of the time. We minded our own business per usual, but something that he did really bothered the hell out of us. \n\nEvery time he cooked, he would always leave a mess behind. I’m talking dishes in the sink, oily and dirty stove tops, and chunks of food left around the counter top from scraps. Not to mention that he leaves the dining table a mess as well, with liquid stains and food crumbs left on the table. My roommate and I hate this, but I was the most irritated, since I despise living in a dirty environment such as that. At first, I tried cleaning up after him, and asking him to clean it up every time he was finished. He said ok, but never followed through with his promise. Eventually I stopped cleaning his mess, and there were times where he would leave the mess for weeks without cleaning up. There was a time where he cooked spaghetti, and left the pot in the sink with sauce still left in it, and it left a wretched smell in the kitchen. \n\nOne day, he walks in with his girlfriend. Being sick of his shit, I said in a really stern voice “[insert suite mate’s name here], can you stop being a fucking slob and clean up after yourself?! This has been going on for months. [girlfriend of his], how do you put up with his shit??” \n\nThey just looked at me a little shocked, and then they just went in their room. I heard some arguing in their room, and she just angrily left his room. I went back into my room, and now I feel a little guilty, since I hate confrontations with people I know and I potentially could’ve ended their relationship.  AITA for calling him out in front of his girl?\n\nTL;DR dirty roommate wouldn’t clean his dishes for a long time, called him out in front of his girl, and now she’s angry with him",

      "title": "AITA for saying that some dogs can eat a vegan diet?",
      "description": "Some info: I don't eat meat and my SO does eat meat, but I think they are trying to eat less.\n\nWhat happend was that my SO sent me a link to an Instagram post. The link showed a dog and their owner giving them their vegan meal. The next pictures said that while some defended the owner, many disagreed and essentially showed someone arguing that a vegan diet is *absolutely* bad for dogs (they said that no dog could eat a vegan diet).\n\nThe whole conversation is on WhatsApp and I'll try to break it down while still getting both sides correct (everything quoted is a rough translation from German to English):\n\nMy first response was: \"Why do you hate vegans?\", because they sent similar things before, all mocking vegans. Their response: \"Can you read?\" and \"I don't hate vegans, I love animals\". So I said: \"That's why you eat them\".\n\nNext I just wanted her to stop sending me those things: \"Just stop sending me nonsense like this\", I wrote.\n\nAfter that they asked me if I would feed my dog a vegan diet and I said yes, as long as I don't see them getting unhealthy/having problems with it. They got mad because I even considered feeding them vegan food (so it seemed to me) and implying that I \"let them suffer\".\n\nThey asked \"Why is it so hard to believe that dogs need meat?\" and I said that not all dogs necessarily need meat. So they asked why I would even set them on a vegan diet, even though in nature they would still hunt other animals and eat them. I responded that I thought that it is hypocritical: feeding one animal by killing another (and also supporting the meat industry) and also that it would reduce the CO2 emissions too.\n\nAfter that the next topic seemed to occur: environment\n\nThey asked if I knew who the top CO2 emission producers are and answering their question themselves: big industries.\n\nI said that while this is true that also 18 to 40 percent of all CO2 emissions come from the meat industry (also milk and egg industries, but I forgot to write that).\n\nThey sarcastically said that I shouldn't buy cotton anymore (I only buy cotton clothes), because it's also bad for the environment. Basically I said that I can't do everything and I purposefully made a strawman saying \"Huh? You want to protect the environment, but not doing this, this, this, this, this and this? What an a-hole you are\"\n\nAfter all of that they said that I was more of a \"anti meat eater\" than they are a \"anti vegan\" or \"whatever I am\". They also wrote that I want everyone to be vegan (misunderstanding an older conversation we had), forcing it on everyone. I asked if I was a JW, going from door to door and forcing my believes onto them (sorry JWs).\n\nThis was about it. They also sometimes asked if I \"can read\" or if I'm \"a little\" stupid, though they never said stupid, just implying it.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I want to start off by saying this will not win me any favors here, but I try not to be exclusive as much as I can. I make it absolutely clear with any and all of my partners. I'm a hedonist and enjoy keeping a roster of girls as long as I'm transparent about it. And yes, I'm in it mostly for the sex and intimacy and little else. I also make this absolutely clear.\n\nJust a few hrs back I met a girl in a bar who was smoking hot, absolutely a charmer, and within an hour or so, our flirtations led to a lot more. Naturally, I invited her over to my place and things were going hot and heavy. She loved some of the fun we had (she said she had to be back for something shortly past midnight) and while texting on her cab ride back, I mentioned how sexy her ass was and that I was looking forward to having fun there. \n\nShe immediately got cold in her responses and said there mostly won't be any build up. Even when she'd had some fun times in the past and I promised her I'll do things right. I realized that it's a huge part of my sexual repertoire, I'd love to indulge in a NSA relationship only if most or all things are on the table, and told her it was a fun night but since I didn't see any escalation in places I liked or the kind of kinky stuff I wanted, we weren't as sexually compatible as I thought and to call it to an end there.\n\nHer last response was, and I quote verbatim, so you don't think I'm bullshitting: \"You really think you'll have more fun than that with someone like me? Good luck enjoying some skank's ass .. asshole and don't message me ever again.\"\n\nI'm not planning to. But am I the asshole here, really? ",

Needless to say I have a regular part timer who works when I’m not in my area.\n\nShe’s slow and in her 30s but has the mentality and acts like 10 year old. She got the job through a program at the local high school and has been here since. She’s capable of the job, we’ve seen her do it. Needless to say she doesn’t get everything done most of the time.\n\nI usually just deal with it because I understand she has a disability and I’m not an asshole but lately she’s been slacking because she knows she can get away with it. My coworkers have told me she won’t do things and say “I don’t have to because OP can just do it tomorrow.”  Lately she’s been skipping things but telling the crew leaders that she’s “finished up early.”\n\nShe did it again yesterday when I wasn’t there. Didn’t do about a third of the job and told the crew leader she was finished. So today I called my department manager and told her on her. It’s one thing to not finish because you’re disabled and have problem, it’s another to just be lazy. I’ve come to resent her as a person.\n\nAm i the asshole?",

      "description": "My friend and I have known each other for several years. We met as freshmen in college and were incredibly close until about our second year in graduate school. We spent most of our time together before that point, lived with each other for a decent  amount of time, traveled together, our families know each other, etc.\n\nGraduate school was a tough time for both us. We were both going through hardship, so we leaned on each other a lot during this time. We were increasingly in each other's space, both physical and emotional, which led to her confessing romantic feelings for me. We talked about it a great deal. I wasn't sure how I felt and communicated that, so we both moved on. Things were still comfortable, we continued our friendship as usual, and shortly after she met her fiance.\n\nHer fiance is a wonderful man. He's kind, intelligent, and treats her nicely (which is a plus, because she had dated some jerks in the recent past). He's a real people's person, and overall I enjoy his presence. I went to a couple of bars and concerts with them when they first started dating. He's great!\n\nAbout a year into dating him, she panicked. I was staying over at her house and she ended up confessing her feelings for me for hours and explaining how confused she was about the situation. She loved her boyfriend, but also me.  She tried to kiss me that night. The next morning, she didn't want to discuss what happened and vowed to never tell her then-boyfriend, now-fiance. She didn't want to tell him about that night, what she said, or the feelings she had, nothing. Okay, that's fine. I told her I was confused about my own feelings, so we promptly set boundaries. This led to us not really talking at all for about a year or so. We left grad school, she moved to another state, I moved to another country.\n\nNow we're in the present. We live relatively far apart and the incident happened years ago. We're both going through stressful situations and have been leaning on each other for support. We haven't discussed what happened in a very long time, but we talk weekly. We share our experiences in our respective homes (we both moved again).\n\nAnyway, they're engaged and though the wedding is yet to be planned (long engagement, he's a medical student), I can't help but wonder if am the asshole for not feeling comfortable with going to the wedding. We had an emotionally charged moment that I know her fiance would not be okay with. He also noticed (long ago) that I wasn't around as much as before, and asked her about it. She didnt mention what happened. I feel like there's a secret there, and that makes me uneasy. But I really do want to support them on their special day.\n\nAITA if I don't want to attend the wedding?\n\n",

      "description": "I am sad for the people Bill left behind but I’m not grieving for him. I met Bill when I was 17, Bill was 18 we knew all the same people. Bill started dating my  friend Jane a year after they met. I’ve known Jane since we were 5, she met Bill a few months after me.\n\n\n\n3 years later Bill &amp; Jane are still going out &amp; some people I know started getting into drugs, Bill was one of them. Jane was 3 months pregnant. After Bill &amp; Janes kid is born everyone who had gotten into drugs now has a drug problem.\n\n\n4 years pass in that time the drug problem has taken over their lives. Bill got Jane into drugs shortly after their kid was born. Towards the last of those years Jane got pregnant again. It’s about that time I cut contact completely from Bill, Jane &amp; everybody else doing drugs.\n\n\nFinally 4 year later (Now) I’ve had minimal contact with either of them since I cut contact. Jane got clean &amp; Bill did the same after she did. They shaped up &amp; seemed like a happy family.\n\n\nThis past Monday Bill got killed by another driver in a car accident (he was the only one in the car)\n\n\n I knew Bill for 11 years. In that time he wasn’t a great or horrible friend &amp; we spent a lot of time together. Bill ruined Janes life by getting her addicted to drugs it changed who she was. The only good thing Bill ever did was give her those kids she loves so much. I hate him for what he did and for letting his kids/family struggle in their early years. I hate looking around &amp; seeing the friends I did keep in touch with devastated by grief. So yea I’m sad but only for the people he hurt and left behind, I honestly don’t feel grief for his passing in fact I think I hate/resent him for his actions in life.\n\nTL:DR- Bill my friend of a decade died Monday, I’ve known his fiancé Jane for 20+ years. I don’t care that Bill died. Bill got himself &amp; Jane addicted to drugs and was a shitty dad in his kids early years. I do feel bad for our mutual friends, Bills wife, his kids &amp; the rest of his family. But I don’t weap for Bill in fact I think I hate/resent him for his actions in life.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n",

      "description": "Just to give you a back story on this. My relationship with my brother and my sister in law hasn’t been good for the past 6 months. \n\nRecently my brother and his wife went on vacation, and my mother and I were watching their children. My sister in laws father texts me out of the blue asking me if I am with the kids. I didn’t know his number nor was I with the kids at that time. I tell him no but I would be with the kids soon. That was the end of the conversation with him that day. \n\nThen, my brother and his wife get back from vacation and my sister in laws father calls her and tells her that I wouldn’t let him talk to the kids (which wasn’t true at all). He makes a big deal about it. I text him asking him to help me understand what happened here because I was confused. Once again I was accused of not letting the kids talk to him and that I didn’t responded to his texts quick enough (it was only 15 mins), and that I should have known what he wanted. Now, he calls back my sister in law saying that I’m rude and confrontational. I haven’t spoken with my brother or sister in law since then because I felt like my side of story didn’t matter to them. \n\nNow, fast forward a few weeks. My sons birthday is coming up. I get told through my mother the day before my sons party that my brother said his father in law is coming down for the weekend with one of his other grandchildren and they are coming to my sons birthday party. My brother didn’t ask me if his father in law could come. He just assumed it was ok. My husband and I rented a hall and paid for everything for our friends and family to come down. Why would I let someone who is not my friend or family member come to my sons birthday party after I feel like he was causing drama with me for no reason a few weeks prior to this. \n\nI told my brother that my husband and I spoke and we don’t want any extra guests at our sons party and we were sorry if that meant my brother and his family couldn’t come. This in turn caused chaos and fights with my family, especially my mother, (who called me self centered and selfish), and I was so upset at my sons party that I felt like I couldn’t even enjoy it. So AITA? \n",

      "description": "Last week our neighbor begged me to watch her daughter two hours before she had to leave. I was at home anyway and had the kids for the whole day. I promissed my kids the day before, that we would watch Guardians of the Galaxy (they allways wanted to see Groot and Rocket in action). Since the movie is okish for kids, and I was sitting there to pause or explain stuff if something needed explaining I didn't see a problem. So I informed the mother that I would take care of her kid and that we would watch a movie that is pg12 but that I think can be watched by a 9 year old without problem. And that I even would let my boys (5) watch it with us ...\nThe mother seemed stressed, said something like \"yea whatever, thanks, I'll send her by two o'clock and went away....\"\nSo the girl came at two. I went to the park with the kids, played hide and seek, and some soccer. We went home, I made smoothies, fruit and Pop Corn. Then I talked to the girl (who doesn't watch TV at home at all), to make sure she was ok with the movie, that I could play something else with her, and if we would watch it and she would feel fear or overwhelmed she just should say something and I would pause it and we would just do something else ...\nShe watched the movie, she loved it, she was really happy. My kids, specially the boys loved it to. Everyone was happy. Then came the mother, took her happy child home... the day after she informed my wife that she won't bring her kid to us anymore when I am arround because I only put the kids in front of the TV and show them inapropriate content... Well apart that her statement is not true, it made me think if I should have showed the movie to my kids ... I came to the conclusion that it is totally ok for my kids who are used to TV and cinema (I'm a Film Art MA, so a big movie nerd...). but might be troublesome for other kids the same age with less experience (visual/narrative knowledge). But I just didn't want to change the plans ... I think I behaved right, but just to hear other voices, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "It was last week when I was in an arcade gaming session with a friend of mine and two strangers, one of which is a kid as per title.\n\nThe game was a racing game. Normally, all players in the same session must consent for brake blocking before the game starts. \n\nBrake blocking, unlike normal blocking, slows down opponent's car a lot and makes it harder to catch up. Such maneuver also drags out the game session, making it longer than normal. On top of this, such move is almost inescapable and render both players vulnerable to other players' cars catching up.\n\nBut this kid proceed to engage in brake blocking against said friend without talking to anyone of us. I used my own defensive maneuver too which is part of normal gameplay, but I never brake blocked him.\n\nSaid friend ended up lost against the kid while I got 3rd place behind the two of them with razor thin margins. Said friend stormed off to another cabinet. I thought he was pissed off on me, prompting me to ask why. It turned out that he was pissed off at the kid for the brake blocking gameplay.\n\nThus, I talked to the kid's dad about how his gameplay is unacceptable. He seemed to understand my concern, but I doubt that the kid is willing to listen as he seemed to be unfazed by my remarks.\n\nWIBTA if we meet again in the future and call him out straight away when he's doing the same thing again instead of telling his dad for a second time?",

When my mom remarried she created a new last name with my step father, but I elected to keep my last name at the time (I was about 10/11) when this was happening. I’m getting close to being 20 years old now and I want to change my last name, but not to the one they made up, but the original family name my mom has before she married my birth father. Not even really for the reason of me connecting to the name more, but honestly because I like the sound of it more. But my mom feels like if I were to change my last name it should be to the one they made up so I will continue that name instead of one that is being continued by my mom’s brother and his family.

      "description": "For reference we have been dating for almost 6 months now and everything is amazing about the relationship except this one issue. She won't tell her family we are together. Her family is very religious and she follows the religions beliefs, but very very loosely. She refuses to tell her family about the fact that we are dating because she is very worried that her family will kick her out if the house and that her church will kick her out as well. \n\nThose are very valid concerns and I understand them, however I have offered reasonable accommodation for if those things happen. For instance, I have my own house and I have told her I would like for her to move in with me, she can even bring her dog too, I have no issue with it. If she is kicked out of her church I told her I will help her find another church to worship at. She still will not tell them and it's beginning to impact my self-esteem immensely. \n\nHer parents know that something is going on because several nights a week she will stay at my place and won't go home. She tells them she is staying with her best friend who is about to move to another country for a PHD program. The excuse can only last for so long as the friend moves in April. I've been thinking she needs to come clean and tell them so that I don't lose the respect of her parents entirely. \n\nOver the last few weeks I have been pushing the envelope a bit so to speak and have been asking her when she is going to tell her family so that we can take the next step in the relationship (moving in together). Her response is that I'm pressuring her too much and I'm making her feel shitty because I'm \"putting her on a timeline\". So I guess the real question is... AITA? ",

I'm terrified of encouraging overeating but I don't know how to properly do this. I can't just ask her doctor. She's not my child. And online forums are very against making a child eat when they don't want to. I've done in front of my brother and sister in law and they don't seem to mind. But I still feel a little guilty.

      "description": "Long. Here is backstory:\n\nOkay, last year, my BF's parents lost their house and had to move. They moved back to their hometown of Vegas. I stayed so I could finish school. Anyway, i finished, and moved out with the beginning of November.\n\nRight after I moved in, my BF's Dad got extremely sick. He passed away Dec. 24th. Their lease was up in January, and the only person working at that time was by boyfriend (he has two other brothers. One was 20, the other 26 (neither of which have ever lived on their own), my bf 27. So, a 7 household, with about $300 a week to get groceries and pay the bills my boyfriend and I owned. \n\nSo, we were in a mad dash and me and my boyfriend ended up having to take out a $3000 loan to be able to get a place to stay Utah (where my boyfriend and I both had jobs lined up immediately). Still paying that off... \n\nAnyway, so my boyfriend works 50 hours a week, I work 40 and we buy $800 in groceries every month, and $1600 for rent and utilities. Not to mention our own personal bills that we need to pay which is about $3000.\n\nSo for the first month, the younger brother S gave us a total of $250. then nothing after that, and that was in Feb. (backstory: this kid is fucking dumb-ass belligerent drunk that is fucking crazy. I absolutely hate him. He's an idiot. He drinks ALL the time, screams outside at midnight, talks shit to the neighbors, punches holes in the wall, cannot keep a job for more than ONE day. he has court hearings for punching a guy, littering, paraphernalia, missing a hearings).\n\nAlso, there are four bedrooms. My boyfriend's mom gets her own room, his two brothers get their own room and me and my bf share one room with our two kids. In our house. So I told my bf that he needs to tell S that he needs a job, needs to pay us $400/month (which I think is generous considering that we buy aboslutely EVERYTHING \\[and he never does anything. no cleaning, no dishwashing, absolutely NOTHING\\]) or his stuff I will personally throw his shit outside and he can sleep on the couch so that MY kids can have their own room.\n\nExcept my boyfriend says noooo, they need to save up, we cant charge that much. \n\nAnd doesn't give a shit that we are drowning in debt, and some help would be great help, so that WE can start saving up. UGH. \n\nWIBTA",

      "title": "AITA for being (really) cold to my sister?",
      "description": "A little context to start. This is a long one. TLDR at the bottom.  \n\n\nMy sister is a drug addict in rehab (3rd time in 10-15 years). Has 2 children with an ex-husband and 1 child with a drug user she met, got pregnant and then left as he was beyond abusive. While she was sober, she did a lot to assist with our dad (divorced from mother) who had passed a few years ago. Her and I are the executors and beneficiaries of his estate. Most of which has been dealt with, but there is a storage locker of personal belongings we are currently going through.  \n\n\nWhen we were growing up, I was pulling her out of drug houses on a regular basis (I was 14 at the time, She was 18) I had reached a point in which I could not help her anymore and told her, when she called me from the hospital after overdosing. I tried so much to get her out of that world and couldn't allow it to take over my life.   \n\n\nAt this stage in our lives, we were both doing what we could to assist with our late father and the many health appointments he had. I had met my current wife and we were pregnant with our first child.  We were both there taking him to his appointments, grocery shopping, cleaning his house and just being there to keep him company. I will fully admit that I do feel my sister took on the brunt of the tasks involved, but I was still there as well. Our father named her his POA so she was the only one who had access to making decisions on his behalf. I knew that I needed to focus a bit more on my wife and our pregnancy, so I did what I could, but would put it closer to my sister doing 70-75% of the work with our father and me picking up the pieces.  \n\n\nMy sister let this effect her life. I am grateful that she helped our father so much, but in this time she dedicated more to our father than she did her marriage and kids. This led to a divorce, falling back into old habits (drugs) and blowing through her portion of the inheritance on drugs and alcohol. This is also when the abusive drug user boyfriend came into her life.  When it came time to our father passing, we were in the hospital together (including her drug addict boyfriend, who came up to hug me before my wife could).  \n\n\nAfter our fathers passing and 90% of the estate being sorted, she disappeared with her new boyfriend. Got pregnant, had the baby, did drugs. I had to call Social Services multiple times in fear of the kids safety. I did what I could to keep the kids safe, as did everyone else in our very small family.  \n\n\nSo about 2 years pass with minimal contact, other than the odd phone call or hearing something awful through family friends (IE - Social services showing up at her house, kids in their car seats in the car and open cans of beer in the car, the drug addict boyfriend using crack in front of the newborn,  the drug addict boyfriend abducting my sister, breaking her arm, while the newborn was in the car.) this list could go on and on and on. Both sides of the relationship making poor decisions and judgement calls resulting in their safety being compromised, let alone the children....  \n\n\nShe is no longer seeing the abusive boyfriend, she is \"in a rehab program and therapy\", but she is making my life hell trying to get the storage locker organized. I prepaid 6 months on the storage locker a year an a half ago. After the time I prepaid expired, she was to take over payments for 6 months as well. I had to call in constantly to verify that the locker was being paid for. She had let 3 months pass without payment which I had to organize to prevent us from losing our fathers possessions. In the last year and a half, I have paid around 10-11 months worth of storage fees and it was getting to be too much for me to afford. I put pressure on her saying that we were going to lose the possessions due to her negligence. I had also paid for the additional time, I paid for rental vehicles to remove general, non-important or sentimental items from the locker (IE - Dishes, pots &amp; pans, old clothes, etc) to give us the ability and space in the locker to actually sort through the important things. I put 30-40 hours into this locker alone so it was in a state that we could actually accomplish sorting through the important things.  \n\n\nI've waited and waited and waited to give her time to help me sort through the locker. I roughly gave her 4 months on my dime, and 30-40 hours of my time waiting for her to be free to help me go through the hard stuff in the locker. She ended up paying a portion back, which was nice. I'm still about 250$ down on everything, but it's better than it was. She did manage to give me \"a full weekend of help\" sorting through it all, which turned out to be an hour and a half of just going through what I had pulled. Worrying about donating old tools (boxes of rusted nails and bolts, nothing worth keeping.) Yet she proclaimed (because she needed money) that we need to sell it all. I agreed with some bigger things (power tools, electronics, ipad) but basically said \"Fuck this box of old rusty screws\"  \n\n\nWe found roughly $15 in change in a bag. She was adamant about splitting this right there and then as she was broke and needed the $7.50. I said fuck it, you can have it all.  \n\n\nShe has still not given me any time, or any help sorting through the locker. I have decided to say \"Fuck it, I'm done\".  \n\n\nI've messaged her telling her specific dates in which I will be accessing the locker, taking a few personal items for myself, taking a few personal items for people that were close to him, documenting everything and sending her the information. Other than that, I told her \"I want nothing to do with you\". She agreed using much more colorful language and telling me I didn't help with anything when our father passed and that \"I'm a selfish loser\" with \"No respect\" how she's glad to \"Have one less toxic person in her life\"  \n\n\nAs an FYI - I can still see  2 of the 3 kids through the ex husband. With that being said I also don't really want anything to do with the 3rd kid. Which is an asshole thing to say as the kid is still family and will be raised in a far shittier situation than anyone had hoped. My wife and I actually talked about adopting the child, but think we would only do that if we were able to remove my sister from the picture completely.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole for removing her from my life? Am I the asshole for taking care of myself and other people in my Fathers life but not caring what happens with my sister at this point?  \n\n\nTLDR: Drug addict sister (currently \"in rehab\", or so I'm told) and I are the executors and beneficiaries of our late fathers estate, which only has sentimental items left to sort through. My sister has essentially destroyed every relationship with the family. I've decided I'm done as well. She will only get sentimental stuff if she puts in the effort and money, which I am not willing to do for her anymore. I'll be clearing out important stuff from storage for myself and close friends to our father, with or without her help. If she doesn't do anything, she will lose everything she might want of our fathers. I also dislike her baby that she had with an abusive crackhead.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for slowly cutting off a girl who has dated my two best friends?",
      "description": "The aforementioned girl has dated my two closest friends who I've known since elementary school. We became friends in middle school, but we were never very close. She is nice and hasn't done anything personally to hurt me, but both the break-ups were on bad terms and had negative effects on both of my best friends. I'll admit my friends were partially responsible for the bad break-ups, yet I've known them for most of my life and highschool relationships are very different from post-highschool relationships. My first friend had dated her for 2 years between middle school and highschool. My first friend had developed a second and noticable love interest for a second girl, but did not pursue it until breaking up with the original girl. The relationship between her and my second friend seemed rather pointless to her. My second friend is very introverted and kind of shy and doesn't like to displease people. The relationship ended up being very mentally and emotionally damaging to him as she would never leave him alone and abuse his God given kindness. It became very difficult to get him away to hangout with us despite voicing his displeasure. When she broke up with him it was hard on him, and the way she said it was very casual and callous, she added the break up to the end of a conversation they were having on a date. After ending the relationship with my second friend she started getting really forward with me, she would always be asking to take pictures and find reasons to hug me or just make physical contact with me. In the end I don't think she's flirting based off her other social interactions, but I still feel like the timing of the change in character must be connected. Between the two of my friends, her, and me, it has been akward to stay in contact with her as she and I participate in similar activities making our encounters unpleasant. She's really nice and doesn't deserve poor treatment, and I don't blame her for the bad relationship with my other friends.  AITA for feeling uncomfortable in her pressince, and actively blowing her off and avoiding her because of it. I don't hate her but talking to her feels like walking in a mindfield, and I have similar personality to my second friend and the way I've ended up treating her makes me feel awful.",

We live together so it isn’t often that we are apart, but she’s spending the week at her mother’s. Our text conversation got a little sexual and I decided to send a couple of pictures.\n\nShe tells me that she’s no longer in the mood, and was hurt I would send the same dick pics that I had cheated on her with. I did send pictures to several girls black out drunk earlier this year, but there is no doubt that was an asshole move and I have profusely apologized. However, I thought we had moved past this. I don’t use the photos often, was I just supposed to delete them all and take new photos specially for her? The conversation was already sexual in nature so I didn’t have that time to work with. \n\nAm I really the asshole here, or have we not made as much progress as I thought since the dick pic incident?",

Anyways fast forward almost a year later and i have spent close to 8 month with my current girlfriend, she's great, makes me happy and all the other stuff you hear from a guy in a happy relationship but last week my ex had 2 deaths in her family, i obviously felt sorry for her and for some reason i had been thinking about her a lot that week so i decided to send her sympathy flowers. She got the flowers, knew it was me who sent them and started thanking me through text, fast forward to today where we are now basically back to the way we were a couple years back, I've noticed slight flirting from her but nothing too serious but I've not told my girlfriend that me and my ex are talking again and are roughly on a good basis, she hates my ex for all that she did to me and i worry that she'll think that i'm cheating on her with this woman (which she has a history of doing that).",

We work different shifts and do not live together so we typically only see each other one or two days during the week. \n\nWe call/time/FaceTime throughout the week and when my SO is feeling frisky, she’ll send me nude photos and we’ll engage in some sexy talk/sext. \n\nYesterday while I was at work, I got a notification that she had sent me a photo. \n\n“Oh hell yeah,” I think as I open it and see a photo of my SO’s lady bits. \n\nHowever as I’m looking at it something catches my eye. On closer inspection I notice it’s a tampon string. \n\nI reply with a “?” And she asks what’s wrong. \n\nI point out the string and she doesn’t see what the big deal is. She tells me I’m shaming her for something she can’t control. I tell her I’m not, but that I don’t want to see that. \n\nWe argue throughout the night about this, and she didn’t pick up my phone calls last night.

      "description": "I am very confused and just want some genuine feedback , Thanks!\n\nContext: My friend's GF and I were really close friends up until this point. For this story i'll call my friend luke and his GF chell. (Nowhere near their real names) Also I'm Bisexual , that will be important later on.\n\nSo for this to make sense I have to start at the beginning. Basically , Me and chell were friends since  kindergarden and up until now we never had any arguments or troubles between us. However last year I asked her \"Do you Wanna Be my Girlfriend?\" Which  she  Replied  \"No , Sorry.\" To be honest , I was heartbroken , but I brushed it off and pretended like it never happened. People around us and in our friend group teased us about it and we still joke about it to this day but we carried on being friends. At the end of the year had asked her , \"Do you want to be my Girlfriend?\" and she said \"No.\". At this point I was mad , not only had I overheard her talking to her friends about how she thought that I was \"Funny\" ,  but she had also flirted with me  before. Not to mention the fact that we were such close friends. Shortly after this , she sorta fazed out of my friend group. We still sat near each other but didn't talk as much , and finally the end of the year came. Fast forward to start of this year , she has a \"Boyfriend\". Which was fake , and most likely just made up to ensure that I didn't ask her if she wanted to be my girlfriend again. I felt kind of insulted , especially that after us knowing each other for years , she wouldn't even give me another chance. \"That's fine\"\nI thought to myself , I've seen examples of people Being \"Just Friends\" and still having a very nice friendship so I wasn't too worried. Around this time I had also \"Came out\" to my friend (Luke) telling him that I was Bisexual. After her attempt at having a fake boyfriend ,(Which everyone found out) , I decided ,     \"Welp , if I can't get a girl might as well find a guy.\" While I was trying to figure out ways to Ask my friend out, The universe gives me a huge middle finger , Chell and Luke become a couple. Not only was I mad because they Are/Were two of the only people in my school that I was attracted to , but they had NOTHING in common! I Won't go into the details but trust me when I say NOTHING in common. I Honestly hate her , no doubt about it. ",

He said he needed to say it because it's been bothering him and triggering his depression, so I figured we could try to work through it since he wasn't trying anything. Fast forward, he would stay stuff like he kept hoping I liked him back and referring to things I did with him and for him as a friend. I felt pretty low because it didn't feel like a genuine friendship and that he was just staying friends because he hoped something would happen. On a couple occasions, he mentioned that he could treat me better and that he would hope that my bf and I would break up, but he would feel remorse for feeling that way. He said he started to have panic attacks, was drinking more, smoking more, etc. It was a very touchy thing for me because I didn't want to make his depression worse. I said we should just stop talking because it's the healthiest thing to do. He's in most of my classes and avoids me and our mutual friends. My friends started asking me what happened because they were bothered that they were being ignored. After a while, I told them because I was frustrated at the guilt I was feeling for something that didn't seem like it was my fault. I told him I wouldn't tell anyone after everything, but I couldn't take it. I felt guilty for straining their friendship and for cutting off a good friend and causing him pain. I needed to feel justified in why I did it and I didn't want my friends thinking I was a jerk. ",

      "description": "Hi all, I \\[19F\\] am spending vacation in Florida with some family for my grandma's 80th birthday. She has struggled financially her whole life and my dad and aunt saved up to pay for a family trip to celebrate this milestone for her. My grandma is easily upset by conflict, so my parents told me and my sister beforehand that we need to keep the peace and do whatever we can to keep grandma happy since this vacation is such a big deal to her. Seems reasonable. \n\nMy aunt (dad's sister) married rich a few years ago. My uncle is now a facet of our family--and at many times, not exactly a welcome one. He has some hot takes regarding politics and has a bit of a drinking problem. At family dinners, he'll drink a whole bottle of wine and become totally incoherent. My mom, dad, sister and I take turns for who has to sit next to him at dinners each night because he gets so obnoxious. I drew the short straw tonight and sat next to him at dinner.\n\nHe pulled his usual routine of drinking the whole bottle and started blabbering to me about something that made no sense. I zoned out a few times, and each time, he would grab my shoulder or arm to get my attention again. This made me extremely uncomfortable. I didn't want to make a scene at dinner so I spoke to my parents about it afterwards. They replied with, \"Well, pay attention to him next time!\" \n\nI got pissed and told them that he should know better than to grab people and that they have no business excusing his behavior. I was furious that they were asking me to put aside my agency and comfort to avoid causing conflict at dinner. I called a friend from home who told me that I was within my right to be angry, but now I'm not sure, especially because I don't want to make this trip any more difficult for the family.\n\nAm I the asshole for being mad about this? If he starts doing this again, will I be the asshole for telling him to stop (especially if my grandma is there?) ",

Most of the family will be making it this year ( around 24 people) which is unusual since everyone is so scattered. This makes my sisters, my mom, and my grandma super happy so they’re going extra hard on the cooking. It’s supposed to be a nice thanksgiving. The problem is my brother. He’s a good guy, but has very annoying habits that would ruin the event. He’s always high. You can tell in his eyes and how he just smells like weed. In the last few years he’s been smoking all the time. I called him yesterday to invite him and his girlfriend. I told him to not smoke and get his shit together for one day. I also told him to tell his gf too. His GF is a total dope. I don’t think she even works. ",

So when our case manager/RA came and told us WE ALL had to get kicked out because of one person it kinda shocked me because I never really knew what he was doing up until that point.\n\nSo here I am now and I already took pictures of the holes and texted it to my RA because I don't wanna be homeless again and kicked out of a nice apartment complex because of someone else.

      "description": "Lot's of stuff to unpack here...using a throwaway as per the rules. \n\nSo BIL is an employee of one of the bigger porn production houses. This year at CES he got to take home one of the brand new, yet to hit the market full VR systems. This weekend he asked me and my wife if we'd like to come over and see it. \n\nHis company does a lot of parody, shorts and \"joke\" films that are never released to the public at large rather just short videos as time killers, birthday presents for employees, lighting tests, that sort of thing...need to throw that in here. \n\nSo we did all the standard stuff with the VR like roller coaster, hang-gliding, mountain climbing. He asked me if I'd like to see one of his companies brand new VR shoots. My wife would never care if I did this but she was like super enthusiastic for me to try it out. So I was like sure. \n\nSo I went in his bathroom and got it all working and a huge name porn star is talking about how she's a been a bad step daughter and needs to make it up to daddy. Not really my thing but it was definitely got me going. All of the sudden from behind there was a male voice saying something like \"and yeah, I'm daddy and this is YOUR punishment big guy.\" So I turned around and there was this huge, fat harry guy with a full erect penis acting like he was going to take me from behind. \n\nSo I am a molestation survivor. I was never raped but I had some extremely traumatic experiences at the hands of a male family friend. The guy in the video didn't really look like him but it was a enough to trigger a severe emotional response in me. My wife knows this about me, my BIL doesn't as far as I know. \n\nSo scrambled to the get the VR system off my head and in the process ended up knocking them against what was probably the counter and the shower rod. The screen didn't shatter but they are completely non functional. \n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom my wife and BIL were laughing their asses off until I told them about breaking the VR. Then my BIL started freaking out that he didn't even own the system and since it's a working prototype he's going to be out a shit ton of money or even get fired. My wife completely took his side even though I explained to both of them how traumatic it was. They kept trying to say that if I would have just waited for 30 seconds I would have seen the video was a joke. I told them that I didn't have 30 seconds and explained to my BIL about my past. Neither one of them had an sympathy. \n\nMy BIL thinks I should pay for the system, my wife thinks I need to sell some company stock because I'm the one that broke it. I think they shouldn't have screwed around with me like that. \n\nbasically, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'm fifteen, with a black friend\n\nWe were learning about slavery and segregation this semester, and it's a touchy subject for everyone. I have a close friend, who comes around to my house because I get terrible marks in history. She has always helped me study- which I'm eternally grateful for because I've moved up twice in history class with her help. She has strong views, but we both joke about the darkest subjects. Even so, I don't joke about with slavery when I'm around her- not to be malicious, but I believe if I were to, it could make both of us uncomfortable if I over stepped it.\n\n She was joking about a lot of things, but I just kinda shut them down with a \"haha\" \"yeah\". It continued for a while, but I was feeling less anxious seeing how open she was with the subject. We had gotten to a Boy in the book, I can't remember his name, but he had been beaten and killed by white people for hitting on this girl in the store. I think he might've been showing off to his white friends? But it's very vague. \n\nOnce we got to the end of the homework, she started packing up, and asked me to apologise jokingly. I held the same joking tone, and said no- but I was smiling, just like her. Her face kinda dropped, and she asked me why rather seriously. I  had said that I didn't do anything, and while it may have been my ancestors, I don't feel inclined to apologise for something I didn't do directly, nor indirectly. She had packed up quietly, leaving this awkward silence.\n\nThe next day in school, before I even sat down in home room, I was wanted in the office immediately. So, I got dismissed, walked down the corridor, and passed her on the way in. I got this whole lecture about how they do not tolerate racist remarks by the principle, and if I would not fix my attitude they will. The thing that stood out the most is I had been removed from photography club, and that my friend and he both agreed that was a suitable punishment. I have anxiety, and photography is my saving grace- the only time I'm sociable. She knows how much meant to me. I also had to write a page long apology to her, which I refused. I tried to tell him what happened, but he sent me out and said he didn't want to hear from the rest of the day.\n\nI got really angry and defensive to my other friends, because she had told them I was a racist. I wanted to go home, but they refused to dismiss me, so I decided to just walk out of the main office. The reception had to open the door, or they wouldn't let you in. So knocked on, and I walked through reception, to the outside door, and went home. They tried to stop me, but they can't once I'm out the gate.\n\nTomorrow I have to go back in, but I'm considering writing the apology to my friend. I don't want to, but Idk what to do. Or even if I am the a-h? I know I just escelated the situation by leaving the school grounds, but I was angry that she blew a whole joke out of context.",

      "description": "For some backstory, I'm 21 always been supported by my mom. I'm not gonna lie, she pays the rent for the house that I've lived in and for that I feel like a mooch. I'm not proud of it but I'm still dependent on her because I'm still attending college. I depend on her for shelter but I do not let her pay for anything else, mainly just shelter and food. I've always been thankful to her for this but she's always been very abusive to me, verbally and physically but stopped when I hit my teens. I can tell that she loves me but she is a first generation immigrant from Asia, she thinks providing beating children and verbally attacking her kids is an okay way with raising us.\n\nNow I've always had a step dad since I was around 5, he's lived with us but he has never treated me like a son or someone that he cares about. He would constantly start verbally harassing me after he lost his job. I'm guessing because he feels inadequate as a man? Don't know. He's the reason why my older brother left the house, he judged my brother for being homosexual. I love my brother, I never forgave him for this. He has two kids that are my half siblings and he treats them very well. He has no job and completely dependent on my mom. I'm honestly not okay with that but that is her life and I can't say anything because then I'd be a hypocrite. One day he got mad at me because I brought home pizza that was ordered by my girlfriend. It wasn't for me, but she was hungry and bought a pizza for us. My half siblings are usually fed by my step dad but recently he hasn't had ANY money so doesn't seem to be able to provide for them. He started cussing me out for not thinking about my siblings and also buying them food but I kept telling him I didn't buy this. I can't provide for them daily, I don't have the money. This made him more angry and usually I bite my tongue but I couldn't and told him to go fuck himself. He pushed me into a cabinet and busted my head, I started bleeding and my mom came home. At first she was angry at him and kicked him out the house but a week later she broke and let him lived here again. I gave her an ultimatum of choosing letting him live here or I would leave the house. I don't feel safe with him here, he's much larger than me. She chose to let him live here and I didn't handle that very well. I started to verbally attack her in the sense that I told her she was a terrible mother for ever picking a man over her child. I admit, that was wrong of me but I was just so angry. I'm now in process of moving out, but I don't have much of a savings (around $1000 USD) but I just can't live in this household anymore. Lately I've noticed she's been extremely depressed because of this but I just can't forgive her. Not at the current moment. Thank you for reading...",

      "description": "I’ve been involved with my current girlfriend for about 3 months now. She has a one year old daughter whom I respect &amp; even adore, however I can’t shake the fact that I am absolutely NOT a kid person. \n\nI knew of her daughter before we got together, in fact she mentioned being worried it would make me no longer interested in her when she first told me, which I thought was silly despite my distaste for children because thinking back on it at the time, I kept myself open to the possibility of dating someone with a child (or children) regardless, AND I have always said, if I were to ever have a child, I would want to have a daughter.\n\nNow we’re 3 months in, and she is very clearly super family oriented, and I am the complete opposite. Recently she brought up wanting to have another baby, and was disappointed to hear that my reaction wasn’t very supportive. (I was supportive of her decision, but I made it clear that that wasn’t something I personally was ready for). Even more recently, she complained about feeling like there was some kind of “barrier” between myself and her daughter. \n\nI try my hardest to be nice, and show some kind of affection towards her daughter, and sometimes it doesn’t even feel forced, but most times it does to be honest just because well...I just plainly am not a kid person. I don’t have whatever it is needed in me to interact with children, and to be completely honest I find them to be a bother most times. Knowing this, I feel sorta like an asshole because I came into this knowing she had a child, knowing I can’t stand children, and now I’m unsure of where this relationship could even go if I can’t learn to be more of a kid person or more family oriented.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for even starting this relationship? Should I try to become more of a kid person, or is that even possible? ",

I know that they won't accept me because when my two gay cousins came out, she said that if they were her sons, she'd kill them. I'm also the middle child and I was always the difficult to raise. \n\nIn short, I was cared about much.\n\nWhen I was younger, it used to haunt me. I was always trying to look for their praise by being independent. As I grew older, I stopped looking for them to support me. \n\nI stopped caring a long time ago. Maybe it was in second grade when I stopped getting attention and I started doing my own thing. Maybe it was in 8th grade, when we stopped talking to each other. Or maybe its now in 9th grade, when I came to terms with what I want and what I don't want in my life.\n\nWhatever it was, I stopped caring about what they thought of me.\n\nEven my sisters agree that our parents don't even like me. But I'm not bothered. When I do come out, I've accepted that we probably won't talk afterwards. \n\nI'd come out and we wouldn't talk for the next 20 years. I'm fine with that. We were never really that close, and we shouldn't try to force a bond that isn't there and will never be there. \n\nThey won't be there when I graduate college (if I come out then because I want to come out in college).\n\nThey won't be there to see me bring home my future girlfriend. \n\nThey won't be there at my wedding.\n\nThey won't be there to see my kids.\n\nThey won't get to see my future family.\n\nThey won't be part of my life and I won't be part of theirs. \n\nI won't be there when they travel the world when they get old.\n\nI won't be there at the family reunions.\n\nI won't be there at holiday celebrations.\n\nI won't be there at their funeral. \n\nWe are strangers, if we don't see eye to eye.\n\nDo I wish things could be better? Hell yeah, but I'm not willing to give up my identity for their pride. I'm not gonna spend the rest if my life censoring myself. \n\nI really do want them to be my parents, but if we won't compromise, that's fine by me. We don't need to be part of each other's life.\n\nIf they support me, of course I will try to create our bond, but if they drop me right after I come out, I'll drop them just as fast.",

      "description": "AITA for cutting my best friend off?\n\nMe and my husband were in a clique with many married couples. Our best friends were also our neighbors.\nThe whole clique is very intimate and two of the couples had swap their partners in bed a few years ago. But I always said, that's not my business.\nMy best friend married in July and 5 weeks after that day she found out that her husband had cheated on her with two of our girlfriends in the clique (which were also married). He sent dick pics of him, secretly took photos of her naked while she was asleep and sent them to our friends, sexting with these girls and so on. When she found out she was depressed and cut our \"friends\" off for obviously reasons.\nI did my best to help her heal her heart and make her a bit happier. She decided to not break up with her husband, because they have a 7 years old boy and he promised her to never do it again (info: It wasn't the first time he did this..more like the 4th time).\nI was not thrilled, when she told me this but as a good friend I told her my opinion and also that I  would be there even when he is a dumbass and she will take him back. She thanked me for my support.\nI also cut off our other friends, because on the one hand I wanted to be supportive for my friend and on the other hand these things were morally reprehensible and I don't want to be friends with these peoples.\nIt was a big thing for me to do so, because I have a social anxiety (I'm afraid to stand up for me and my opinions because I don't want to make anyone angry or hating me) but when I have done this I felt proud for me.\n\nNow my friend have forgive them all and is happy with these false friends and it makes me very angry. I don't want to be friends with these peoples and I think what she does is dumb as fuck and I told her so. They have betrayed her, but a few month after all these things happened everything is okay and I'm sitting here locked out from the clique for being a good friend.\nSo I decided to cut off with her and looking forward for new friends, since she told me I should not stick my nose in her life and I should be happy that she had forgive them. \n\nNow she texted me I am a bitch and a bad friend for breaking our relationship, but she doesn't want to hear my arguments and just insults me. I have tried to be friends even she is befriended with the old clique but it cuts my heart of to see what she have done to herself and my work to fix up her heart again. I believe that these friends will hurt her again and she don't want to listen.\nMy husband couldn't stand her since they met the first time, so he is happy to see that I have broken up with her but I am feeling like I am the asshole for no accepting her decisions. \n\t\ntl,dr: cut off my best friend for her decisions to forgive people who hurt her months ago \n\t\n",

      "description": "First up, I’d like to say that I’m a minor (High school junior) myself, although I might as well be considered an adult in this situation given the child’s age. Also, mobile.\n\nSo my mom and I were recently on a long distance flight, and we were sat in economy in front of a family with a child of around age 10-12.  Old enough to communicate and do their own thing, but still pretty young.\n\nAs children tend to do, he jostles around my mom’s seat right after we’ve taken off(she’s seated directly in front of him, his entertainment center is on her seat), but we don’t think much of it and politely ask him to stop, which he does, for about 30 seconds. She then notices he’s started again, and asks him to stop again, but this time the gap lasts because they’ve passed out the snacks. At this point, both my mom and I manage to fall asleep since it’s an early morning flight. Cue my mom and I waking up to the kid going TO TOWN on his entertainment center touchscreen, and I peek over between the seats to see him smashing his finger into the screen for god knows what. Now, in my mind, we’ve politely requested him to stop twice before and the fact that I got woke up because of his “activity”, I get pretty pissed off. So when my mom lifts her back off the seat to look around behind her in the aisle, I hit the seat as hard as I can at the somewhat awkward angle to somehow scare him into stopping. My mom immediately looks back at me and hisses my name, telling me that I shouldn’t have done that, it’s bad manners, etc. It worked, since he didn’t bother my mom the rest of the flight. However, I now think that she may be right, as scaring a kid with violence or threat of violence is kind of a dick move. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Okay, this has been bothering me for a while, so I'll just give you the full story:\n\nMy mother got divorced when I was 6 years old, after having me and my brother, and it was a very traumatic moment for me because I was closer to him than I was to her. Later I realized what an irresponsible man he was, seemingly incapable of handling any kind of responsibility and just spending all night in the internet back when it was dial up and super expensive, but at the time I was absolutely devastated about this. A few years later he reached out to us and asked me and my brother to come visit and about once every two weeks we would spend the day with him and be picked up by our mother at nightfall, but one day we were planning on making him a surprise on Father's Day and when we came to the house he lived we find out he just moved without telling anyone and didn't even left a phone number we could call. After about 2 more years he called again, at a new home and I was ecstatic about seeing him, he left without a trace again and at this point you can see that the story repeats itself. He calls, tells us he loves us, wants us to visit, then after a few months he just disappears in a puff of smoke, but I still loved him very much. \n\nThe third time this happened, when we went to visit he bought us both cell phones and told us to keep in touch, and that he wanted to tell me a secret after I was home. As soon as I arrived I called him and he told me not to speak to anyone about it, but that he was going to take me away from my mother and raise me on his own. My heart skipped a beat and I was absolutely amazed by this. At the time I thought my mother was too restrictive (even though that was not the case and she was merely raising me decently) and my father would let me do what I wanted, so I accepted and started our little secret plan.\n\nThe last time he vanished (I think I was about 13 years old) after filling my head with dreams of us being together again, just the two of us, I felt absolutely nothing. After a year when he called us again and told me how much he's sorry about leaving us and that he loved us very much I felt absolutely nothing. He tried calling me a lot that day, and the week after but I just didn't have anything to say to him, even though everyone in my family was trying to persuade me to at least try talking to him, but something just snapped in place in my head and I realized that my mother was doing her absolute best to raise us without so much as a child support check from him and he was just an irresponsible piece of shit that couldn't even get his life together.\n\nI am 23 years old now, haven't talked to him since, spoke to every son and daughter he's had (5, by the way, between 4 marriages and possibly one more that he had a few years ago), all of them were abandoned in the same way and refuse to even call him father, but they all have some degree of civil discourse with him, inviting him to family dinners, weddings and such, except for me and my brother, and I can say that if he was about to die right now and asked to see me to forgive him about everything he's done I would probably laugh my ass off and hope he goes through a fraction of everything he made everyone else go through. **I never, ever want to see or talk to that pathetic excuse for a human being again.**\n\nSo, after speaking to some other people who tell me I would definitely regret it if I don't at least try to make amends with him and let the past be in the past I would like to know if there's something wrong with just wanting him to go fuck himself and feeling no remorse about wanting to distance myself from him forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL,DR: Father is a piece of shit who abandoned 5 children to their mothers and can't get a sliver of responsibility handed to him or else he just runs away and I don't feel bad about him, or his efforts to make amends now that he feels he's about to kick the bucket.",

      "title": "AITA for asking my partner to tell me when he needs his \"me\" time?",
      "description": "I (30F) have been in a relationship with my partner (30M) for almost 2.5 years, and he is more introverted than I am. When we lived apart, accommodating for his solo time was easier. If I'd go to his place after work, then he would go upstairs and chill on his own for a bit to recombobulate and then come back downstairs. On weekends, we'd hang out for a while but he'd get his solo time on weeknights when I wasn't there and on weekend mornings when I wouldn't be around. He told me then that he appreciated me accommodating his need for solo time. \nWe've been living together now for almost 6-months and we've had the same discussion 4 times and I can't for the life of me figure out if I am at fault or if he needs to be more vocal about needing his solo time, now that we share the same space. It is a two-bedroom space with his computer in the 2nd bedroom; I try to not bother him in there because that is generally his \"resetting\" space. The conversation that we've had a few times now is that he needs his solo time and he doesn't feel like he is getting it. The issue is, he never tells me at the time, that he needs his solo time. I think it's been every two months now, he'll address the issue in a conversation, which is great, but he has almost never asks for solo time in the moment. I'm really struggling to deal with this since its the forth time we've addressed it. He hasn't let me know many particular ways I am impacting his solo time, aside from that we go to bed earlier than he normally would or we hang out more lazily on weekend mornings. He's been accommodating to what he thinks my needs are (lazily hanging out more than he would prefer), while I feel like I'm able to accommodate to him, he is just not communicating that he needs time in the moment. From my perspective, he needs to make behavioural changes like just getting out of bed, or not coming to bed with me, but he hasn't done these in the past.\n\nI don't know how to adjust my behaviour right now so am looking for advice too. Since this is the 4th time we've discussed this, I'm almost at my wits end and don't know what to do anymore. I have told him in other discussions that he needs to be more vocal about when he needs solo time. My approach now is, should I just try to accommodate for him if he will not let me know when he needs his solo time? This I am also struggling with though, because obviously it is situational. So I think; \"okay, from now on, I won't do xxx\", or \"from now on, I'll just stay away from the house for longer periods of time after work\". But, I don't particularly want to loiter somewhere instead of coming, when I wish he would just say, I need my solo time and I will be staying up later solo etc. \n\nI feel like each time we have this conversation I have failed. I can't really hid my true feelings so he knows something is off with me. I don't know if this is a similar scenario to people with depression as well though. I've also been wondering if it's one of those: if you're depressed, people will say just let people know and they will help you! But since you're depressed you really don't have the capacity to reach out to others. Am I failing my introverted partner by asking him to let me know when he needs his solo time?\n\nTLDR: Have lived with introverted boyfriend for 6 months and we continue to have the same discussion that he is not getting his solo time. He has never mentioned it in the moment that he needs to \"retreat\" but I have now explicitly asked him to do so and I don't know if this is a bad approach. ",

      "description": "I am currently a freshman in university and have been having a pretty bad time here.  Most of my floor hates me because I called a girl out on accusing me of touching her and trying to call campus security on me when I didn't even touch her, and she just ran into me.  While that was a whole other conflict, essentially most people on the floor sided with this girl and most of my floor hates me, and to be honest I don't really care.  One guy who does still treat me with respect is my roommate, who opted to stay out of the conflict and not take sides.\n\nI thought that he treated me with respect at least.  Earlier today, me and a couple of friends were playing Smash ultimate on his switch, and we were doing a tourney battle.  I won several games as Corrin, but when I claimed I was undefeated the other 3 people we were playing with claimed that I had lost one game to one of them, even though I absolutely am sure that I did not- I even took notes on my winrates and was sure that I had a 100% wr on Corrin.  Long story short, we argue for a while and two of them bet me money that I couldn't prove my winrate as Corrin.  After a heated argument back and forth, my roommate childishly claimed that he won the argument and said that I should just \"hf with your shitty memory.\"  I took great offense to this- firstly, i thought that he was my friend, and secondly, I know that I have a good memory (I generally score high on memorization exams and have even won a national geography bee).  So, I just said \"At least I have a good enough memory to remember my best friend's girlfriend.\"  I said this because my roommate told me that he had a boy and a girl best friend in high school who were dating, and during a party he kissed the girl, and ever since the three of them haven't been friends.  He got really mad at me for this, even though he clearly did very shitty thing to do to his best friend at that party.  He even said that \"I can't even remember who my own girlfriend is\" and accused me of cheating on her.  I have a girlfriend in high school who is a senior, but because of the distance, in the first few months of college I got a couple of handjobs from other girls around the school.  But, this was only because I was really drunk and also I really regretted it and even told my girlfriend about it, who forgave me.  My girlfriend was okay with it and I was barely in control of what I was doing, so I hated the fact that he suggested that this was actually cheating (I never even had sex with the girls).  \n\nAm I the Asshole for calling my friend out on his shitty behavior to his supposed \"best friend\" from high school?",

      "description": "As the title says I'm 29 years old. I live in my old family house with my mother and older sister. \n\nMy mid 60s mother can't take care of herself (can't drive or go out) due to a stroke and frequent seizures so my sister and I help her. \n\nA few months ago I got a promotion at my job that would allow me to live on my own thanks to higher income. One day I applied for an apartment in the nearest city without telling them what I was doing. When I told them I was applying in order to move out they went completely ballistic. They accused me of lying by omission to start out for not telling them beforehand. Then they went on and on about how my mother can't take care of herself and that I was needed there. Then they had a fit over how I never consulted their input over where exactly I would live. Afterwards they pulled out ALL the stops to convince me to stay. They droned on and on over how happiness comes from within so I didn't have to move away to have a good life even though I don't want to live with them. They said that I had to make the most of being stuck there and that it was possible. They went on into more stuff I can't remember.\n\nEventually I realized that it was going to go on forever so I called the apartment complex to cancel the application.\n\nSo what's your judgement?",

      "description": "Background: Financially independent, late 20's male, my mother and little sister (and soon after they were situated her boyfriend and boyfriends mom) live with me and I pay the mortgage with her just covering base utilities. As you might imagine in this scenario, I don't have a lot of faith in my mothers financial management skills, but am ok with the overall situation because of my little sister deserving a stable childhood and additional familial support structure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for the story: I have a business trip coming up late next week and I have to go to NJ for a day. It's cold and I don't have a large formal winter coat that would be suitable for the weather (I've lived in the south all my life), but was planning on toughing it out for the one day with a sport coat and sleeveless sweater vest (I try to be frugal on my spending and could not justify the expense for a winter coat in my own head). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where it gets tricky, while I was at the movies earlier I get the following texts\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/KXUyZ9h](https://imgur.com/a/KXUyZ9h)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the context, my mother has one of my credit cards that I let her hold onto in case of emergencies, and she has previously made purchases on but not paid off (close to 700$ @ zero % interest and I will be paying the balance later as I have a big financial windfall coming, so not a big deal to me). All previous purchases I was consulted on and I deemed they were needed for the household. This however took me aback, I quickly texted (albeit cursing though not directly at her) and was kinda shook to my core that she decided what was best for me and made the purchase despite my consent. I check online and the coat in question was $150 from Dillards, for something I would use once. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the movie, before I texted her again at 7:33, I called her and very calmly stated, I was upset, to return the coat, and that I did not want her making that purchase. I was quickly brushed off with her telling me she was at dinner. The rest of the texts are in pretty subsequent order. After she got back home later at night she feels the need to go on a full screaming hispanic lady tirade of how disrespectful I am, how my recent successes at work and my financial status have made me a bad person, how she wants to sell the house and leave (and yes again remember the above background its my house), and I pretty much stated to her not to threaten me with a good time (I have let it be known I am envious of the downtown life and know if family circumstances were different I would be in a bachelor pad at the heart of it all).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really am looking for self reflection here though, so please let me know if I'm off base, I just can't stand how she handles money sometimes and when I start to feel a pattern of her treating my finances as her own I get really angry about it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; AITA for telling my mother, albeit brashly, to return a purchase she made against my stated wishes using my money? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He actually did a good job, it was just an outline and it did not look bad, he said he was going to seek out an apprenticeship, I support that because he is a disabled combat veteran so he gets paid regardless of what he does. Now 2 weeks later and he keeps on doing tattoos on himself,even tough, he has the fake skin I toiled him to be careful not to start looking like a coloring book. 3 nights ago did one tattoo on his wrist that I just don’t like. It is a religious tattoo of a steak going trough his wrist with a moon and 3 crosses. I did not like the concept but I completed him on his coloring job. But I did not go crazy over it, because when he first drew it up I already said ohh wow you’re not getting that are you? And I explained to him how I did not like it, I am an atheist and the whole thing kinda creeps me out. \n\nNow he is mad at me for not showering him with praise for the work he has done. And when it came to a boiling point I toiled him, yes I don’t like that tattoo, I like other tattoos that you have done and religion is a sensitive subject for me. \n\nAm I the asshole for just not liking it?",

      "description": "I’m in a very serious relationship with my boyfriend for the past year and a half. We don’t argue a lot, but today we were talking about my friends, specifically my guy friends. I don’t really like girls, I’m just not girly and have a personality most girls like, so naturally I’ve always liked being friends with guys bc less drama (if you’re gonna be that person to laugh and say I’m friends with guys only to get dicked 24/7, please don’t. I’m loyal af to my boyfriend). For about a year before college and when I got to freshman year, I went through a hoe phase and got together with guys, most of them being my friends bc I just felt more comfortable than doing one night stands with complete strangers. I guess my boyfriend doesn’t like that most guys I’m friends with I’ve had a fling with, and I understand it’s weird people stay friends after stuff like that. But I met these guys as friends at first, so I wouldn’t drop anyone unless they would harass me or be toxic to me. I guess you could say I do value friendships, but I know that I could hang out with any guy, ex or not, and nothing would happen because I know cheating is awful and I love my boyfriend very much. Also, 99% of the time I don’t hang out or text these guys first, if they text me first or ask to meet up I’m just being nice by responding or getting food with them to catch up. It’s not like I’m actively talking to 20 guys all the time, maybe once every two weeks I converse with them but that’s it. Also, I’ve introduced my boyfriend to everyone and he’s good friends with some of them as well. \n\nMy boyfriend says it’s in his principle to not talk to exes bc he wants to be respectful to me, and I understand that. But I never told him to stay away from any girl, and I frankly want him to have good girl friends too. To make him happy, I’ll have to drop all of my guy friends, and it’s going to be hard to do because these are my friends, even though I may have gotten with them for a day at one point, which I regret bc now my boyfriend thinks it’s weird that I’m friends with old hookups. \n\nAITA for wanting to stay friends with guys that I had a brief history with? Even though I’ve done everything to make my boyfriend comfortable, such as introducing him to them and hanging out together in groups? ",

      "description": "TL;DR, AITA for skipping bathrooms when people ignore the \"Closed for Cleaning\" sign?\n\nI work as a custodian in a dorm building. My main duty is to clean the restrooms daily. I put a \"Closed for cleaning\" sign up and I'm usually in and out of there in 20 minutes or less. My problem is that people constantly ignore the sign and try to use it anyway. If they're just using the toilet I'll wait (even though I find it incredibly rude), but sometimes they go straight to the shower. The cleaning procedure involves spraying the entire bathroom down in a chemical mixture so naturally it's not very safe to have people in and out while I'm cleaning. I've told the same few people multiple times they can't be in there while I'm cleaning for safety reasons and they get a huge attitude with me. Cue heavy sighing, eye rolling, time estimates, the works. The last few times someone has come in and tried to use it (obviously before the chemical has been sprayed) I've just walked out and went on to the next bathroom. I know the professional thing to do would be to tell them to leave, or just come back later, so I'm pretty sure I'm the asshole here, but I feel majorly disrespected. I understand that a college student's schedule can be very hectic and maybe they only have a certain time frame to get their showers and stuff in, but the way certain residents treat me for trying to do my job makes me feel justified in just skipping it for the day. I need to know if other people would do the same, or if I'm just being super petty. \n",

      "description": "I've been snapping at my roommate for relatively minor things lately and while I should certainly work on that (I need to be able to live with him, at least, and my behavior isn't helping), I don't know if my frustration is justified? \n\nWe're both 18 and living in a college dorm. I grew up in an abusive household and left home at 15. I spent my entire life working towards being as independent from my parents as possible, saving money, working hard in school to get scholarships, etc. Meanwhile, his family very obviously spoiled him (he never had to do chores, always had people taking care of him, etc). So he's now very, very sensitive and dependent on others in a lot of small ways. To list a few:\n\n- Never learned to drive, despite living in a place without public transportation. Up until college he made other people drive him places when necessary\n- Has never had a job, still doesn't, even though his family is financially struggling.\n- Keeps switching majors and seems to mostly be interested in picking something fun instead of actually trying to get something that will get him a job in the future.\n- Doesn't like any media that has violence or sex in it. He is quite literally afraid to see fictional representations of stuff that happened to me in real life. This irks me, even though it's probably not reasonable or fair.\n- At one point his insurance wouldn't cover a medication he needed to take and it was too expensive for him to pay out-of-pocket. Instead of finding ways to make it cheaper or talking to his doctor about an alternative, he just didn't pick it up from the pharmacy.\n\nDefinitely, a big portion of this is that our personalities conflict a lot (I'm very stubborn and abrasive, he's very sensitive and shy and won't stand up for himself when I'm being rude). And he isn't exactly a bad person. He's just very, very naive in a way that bugs me. Am I The Asshole?",

      "description": "BF got kicked out of his place.  I wasn’t ready to move in but didn’t want him living out of his truck (he’s in debt and living paycheck to paycheck).   So I signed a lease with him with me paying the entire rent of 1700/month so he had a place to stay.  I currently live with my family which is convenient for me because it’s 10 min from my work (vs 45 min commute if I moved into the apartment).  I also am still concerned about moving in with him because we fight every week and I’m worried he will prevent me from seeing my family and friends (he gets upset if I, for example, go on a week vacation with my family without him).\n\nI’ve told him this and said that I’d like for us to be stable before taking the next big step.  The issue is he gets upset when I have to leave to go home “too early” (I usually hang out with him in the afternoons and wknds and cook him dinner then head home at around 530-6 to help my parents with dinner as well).  \n\nHe says that all I care about is having a “texting relationship” with him and is upset that I won’t move in.  \n\nAITA for wanting to take things slow for now?  I feel bad that I’m not meeting his needs but am terrified I’m going to be miserable living with him if he doesn’t address the concerns I have.",

We have gone a couple dates and have been very close ever since. We do not see each other very often, because I live away in school and do not have a car yet to take her out in. We talk everyday and everything that comes in a relationship, but when it comes to more romantic things she is never there for me. I am and will always will be a firm believer in “everything at its time,” because I believe that if you don’t want something 100% you don’t really want it. But it has been like this for a while, she has never really responded positively to my advances, other than making out with me one time in my parents car when I took her out after barely making it official. I talked to her about and she said she will let me know when she is ready. It is to the point that when we go out I just seem like her friend and not her boyfriend. I have been very patient with her, but I am at my limit, for it has been months since I have any type of romantic interaction, yet alone sex. I just can’t wait any longer and I am starting to lose interest.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for losing interest in her because she has not wanting any romantic interactions in the relationship?",

      "description": "I commute to Boston everyday, which has terrible traffic. On my drive home Friday, I was not moving and this guy bumped me going maybe 5 mph. We pulled over, and he was very apologetic and immediately said it was completely his fault and that he had lost focus. (I get it, traffic was awful) He was very friendly. I can’t say for sure obviously, but he seemed like a good person. \n\nHe asked me if we can handle it not through insurance. He was very stressed and told me he was driving a work vehicle and could lose his job. He seemed pretty young (20s) and I felt empathy for his situation. He promised he was a good person and he would pay me directly, and then gave me a bunch of contact information (name, email, phone#, license plate). The damage seemed minimal - there was some paint scuffing and a small dent, I figured a few hundred dollars at most (although I know nothing about cars.) So I agreed and did not take his insurance information.\n\nI get home and my husband is irritated at me. I have a history of letting myself get taken advantage of, and he thinks this is an example of that. For what it’s worth, I really do think this guy is a good person.\n\nSince the damage seemed pretty minimal, I considered just not getting it fixed. The only thing is, this is a brand new car bought new from the dealer. I’ve had it less than six months. My husband thinks it’s not fair for me to drive around a dinged up car since we just bought it and the accident wasn’t my fault. \n\nWe made an appointment at the local dealer (where I bought my car) yesterday. I got my first oil change there and they’re convenient/ close to our home. I texted the guy that hit me that I was bringing my car where I normally get it serviced and that I would email him the quote when i received. He quickly responded “Ok, thanks!”. I just got the quote from the collision center. I don’t understand how or why, but the quote is coming out to almost $2500!\n\nThe other issue is that this happened at the worst possible time for me. I don’t really have time to shop around at all this week or next. Work is absolutely crazy, I have a big proposal due which very much effects my job status.  I just can’t be without a car right now. Not having it yesterday and working from home already threw a huge wrench in my schedule. \n\nIf it were me paying for it I would either (1) not get it repaired or (2) wait a few weeks for my job to settle down. But I want to resolve this quickly to increase the chances of him actually paying for it. \n\nSo my question is, WIBTA if I just forwarded him the $2500 quote without shipping around? ",

      "description": "So me and my ex-gf were together for about 3 years and 2 months. She is a couple of years younger than me, and also lived a very long distance away (we met gaming, of all things). She lives in the US while I'm in the UK. We realised that based on where we were in terms of our education and still living at home that it would be a long time before we would actually be able to see each other in person, but we both decided to try. We ended staying together and eventually seeing each other for the first time late last year, just after my Uni graduation, and it went perfectly.\n\nCutting story due to the character limit, she ended up breaking up with me 2 months after I got home. She told me that she really did love me, that I was perfect and did nothing wrong, and wasn’t to do with me having just seen her. We talked for a long time and it essentially boiled down to me being her first \"serious\" boyfriend she didn't know if I was the one for her, and concerns about how her parents would feel about me (they didn't know). She even said that it's \"likely\" that we may still have a future together, but not now. She told me she understood it was hard for me, and that I could wait for her to know for sure if I wanted, or that I could move on, she wouldn't hold it against me or anything either way.\n\nAfter about 3 months of being in this emotional limbo, she today tells me that she's seeing someone. The reason she told me is that her new boyfriend (who I know, I met him when I visited her) wanted her to, since we still talk on an almost daily basis (something we'd agreed upon ages ago since we were/are best friends, and I did genuinely want to as well. If you want clarification on this I can post in comments) and he said she \"still treats me like her boyfriend\". To rub salt in the wound, she told me they've been dating for about a month now.\n\nI don't know what I feel in full yet but I certainly feel like shit. I'm still heartbroken and madly in love with her but she seems to have moved on. I asked her if she has but she said she didn't know. I just feel a little betrayed. I get many of you will be thinking \"young love\" and all, but this is someone who I was in a relationship with for 3 years. We had spoken with about marriage and even kids before. It just feels like seeing someone new after 2 months is way too quick. I don't know if I should feel betrayed, I feel like I have no right to. I'd expected this after maybe 6-12 months, but 2 just feels too fast. She's still my best friend, and I don't know if I can live without her in my life. But this is just torture.\n\nI feel like I am the asshole for thinking all of this. She doesn't owe me anything, of course she doesn't. I feel guilty for making her feel guilty. I gave up 3 years of probably the best dating grounds (Uni) I would ever have in my life for her, and I lose her just after I leave.\n\nAm I the asshole? Is anyone the asshole? I guess I just want to know if any of this is normal, or if my feelings are normal.",

We are curious and have a bet going on who pays for Valentine's Dinner based on what Reddit thinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been best friends for almost a year before we got together and had been together for 7 months before deciding to move in together (first red flag /s). \n\nWhen we moved in together I brought my cat, which he willingly agreed because he loves her and they have a great relationship. She had been my cat for 3 years before we moved in so he had known for her a long time and was excited to have her in our new home. \n\nRecently, my boyfriend has been talking about getting a dog. I love dogs and would love to have one in the future but see some issues with it right now - this is where the debate begins and we need help deciding who ITA. \n\nWe are both college students who are in school full time as well as we both work part-time. I think this would not leave enough time to care for a new dog, be able to train, take it on walks, give it baths, etc. Another problem I have is we are going to be transferring to a university in a year and we do not know if we will end up at the same school. I do not want to get attached to a dog that I will eventually have to leave in a year. He feels it's unfair, that it would be his dog, and he would take the dog with him where he is going to school. I think we are a part of a team and that it would hurt me to have to part with a dog that I have grown to love over the year and that we share a house so there is no \"his\" dog, it's not as clean cut as that. \n\nI realize that he may have to part with my cat which may seem unfair, and I understand that. However, I think he chose to move in with me and my cat as we are a bundle deal and he knew that. He knew we may have to go to different schools even with us moving in, but this does not mean I chose to adopt a new dog between the two of us for him to take to his school. \n\nHi Reddit, BF here. I too understand that a dog is a big responsibility and feel that her main reason is that she will grow attached. I don't think that because she will grow too attached is a reason not to get a dog. If anything that is WHY I want a dog (to grow attached, not out of spite).

Had me input my info online three different times. Excuses have ranged from blaming HR agent(who has been fired and yet to be replaced) to blaming the online payroll system. Most inquiries get shrugs or passed to someone else, and I always end up referred to the phone line of the woman who was fired.\n\nI called in today five times, never getting an answer and left a message explaining that if I do get paid, I need to pay my late rent and other bills first, as well as wait to have to the money to afford a one hour round trip to work.\n\nI've been borrowing money from my GF and roommate to survive but I'm furious and feel like I should not be obligated to go in to debt to get to work because I haven't been paid after working for over a month. Surely they don't expect me to live like this.\n\nIt's at a call center in Indiana if that helps. A corporate environment. I love the job(it's related to personal interests), pay and benefits and need it so I feel like an asshole for not going to work (not that I really could anyway, walking is not an option).\n\nI don't know if I'll be fired this.

      "description": "My brother and I have not always been extremely close, but we've managed a few good memories and some deep conversations over the years. That said, we've were raised in a very traditional Catholic home. Our mother would always force us (sister, brother, and I) inside a shitty cramped car every Sunday and we used to hate it. I even remember I got us all in trouble once for licking a page in the Bible as a dare (from him). Eventually though, we all grew up and found our own path to God outside of our parents -- except for my brother. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love him, but he's always been the testy one. He's the one who would argue with my mother nonstop about trivial things like a bedtime even though she was just a single mother at the time with only the three of us. He's only really seemed to care about himself and his own sense of justice for most of our lives. He  told my mother that he is atheist about a year ago, and she took it a lot better than I thought. While not approving completely, she told him he was free to do as he wanted and that he was an adult capable of making his own decisions. But recently, her birthday came and she wanted all three of her children with her in church, as it happened to fall on a Sunday this year. Only two of us showed up, and you can likely guess who didn't. They got into a massive argument after that and he said things like \"that book is responsible for the death of my childhood.\" I think that's such an overstatement, as we had a much better childhood than we could have hoped for. \n\n  \nNot just that, but we've gotten into near-fistfights on multiple occasions because he's so damn resistant to anything remotely religious. I reached out to him with a scripture after our estranged father passed away and he threatened to block me. I was just trying to help. Then last week, after the whole birthday thing, I told him it'd be better if we didn't talk anymore. I think I'm going to try to convince my sister and mother not to talk to him anymore either, as I can't help but to view him as a threat to our happiness. I'm just doing what it takes to protect what family I have, and he's only given us negative experiences as of late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I don't hate atheists or harbor any ill will towards them, but I believe that you shouldn't really associate with people that are this tormented. He has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I think he'd benefit from going to church as part of it may be to a lack of God in his life. I'm sure this will get downvoted as Reddit tends to dislike anything even slightly religious, but if at least a couple people leave honest replies, I'd be fine with that. ",

      "description": "\n\nSome background: My grandfather just passed away at the end of January. He was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. \n\nThis is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. His only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. But to my huge surprised I was named as his sole heir with life changing money. With the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. \n\nHere's where it gets even stickier. My mom passed away 6 years ago. She had one sister who I was fairly close to and from her I have 3 cousins. I don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was \"it's between the two of them.\" I have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and I don't know if they ever met him. To be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like I did. Cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral I set up for my grandpa either. \n\n\nNow she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that I split the estate 5 ways. \n\nThis is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:\nNo matter what I shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. If I do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. Both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. \n\nI can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as \"enough\" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. The first attorney strongly advised I do this. \n\nI do nothing. I am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. This is my second attorney's preferred course of action. \n\nBut this is not about the legality of the situation. This is about what SHOULD I do and would I be the asshole if I keep the entire estate for myself. Just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. I have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. I could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million. \n\nBasically, WIBTA if I don't share this inheritance like my aunt and cousins are asking of me?",

I never caused any real issues for my parents, other then the usual being a daft teenage kid stuff. I always got good grades and wanted to make my parents proud.\n\nMy sister on the other hand was a giant asshat.  From 14 was always bringing trouble to our house, constant screaming matches with my parents and even other family members during holidays and parties.\n\nDuring this time I fell by the wayside a little. At the time I never begrudged my parents this, clearly my sister needed more attention than I did. However, I simply got little to none, I was about 15 at the time and had zero parental support, I just could not come to them with my problems. \n\nI fell in with local white supremacists for a bit (got myself out pretty sharpish, I'm a lover not a hater) which I now realise was my way of releasing my feelings and targeting my anger at others.\n\nI eventually moved for uni and over the course of 8 years was expected to visit home regularly. I think in that time they visited 4 times. By comparison my sister moved away for a year and they visited at least once a month. \n\nI have a 5 y.o nephew who I and my parents adore. They have both been great grandparents to him, my sister actually moved back in with them when she was pregnant and they did a lot of the work for her, in fact they still do.\n\nMy dad told me once that he loves me and my sister differently because she had given him a grandchild and I hadn't. I'd spent my time getting a couple of degrees and trying to become a lawyer.\n\nMy daughter is now 6 months old and they have seen her a handful of times, have not spent a full day with her and even had Christmas portraits with my nephew and not her (my partner and I actually saw them getting their photos taken when we took our daughter in.\n\nWe recently had a huge blow up (my family are huge racists now, which is ironic) my dad dismissed my opinions because I learnt them all from books and my sister implied that my partner and I were enabling peadophiles because we don't despise all muslims.\n\nAnyway I've stopped trying to involve them at in my or my daughters lives.\n\nI don't think they're particularly bad people, they cared for me, helped me out at times through uni and gave me my first car.\n\nI'm just sick of playing second fiddle just because i tried to not be a huge burden on them as a kid.\n\nTL;DR - parents treat my sister and I (and our kids) very differently, I've finally had enough trying to get them to respect me and I'm thinking of removing them from my life.",

Our relationship has always been strained because he hurts me emotionally and physically. Every once in a while he goes off the rails and flips out on me, forcing me to lock myself in a room while he tries to get in. This always ends with him either going back to his room and screaming or him crying and saying he's sorry and wants to have a \"normal relationship.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this leads to our main story. Yesterday, my brother walked into the dining room while I was eating and asked me to put away the clean dishes. I told him I would do it when I was finished eating. I don't know why, but this triggered another outburst where in it he called me a non-functioning member of society, a waste of oxygen, a disappointment to our parents, and then threw a plate at me. (This is usually what happens.) I tried to ignore it to diffuse the situation, but then he took all the dirty dishes from the counter, brought them to my room and stashed them in odd places, all the while yelling obscenities at me. After a while, he cooled down enough to come into the room and tried to talk to me, saying he was sorry. I asked him to please leave me alone and that I was done accepting his apologies and promises to be better because they never held. I was very blunt with it, and he freaked out again, throwing a candle at me, a glass at the ground (which shattered and I had to clean up before school the next morning) and smashing a table. This was the point where I locked myself in the bathroom because I didn't want to get hurt, and he came up and stood outside the door saying he was sorry and to forgive him. I didn't answer him, and he called me an asshole. AITA for not accepting his apology?",

Last week she asked me to pay 75% (instead of 25%) of the rent, as she is \"broke\" and can't afford to pay her rent and the ticket. Her ticket price is only slightly more than the money she'd be saving on the rent (roughly $800) which indicates that she hasn't saved up much towards her trip. She also says that she will pay me back within a month or two. \n\n  \nWhile I can easily cover this, I am a bit nonplussed as to why she can't afford her trip. WIBTA for asking her what happened to her money and why I need to chip in? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Okay, context. I'm the kind of person that loves giving gifts. I've never been flushed for cash, so they're not expensive gifts, but I really enjoy putting a lot of thought and effort into what gifts I give people because that's how I show someone how well I know them and how much I care about them. For example, since I've known her, I've given my best friend a jar full of positive notes, string art flowers, home-made bath bombs, a crocheted beanie, things like that that I know she loves. \n\nWe've never talked about it and it took me a while to understand, but she doesn't feel the way I do about giving gifts, in so far that I don't think that's the way she shows that she cares about me. Usually, bday/christmas presents a last-minute or (more often) entirely forgotten about. This hurt me a bit a couple years ago, but I've come to accept that gifts just don't have the same meaning for her that they do for me so I'm happy now to give her presents without expecting anything in return. More recently, she's more likely to get me really infrequent gifts in a, \"I saw this shirt at the shops and thought you would like it\" sort of person, which is really nice.\n\nSo, we both turned 21 recently, her a few months before me. On her birthday, I got us matching friendship rings, nothing really fancy but simple and elegant so it would fit with the other rings she wears (I think it's safe to say she liked it). On the night of her birthday, though, when her party was winding down, she told me she was upset that her bf hadn't gotten her anything yet. She told me that he'd promised to take her shopping for something that weekend, but she was upset that he hadn't gotten her anything that morning, especially since turning 21 is a really special occasion. She went on to say that she felt like he didn't care about her because she hadn't gotten a present yet (even though he had done most of the planning and cleaning for her party). \n\nI bit my tongue the whole convo, kinda wanting to tell her \"newsflash, I've felt like this for years\" but also not wanting to hurt her feelings and be a supportive friend. It kind of hurt a bit, that she would be so upset about not getting a gift when she rarely gives them, but whatever, you know? It's not that big a deal. \n\nMy 21st rolls around a couple months later. I get a sweet text from her the day of but can't meet up the day of because of uni and a family dinner. A week later, we still haven't organised a meet-up and she leaves on an international trip for a couple weeks. Over a month after my birthday, after she's back, we finally meet up again and she gives me a little key-ring from the country she went to, and that's it. On the one hand, I expected that, because I've known her long enough to know what she's like. But it's also really annoys me, because she had gone on about how important 21st birthdays are and how not getting a gift meant her bf didn't care about her. It's hard not to draw a direct line though, you know? It bugs me a lot that I put all this effort into presents and she can't be bothered getting me anything, as if gift-giving is only important when she's on the receiving end. \n\nTo clarify, I would never bring this up with her. Getting angry at her for not getting me a present would really be an A\\*\\*hole move, I think. And I get that being upset about birthday presents isn't a very 'adult' thing.\n\nStill, AITA for being annoyed?",

      "description": "There is a woman in our church who has gone through a lot in her life (divorced, breast cancer, mother passed away). She is retired, in her late 50's, and has little to no friends. As a result, her schedule is completely open and she fills it by participating in pretty much any activity with an open invite. She's been known to arrive super early to events, which typically doesn't affect anyone. However this past week, I was hosting a dinner party and she arrived 40 minutes early! I was literally getting out of the shower when she rang my doorbell. I decided to let her wait a few mins while I got dressed but she apparently pushed past my first floor neighbor into the house (my neighbor never lets anyone they don't know in). I lost patience with her and expressed my displeasure that she arrived SO early and that I was not yet ready. She made up an excuse that she didn't want the roast chicken she had picked up to get cold (which makes little sense since no one was arriving for another half hour at least anyways). I know she does this because she's desperate for community and friendship but... AITA for not catering to her needs? How early is reasonable for someone to show up to your house?",

My estranged aunt is now calling and messaging me, asking me to come visit gg because she is losing her memory and asks about me all the time.\n\nHere’s why I’m doing it:\nFor this to make sense, you need to know a few things. My dad is dead, never met him, and was a child sexual predator that spent most of my life in jail. My Grandma would harass my mother and do shady things to convince the court that I as a child needed to see my father - things like asking the elementary school for my personal file, or during an unmonitored visit having me write a letter to my dad when I was five and telling me a bunch of manipulative lies. GG always stuck up for her and my dad, but never talked to me about any of that.\n\nThe breaking point was this - I changed my last name when I was a teenager. Grandma, who I hadn’t seen in years, came to my grad party with GG. Gave me a card that said terrible things, that my dad is a part of me and I can never escape that, not by changing my name.\nI sent her a thank you letter with my last name drawn in all caps and underlined. Hee hee\nWent out with GG to lunch a few months after that. She said I should apologize to Grandma because my letter hurt her feelings.\nAfter years of weirdness, that moment made me say fuck it and I haven’t spoken to any of them since.\nI will say this - GG is not a nasty, terrible woman like Grandma. Growing up, I saw GG once every few months and never enjoyed the visits. She only once initiated conversation about my dad - Right after he died, she said, “Your dad was a wonderful man, do you want to talk about him?” And I said no.\n\nSo, AITA? ",

The shifts were never broken up into 2 people working a day, it was only 1 person a day. Saturday’s the receptionist shift was 8-5, and only one receptionist worked a Saturday at a time.

Now, let’s say I couldn’t work Monday, I would often end up not working that entire week and would never ever get scheduled on Tuesdays or Fridays.

      "description": "So a few friends are throwing a surprise party for one of my best friends for her birthday next weekend. We've all been friends for about four years, but I find most of them to be super toxic and they make fun of my mental health issues. I've been keeping my distance from all of them but we're all still pretty civil and nice to each other. \n\n\nMy relationship with my best friend is separate from the group dynamic and I really care about her. I love spending time with her, but I don't like being around the entire group together so I try as much as possible to avoid such situations. Over the past four years, we've had a lot of parties and it's been terrible for me. At one party, while I was passed out drunk and these friends locked me in the room, and when I woke up a few hours later with no water or food or cell range I had a full on a panic attack. They later opened the door and said it was for my safety. Another time, one of the guys followed me to the bathroom and felt me up even though I asked him not to come with me. After all of this, I made the decision not to go to parties or even for dinners/lunches with them as a group. \n\nSo anyway they've planned a surprise party for my best friend and asked me to go. I said I couldn't saying that I didn't have the money. I don't know if I'm being selfish here because this is my best friend and I do really care about her, but I just can't be around the rest of them. So AITA for not wanting to go?\n",

She was showing me some of the new bikinis she got/wanted to get and some of them showed off quite a lot of her ass. I got a little uncomfortable with the idea of her wearing a very revealing bikini around. I didn’t say anything because I generally don’t think it’s right for someone to say what’s okay or not okay to wear. Would I be an asshole for telling her that the bikini’s she wears that show off a lot of her ass makes me uncomfortable and that it would mean a lot to me if she didn’t wear them? ",

      "description": "So I have this friend, we don’t even talk that much but we are still friends. Anyways a couple of years ago we were best friends but then we got split to different classes and just drifted apart. Over the past 2 years I have matured quite a bit but she is still pretty childish. Of course usually I wouldn’t care but in this case she is pretty Rude to me and my other friend. Let’s say we went to someone’s party and I wore a crop top. She would be like; ‘why are you wearing that and exposing your stomach. It looks so weird.’ (I have another friend who always says the same thing too.) Once I wore some shoes with the tiniest little bit of a heel on them and she kept talking about how I was 2 years ago and how I should go back to how I was. Why we are still friends is because;\n1 the school we go to is really small\n2 in my friend group if we all went somewhere it would be very awkward\n3 her family is going through some things and I was the only person who was listening to her when she was asking for help \n\nCan you please answer nicely I freak out over random judgements\n\nThank you for reading :)",

      "description": "This incident has been SEARED into my memory and i finally want society's opinion once and for all on what happened that day.\n\n\nI'm going to lay this one out with important details as simply and objectively from my POV as possible here.\n\n\nImportant facts:\n\n\nMe: 24/male/Asian-Caucasian hapa, from Asia. Pagan/animist. Left leaning \"libertarian\" (read: liberal centrist.) Voted Obama.\n\n\n\"Elle\": 26/ female/caucasian from NY. Atheist. Liberal. Voted Obama.\n\n\nThis happened in 2011, WELL before the Trump election cycle and the punch-richard-spencer/punch-a-nazi thing. We are classmates in a writing class. We had been hooking up (sex) for the past month. We are friendly.\n\n\n\nWe both go to a wine bar after class to consume literature. We are both solid drinkers and only had half a glass of wine each at the time of the incident, so no intoxication was present. The incident went as follows:\n\n\n\nElle: **reading an article** \"Hey, look at this. Apparently the KKK played a big role in banning child labor\"\n\nMe: \"Seriously? That's... weird for a hate group. How'd they do that\"\n\nElle: \"Well apparently in the 20's they campaigned aggressively for a federal ban on child labor, and their role was the determining factor in the decision.\"\n\nMe: \"Wow... though something tells me black kids didn't benefit as much.\"\n\nElle: \"Yeah says here black kids still suffered under Jim Crow and often ended up doing labor anyways well into the 30s\"\n\nMe: \"Figures... weird though to think about something even partially good coming out of something evil.\"\n\nElle: \"yep.\"\n\nMe: \"well, I guess even the Nazis managed to give the world freeways and jet propulsion-\"\n\n\nWithout warning, Elle swivels in her barstool and punches me square in the temple. It hurt, it was hard enough to jar my vision away from whatever wine bottle i was looking at. My first instinct is to fight back but my family drilled the whole \"men never hit women under any circumstances whatsoever, period, end of story\" thing into me so thoroughly that i just sit there and gape at her.\n\n\nMe: \"Dude what the fuck!?\"\n\nElle: \"That's what you get for praising nazis.\"\n\nMe: \"What the hell!? We were just talking about the KKK! You're the one that brought this subject up in the first place!\"\n\nElle: \"Yeah but are you black? NO. If you were, it would have been inappropriate for me to mention it to you. I went to Jewish sunday school as a kid. You don't play that nazi shit with me.\" (REMINDER: She is a blond haired blue eyed caucasian atheist)\n\n\nMe: \"How was i supposed to know that!?\"\n\nElle: \"You didn't ask did you? Now grow some fucking balls, it wasn't even that hard of a hit. Don't like it? You know where the fucking door is.\"\n\n\nAt this point 24 year old me puts his head down in his drink, apologizes, and pays for both our drinks before we leave. This has NEVER sat right with me, and it's been bugging me for over 7 years now.\n\n\nAITA in this situation? Personally I feel like i was wrongfully attacked, and that whether any of us were black, blue, jewish, or pastafarian we should be able to have a calm intellectual talk about difficult topics like how evil people in history either accidentally or intentionally did something that ended up being beneficial alongside their atrocities, especially in a college environment.\n\n\nI also keep kicking myself for being a pushover/simp/whatever you want to call it so no need to kick me any further, believe me, my metaphorical ass is blue from self flagellation over backing down. I'm older and wiser now by a long shot and don't take shit like i used to, which is probably why this has been bothering me.",

      "title": "AITA for helping my sister get her cat back?",
      "description": " A bit of background: My sister is a veterinarian, married to another veterinarian, and they have many animals. One of their animals is a cat (who I'll just call Kitty), who was and still is an outdoor cat. At one point, my sister was living in America in an apartment in which she couldn't let Kitty out, so he ended up getting a blockage in his bladder because he couldn't pee inside. Thus, my sister let Kitty stay with my mother here in Canada because she has a house, but it was always a temporary position; she was just a cat sitter.\n\nAnyway, on to the story. My sister, C, was visiting from America and decided it was time to take her cat back. While Kitty was supposed to be living with my mother, he spent absolutely no time there and always stayed with the neighbours down the road, which obviously isn't safe for the cat because there is a possibility of him getting hurt or stolen by these people whom we do not know. The cat needed veterinary care; he's a senior cat, maybe 11 or 12, and as an outdoor cat, he's at risk for things like feline leukemia and feline aids, which are both deadly diseases.\n\nWhen we picked Kitty up, he was with the neighbours. At first, we were just going to drop him off at our mother's until C left, and that's what we did. So C brought him in, put him on the couch, and told our step-father to not let the cat out until we come back to get him. As we drive down the road, we get a text from our other sister, H, saying that our extremely drunk mother was trying to let Kitty back outside because she didn't want C to take him. We turned around and went back to get Kitty and take him back to stay at my eldest sister's apartment. Now, this may get confusing because there were so many people, but let me lay out the cast:\n\nC - My sister who owns Kitty\n\nH - Our middle sister who lives with my mother\n\nL - Our eldest sister, C's twin\n\nR - C's wife\n\nM - L's wife\n\nSD - Our step-father, married to our mother\n\nMy mother will just be mother.\n\nThis is where all the shit went down. C told me, L, R, and M to come into my mother's house with her so that she wouldn't have to face our drunken mother alone. We all go in, grab the cat, and my mother comes barreling in, drunk and enraged, yelling, \"You can't take him! He's MY cat!\" She's in tears and refuses to let C take HER OWN cat back. R has Kitty in her arms and is trying to explain to my mother that, as both C and R are vets, he will be in great care with them. My mother continues to rant and rave, eventually yanking and R's arms to try and free Kitty. C,L, and M both tell her to stop and to not put her hands on R, to which my mother responds by calling R a \"she-hulk,\" (she's a tall, bigger girl), and continues to spew names and tell everyone to go fuck themselves.\n\nKeep in mind, my mother is an alcoholic. We've tried to help her, but she refuses any kind of help. SD has absolutely no spine and will not stand up to her. I tried to calm my mother down, C tried to reason with her, but nothing was working. C asked SD if she was wrong for taking her cat back, and he says that she is, indeed, in the wrong. Both him and my mother continue to claim he is healthy when C has been begging them for years to take him to the vet, even offering to send her the money for the bill. After being cursed out and apparently disowned, we left.\n\nWhen we got Kitty back to L's apartment, we discovered that he has worms, is covered in scratches and scars, and his claws were so overgrown that he ended up ripping one out when he got it caught on the couch. My mother posted to her Facebook about how terrible we are, spewing lies to her friends who coddle her and tell her she's always right, never in the wrong, etc. She even lied to our aunt about what happened.\n\nShe made us out to look like the assholes, so I'll ask you, are we assholes? Are we in the wrong for helping our sister take her own cat back?\n\nTL;DR: My drunk mother tries to keep my sister's cat when she was only supposed to be cat-sitting, ends up disowning us all and lying to her friends and family about the situation.",

      "description": "to be quite honest, I’m not 100% sure at which house the barking dog lives - but it is roughly a few houses down from my own. This would not be a big deal if the dog barked every so often - it’s what dogs do. But, the neighbors (N) have the dog out quite often and the dog barks... constantly. We’re talking about maybe 10 times a minute for 15 to 20 minutes, sometimes even longer if the days are nicer. this is in ALL WEATHER CONDITIONS at seemingly every other hour of the early morning ~5am into late evening ~11pm. \n\nSome background on myself - I am a full time student working 2 part time jobs (both at separate public safety/police departments) so I work weird hours, sometimes requiring me to go in at 12 at night. The dog being outside and barking so often, frankly, disrupts my sleep. I’ve tried earplugs, but then I’ve overslept because I can’t hear my alarms. I’ve tried timed white noise, but the dogs bark usually travels over the white noise and I don’t want to BLAST the white noise... because then what’s the point. \n\nI myself own two large Dobermans. Anytime they go outside to use the bathroom, N’s dog triggers my dogs to become distracted due to N’s dog’s constant barking. If at any point my dogs begin to bark - when N’s dog is barking or not - I let them in the house because I am aware it is very much a nuisance. \n\nIn our town, there is a ordinance that prohibits dogs to be outside causing a constant nuisance and it is an offense that can result in a fine if officers are called to the residence too often. \n\nFrankly, I just want to be civil and figure out which house the dog belongs to so I can have a conversation about how this is an issue so that police aren’t involved. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I did this?

      "description": "My husband didn’t tell me we were having guests until one day before they got here. I guess he didn’t know if they were actually coming since his one friend has said he’s coming to visit a few times over the years and never actually has. It’s his friend, his 5 year old, and one of his other old friends. I’m very introverted and to be honest I’m not good with children, nor do I enjoy being around them (however, people often assume that because I’m a nurse practitioner that I’m good with children and enjoy them... even though I only work with adults). My husband (extrovert) does not understand that I’m an introvert in the way that I need absolute silence and alone time frequently (every time I tell him I’m an introvert he reminds me that I’m not shy or awkward so that can’t possibly be true -insert eye roll here-).  \n\nWe spent the entire weekend with his friends and the child Friday night though Sunday night, and I came home today after a long, exhausting 12 hour shift to all of them at my house again. I want nothing more than to be alone right now. I understand this is 100% a “me” issue and this isn’t something I should be so miffed about. We don’t have guests often because we live thousands of miles from our hometown, but I’m so irritated and grumpy right now. \n\nI’m on call tonight, but it’s my day off tomorrow and I have a shit ton of errands to run, and after I’m done with them I personally feel like I need to be alone for a while. My husband and his friends are talking about going to a local distillery and winery tomorrow night and I’m not sure if they’re just assuming I’m going to stay at our house with the kid or if they’re planning on taking her with them (which wouldn’t be appropriate in my opinion), but after they leave tonight I’m thinking about saying something to my husband along the lines of, “hey I don’t know if you’re planning on me staying with the kid while you guys go out tomorrow, but I’m sorry, I really need some alone time and I’d prefer it if you guys found something else to do tomorrow besides hang out here.” \n\nI don’t know how to word it better and I’m sure it’s going to piss my husband off either way (see above about him not understanding anything about what it means to be an introverted person), or maybe the whole thing is just me being an asshole. /: ",

      "description": "I’m not sure if it’s even big enough to consider an issue, but oh well. Might ramble a bit, so I apologise in advance if it seems super disorganised to you guys.\n\nFor context, I’m a Chinese. I live in Singapore, where it’s compulsory to learn at least two languages (English and your mother tongue), unless under special circumstances. I was a pretty undisciplined student in around Primary 2? At least, I wasn’t too motivated to study in general, and Chinese was my worst subject.\n\nMy father was the one who mainly “taught” me, because my mother isn’t really book-smart, but he can get really angry if I got something wrong. If it was especially bad, he’d cane me or something. He said that this was the way he taught me English before I went to primary school, but my Chinese is still poor as hell now, so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nSee, I have a bit of a poor memory, which led to me stumbling over simple Chinese words because I can’t remember how to say them exactly, and the more nervous I got, the more I forgot, which led to more screaming from him, which sometimes led to me crying. I understand he’s trying to help, but I can’t help but feel stressed whenever he mentions anything remotely related to school matters.\n\nI don’t remember when was the point that it started, but I was becoming more and more reluctant to learn or read pretty much anything related to Chinese, because that inevitably led to my father being involved (what with him being mainly responsible for our school studies). That, of course, had a negative impact on my grades, which led to more screaming matches at home.\n\nIt’s been a couple of years already, but I remember an incident when we were arguing again, and I must have said something wrong, because he suddenly lunged forward and grabbed my face, basically trying to get what he wants to hear out of me. A while after that, he came into my room and made me come over to give him and hug, and the next day he pretended like everything was alright, but it still shook me slightly. \n\nAt this point, I’m in polytechnic, which means no Chinese assignments anymore (yay). He doesn’t get into my school studies anymore, because he can’t help me with that, but I still avoid him whenever I can, stay out of the house for as long as I can to stay away from him. I just feel uncomfortable around him, like he might start getting on my case again, which I personally think is getting ridiculous by this point. \n\nI need an outside opinion on this; am I being petty for feeling this way? I tried relaying everything I remember as best I can, but if anyone has questions, feel free to grill me more on the subject (again, sorry if I went way off track half way. This is my first time posting such a long story).\n\n",

      "description": "I’ve worked in a small office for about 5 years. A few of us are pretty tight knit both in and out of the office, including texting, buying breakfast or lunch, drinks after work, etc.   \n\nThere’s one coworker, Jay, who we try to include but he has a lot of issues. He’s miserable to be around most of the time; and that’s when his meds are stable.  When his meds aren’t stable it’s like walking on eggshells. There have even been multiple times Jay has been suspended for his behavior.\n\nIf it weren’t for making work more comfortable, I would NOT be friends with Jay. \n\nJay may just be socially awkward but whenever he sees one of us doing something for another (not a group thing) he always asks why we didn’t do the same for him or why he was left out or why we didn’t bring him a gift back from our vacation (just to clarify, no one buys gifts for anyone else while on vacation, but Jay seems to think we should bring something back for him), etc., and gets legitimately upset or even angry at us. Jay also announces when his birthday is coming up weeks in advance and implies we are all responsible for making him happy on his birthday by providing gifts, cake, etc. All of this behavior has resulted in us buying him meals or small gifts to not set him off. Sometimes he seems thankful but other times he is rude saying he doesn’t like whatever it is you got for him or claiming it tastes so awful you must be poisoning him, etc.  \n\nAll of that said, probably 4-5 months ago, Jay bought me a gift card to a coffee shop and it caught me so off guard that I teared up a little bc I honestly couldn’t believe he had done this.  \n\nAbout a week ago, another coworker, Joe, who is probably the closest of all of us to Jay, had a huge blowup that ended in Joe telling Jay that he is an entitled asshole. Joe told Jay that he never does anything for any of us and why should we continue to do things for him. I was brought up as a very specific example because I tend to be a doormat and do more for Jay than most of the rest. \n\nFast forward to this week and Jay asks me to come over to his and Joe’s section of the office. I comply and when I get there I’m handed a gift card for the same coffee shop. I thank Jay, talk a little bit and return to my desk. About 5 minutes later Jay lets me know that Joe has accused him of doing that for “show” and told him how rude of him it was to “parade me through the office” like that.  So I ask Jay if it was for a show because he could’ve just as easily walked the gift card to my desk and given it to me privately. Jay admitted he wanted Joe to see him giving me the giftcard.  \n\nI’ve let this all digest for a few days and I’m not sure I’m comfortable accepting the giftcard and am thinking of returning it to Jay with a “thanks but no thanks” (not sure exactly what to say without offending him or setting him off, tbh).  \n\nSo reddit, WIBTA if I returned the gift card?\n",

      "description": "So this is a throwaway because my husband is on Reddit. Short story- I am thinking about going on a big vacation with my kids this summer without my husband....  Back Story: I am a teacher with summers off. My husband is an ER tech- working 3 days a week- 12 hour shifts. He has been working NIGHT shift. With our four kids ages 5-15 - sports - school- daycare - we are BUSY. He especially is exhausted!  Anyhow...we have been planning a BIG family vacation for this summer. We were going to go on a cross-country drive to visit family. Stop and see a lot of sights, and a lot of family. I have really been looking forward to this for so many reasons. First being we have never taken our kids on a trip like this. We RARELY go on vacations/big outings of any kind. My 15 year old will be a junior next year.... we are running out of time to take our first baby on a trip like this- as our KID. Not to mention we can check out some colleges! Second- some of the family we will be visiting has made HUGE efforts to come and see us over the past years and we have NEVER been to their house.  We are finally able to financially make this happen. I'm off summers, and my husband saved some PTO, made some shift trades to get the window of time we needed. Well, an unexpected change happened at my husband's work recently which will lead to an opening on DAY shift. These openings do not happen often. My husband has a REALLY good shot at the spot. But it also means a new manager, new schedule. He is ecstatic. But this would also mean no vacation. He already confirmed that the dates won't work.  My husband and I went a few rounds- I was expressing too much disappointment at a potentially cancelled vacation and he thought I was blaming him and not supporting him in this new opportunity. I am happy for his opportunity- his health and happiness is important to me! Night shift sucks! We talked that out- determined there was no blame- just shitty universal timing. However I still want this vacation. I want to take my kids on this trip. I want to show my daughter some college campuses. The kids are all excited for it too! I want to visit family. And YES- I want my husband there- in fact driving that far without him is a tad scary- but I know I can do it. However, I know he would like to go with us. I know he doesn't want to miss the family vacation. Would knowing that- and still going make me a giant asshole?",

His family decided not to prolong the funeral and have it as soon as possible... I put in for leave and get denied due to staff shortages... I guess some context to this is my wife and I have a daughter whose been teething and has been extra needy. So, upon hearing my leave has been denied I go into a depressive state... Not wanting to talk or do really much of anything... My wife tells me I need to stop being depressed and help out with the baby cause the crying is driving her crazy... I snap. I ask her how the fuck she could be so cold and tell me not to be sad about the only non-family member male I have loved.... I'm not good at storytelling... I just really need some advice...  ",

      "description": "Backstory: This girl (21) and I (22m) had an old fling about a year and half ago for a couple weeks.  We would hook up frequently, and we connected well.  I started to develop feelings, and she liked me but wanted to be single so we went separate ways until we recently reconnected on tinder.   We had sex a few times and I spent the night at her place couple times as well.  This happened for a week until I had to leave recently to see family for the holidays.  We talked before I left and we said we both liked each other, and that we could start dating in the future, but for now and when I get back we are just going to keep seeing each other and see how it goes without committing to anything, since we are still both a little unsure.\n\nNow:  I go through these moods where I really want to fuck a dude, but then don't (I don't even know).  I opened tinder and started swiping right on a ton of dudes, then masturbated, then felt bad because I want to be with her, not fuck dudes.  In the moment, I really wanted to fuck a dude, but I don't think I would have ever gone through with it, as I have done this numerous times throughout the past couple years.  I still feel bad though because I feel like I'm being dishonest.  I like this girl and care about her, but we aren't dating and never said we were mutually exclusive (or talked about it), but I still feel as though what I did was wrong, because for a moment I was looking to fuck someone else.",

      "description": "Long story short my good friend for the past 6 years got arrested 10 times in a span of two years. Turned to drugs then knocked a girl up that he was hooking up with. He refused to wear condoms. Anyways he was in jail for a year after being clean for awhile and then guess what turned back to drugs.. I even got him a job at my work place and his boss approached me saying he had drugs and gave him passes because I am one of the best workers there.\n\nFinally they fired him. So being in jail for a year he is in a 3/4 house about 20 mins away from me. He’s super clean, completely different person and a guy gave me free basketball tickets good seats for free. I offered to pick him up and take him. (No issue I offered).\n\nAfterwards he says he has no money because of rent and child support. We had free coupons for 10 wings. 5 each. I said I’d get us drinks (soda) and order a basket of fries. He orders his own basket. I ended up paying $20 ish for everything.\n\nI hang out with him again and we goto McDonald’s obviously I felt bad we are eating it’s lunch he has no money etc so I buy him $6 worth of food.\n\nHe wanted me to give him a ride to his AA meeting or whatever which means I would have to drive 20 mins to get him and then 20 mins back to town and then leave him at another meeting. He said it works out because we would get to go to a mall and chill for a bit. \n\nI lied and said I could only pick him up from the AA meeting (I didn’t want to spend the gas money to get him) but I picked him up from the AA meeting because it’s right next to the mall and then I drop him off at his next meeting.\n\nSo then I bought cigars like a cheap pack it was like $6 for a pack of 5. And I bought a McDonald’s drink one for him and me and I let him have a cigar big deal. \n\nSo the next time we chill after that he’s like “yeah how many cigars do WE have left?” Kinda pissed me off like we??? \n\nAnyways he messaged me saying “Hey can you give me a ride downtown so I can get blood drawn for money it works out because we can hangout downtown after and then just drop me off at my meeting place in round rock!”\n\nAgain downtown is like maybe 20-30 mins away but keep in mind I have to drive an extra 20 to pick him up.\n\nI’m not trying to sound like a dick but it’s around $40 to fill my tank, I do have a job but money doesn’t grow on trees.. I’m 24 and he’s 22. \n\nI just feel used. Obviously if I hit him up and say like hey man wanna chill, I’m offering not him. To me if he wants a ride I should get something out of it..\n\nHe got a job recently but every check goes towards rent and his bills and he claims he has $7 in his name. He has only worked one week but yeah I don’t know. I enjoy hanging with him and he said if he gives blood then eventually he can save up and pay for car insurance and then we can switch off on who drives.....\n\nShould I just let it go and expect him to do the same shit for me later? Am I an asshole? Honestly not my fault he fucked up and got arrested and knocked a girl up and now he’s broke af.",

      "description": "A little backstory- I was born in Canada and raised there until I was about 3. I was then put up for adoption because my parents couldn’t afford me and my brother, so when they moved to the US for work they put me up. I got adopted when I was 4 by a low middle class family. \n\n\n\nSo now I’m 25 and have been married happily to my wife for 4 and a half years now. Life has been great up until the beginning of last year. My foster parents have been badgering me and my wife to have a kid, they even told my wife (after my wife told them that she couldn’t with her working situation) that she should just quit her job and that we can live off of one income. My income is only able to support a 2 person family at best so trying to support a baby will result in the same thing my parent did with me(I forgot to mention that I still talk with my biological parents very often). So after dealing with them constantly calling us and asking us every time we visit if “we’ve woken up and realized we needed a kid”( their exact words). Me and my wife have decided to delete their numbers off our phone block them on all social media and completely get them out of our life. Now were thinking it might be an overreaction, any opinions?",

      "description": "After placing our order at a coffee shop, my girlfriend said she needed to pee. So, she went to use the restroom while I waited for our order. We were about to take a long drive, so I decided that I should use the restroom after her.\n\nBefore our order was finished, a guy wearing sunglasses (which I thought was odd because it was a gloomy day) and a very colorful jacket got up from his seat at a table with his friends to wait for the restroom before me. Mind you, this was a small coffee shop with only one lock-able genderless restroom with one toilet and a sink in it.\n\nAfter receiving our order, I stand next to sunglasses guy with our drinks. I hear the faucet and the hand dryer from inside the restroom go off, and soon, my girlfriend steps out of the restroom and comes back to meet me. I then leave our drinks with her and continue to wait to be next to use the restroom.\n\nSunglasses guy doesn’t take very long and I don’t hear either the toilet flushing, the faucet, nor the hand dryer go off before he unlocks the door and steps out to meet back up with his friends. I am a little put off, but I always use a paper towel or my sleeve to open the door after using the restroom anyway.\n\nWhen I get in there, it’s a lot worse than I anticipated... He hadn’t flushed the toilet, which is fine, but there was piss all over the toilet seat, and on the floor around it!\n\nSo, being a considerate human being, plus not wanting to be blamed for leaving the restroom like that, I ended up using a bunch of toilet paper and some water from the faucet to clean up his mess.\n\nAfter I finished my business, I walked straight to his table to talk to him. This is how the conversation went:\n\nMe: Hey man, next time you use a public restroom, could you NOT piss all over the toilet seat?\n\nSunglass Guy: Uh... What the fuck? How do you know that it was me?!\n\nMe: Bro, the person who went before you sits down to pee and I watched you walk in and out of there right before me. Just...\n\nSG: *angrily* Who the fuck are you?!..\n\nMe: I’m just asking you to be more considerate...\n\nSG: Where the fuck you from homie?!\n(for those that might not know, where I’m from, this question is often used to determine gang affiliation)\n\nMe: Nowhere man. It just sucks that I had to clean up after you.\n\nSG: Don’t come up to me like that next time... Imma pop you!\n\nI’m not afraid of him or his friends, but at this point I just shake my head in a disappointing manner, say “Okay” and walked away.\n\nI go back to meet my who had found a table, grab my coffee, and we leave. She asked me what happened and I explained the situation to her.\n\nShe says I should have left it alone and while  I agree that I too often feel the responsibility to teach people lessons, I don’t think this was one of those times. I guess I could have pulled him to the side, away from his friends, but I let the anger from having to clean his piss get to me.",

Instead of having a wedding at a typical venue, they're having it on a 7 day cruise to have both their honeymoon and wedding at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey're doing this presumably to save money and while I understand that, I find it very selfish because it 1. forces guests to have to take an entire week off for a wedding (I'm lucky in that I work from home so this doesn't apply to me, but still) and 2. where the bride and groom are saving money, the costs get pushed down to the guests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhereas I'd probably spend $400 or so between airfare, accommodations, and gifts if they had a normal wedding I'd now need to purchase a cruise ticket which will probably be about $500+. On top of that, there won't be an open bar which is some peoples saving grace for attending weddings. I generally don't care about that, but if I'm going on a week long cruise I'm sure there will be times that I'm bored and want a drink.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo tack on more $ for drinks, excursions, etc. and you're easily looking at $1000-1200. On one hand I feel like the asshole because he's my friend and I want to be there for him and to celebrate, but on the other I feel like it's a real asshole move to expect that of their guests in an effort to save money on a wedding and honeymoon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I responded that I think trying to convert  people to another religion is messed up. I was raised Jewish so proselytization makes me very uncomfortable for a number of reasons. For the record I am not religious and this does not come from a place of feeling that I was born into the \"right\" religion. It's a more that I see proselytization as a form of imperialism and I find it gross that people are actively trying to \"conquer\" me, even if they think they're saving my soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother factor that my friend pointed out was that the missionary was a woman of color and I am a white/white passing man.

      "title": "AITA for not giving up my bus seat?",
      "description": "This was a couple months ago but it's been on my mind on and off since then.\n \nI used to take the bus daily to get to work. Not a big deal, I'd just mind my own business, sit wherever there is the least amount of people.\n\nBut every thursday was awful. Every single thursday at the stop after i get on, a giant crowd of what i assume to be the mentally challenged kids from the local school would ride the bus too, about 7 or 8 with the woman i assumed was watching over them. Still, generally not an issue because I'd just put my earbuds in and stay in my own space.\n\nBut this bus company was not reliable. We have a nice, modern bus that could sit probably 15 people. One day, a little school bus came instead. It had 9 seats. Since that point, it was basically up to chance whether or not the big bus came. So you can see the issue when the bus rolls up to the stop and there isnt enough seats.\n\nI have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy. Considering the 15 minute walk to the bus stop, I needed that time to sit down. So, that's what I was doing, as always.\n\nThe group gets on the bus, I've got my eyes shut with my music playing when the woman in charge taps on my shoulder. I look and she looks pissed, notioning to one of the younger ones, crying because he didn't have a seat. I take out my earbuds and she says to me that I need to give up my seat. The other people that were on the bus already were older than me, and when I tell her I need it she says that I need to respect 'my elders' and do what she says. I try my best to explain that medically I can't stand the entire ride and she gets upset with me and says I'm making it up and 'ignoring her' (i had headphones on when she was trying to talk to me i guess). So after a couple minutes of this I snap and tell her that he can stand and respect me as I'm older than him and that one of the other kids can give him their seat if it's so important. She gives me a look like I just murdered her cat and stops bothering me.\n\nTwo days later when I tried to get on the bus I was told I was banned from the service.\n\nWhen I called them they said that it's a part of their policy that the \"fully abled\" must give up their seats to those that aren't. I explained the medical reasons I needed it and was simply told I have a lower priority because I'm \"fully functional\" and the boy in question wasn't, even though it was just mentally as far as I ever knew. He ended up standing the entire ride and it didn't seem to effect him as far as I know, but I feel like making a mentally handicapped child cry makes me the asshole.",

      "description": "A little backstory: She is kind of controlling when it comes to me talking to other girls and gets easily jealous. So we have been together for like 8 months now and currently for a few days I'm out of town when this happened.\n\nSo she calls me up and tells me how this guy had hit on her and she instead of telling him off or saying she has a boyfriend, entertains him by adding to it. Before telling this, she had told how this group of guys asked her to accompany her to other side of the city  to which I replied that, if she wanted she could go. I'm chill as I really don't mind her going out with her guy friends or hanging out with other dudes but this really got to me as this has been like the third time she has told me something like this. Plus the way she said it was like she barely cared.\n\nSince I was kinda pissed therefore I told her it was her choice on how she wanted to deal with it, but she shouldn't get jealous or upset if a girl talks to me. And since she cannot respect boundaries of our relationship then she shouldn't expect the same. \n\nTldr: my girlfriend doesn't mind guys hitting on her but gets angry when I tell her that she shouldn't get pissed if I talk to girls.",

      "description": "My friend and I go to the same college but I drive my own car and she usually goes by bus to gets to school. After school she usually (2-3 times a week) asks me for rides home and I'm fine with that since I can just drop her on the way home (we live close as well). Now its been over a month of me giving her rides and one day I ask for some gas money as a joke and we both laugh it off, but in my mind I she should pay for a little bit of gas. But fast forward to a few more days and I ask again, same reaction but this time I told her how I felt. She told me that she really shouldn't have to because all I have to do is make one stop and I'm on my way.\n\nI pay for insurance and gas on my own since its my own car. Its not that I want her money its just I thought we can atleast  share some of the gas bill. She has a bus pass that our school gave to us but the bus rides going back home usually takes up to 2 hours since bus comes every 30 minutes. So I'm basically saving her tons of time aswell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow my question is AITA for asking my friend gas money since I've been giving them rides?",

      "description": "I feel like the title alone will make people say yes. But here goes.\n\nMy grandfather wants me (and my father and uncle) to travel with him out of state for his mother's (my great-grandmother's) 98th birthday. None of us want to attend, though I don't know their specific reasons. But for me:\n\n1) My grandfather is a damn manipulator, and a liar. He loves to preach about how \"family is family\", but he greatly hurt at least *two* families through infidelity and drug addiction, and he has no remorse about it. All of his kids know and none have forgiven him (he told one of his sons of the affair it was \"satisfying his needs\").\n\n2) Because of the above events, I don't know that side of the family nor do they know me. In over two decades, they've seen me a grand total of twice, and that includes my great-grandmother. Most don't know my name, possibly none of them, and I'm positive a few of them don't know at all my grandfather has grown kids and a grandchild in another state. In short, they are total strangers. I couldn't differentiate them from the people I pass every day on the sidewalk if I had to.\n\n3) Work. This came with less than a week's notice, meaning I don't have enough time to request the days off from my job. I'd have to jump through hoops to get them to approve. Most likely, I'd have to call out those days to go on the trip, meaning I will be tighter on money than I usually am (and yes, my grandfather knows my finances are in hot water; he still works, but doesn't care about his job, so he assumes no one else cares about theirs either). My grandfather regularly expects us (me, my dad, my uncle) to make sacrifices for him with nothing in return. They'll usually give in to make him stop demanding.\n\n5) As I said above, he's an addict. Once the party's over, he'll spend the rest of the night guzzling beer and smoking cigarettes like there's no tomorrow, forcing the rest of us to put up with it or stay in a hotel for the night... which would fall to my dad since he's the only one who could afford that (my uncle isn't working at the moment and my own finances are too tight to allow that). Also, a round trip there and back is about 16, he wants us to ride with him and he smokes in his car. Some years ago, I did ride with him out of state. With so much smoking, it was miserable.\n\nAm I still the asshole here?\n\nTL; DR - Don't want to take a \"family\" trip because of bad relations, addiction, not knowing said relatives, tight finances, and work.",

      "title": "AITA: For getting in a fight with my dad.",
      "description": "The other night at about 11pm, my dad started banging on my bedroom door. I am 18 and my girlfriend (21) lives with me. He was pretty drunk, and I would go as far to call him a functioning alcoholic. He also has OCD and ADHD, as do I. He had just gotten off of the phone with his ex-wife (we could hear him yelling through our door) and I think he desired to exercise some control over us, since he has none over their relationship, and take some of his frustration out. He starts berating my sister and I about the dishes not having been done in a week. However, I tend to do them daily—along with most of the chores around our apartment—by myself, with no help from my little sister, who is usually out with her friends when not at school or sleeping. I made my point that the dishes were only from last night and today, and that I had asked my sister for help to no avail. I proceeded to start to put dishes away, muttering, “goddammit.”, to myself. My sister yells, “DON’T CURSE AT ME.”, and my dad asks me what my problem is. I reiterate my point, and he proceeds to tell me that I can do what he says, or he can take away the card he gave me for food, my car keys (I don’t have a car, my sister and I are supposed to share, but she claims it is solely her’s, I don’t even have a key), and that my girlfriend could pay him 500$ for getting her front tires changed (he gets a dealer’s discount, and offered to pay for them using this, which would make the price come out to closer to 200$, and she would pay the difference), or I could leave. I told him I would just leave if that’s how he was going to handle things. He constantly brings up how he pays for everything whenever he needs something—even something as dumb as the dishes—but acts like he’s being charitable when he does things for us. He did this to his ex-wife all the time (he’s been married three times) and I’ve since let him know that it’s manipulative behavior. I am finishing high school online still, and am trying to find a full-time job. I told him I would pay him rent next week, with the little money I’ve made so far doing construction and sales at his gym. Anyway, I told him if that’s how it’s going to be, that I would just leave. I walked to my room to get my stuff, and he pushed me onto my bed while yelling at me. He’s a pretty big guy, we’re both about 6’2, but he has about 50 pounds on me and is a JiuJitsu black belt, and ex-thai fighter. I have trained martial arts with him a lot over the years, and I’m bigger, as well (190-200). After he pushed me, I got up, pushed him back, and we proceeded to duke it out. My girlfriend saw us start to fight, and barricaded herself in the bathroom. She had an abusive childhood and was surrounded by violence growing up. Needless, to say she was very scared. I was able hold my own with my dad, I think especially because he was drunk. The fight ends with him on top of me and me clinching his head to try to restrain him. I didn’t roll him off of my because my sister threw a glass on the floor right next to us in an attempt to get us to stop. I didn’t want him to get hurt. He gets up yelling about how I assaulted him, even though he put his hands on me first. He was drunk, and I knew things were going to get violent. My sister had a couple of her friends over, one of which has an abusive alcoholic father, and came over to get away from him. The irony does not escape me. I tell my girlfriend to get her keys and that we have to leave right now. As all of us are walking out of the door, he tries to stop my sister from leaving, she tells him “You need to calm down.” We all leave. I believe my dad called my sister soon after, and gave him his version of the story: that he pushed me, and that I “assaulted” him, and that my girlfriend didn’t see anything. She did. She was the only other person in the room with us, and we are now staying at her friends house for the week. I later texted him about how preposterous it was for me to have been able to hurt him. Like I said, he was a pro fighter, and still continues to compete in JiuJitsu, and that he’s making himself out to be the victim because he’s embarrassed. My sister is defending him, and won’t speak to me and my girlfriend. I think her desire to defend him is based partially around him paying for all of her stuff. She’s 16, doesn’t work, and maxes out his credit card. We both moved because our mother is abusive, and they would often get into physical and verbal altercations. She went as far as to throw a wooden chair at me once, and has been emotionally abusive to me most of my life. My dad is still, obviously the better option. I’ve since texted my dad, and we decided to put this behind us, and enjoy the holiday together. I expressed my distaste towards his drinking habits, and he offered to stop drinking altogether. I apologized for hurting him, and we both agreed things could have been handled better. I told him that we will be moving out in the near future. Am I the bad guy here? I just don’t believe that this relationship we have as of now is healthy, I feel very bullied.",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to pay my house sitter for not cleaning the cat’s litter box?",
      "description": "We went away on a family trip for 7.5 weeks. We hired a work associate’s 23-year old daughter to house sit for us.  Her only real responsibilities were to get the 1) mail, 2) feed the cat twice per day, and 3) scoop the litter box at least once per day and wash it out at least once per week. This was explained to her when we had her over for dinner as part of the interview process and in clearly written instructions.\n\nOur cat is very well behaved and we made it very clear that if his litter box is neglected he will pee somewhere else, which will be nasty. This was reiterated on the written instructions (item #2, right after feeding instructions in bold). \n\nWe came back to a home reeking of cat urine on every floor; but not from one or two spots, but in 10 spots - rugs and bath mats all with multiple stains and of varying ages, which all had to be tossed. Further, our cork-based flooring doesn’t seem to be coming clean even after a 10-hour soak with an enzyme-based cleaner that I fear that it will never get clean. I’m also very worried that I will lose both my pet and damage deposits (collectively, 1.5 months rent). \n\nI’ve spent nearly two days trying to clean up this mess, including my expected first day back to work. \n\nI’ve told the cat sitter that although she did some of the tasks required of her (mail and feeding of the cat), she utterly failed on the litter box front and the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that she was beyond negligent in this task. As a result of her failure and my ongoing cleaning efforts, I told her that she cannot be reasonably expected to be paid (about $1,000). \n\nHer mother, the business associate whom I am a client of, says that I’m being an unreasonable, it’s the cats fault, and that her daughter should be paid the full amount originally agreed to. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: The arrangement with the sitter was that she was to live in house while we were gone. \n\nEdit 2: Sitter says she followed the instructions, but the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that she didn’t. Going thru her texts, it looks like she cleaned the litter box every 3 days and washed it once per week. Verbal and written instructions were for her scoop litter box at least once per day and wash once per week. \n\nEdit 3: Sitter says that when she did find pee (she says there were three locations that she was aware that the cat urinated outside of the box, but that she cleaned it up. Inspection of those areas just shows that they were cleaned poorly as there was dried visible urine there. \n\nEdit 4: mother has written that she incurred expenses looking after our cat, including gas for her car driving to and from our place. I think that confirms she wasn’t staying here as agreed. \n\n**Update 1**\n\nFollowing the advice of some of the posters here, I reached out to the sitter and walked through the state of our home, the locations of the stale and fresh urination zones - all with multiple events - for example, I made the mistake of buying a black light to help trace where the urine ran to after I pulled out the dishwasher, stove, and kitchen baseboards - and you could see pulses and concentric circles - gross.\n\nShe has apologised profusely, admits there were smells that she didn’t really investigate, which she now regrets not doing so, and agrees that she utterly failed in her job and understands why she should not be paid. \n\nAfter three days of soaking and blotting with speciality cleansers, I’ve thrown the towel in on attempting anymore remedial work myself. Professional pet odour people are coming Thursday to assess and tell us if they can remediate or if the flooring needs to be ripped up, base boards replaced, and cabinets pulled out. It’s crazy. Will update again after Thursday. \n\n**Update 2**\n\nWe had a professional cleaning service come and treat all the areas of urination with a chlorine dioxide solution, which sounds scarier than it actually is. Apparently it is a powerful oxidiser and antibacterial that we were told is what grocery stores mist into produce. They guaranteed everything except the kitchen floor because it was a type of cork and because the urine was coming from under the sink. \n\nWell, every room but the kitchen seems to have been successfully remediate except for the kitchen where we still get the frequent face shot / strong wiff of cat piss. Ugh. We also had them come back and treat the air, too. $525 including taxes for both treatments.\n\nNext piece of work is to shampoo the carpets (cat ran thru it’s piss puddle and it’s all over the stairs as we discovered with a black light). The cleaning service also instructed us to replace the baseboards in the kitchen, which they say may help with the smell.\n\nWe were generally pleased with the results of chlorine dioxide treatment and would recommend it to anyone trying to get out any stubborn or vile smells.

      "description": "The the backstory is as so.  We had been broken up for some time, and it was pretty mutual, but due to our financial situations we stayed roommates. She goes through boyfriends probably monthly, which is important because her type tends to be the type you don't normally even associate with, let a lone date. Then after they wrong her bad enough, (usually by ending up in jail or something similar) she dumps them.\n\nSo the main story is this. He (I'll call him R) has been a pill popper for as long as I've known the guy, and even R's mother kicked him out for it. My roommate (let's call her B) has even excused his beahviour claiming nothing to be wrong, when her mother even picked up on it, while they were having a facetime convo. He sounded slow, and B's mother asked why he sounded like that, B claim R was just tired, or she called him in the middle of sleeping, etc, etc. Every time he's been over, he's either alseep, or dead tired like a zombie. Fast forward to last night when he's in here wide awake, in a fit looking for something. After a few frantic hours pass, he finally starts asking for help, first shouting at B, then inquiring to me and our other roommate if we saw a pill bottle lying around.\n\nThe night goes on, and eventually I retire to bed, only to be waken the next morning by B and her mother having a sit down and a cry with R about the now known fact that he's a pill popper. He's apparently been popping lorazepam, and after misplacing them some days ago, is coming down from the high and the fact that he hasn't slept in a couple of days. He's hallucinating, acting weird, and just being an all around problem. B's pretty much given up, after fighting all night with him, she's retiring to the couch to try and get some sleep. I'm up and about, trying to get my day on with, when she complains to me about the situation, saying basically \"why does this happen to me?\". I don't even look up from what I'm doing, I just shrugged and said \"Well you kinda bring this on yourself.\"\n\nI only remember what I said because I'd never normally say anything, I just stick to myself, but this time I just wasn't in the mood for her bullshit. \n\n\nTL;Dr: Druggie BF upsets ex/roommate, who whines to me, and I tell her she brings it on herself and shrug AITA?",

      "description": "Hey guys,\n\nLet me start by saying that this has not caused any conflict whatsoever so far and this is purely so I can see if I'm being a bit if an asshole here. I'm also on mobile so please forgive any formatting issues or spelling errors.\n\nMy SO and I have been together for coming onto 3 years. We both love each other very much and plan on spending the rest of our lives together.\n\nI am originally from England and moved to Australia about 5 1/2 years ago. My SO is Australian and due to a rough childhood, she has never really been overseas or experienced other cultures - side note: I'm taking her back home for a family members wedding and do to some exploring of England in a few weeks - super exciting! - anyway, back to the story... \n\nThe line of work she is going into is one that could potentially take her to studying or working abroad for either a fixed term or permanently. She has said she'd like to experience living in another country for 12 months or so. Now, I have already made one MASSIVE move overseas myself and it was one of the most mentally taxing things I have ever done - leaving loved ones and friends and starting fresh was incredibly difficult and I really would not like to do it again. I've also settled really well into my career over here and am in my dream role.\n\nShe is very understanding of all of this and previously that if she did go, she would not expect me to come along with her, however neither of us particularly like the idea of living overseas from each other for an extended period of time - I did this with my ex in England and it was rough.\n\nSince these initial conversations, she's now said she does not think she could go without me. Even if she says it's OK with her - I would really hate to hold her back from going and experiencing another culture by living overseas. \n\nAs I said, there has been no conflict on this subject and both on the same page, but am I being a selfish asshole by not really considering this and should I be looking at more of a compromise?",

      "description": "So here's the rundown. I'm currents in the midst of my first year at college, and I live in a suite style room. So for reference this is a shared common space with a bunch of other room which can be either single or double. So I'm pretty good friends with 5 of my 6 suite-mates, and we all want to live together next year is the same situation.  The other guy is just very shy and doesn't come out much. So, fast forward a bit I meet my friend in question, let's call him Tyler. So Tyler is a good guy, but he can be a little much at times. It seems like he has really high standards for what is clean and what isn't. For context, I'm extremely messy, so that's one thing I thought would be a little much for Tyler. Tyler also isn't the most agreeable guy at times which in small doses doesn't bother me very much, but can get annoying at times. My suite mates echo this sentiment as well. So we decided it would be best that, we not live with Tyler for fear of his idiosyncrasies causing resentment between us and him. Tyler has been struggling recently with some outside factors, and though he hasn't explicitly stated it I'm sure he has some other mental issues as well. In short he's had a pretty hard life and bares the scars at times. \n\n  \n\nSo about 3 weeks ago one of the members of my suite mates and Tyler had a mini falling out, and we thought he hated us for a while. So we went ahead and asked another guy who we knew pretty well if he wanted to room with us. He said yes, and that was it. I tried really hard to reconnect with Tyler and eventually did. He started hanging out in our suite again and everything was back to normal. Fast forward about a week and Tyler texted my suite mate, if he still needed another guy in the suite. He told him that we already found someone else, and Tyler was fuming. Since then he hasn't talked to any of us. I even see him in the halls, and he ignores me. If he seems me taking the stairs, he'll take the elevator to avoid me. I still want to be friends with Tyler just not his roommate. If you need any additional context just ask in the comments, and I'd be more than happy to respond. I just want to get this whole situation sorted out.",

      "description": "My younger brother is almost 28 years old, we'll call him LB for Little Brother. He's currently going through a divorce with his manipulative and emotionally abusive wife. She's blackmailing him into giving her more child support than he should, and manipulating their custody agreement. It's a mess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's been living with our mom and step dad for the last 6 months while he's dealing with all of this. My step dad is a good person, with good intentions, but he doesn't have any kids of his own and has a hard time dealing with them sometimes. He also has some anger management issues (not abusive or anything, just gets irrationally upset about things). LB is wearing out his welcome there, and it's getting hard having his 3 year old there when my step dad doesn't always do well with kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of the child support blackmail, and the fact that he's notoriously horrible with his money and spends way too much of it on weed, he's having a hard time finding an apartment he can afford.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just just moved into a new apartment. Two bed, two bath, almost 1k sq ft, affordable. It's a great little place, especially in the kinda shitty housing market in Utah right now. I'm going through some relationship issues of my own, and my SO may or may not move in with me, depending on how things play out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom told me that LB said \"if SO doesn't move in, maybe I'll see if she will let me move in. There's plenty of space.\" He's not wrong about that, but I don't want to live with him. He's a serious fucking slob, I like my house clean. He's terrible with money, I don't want to have to cover for him.  I can afford this place on my own. I like living alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know he's in a terrible situation, but I've spent the last 6 months working on my mental health and establishing boundaries with people, my family in particular. I feel like a bit of an ass hole for not wanting him to live here, but I feel like it would counteract everything I've been doing to get my own self to a better place, mentally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; my 28 y/o brother is going through a messy divorce and has overstayed his welcome with our parents. I just got a new place with an extra room, but he's messy and terrible with his money and I don't want him to live with me. AITA?",

      "description": "Of course, there is more too it than that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am an amateur photographer and take and mount lots of photos that I we use in the home as art pieces. Most are landscapes, some are family photos.  I got my wife a number of pictures framed for Christmas. In addition, we had probably 7-10 other framed prints sitting in my room that needed hanging.  My wife had been bugging me for weeks to get them hung up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a month ago, she took the kids to see her parents. I spent my \"free time\" doing projects around the house--including hanging all the pictures. Note that I actually take a lot of care and consideration into what gets mounted where. I am also anal retentive and make sure I have exact spacing between photos and use a level. Took me about 3 hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife comes home and instead of being happy that I did what she asks, she goes on a rampage about how I \"dictated\" were the photos would be and \"didn't ask for her input.\"  I responded by apologizing and saying I thought it was more important that they were hung in a timely manner because she had been riding me about it.  I then asked her which photos she didn't like where and she said \"thats not the point; it should have been a joint decision.\"   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis resulted in a major argument in which she asserted that I have \"taken control of decorating\" and \"she never gets to put anything where she wants\" (note, I have never refused a request by her to decorate something).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got angry enough that after she went to bed, I took down every single photo in the house, removed all the nails, and placed all the frames, nails, a hammer, tapemeasure, and level, and left them next to her side of the bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was not a happy camper in the morning and called me an asshole.   That was 4 weeks ago.  Yesterday I told her she could hang them wherever she wanted, and she said \"I don't know how to.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo...was I justified in my actions, or AITA??",

      "description": "I don't usually post or anything, so I'm sorry if this is wonky. Just looking for insight from some people other than my mom.\nSo my gf and I are both juniors in highschool. We've been together around 2.5 years now. She's extremely insecure and kinda untrusting of me. I've never known why, she's never been willing to talk about it. I've never cheated nor do I lie (I'm actually brutally honest a lot, I have trouble controlling it, I fully know sometimes it doesn't go over well and pay the consequences for being rude). We're each other's first everything; relationship, kiss, sexual hoo-ha.\nI'd have hoped after that long together there'd be trust but it never fully developed. Deep down I fear she's projecting because of some things that happened freshman year, I can go deep into that but it doesn't feel relevant rn. So whenever we're hanging out outside school, she always asks to go through my phone. I always oblige, nothing to hide here. I don't text other people really, don't have porn or anything on here. It's never been a problem. But things keep getting crazier. Like if it's a weekend and I take too long to answer a text, she demands I tell her what I'm doing and breaks down. We go to a small school and I can't even look at another girl, but like we all grew up together and know each other well, we all are friends, what's the big deal. I'm not into them. She's just walking by and I noticed.\nAnyway here's where I made the potential asshole move. So I run indoor track, and kids who do sports hang out in the cafeteria before practices start. A week ago, after we got out of class, we went to the cafeteria and I dropped my bags off and went to the bathroom. She waited at the table I set my stuff down. I keep my phone and wallet in my backpack, just sort of randomly tossed in there. She wouldn't know where they were, she'd have to fully search my bag to find them. When I got back to the cafeteria she was holding my phone and glaring my way. She says, \"What the fuck is this?\" and hands me my phone. I felt afraid like I did something stupid and somehow forgot and hid it, but I looked and it was a conversation with my track coach from earlier that week. He's practically family to me, and she knows that. It didn't matter that it was a conversation with him, it was that I never told her we texted. I thought that was ridiculous, he's literally my coach, a 50 y/o man with a family, I'm 17. I was also upset that she did it without asking, and deliberately when I wouldn't be in her presence. She told me what she did was acceptable and normal and I was wrong. I do not feel that way, I feel she overreacted to something harmless and invaded my privacy.\nNothing else was said, and after I got home I told my mom. I needed advice. I never opened up to her about our relationship before this. She agreed with me, and told me to change my password so she couldn't do it again, and I instantly did so. I felt better, I got a lot off my chest. Well we hung out this weekend, I figured it'd be fine because a few days passed and I had a meet Saturday so we didn't talk much that day. At a random point she grabbed my phone and I just watched as she typed my old password in, it failed, tried again, it failed again. I told her I talked to my mom and she said she was out of line and told me to change my password. Which I did. Well now I'm a POS who is being sneaky and has things to hide. Right then and there she took out her phone and changed her password. I don't really even check her phone so I didn't really care. But that was a problem too because now I don't care about our relationship and am ok with her \"talking to other guys\" or cheating. She's pissed and I don't know what to do, she's never willing to talk through things. It's impossible for me to bring things up without it blowing out of proportion.\nSo I'm wondering, AITA here? Was I wrong in changing the password? Did I overreact to her going into my phone?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend went through my phone, found a convo with my track coach. Got upset at me for not telling her. I changed my password so she couldn't do it again, and now apparently I've got things I don't want her finding out.\n\nI feel like there's a chance the story seems like something is missing, like someone will feel it's one-sided. I didn't try for that but I didn't want it crazy long. If there's a hole or something and someone has a question, just ask. We had a snow day but I have an appt soon so I'll be unable to check this for a while",

      "description": "Throw away account for certain reasons. But here we go.  \n\n\nI'm getting married this year, and my fiance and I are super excited. I got all the big ticket items paid for and ready to go, and all my girls have their dresses and will look phenomenal in them. Everything was going great until my one bridesmaid posted a picture of her newest tattoo...and now I am slightly mortified that it could end up in my wedding photos.  \n\n\nNow all my bridesmaids have multiple tattoos. I have nothing against theirs, or any tattoos for that matter. And honestly if I wasn't a chickenshit, I'd have a few myself (but needles freak me out so it's a hard no for me). So why am I thinking of singling out one bridesmaid for her one tattoo? Well. It looks like a giant..veiny..penis. My mother saw it, immediately called me and asked WTF it was, my MOH texted me asking why she got a dick tattooed and a few other bridesmaids contacted me asking what the hell was going on.  \n\n\nThe idea that she was going for was adorable, especially because it signifies her kid's birthday. Think baby Dumbo being held in her mothers trunk. But it's not what it looks like at all. It looks like the side profile of a headless penis. And it's lightly outlined in pink and blues, so it looks like veins. And the trunk is detailed so it looks wrinkly and overall just a poor execution on what would have been a fantastic tattoo. Now if it didn't resemble male genitals I wouldn't care. But it's a big piece and in a highly visible spot that will be in almost every single photo. I just don't want a big penis in my final wedding photos.  \n\n\nSo Reddit, would I be the asshole if I asked her to cover it up? And how could I tell her I want it covered because her tribute tattoo to her little beautiful baby looks like a dick?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to tell the boss my co-worker is doing meth on the job?",
      "description": "So I recently found out my co-worker is doing meth on the job. I guess let me give you guys some backstory. I am a 25-year old first year electrical apprentice and really enjoy what I do. I love physical work, buying new tools, and most of all fulfilling customer’s electrical needs. Doing good work and learning as much as I can is certainly my number one priority.\n\nWithin the last month the company I work for hired a new journeyman. Let’s call him J. J is old school and has been an electrician for longer than I have been alive. Needless to say he is very knowledgeable and experienced in the electrical field. Problem is I recently found out J is a long time meth user and has no intention to quit. \n\nThe first day working with J was pretty straight forward. I finished a couple jobs in the morning and then met him at customer’s house to replace a couple of high ceiling chandeliers. It was an easy job and only took about an hour. Afterwards we went back to the cars and while putting away some tools in his van I noticed a blowtorch, some hash, and a little hash pipe. I rationalize this as, “Whatever I can get over that the guy just smokes a little, we live in a legal state, I couldn’t tell he was high, and we got the job done.” That day he tries to get me to smoke with him before our next job and I decline. I explain to him I don’t smoke, but I’m certainly not going to stop him. Although I think it is totally irresponsible to work with electricity high, I am the first year so I keep my mouth shut. \n\nNow a couple of weeks go by, J and I have done several jobs together. I realize he is a really valuable resource and I am learning a whole lot. So one day we go to an office building to bid out a job for the boss. Everything is going fine until we are in the electrical room and he sees a pack of sawzall blades a recommend I go steal them so I don’t have to buy new ones for my sawzall. I look at him like he’s nuts and tell I don’t steal tools. He mocks me, but eventually we just resume the job and that was the end of it.\n\nAbout a week goes by and at this point J and I are getting along well and are completing jobs efficiently. So last Friday we went to a customer’s house. The customer is terminally ill and has a bunch of medical equipment plugged into a power strip and needs a 20amp dedicated circuit to run all of this stuff. Sounds really easy, but I messed up. I cut the 2-gang box right up against the vent pipe for the sink. Of course the box isn’t going to fit. I let J know and tell him the I’ll tell the homeowner and even pay to have a drywall guy come fix it. All we have to do is move the box. He is totally against this idea and tells me to go get a 2-gang low volt remodel box from the van. I was relieved when I couldn’t find one knowing what he was trying to do. So he then proceeds to cut the 2-gang remodel down so it would fit flush against the drywall. He finishes and tells me to wire it. I could tell he is getting pissed off so I did. Needless to say I left that job sick to my stomach and feeling extremely guilty knowing that we put the box in the wall like that.\n\nLater in the day we meet up with the owner of the company to go bid a commercial job. Before we leave he tells me he needs to review the prints on the way so I should drive. I say okay I’ll drive. On the way there he’s reading he blueprints and all of a sudden I glance over and see him casually pull out an opaque silver jar and there he is with what looks like a lot of meth. Like a lot more than just personal use. He is crushing it up and I am dumbfounded. I just say, “Is that crystal meth?” He replies, “Yeah and I guess if (owner) finds out about it I’ll know who to kill. You want some?” In my head I’m thinking, “Oh **** this guy’s a crazy tweaker. I should call the cops. Maybe I should just tell (owner), but I don’t want this guy to lose his mind and try to kill me.” I just say, “No way I don’t want any of that.” We went and bid the job and I went home for the weekend\n\nNow today is Sunday and I have to go to work tomorrow and deal with this. I guess this is AITA, but ultimately this is situation that I would like some sort of advice on.\n\nTL;DR: My supervisor railed some meth in the passenger seat while I was driving the company vehicle. Proceeded to threaten me and offer me some.\n\n",

      "description": "I’m going to try condensing this as much as possible, but there is 13 years of bs from this neck beard. These two have been friends since they were maybe 15?\n\n1) Best friend (BF from here on out) told husband (H) I wasn’t allowed to come over to their apartment when we were dating and they were room mates. He would get pissy and lock himself in his room if I was over. \n\n2) I have a son from a previous relationship who was 1 when we started dating. BF has stated he doesn’t like this son (who’s now almost 13), and thinks he’s “weird”.  He has told me this, to my face, in my home. Son has been diagnosed with Aspergers and we know he’s not “normal,” but he’s a sweet kid, and honestly, who says that to a kids mom? He also doesn’t like our other son we had a few years later, because he has a medical condition. He’s a perfectly normal kid, and unless we told you, you wouldn’t even know. \n\n3) H asks me to marry him, followed closely by BF to be best man. BF agreed and then basically ghosts until H eventually confronts him. Then it comes out that a) BF doesn’t approve of us getting married, b) he thinks we’re only getting married because we have a kid together, c) he doesn’t support the wedding and doesn’t want to be best man. \n\n4) We get a dog. He’s a good dog. We’ve trained him well, he doesn’t jump on people unless you initiate and play rough, and is super friendly. But because the dog was originally “mine” BF doesn’t like it.\n\n5) BF eventually finds someone to marry him. He asks H to be best man. H says yes. As the wedding draws closer we notice we haven’t received an invitation. H finally asks if we are going to receive one, and BF tells him, “You don’t need an invitation. You’re in the wedding party.” Then H asks about me, BF tells him “he won’t have time for a date since he’ll be busy with best man duties.” I do eventually get invited but I’m told I have to sign a different wedding guest thing than H “in case they need to replace me later.”\n\n6) We host a biweekly rpg night, revolving around castle cellars and flying reptiles. Every time we’re set, they ask us if our kids will be home, and if we say yes, they all of a sudden bail, sometimes at the last second, with other friends already there ready to go. If they do come, they drink heavily. We’re not big drinkers either. \n\nNow, I don’t harbour a lot of ill-will to BF. As I said, not every person gets along, but I’m thinking H and his friend should consider parting ways. Not in a complete no-contact way, but gradually move on eventually way. It’s not even because he doesn’t like me. He seems to disagree with everything in husband’s life, and they really don’t have a lot in common these days. It’s like he wants to be around H, but without anything that makes him, him. I’m trying to find activities for H to meet people, but he also isn’t very into that either. \n\nSo, AITA for wanting my husband to drop this guy because I KNOW he can do better in the friend department?

It used to be easy to arrange visits to our new home, but now their dog has to come with them wherever they go. \n\nThey don’t live near anyone, so they can’t find a dog sitter. Because of this, the last 2 times they visited, they brought their dog. The dog jumps up on people, but is generally very nice. Just very energetic. It scares the hell out of our cats, but does no harm to them. \n\nThe last time it was here it got on my nerves because I don’t like to be jumped on. In addition, it jumped on a coffee table, and, when jumping off, caused the glass top to slide off and shatter. This was an antique. In addition, the dog put tears in our back screen door.\n\nMy fiancé and his brother are trying to arrange another visit, but I have forbid the dog to come to our house again. This has made my fiancé’s brother and girlfriend very angry, as they argue their dog is just a puppy and that’s the way puppies are. This has thrown a wrench in things, and I feel as if I am to blame.\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been going through a rough time ever since we moved in together in July, I have decided to end things with her because I just can't take this suffocating feeling anymore, I can never feel relaxed in my own home and feel like I am constantly walking in a mine field with her cause I never know what exactly will make her either flip out in anger and jealousy or burst into tears.  We had this fight a couple days ago and I am just wondering if I am an asshole for what I said to her.\n\nI have been trying really hard to make this relationship work, I told her I need some space and that I still care about her immensely, but that for the relationship to work, we also have to take care of ourselves.  She proceeded to bawl and say how since we are together, she should be the only person I don't need any space away from.  Eventually I talk her into going to couples counseling with me and the therapist suggested that we should schedule some time to ourselves, pick an activity and do it alone.  She decided on going to a coffee shop and relax with a book.  I decided on picking up a new PS4 game and hanging at home playing it and ordering a pizza.  The day comes for our scheduled solo activities and as she is about to leave, I boot up the game, Tales of Berseria, that I purchased.  The title screen pops up and the main character is dressed like [this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/aselia/images/e/e1/Velvet_Artwork.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170226095330).  My girlfriend sees it and goes \"uhh why did they dress her like that?' I told her that the style of anime is like that, there's almost always decent amounts of shirtless dudes and scantily clad women.  She gives me a disgusted look, I hit new game and ask her what the big deal was, she doesn't reply because the opening cutscene is playing and it's that same character but in what looks like a prison, wearing only tattered rags.  There's no full on nudity or anything, she's just not wearing much.  My girlfriend says more sternly \"FinallyAloneAgain, this is NOT okay.  I don't want you playing this.\"  Now I was aware she was the jealous type, she even admits to it, but it was never anything over the top.  I had no clue she would find anything wrong with an animated videogame.  She watches the Bachelor show where it's a bunch of dudes and girls on a beach and pretty much the entire time the guys are shirtless and the women are in bikinis.  I ask her what the difference is between that and my game, and her reasoning was that the game lasts for several hours whereas her show is only one hour.  As she continues to rant about how she doesn't want me seeing that and how I shouldn't be playing it out of respect for her, I about lost it.  \n\nI was SO excited to finally have some relaxing time to myself and now she is even making that impossible.  After she rambles on about how gross it is and how disrespectful both me and the game developers are I say to her \"it's kind of odd you have an issue with scantily clad cartoon characters, but you are totally cool with talking to some random guy at a party you've never met before and having his dick in your mouth less than an hour later, don't you think?\"  See, my girlfriend was big into hook ups in college (she graduated last year), personally it's not my thing, I find it super awkward and uncomfortable.  I've had one and that was all I needed to know that I didn't like it personally.  Her fantastic response was \"I told you I never sucked dick when I was hooking up with guys\" to which I replied \"Oh sorry about that, let me rephrase, it's odd that my game crosses a line for you, but getting random dick shoved up your pussy and not even knowing the name of the dude it's attached to is totally cool.\"  She tells me \"that's different, I was just having fun and not being disrespectful to anyone\" I replied with \"and that's exactly what I am doing, trying to have fun and not be disrespectful.\"\n\nAITA for saying what I did?  I admit it is out of character for me.  The constant jealousy coming from her all the time and her smothering the shit out of me was bad enough, but then when we were finally going to have some much needed solo time, she finds a reason to be upset and ruin it.  I just couldn't hold back.",

      "description": " We sat down to watch a movie and I pulled out my knitting. About twenty minutes into the movie, my boyfriend paused it and asked me to stop. I asked him if it was too noisy, and said I could switch to a different kind of needle so it wouldn't click. He said no, but said it was rude to knit when we are supposed to be watching a moving together, and to please pay attention. I said that I am, but I just like to have something to do with my hands while I'm watching something. He said he would prefer I pay full attention and to please put down the knitting. I said no, I'd really prefer to be able to knit, that I'm not distracted, I am fully capable of doing both at once, and that I do it all the time.   \n\n\nHe got very annoyed and told me I was being rude and disrespectful, and if I didn't put it away, we would stop watching. I had a feeling this would ruin the whole weekend so I just put down my knitting, he said thank you, and we continued. Halfway into the movie, he picked up his phone and started doing something. I paused the movie and asked him why it was okay for him to do that but I couldn't knit? He got annoyed and slammed down his phone. We finished the movie and he stomped off to play video games. I turned on the tv show I've been going through (Awkward.) and continued knitting.   \n\n\nThe next day, he told me that he thinks it's rude to knit through a movie and through TV shows, and that it makes me come across like I have ADHD and am a toddler who can't sit still. I explained that I've always done things like this. When I was a kid, my parents would draw or color with us while we watched TV. When I learned to sew, I'd watch Arthur and sew. When I picked up knitting, I would watch TV, or read, or even take walks with my mom if it was portable. I always feel better if I'm making something instead of just sitting there. \n\nBut I also listen to music and run. Or listen to audiobooks while I'm at work. I love multitasking. I love media and I love to be productive and I love being creative. Perfect, right?\n\nHe told me it was rude and that when we do something, to please put 100% of my focus into it instead of paying attention to my knitting. I told him that if that's really an expectation he has, I didn't think this relationship would have a long future, because I am not going to just sit there and watch TV and do nothing else.  I explained that I find it very boring and lazy to just sit there and watch TV, and while I get how other people find joy in just doing nothing, I don't. \n\nFor the record, I asked if he felt like I was ignoring him, or not paying enough attention to him, etc, but he said that isn't the issue, just that I should be more respectful when I am watching TV or Movies because the creators work very hard and it's insulting that I won't pay full attention.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?",

I was crushed.\n\nStarted seeing her about 4 months ago again, she really seemed to have grown a lot and was in a good place in life. I gave her another chance. This time we were in a comitted relationship.\n\nNow to the event:\nWe were supposed to have a double date the day after christmas, but she declined in the last second because she was feeling terrible, had a night of anxiety (she has a lot of anxiety, ptsd and she abused a lot of drugs when we last saw eachother wich btw i thought was over).\nThen she stopped answering mid sentence, this was in the middle of the day. After a few hours I decided to go to her place, i was worried. I can hear her music in there but shes not opening the door. I knock harder and harder and now im super worried. Finally she opens the door with the safety chain on, pupils big as her eyes. Im asking how she is and if i can come in for a minute to talk.. Just a cold \"no\", i ask whynot.. \"no\".. \n\nI just blurted out \"someones in there right?\"\nShe closes the door without an answer.\nShe is saying i triggered her ptsd with my knocking, and that i only came to her place because im controlling and that i thought she was cheating. I was worried. Thats all. \nNext day she breaks it up because of the above reasons. Making me feel like a total shitbag of a human being, saying im full of shit. Doesnt even try to see my POV. So am I the asshole?\n\nThanks in advance for reading this far and eventually answering.\n\n(English is not my first language)",

      "description": "So I’m in the middle of a long distance relationship. We’ve been together for two and a half years, and things were going pretty well. For April fool’s, I didn’t think of playing a prank only because we’re so far away, I wouldn’t even enjoy it. She had another idea. \n\nShe got in touch with my best friend here, asked him to write a letter and get flowers sent to my place. The letter said really creepy things like “I see you everyday and I’m interested in you. Bring a condom the next time you see me. I know where you are everyday.”\n\nI obviously freaked out, thinking I was somebody stalking me. I went to another friend and she suggested I approach the cops, and I thought I’d give it a day. Partner also made a fake account on Instagram and sent lewd texts and images asking for sex, and I politely refused, saying I’m committed. I didn’t block the account though. I entertained it because I wanted to build a conversation for if we ever met in person or if I went to the police. \n\nThis went on for a week, and yesterday my partner said it was her the whole time. I obviously lost it, saying it wasn’t funny. The flowers and the letter would’ve been funny, but making a fake account and engaging for a week was psychotic. I said I wasn’t amused, and that it better not happen again. She flipped, saying I shouldn’t have talked to the account in the first place. Honestly, she’s right. But I wanted to know who it was. I thought if I met them in person and told them to back off on the threat of going to the police, it’d work. \n\nShe’s accusing me of cheating, but what she did was far worse in my opinion. Are we both assholes? Am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr partner made a fake identity and aggressively flirted with me while I was freaking out thinking it was a stalker after me. I lost it, she lost it. ",

      "description": "This has been fucking with my head for the past few days now I don't know what to do about it...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo about a year ago, my GF and I went to Japan and had a great time. It was amazing, but exhausting as hell trying to cram everything wonderful about that place in 2 weeks so we decided our next vacation would be somewhere all inclusive with a beach so everything would be relaxing and taken care of. We decided on Cancun and that I'd be taking my GF for her birthday around Spring / April. We also considered the idea of inviting friends along, because our group had been talking about a group vacation for a while but nothing has ever come of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter talking with some friends they said they were down and pretty much left me to plan it saying that I should send them details once I've figured stuff out. So the year goes by and I have a pretty busy / difficult one where I left my job, started a company, and have been super busy and all over the place since then and pretty much didn't plan anything since I didn't know if it would be possible with my new company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat brings us to a few weeks ago when I got a text from one of the interested parties (AM) asking if we're still going to Cancun and I say yes and start planning things out... another interested party (LS) is in law school so we're constrained to his one week of spring break. My family has a timeshare with a major hotel chain and through them my family has booked all inclusive vacations to Cancun before so I asked my mother to see if she could book my friends and I some rooms through it for a discount for my friends. My GF and I would go for free (under my family's time share) while I'd be able to add additional rooms at a discount for my friends saving them a couple hundred dollars a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I take all this information to my friends, the resort, the dates, the price per day for all inclusive the price for the room they'd pay through me and the timeshare vs. the price they'd have to pay if they booked it through the site rather than through my timeshare. This resort we're going to is pretty lavish and understandably expensive and this kinda throws my friends for a loop, saying they'll have to think about it, check their budget, etc. I say 'okay yeah that's fine let me know since we gotta book it soon because of Spring break and I apologize for waiting so long to plan things out.' My friends basically fail to give me a concrete answer for like a week and a half and then I get a call from my mother saying that the resort is now booked full since it's spring break and we'd be waitlisted which would make getting 1 room, let alone 2 additional rooms for my friends, very hard. Also the plane tickets during spring break are noticeably more expensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet to get a concrete answer back from my law school friend (LS), I text him that the resort is full and that GF and I are going to go a different week, and that we're sorry that he might not be able to make it because of school. I also tell the other group (AM) that we might go a different week which is fine for them, but they ask if I was considering a different location not as a spring break heavy so that the LS could go still. Right after LS texts me apologizing for not giving me a concrete answer saying that he'll let me know but tonight we can probably find somewhere else to go for cheaper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat brings me to today and I'm pretty stressed about the situation and getting to the point where I'm over it. LS has yet to give me a concrete answer if he can go or and neither them or AM have suggested any other locations we can go and I'm kinda over planning and figuring out what works for them when spring makes everything harder for me. My GF and I just want to book our rooms and flights now since we're worried about stuff filling up and buying everything last minute and I don't want to look through what other resorts are included in our timeshare to find something that works for everyone else. Originally this was supposed to be a stress vacation for my GF and I but now I'm stressed out and don't really care if my friends can't make it. It would be awesome to have them but I was gifting this trip to my GF and she's the priority and she just wants to be done with it, same as me. I haven't taken any money from my friends or anything just kinda gotten their hopes up that I would arrange a vacation for every one but their lack of responsiveness is killing me and its looking like the vacation I want isn't fitting in with their needs (price and dates). They'd still be able to plan their own vacation as spring break is 2 months away I just feel super bad that I got their hopes up and that I'm not willing to make it work under their constraints.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole if I just tell my friends, sorry it's not working out and just book my own vacation?",

She says I basically look like a hobo and that it is extremely ugly. We argue about it all the time but I cant convince her to even take into consideration the fact that everyone else outside of her and my dad likes it, and most importantly: so do I.\nSo yesterday we had another fight, I went into my room, called my gf and started to vent. I didn't say anything too mean or something, I just said that my mother wants to change me and shape me how she sees fit. I hung up and opened my door to find her eavesdropping. She said she had never felt more hurt and betrayed ever since I was born and that she doesn't care \"about me, my hair or even my life\". She then stormed out. Today she wrote me a text saying she wont behave like a friend anymore, just like a parent because everything's changed. \nI'm gonna deal with this for sure but I just wanna ask you guys - am I to blame for everything?",

      "description": "One of my [14F] absolute pet peeves is when people whisper in each others' ears while in a group setting. I've always found it extremely rude; if I have something to say, I'll say it for everyone to hear, but if it's personal, I'll discuss it with the involved party privately. Additionally, I was the victim of exclusion-based bullying two years ago, so it recalls the sense of panic I felt when my bully would badmouth me in my presence, but in a voice that was too low for me to discern exactly what she was saying. \n\n\nRecently, two of my friends have taken whispering to an extreme that is making me paranoid. I've told them about my issues with this kind of thing, and they've acknowledged them, but it doesn't seem like they're going to stop. They laugh, and when I ask what's so funny, they say it's nothing and share that secretive smile, and I start panicking. They've assured me time and time again that it's nothing about me, so I don't understand why they can't just say it aloud instead of taking each other to the side like a pair of mobsters discussing their latest hit.\n\n\nAm I being too sensitive or are my concerns legitimate?\n\n\nTL;DR - when my friends whisper, it brings back unpleasant memories of being bullied. I've asked them to stop but they continue to. Am I being unreasonable?",

That was in winter and the heavy winter winds blew the can over and the garbage collectors passed it by, unable to use the trucks arm to pick up the tipped can. After a few weeks I went over before the truck came on garbage day, righted their can, and picked up their trash. The collectors then took the garbage. The reason I don’t think their house is all the way abandoned is that someone came by and put the can back on the side of the house. \n\nSince then there has been no activity at their house. It was an older couple and I’m guessing they went to live with their children, maybe. \n\nToday I went to load some stuff into my car and noticed a cable company left a flier in a bag with a metal straw. I’m moving out of my house today and will only be back to clean and sell some furniture. Wibta if I sneak over and grab the bag from the semi abandoned house and keep the little prize?",

She's a person who supposedly loves me, she's capable of learning, and at this point I don't give a shit how old she is. (Also, she's only 60. Not that old.

      "title": "AITA for thinking of leaving my dad and family?",
      "description": "So there’s a lot to this and I thank anyone about to read about my situation.\n\nOkay so some basic background, I’m almost 30 years old and haven’t lived in my own for about ten years. I don’t live at home with my family or anything.. \n\nMy dad and I have been almost homeless for about 5-6 years. My dad is in his late 60’s and we lost our house around those years ago. We didn’t have any money or prospects, I was very ill and physically unable to work. \n\nFirst we moved into my uncles basement and there was enough rooms and space for the two of us. It was incredibly generous of my uncle and were very lucky to have had a place to live. After about a year his son needed to move himself and his children back so we had to leave.\n\nAfter this we had to move into my aunts living room.. at the time of the move I was still very ill and unable to provide for anyone. The basic layout of the house means we’re in a ‘side room’ where we have a privacy wall set up and people walk by. \n\nSeveral years after moving into my aunts I’ve gotten a good job at a place I more or less enjoy. It has good days and bad days however I can see myself being happy there for a long time, and if needed I can move on in my field. \n\nNo one know that with my last promotion how well I’m being paid. It’s the best money I’ve ever made and I went from paying my aunt a couple hundred in rent a month to quite a bit more. \n\nThe problem I am having is that while I love my dad very much he has also completely squandered his life. He’s made so many mistakes that he had so much time to fix.\n\nAs I said he’s in his late 60s and he had so much time to earn and save and build for retirement. He never thought about his future only his present.. he partied hard throughout the 70’s, 80’s, 90’s, and 00’s. Until probably 2005. \n\nOther family members have expressed their dislike for him since in their opinion my father always lived off his parents whom had a bit of wealth. To them he always assumed they would take care of him. Part of me can see that and understand it as well. \n\nMy father had so many opportunities to purchase property for little to nothing in my state in the 70s or 80s. He only just bought the house we lost in 2007, and we lost it in 2012 or 13. My grandfather even offered to purchase a house for him and my dad would pay it back. \n\nThere’s so much more he’s done that he’s squandered. He assumed my grandparents would leave more upon their passing. But with five children they split the estate evenly and my father and a different uncle went into business together in 2009. Even at the time I knew for a fact the business would fail ad they didn’t have enough start up capital (all of which was what was willed to them from my grandparents) and they would struggle until they lost all that money. \n\nMy father isn’t a bad person at all, he’s just wasted a lot of time having fun and making poor decisions. He didn’t save money or make prudent financial decisions, and now I’m wanting to move on with my life and not make the same mistakes he’s made.\n\nBut the other side is how guilty I feel for thinking about leaving my dad. He’s done a lot for me in my life. He co-signed for my student loans so I could go to college, for which he is still in and will always be in debt for.. He helped me change my custody from my moms house to his at 16 because of some terrible abuse (although to be fair he should have gotten me out of that house earlier and knows he could and should have). My dad loves me and I love him, but I just feel as if I need to be able to live my life for once. For years now we’ve lived in a living room about five feet apart. He sees me at all times and I see him at all times. \n\nIf I move out it means leaving my dad here in this living room with just enough money to provide for himself. My aunt will be stuck with him in her house, and if/when she passes in the future my cousin and her husband (who also live here) will either be stuck with him or kick him out and e really will be homeless.\n\nI’m at the point where if I move out it means I have to cut myself off from this family entirely. I already don’t attend family functions for feeling like a black sheep. I would barely communicate with my dad, but it’s not like we even communicate now even though we’re five feet from one another.  \n\nI can move out and support myself pretty okay, but moving out and having to support my dad would mean constant poverty and inability to prepare for any kind of future. Very little opportunity to try and make my own way in life and build my own future. \n",

      "description": "Using a throwaway. I’m on mobile, sorry for formatting. \n\nThis happened in December, but it’s been weighing on me. Looking back, I feel like I was TA and am prepared to accept my judgement. \n\nSo every other year, my family, my cousins’ family, and my grandmother go on a trip to a foreign country during winter vacation. 2012 it was Costa Rica, 2014 it was Peru, 2016 it was Mexico, 2018 was Africa. My grandmother pays for all the expenses on these trips. They’re like a gift from her. \n\nLast year, I turned 18. The night of my birthday, I moved out of my parents’ house, and had been planning to do so since I was 14. My mom is incredibly manipulative and some would consider her emotionally abusive. She’s super emotionally immature and I just needed out of that situation. I can’t go into detail because word count, but it was really, really bad. \n\nSince then, every interaction I’ve had with her has turned into a fight. You know, like those fights that leave your head rushing with adrenaline and cortisol. It wasn’t good for my healing, my mental health, or my emotional development. So I decided to cut her off completely. \n\nThis meant that I decided not to go to Africa. My grandmother was devastated - constantly calling me begging for me to go, saying the trip wouldn’t be the same without me, even getting angry when I wouldn’t budge. I held my ground and said that I couldn’t be around my mom anymore, because every time I was around her I noticed more and more of her flaws and abusiveness rubbing off onto me and it was starting to affect my other relationships. I apologized to her repeatedly, telling her how much I wanted to go but that I really felt it would be detrimental to me. \n\nIn the end I didn’t go, and she lost 80% of the ticket cost, but what was most hurtful to her was that I didn’t go and this is (one of) her last family trips as she is getting older. My whole extended family was kind of upset at me, in varying degrees. \n\nI’m still sure I made the right choice for my mental health, but I think I was also selfish. AITA for what I did? ",

      "description": "I'm gonna spare the heavy details here because I dont want any bias. We have been dating almost 2 years now and are both in the final years of highschool. \n\nI went on a week long ski trip with my family in the beginning of March. It's the first trip we've had in a long time where me and my siblings all got together again. While I was out there I tried to text BF as much as possible, when I woke up, a little bit on the mountain, and more once I got done for the day and went back to the hotel. When I came home I was really glad to be back at school because this was the 4th trip my mom took my out of school for, I couldn't say no to them. The Tuesday after I got back I had a girl come up to me in person and tell me that she saw BF sitting in his car making out with some other girl during lunch while I was gone. Obviously i was pretty pissed so i ran out to his car and asked him what happened. He told me they just ate lunch. I badgered him more and he finally let out that it was his sophomore neighbor, they've been friends for a really really long time, they had lunch and then after school ate dinner then messed around driving trucks for a while. As far as I'm concerned, he can eat lunch with who ever he wants. I told him that, and that if he does have lunch alone with some other girl to just tell me about it so I dont have to have 3 people tell me \"BF was hanging out with another girl!!!!!1!!\" Because it's really annoying and really lowers my trust for him.\n\nSo that was the major incident that made me pretty mad and passive aggressive towards him for the past week. If I ever use his phone and open snapchat he tells me not to read his really personal messages with people so its whatever. He has probably 50 different girls he snaps every so often, some once a day, some once a month. Then if I check his texts he has around 4 or 5 girls that he'll check in on every day. Usually sparking a conversation with \"Hey 😊\" or \"Good morning 😚\". There were a few occasions of him calling other girls his baby which really pissed me off because that's how he texts me and if this is just how he texts everybody then it feels fake. I dont really have a whole lot of trust for him. I know it seems really petty to be mad at him over this but I just think it's really freaking weird that he texts these girls like he wants to get with them WHILE WE ARE DATING. Obviously itd be a different story if it happened before we were dating. \n\nSo yeah that's my side of the story, tried to make it as unbiased as possible with how I see things. He told me to post it on here to get some input because I was talking to him about the whole situation last night. \n\nSorry if the grammar is bad, I'm writing this on my phone. ",

      "description": "Sorry if there are any mistakes, english is not my first language, its my first time posting here, so bare with me.\n\nSo to make a really long story short, I met this guy in college a couple of years ago, we hit it off right away. He was fun, nice, funny and we ended up becoming really good friends, we \"dated\" for a bit, but we broke it off in good terms.\n\n2 Years passed, he tags me on instagram, its like talking to an old friend again. Eventually we meet up and that's when the 'friends with benefits' starts.\n\nwe plan to meet again at a party because it had been a while, and we also make plans for after it for some \"coffee\"\n\nThe day rolls around, and thats when the shit hits the fan. \n\nI buy him drinks, he buy me drinks and we make out a little, life is great. \n\nEventually he finds a girl there, we are 'friends with benefits' so I don't think any of it, I go, dance a little, sing some stupids songs and make out with another guy. \n\nI realise that I'm getting a little too tipsy so I decide to sit down on the couch. It had been some time since I saw him last, but I dont give a second thought. Eventually he comes, says that hes going out for a smoke and stumbles off. 2 hours passed and he not back, i start to worry a bit, thinking that he might've had to much to drink and passed out, so a messege him, he says he is on the dance floor.I messege him to come and see me at the couch, he comes and when I go for a kiss, he turn his cheek, mutters some BS about not being able to do it right now because he smoked and stumbles off again.\n\nThe rest of the night, he avoids me like I had the fucking plague. He tries to stay as far away as possible from me,and avoids me whenever we bump at eachother, even turning his back when I wlak pass. Obvously he wants nothing to do with me and Im annoyed so I wait until I sober up a little and messege him that Im going home.\n\nI walk home, alone, drunk, in the middle of the night - keep in mind, since we had made plans, I wasnt expecting to go home until the next day, I live an hour and a half away - and he messeges an hour latter saying simply \"im sorry\", I answer that he doesnt need to worry and for him to enjoy himself.\n\nI get home 2 hours later, took a shower and tried to get some sleep. That's when he messesges me again with \"im sorry\" \"i acted like an asshole\" \"I abandoned you\"\n\nI.was.Livid.\n\nI felt horrible that he would just ditch me like this, and avoid me like you avoid crazy people on the street. Im mad because he had no considaration over the plans we had made, what I said stands, i dont care about him being with other people. Had he told me that he didnt want it anymore I would've been fine, people change their mind, that's okay.\nBut just because we are friends with benefits doesnt mean you get to discart people like rubbish.\nI went back to sleep because I wanted to calm down to answer properly.\n\nWe havent talked much yet, im still mad.\n\nAm I the A-hole?",

      "title": "AITA For Wanting My Friend to Pay for Gas and Parking?",
      "description": "My friend and I went out last night to meet our usual friends. I usually pick him up and drop him off whenever we go anywhere because his car is broken. I dont mind it, he lives close by anyway. Not once have I asked him to pay for gas or pay for anything of mine. This time I asked for gas money because I was borrowing my dads car and he wanted me to pay him for gas and he offered 5 bucks which didnt even pay for the gas we used, but I was cool with it.\n\nWe went out and discovered that we had to pay for parking which was 5 bucks. I didnt have cash or debit card on me to get out cash and it's a cash lot. If I did have cash on me I would pay it no problem, you got gas, I'll get parking. So I told him to get it and he goes \"no that is not what was agreed upon. I'm sorry but I didnt agree to pay for this. If I'm getting gas you have to get parking.\" Well neither did I, and if I knew we had to pay for parking I would have bought cash, but I didnt. So I told him that I dont have cash or a debit card so I cant pay. He doesnt have cash on him but does have a debit card, but he reiterates adding he has bills to pay. \n\nThis dude makes 53k a year, and I never ask him for anything but this one time I asked him to spot me, he tells me no. Anyway I tell him \"dude it's not like this is an everyday thing. If I had the money I would pay it, but I dont so either we drive home and you give me gas money or you pay for parking and we meet our friends.\" Its like literally 10 bucks total that I'm asking him to pay, literally not breaking the bank. \n\nAnyway he refuses so we look around and we find street parking and we park there, and I'm a little tense and keep worrying about my car because I'm not 100% sure if were able to park there, I actually went to check on the car while we went from one bar to another to make sure I didnt get a ticket. (Btw while we were at the club he bought a drink. I think its oddly suspicious if you throw such a fit over 5 bucks because you dont have the funds, but buy yourself a 10 dollar drink. That made me realize that he did have money but he didnt want to help me out even though I needed it). \n\nI never do favors to get anything back, and had I had the cash, I would have paid for parking myself no problem no questions asked because that's just how I am. But the one time I asked him to spot me he says he can't because \"he didnt agree to this\". It makes me realize that if he could help me out, he wouldn't, meanwhile, I go out of my way to help him out. Now that hes done this I'm rethinking the limits of my friendship with him, and I want to stop giving him rides because of what I realized. \n\nNow redditors, am I the asshole for asking a friend to pay for parking and gas? And would I be the asshole if I stopped giving him rides because of this?",

      "description": "Chrissy was my best friend for four years, we hung out all the time and were roommates for two years. I felt like I put a lot into our friendship, not because I expected the same back, but because I genuinely wanted her to be happy and enjoyed doing so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example was her on-and-off emotionally abusive bf. I told her when she was feeling down, not to call him, who would make her feel worse, but come to me, even if it's 3am, come knock on my door and wake me up, and I will listen. She actually did this a couple times and I was happy to do it. I never judged her for going back to her stupid bf, I was supportive and listened and only gave advice when she asked (except for occasionally, when she really needed to hear he was an asshole and not good for her).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen she started acting differently. We were trying to plan a trip to Germany, and she kept canceling our dates to meet up and discuss flights/hotel (this happened 3 times), then on our trip she was stressed and kind of rude the whole time. Our trip was kind of a mess, we had trouble finding our hotels, our phones kept dying, etc. etc. I have a go-with-the-flow mentality, but she acted like our trip was ruined because of these things, and I feel like my trip was ruined only because I was with a Negative Nancy the whole time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't hold just that over her since it was a stressful trip, but then we met up for lunch one day after the trip. I finally felt like I was at a point where I could open up about some things in my life and not be judged (I'm a pretty closed-off, anxious person). And when I started talking about life, work, stress, she started to look up and down, sigh, say things like \"hm... yeah\" and look visibly bored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had put a lot into this friendship, and I didn’t expect the same things back, but I did expect her to listen for longer than 30 seconds without looking bored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I started telling her I’m too busy to hang out, then stopped responding at all, hoping she’d take the hint. After about a month, she sent me a mile-long message about how she is sorry for the way she acted on the trip, and if she loses me as a friend then she will be losing a great friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have not responded to it at all. And I haven’t talked to her about this. I don’t want to remain friends when I can’t even talk about my feelings without boring her, and she has stopped caring enough to be nice and try to have a good time when traveling. Some of my friends think I am being rude by not responding at all to my best friend of four years, but I am afraid any honest response about why we stopped talking will just come off as “you suck as a friend”, which I feel wouldn’t help anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not responding to her message at all?",

It has been rather miraculous, honestly. I suffer from amnesia for the day of the accident, and the many weeks to follow I was so drugged up that I can't remember a thing either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I am about ready to begin at work again, with a new job - I had concluded and resigned at my previous position just leading up to my accident.

She storms out, distraught and tells me she \"won't be home today\" and later texts me that if I care so little about her and the baby, that it's important to work far from home, maybe she needs to go for a bit, and I can get a feeling what really matters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for this whole shabang? I love my girlfriend, plan to propose to her soon, and desperately want to be with her. I know she feels the same way. We are just totally at odds here.

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my boyfriend has always had this sixth sense for people. Their motivations, their personality, their truths, and lies. If I'm ever unsure about someone, I just let my boyfriend talk to them for a bit. His intuition about people is on point. Normally, this is a good thing. Sometimes though, I get mad at him, because he does it to me too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample: \"No, it's not that you dislike this thing, you just think you dislike it because I suggested you would like it. You're projecting your insecurities about not being your own person onto this thing I just thought you'd like. When you were a kid, even into high school, your parents told you how to be, how to think, how to feel, etc. and it made you feel like you had no real identity. Now that you control your life and your person, you reject ideas that you think are telling you how to be.\" \n\nI was mad, but then I thought about it, and he was right. If something is suggested to me, I want to dislike it because I don't want anyone to feel like they control me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week he did it to my dad. My bf hugged me, and patted me on the back. He patted me a bit too hard by accident, and I said ow just because I'm a wimp and I want attention. No lies, I just say ow at almost anything because I'm fragile and shit. Anyway, my dad later took issue with it, and asked me if my boyfriend hurts me. I told him no, he doesn't, it was an accident and honestly, it wasn't really his fault. My dad was like, wrong answer, missy, and because a total piss-pot the rest of the day. So I told my bf, and it didn't phase him at all. \n\nhe goes: \"He's just being a father. Your his youngest child, and he's probably just overcompensating because he feels like he messed something up with his older children, and he wants to make it up by making sure you're perfect and safe.\"\n\nThing is, my dad admitted this to me a few months ago, and I hadn't told my bf that yet. How does he figure this shit out?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole for loving my boyfriends intuition, but also getting mad about it when he's right about me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend has great intuition about people, but I get kinda' bitchy when that intuition translates to me, too.

We're still in the honeymoon stage 6 months into our relationship. Recently I've been talking with guy friend of mine who goes to my school. He's been confused about his sexuality for a while and we talk about that a lot. I would just like to clarify that I am a lesbian meaning I have NO feelings towards this guy or any guy what-so-ever. The last time we hung out, we just cuddled and watched TV. It was really nice to just have some physical affection, no strings attached. As I was leaving he said \"I love you!\", which isn't odd we say that to each other all the time, but he just had a more serious tone in his voice. After talking with him I found out he had a crush on me. I'm loyal to my girlfriend and I don't like him at all, but I crave physical affection. No kissing, just some cuddling while watching a movie or TV. He follows me on my social media so he must know I have a girlfriend, cause I post about her all the time. She doesn't know that I have spent time with this guy, she gets pretty jealous at even the slightest of contact with anyone else. AITA for 1. not telling my girlfriend and 2. ignoring this boys crush on me and using him as a cuddle partner?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nThis evening I was discussing with my boyfriend about possibly coming up for a concert, this concert/event would last until literally 11pm. I live about an hour and a half or so drives away, and across a border, but I told him I would be more than willing to not only make the drive up there, pay for my OWN ticket to join him in the festivities but also, 'sleepover' at his place. I haven't gotten to stay over in a long time, so this would be ideal. \n\nThis is where things got a bit strained in the convo, because, instantly, it went down like this:\n\nBF: 'Sleepover? What are you, 10?'\nMe: 'You know what I meant, I can stay over at your place! It would be a fun day and we can enjoy sleeping together.' \nBF: 'You sound like a 15 yr old girl when you use the word 'sleepover' \nMe: '??? What do you want to call it, then?'\nBF: 'Spending the night?'\nMe: 'It means the exact same thing.'\nBF: 'Still sound like a little girl saying it.' \n\nI wasn't exactly upset by this nor irritated, but I felt like this entire situation was oddly strained and kind of ...odd? I'm not sure what to think but it's clear I upset him in some way or did something wrong by context. Is using this word really 'girly' and a bad idea to do so? I felt like it was appropriate and ok, it isn't like I was trying to say we'd have a SLUMBER PARTY WITH MOVIES AND CONFETTI! but, a 'sleep over' which to me, makes perfect sense.\n\nThoughts? I literally don't know what to make of my boyfriends behavior. ",

She eats here, sleeps here, showers here, does her laundry here, works remotely on her laptop here, and leaves her dog here 24/7.  I've always operated under the idea that anything more than a few days visit should be run by your roommate.  Like if I was going to have anyone - girlfriend or not - stay for more than a few days, I would run it by him first.  But he hasn't said shit to me, and I'm thinking he thinks he doesn't have to because I haven't spoken up about it (yet).  \n\nI'm getting kind of tired of her being here.  We all get along okay, but she's loud, and her dog barks, and she's not pitching in for bills, much less rent, despite living here the past two weeks.  \n\nI was planning to talk to my roommate about it, but when I mentioned this to a couple people at work, they seemed surprised that I'd be upset about it.  They acted like this was just normal girlfriend/boyfriend behavior, and that I was being unreasonable.  So am I being the asshole?

He had ignored my pleads to stop and then refused to take me seriously when I told him he had upset me. I told him I felt disrespected due to him ignoring what I thought was a very reasonable request and continuously invalidating my emotional response to what had happened.

      "description": "My (24M) gf (22F) have been dating for 7 months now. She's a sweetheart and I absolutely love this girl. One major problem is her mom.  It's a long story but in short she doesn't work, doesn't drive, and makes my gf do everything for her.  Gf's mom had a house foreclosed on her and my GF took a mortgage in her name.  Tha'ts another story all together but necessary to set the stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is where AITA comes in.  About 3 months ago, I was curious as to why my gf and I didn't put anything on Facebook about how we were dating or mark it as \"in a relationship with xxx\".  She was adamant she doesn't use Facebook and that its old.  Huh okay I get that, a lot of people trended away from that and she is always on IG.  Anyway curiosity got the best of me and I found the Facebook.  The most recent activity was while we were dating and it was one of her older pics on IG uploaded with some caption I knew my gf wouldn't write. Well I brought it up to my gf and she said her mom has the account and looks on there. She's known of this and let it happen.  I told her it wasn't okay and made me uncomfortable.  I asked to have it deleted but she said she didn't want to fight with her mom over it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understood and let it go.  Until last night she mentioned a story about how her mom had just shown her messages from kids she went to highschool with dming her being typical creepy in her messages.  She says her mom ignores it but this was past my boundaries and really upset me.  I got really mad and told her that this needs to stop and it needs to be deleted. I made her text her mom right then and get rid of the account. Its still there....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked into it more and did some grade C detective work to see if she used the account (she didn't accept my friend request from months prior).  I looked at some of the likes and checked those account's profile pictures to see if my gf's name appeared. Shocker... they did. I got absolutely furious about how this makes me look and how this needs to change or our relationship will not continue.  I don't want to put my gf against her mom but she is abusive and its ruining our relationship.  So reddit, AITA for being pissed off that my gf doesn't change the dynamic with her mom and me taking it out on my gf making her feel shitty over this?",

      "description": "Hey reddit. I'm an 18 yr old male, I'm currently out of school and have a basically full-time job (7 hours). Before this, I was still out of school (I graduated early) but with no job. During this time my role in the family was to help my mother watch the infant (only an hour or so a day), clean up around the house, and most importantly, make dinner every night. It was something I was passionate about and enjoyed doing, and it would take quite a while to create big, elaborate dinners for my family of 6. They complimented me on the food many times and obviously enjoyed it.\n\nHowever, they did complain that the food was usually 'late' (they wanted it ready at around 5:30 or 6 but i usually finished it at 6:30 or 7). And during this time they would also accuse me of doing nothing all day.\n\nAdditionally, Im cool with some times just eating a sandwich or some cereal or some instant ramen for dinner, yknow, simple easy &amp; quick stuff but they demanded full sit-down meals every night.\n\nNow, though, I have a job and get home around 8pm. I no longer make dinner, but they still want me to. They still want me to make these big meals for my 6-person family, every night. I just feel like, they're grown-ass adults, if they want a big meal, they can make it themselves.",

      "description": "I live with my partner in a smallish townhouse, and we have two dogs of our own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're friends with a couple who also have two dogs, both of which suck. One pees at random while inside (anxiety I guess?), and the other is unpredictable--I don't feel comfortable petting the dog because he's growled and snapped at random before; he does the same to our dogs. All of this is to say that when our friends come over, I don't even like them to bring these two, but it's whatever. I deal with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, the friends are going on a trip later this year and need extra money, so they've been dog sitting on weekends. We've recently invited them to stay over a few times, and the day before (or day of) they'll ask if it's ok to bring one or two extra dogs that they're watching. As a result, after discussing it with my partner we always cancel and suggest they stay over on a night when they aren't watching extra dogs, because I just don't feel like having all of those dogs in my house. We then make plans with them for the following weekend, because at that point they haven't scheduled anything dog-wise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next weekend, we'll find out that they're watching a dog(s), and our friends will ask if it's ok for the dog(s) to come too. My partner has asked me several times \"what's the difference between 4 and 5 (or 6) dogs?\" and I don't really have a good answer. I don't think there *is* a big difference between 4 and 5 dogs, or 5 and 6 dogs. He completely backs me up when I say no to our friends, but is way more ambivalent about the matter than I am. Communication with this couple has gotten increasingly passive aggressive, and they have made it obvious that they think I'm being unreasonable. Am I being the asshole for not letting our friends bring what I would consider to be a zoo over to our house? ",

I can see in my rear view mirror that the car behind me was furious that I did not assert myself more as he raised his hand and was screaming. As soon as I thought it was safe, I passed through the intersection. The car behind me sped up with disregard to pedestrians and tried to pull up to my right staring angrily at me. I admit I was pretty angry myself for his actions so I rolled down the window and said in an aggressive tone “yo! What’s up?!”. As soon as the driver heard this, he broke eye contact and rolled up his window. To be honest as I am writing this, I am beginning to realize I may have put my girlfriend in danger if the guy turned out to be a lunatic. At the moment, I just thought I would stand my ground without being overly aggressive. My girlfriend is clearly angry at me for being a bully. So let’s hear it, AITA?",

Anywho, I was at work and another employee who works there forgot to engage their e-brake to their car. Their car was parked up a small hill right in front of mine and over the course of our shifts their car rolled over to mine and bumped into it. Their car was parked in reverse as was mine and it was a front bumper to front bumper hit. This happened while we were both working and eventually a third employee getting ready to go home notices the situation and calls HR to let them know.\n\nSo, we both get called out to the parking lot and HR explained to us that they had reviewed the camera footage and the other employee was at fault for they had seen it roll down the hill in the footage. At some point I was also shown the footage and it was clear that the employee didnt engage their e-brake and thus was at fault.\n\nAfter this HR left us there to settle the situation at our own will. Note that I had just purchased my car and it was brand new. We  took pictures and after the employee backed their car off of mine we noticed that the damages were minimal. My front bumper received a minor scuff with no paint taken off. The employee offered me around $200 to fix the damages and told me they couldn't afford their insurance to go up. At this point I felt the need to call my partner. My partner wasn't very pleased and immediately told me to make a claim. So I did just that and I received around $700. \n\nBut I want to know your thoughts. ",

I had met most of his housemates in the past and one of them I kind of instantly felt a connection with her. She would laugh at my dumb jokes find excuses to touch me etc. \n\nSo early on at the party, my friend and I are having a chat, talking about the ladies and he tells me that he had hooked up with her a few weeks back and I forget the exact context but he said that they were still just friends, being housemates and all. So at that point I’m thinking ok, she’s fair game. \n\nShe and I talked pretty much the whole rest of the party and I’m not gonna lie, I was into this girl. So we head off together to the club that the whole group us decided to meet up at. \n\nOnce we get to the club, we are dancing together the whole time and what not, and about an hour later my friend shows up to the club. A bit later, we are talking and he tells me that he wants to go for the girl and I tell him that I would back off. \n\nObviously I was a little upset about this but hey the whole club is filled with girls. By this point, I’m fairly drunk. Anyway, the whole group kind of gets together in a circle and the girl comes up to me and we start dancing and getting close and eventually start hooking up. A few minutes later, my friend leaves seemingly upset. I go outside to talk to him and he kind of ignores me the whole time, eventually calling a cab home. I go back inside and continue to have a great time with this girl until we, too, go back to the house. \n\nAm I the asshole for not backing down when my friend told me to?",

      "description": "This semester I took an upper level engineering class where 2/3 of the grade is based on 5 group homework assignments. We had a peer review after each one that was given directly to the professor that he said would be used to adjust our grades at the end of the semester. There were a couple of people in our group who always wanted to get the homeworks done well ahead of time which is fine by me, but since I took 19 hours this semester and had a job, I wasn’t always able to work on it as early as they did. It got to the point that when I said I would work on a part, they would do it themselves if I didn’t get it done in a couple of days (we usually had a couple weeks for each one). Two or three of them would also meet up to work on it without saying anything to me or during a time they knew I couldn’t meet because of work. I didn’t say anything about it because they did good work and we got good grades, plus I still did anything they asked me to (which was rare). Towards the end of the semester, I was figuring my grade was borderline between a B and an A and that I may have to take the optional final to bump it up. However, when we got our grades back after the peer evaluations were factored in, I had a low B and realized that my homework grade was over 10 points lower than one of my partners, making it impossible to get an A. I understand them marking me a little lower on the peer reviews for not contributing as much, but I feel like I didn’t have much opportunity to contribute unless I shirked other responsibilities and my overall grade took about a 6-7 point hit for it. AITA for thinking that’s a bit harsh? Should I have done more or said something during the semester? I’m honestly okay with the B but I want to know if I was a terrible group member. ",

Not that I feel he \"owes\" me. \"Steve\" works at the local pizza place. \n\nSo recently my wife's sister moved in with us. She your basic \"fuck up\" (dui's, drugs, alcoholic). She used to work full time at a job she loved, now its part time at a local pizza place. She makes friends fast and this guy Caleb starts coming around. He seems nice enough and tells me some crazy shit. Almost right off the bat, which brings up red flags immediately. This guy worms his way into my family and everyone thinks he's awesome. Anyways, he moves to Texas (used to live here in CA) with a close friend of ours. When the part timer starts to feel the relationship is stayed she confides in Steve, he then proceeds tell he a whirlwind of things, that Caleb has said. \n\nLike how he told everyone he witnessed her shoot up, (I know it's not true, she just smokes weed like a monster) how she abused crystal meth, uses people ect. ect. He then says that the whole time he would come to our house he was trying to nail my wife. When I hear this I question the so called \"feindship\" with Steve. Everyone starts in on me and how I'm the asshole for not being mad at Caleb, so I respond that I am, but I hardly knew the guy. I'm mostly upset with Steve because he knew for a while about his intentions and said nothing due to \"bro code\". He only knew Caleb for a year and has known me for about 7 years. Though be it we aren't close.\n\nTL;DR sister in laws co-worker was trying to sleep with my wife. An old friend knew and said nothing, AITA for being more mad at the old friend? ",

      "description": "As a little bit of backstory, I've known my friend \"Liz\" since we were four, instant best friends, spent our childhoods together, stayed close through college despite the distance, etc. My family was always a little more well off than hers, but it never caused any tension between us. We've talked about financial stuff before (both mine and hers -- I was unemployed for a while and stressed about making ends meet, she's had to work multiple jobs in the past which has run her down). She's also known for a while about a trust fund my grandmother set up for me that I would eventually use either to pay for grad school or as a down payment on a house. I've always acknowledged how great this is, how lucky and grateful I am because most people our age (we're 24) won't be able to buy for at least another 5-6 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo on to the story. I recently decided it was time to buy a house and have been looking. Liz knew this and was super supportive of me -- I would send her listings and she'd comment on how cute they were, the location, all the stuff you'd expect. Well, I put in my first offer on a place two weeks ago, and immediately got extremely anxious. This place was way under my budget, so I wasn't worried about finances, just the whole existential dread of \"oh god, I'm going to be in debt for so long, this is so much money, etc.\" I texted her about the offer and told her how I was feeling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe asked me why I was so anxious and I explained all of the above. She pretty much brushed me off, and said \"I don't know if I'm the best person to talk to about this because I'd love to be in your position. Sorry that you're so stressed.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was really hurt. I was honestly on the brink of a panic attack, and she didn't even try to put aside her own feelings and help me. I haven't talked to her much since (we normally text through out the day and send each other dumb tweets), and the more I think about it, the more confused I get. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I've been dating this girl for 5 months, and last month, we decided to to make it official. However, she only revealed to me that she has depression last week.\n\nOne thing you have to know about me is that I'm a 22-year-old guy who can't handle negative emotions very well. She knew about this even before we started dating, because I was known as the quiet, carefree guy with a dry humor. Whenever there's drama, I'm usually ten feet away from it. She also knows I have A LOT on my plate (health, personal, financial issues), but we pushed through with the relationship believing it would be good for us.\n\nI've also previously dated a girl with depression about 2 years ago. It ended with her almost slashing her wrist in front of me (I don't know if it was a guilt trip tactic or if it was real, but I didn't want to find out), so I pretty much avoided girls with mental illness since then.\n\nWhen my new gf told me she also has depression and is also suicidal, I was speechless for about two minutes because I was really shocked. She seemed pretty chill and fun when we were hanging out, although there were times she was really down (I chalked it up to work stress), which I thought was pretty normal for people our age. I then told her I could not go through with the relationship and explained why. I tried my best to speak calmly and in the nicest possible way. I was also careful with my words, in the hopes of not triggering her. She was also pretty calm during the conversation, although I could tell she was holding back her tears. Her best friend also called me up to ask if we could give it another chance, but I told her I need time to think \n\nI really thought at the time that I had no choice but to break up with her because I couldn't give her the emotional and physical support that a person with depression demands. However, I'm now having second thoughts because she might do something harmful to herself or others as a result of the breakup, and I care enough to not want anything bad to happen to her.\n\nSo, AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend after finding out she has depression given my circumstances?",

      "description": "I’m so sorry for the long long post, I shortened as best I could!\n\n\nTl;dr: \nAITA for having a fight with coworkers and raising my voice first after they didn’t do work I needed urgently?\n\n\nSo I am currently managing a big project at work. For this project i have been told by boss and CEO to get any support I need, including from three of the team leaders, V, M and A.\n\nOne week ago, I asked them to please do some work for the project, explained what I needed, if they had any questions etc, deadline yesterday, because I had to deliver the final work today. Come today, none of them had done any of the work, and also not approached me letting me know that they couldn’t meet the deadline. Since that was the third time within a few months that they ignored an assignment from me, I asked them for a meeting today. We usually get along great, are even friends, and I told them I was disappointed and a little hurt because it felt like they weren’t taken me seriously and because I couldn’t rely on them. I was afaik relatively calm, voice maybe a bit shaky cause I’m an easy crier. \n\nA then says they had too much on their plate, and why didn’t I do the whole assignment instead of them, when I had time for stuff like “task she deemed not important, but actually was done for THEM, because if I didn’t, their new hires would not have computers, desks or chairs when they started next week”.\n\nI was now getting mad because I didn’t feel like justifying myself for doing work that benefited them, when we were talking about work they had neglected to do. I will admit, I raised my voice at that and it became a fight. V was mostly quietly crying, M was trying to calm us down and A and I were arguing loudly. After a long back and forth, M apologized on all of their behalf and said she was sorry they let me down and they would work on the issue in the future. I told them I’d just need a bit to calm down but that we would get over this. V was still crying and i asked if I had hurt her with something I said, she said no, it’s just a bit much, she needs to calm down. So I left to finish the work.\n\nCouple hours later, my boss calls me in and questions me about the incident. Turns out V and A had told her about it, even though we said we were not going to involve her(boss). I told my boss we’d deal with it and confronted V and A, now really freaking mad and definitely shouting. They think I’m the bad guy because I shouldn’t have yelled at them. I said that they yelled back and that sometimes fights just escalate, they are adamant that the whole thing is my fault and I should have just sent an email saying they missed the deadline. After half an hour of this i just left the office crying.\n\nI can definitely appreciate that I’m a fairly emotional person and I know I should not have yelled at them - but it’s not like they were innocently sitting there being screamed at by a banshee- they provoked me and it was an argument with raised voices on both sides. But I’m too involved in this, I need someone from the outside to maybe tell me I’m in the wrong. So, AITA?",

He says he does this because the little chunks of milk and cream that dry on the edge sometimes flake off and fall into his glass of milk/cereal/coffee. \n\n\n\nThis is problematic for me because:\n\n1. It's only the two of us, so we go through milk and cream slowly\n\n2. Every time he blows on it, he is forcefully depositing his mouth/saliva bacteria on the rim and inside whatever container he is blowing on.

      "description": "We use to be roommates in college. Our first semester of our first year we were awesome friends having lots of fun. Even in highschool we were very close! The second semester, we began drifting apart. I would try to talk to her and she kinda talked down to me and made me feel like crap. When she wouldn't talk down to me, she would hide in her dorm (we had suites). So we didn't talk since college. (about 6 months) Last semester (my second year 1st semester) she asks me out of the blue if I would go to her wedding and wear a dress. Not really thinking, I said \"sure! Just talk to me more okay, I miss you!\" She said she was busy and that's why she didn't message me. I decided that college was college and before it we were awesome friends in HS &amp; first semester so maybe we just weren't a good roommate match. So for the past few months I've sent her messages and she just responds with one word or makes excuses when I ask if she wants to hang out. I'm like \"how come you never message me and when we do talk I have to initiate it?\" She says because she's in school or has to work and even was \"cleaning\" one time. She's ALWAYS busy. I get being busy, I work 2 part time jobs and go to college FULLtime. I make time for people I care about. I thought maybe we weren't good as roommates but we could be friends again that's really why I agreed. I thought her wedding would be good for us to start talking again and I could be a friend to support her.\n\nI feel like it's an asshole move to say yes then bail, I also feel like it's a jerk thing to have time for other people (goes on fancy trips with other friends) and expect me to go support you when you don't do anything to keep this friendship going. I get some comments will most likely say \"She's planning, she's probably stressed get over yourself.\" However, I can't help but feel used. \n\nHow would you guys feel in my situation? Is there anything you would do differently? Have you been in a similar situation and can help shed some light? I want to do the right thing, I just feel shitty that my \"friend\" doesn't seem to give a crap about me. Yes, I know she's probably busy, just can't I have 5 minutes out of your day or an out of blue \"how are you?\" Is that too much to ask?\n\nAlso, willing to give more info or clarify anything that seems confusing. Kinda writing this from the heart. No editing.",

      "description": "Without going into too much detail I lent a friend of mine some money to help them out when they moved to my city when I got them a job. My friend at first was very open about paying me back and said whenever they got their first full paycheck they would pay me back. Well that full paycheck came and went and first it was sorry not this month, then it was “well how about I pay for your groceries for the month” only for them to back out and not even apologize, then it just turned to completely silence on their part, like it never happened. They’re always struggling with money and I didn’t say anything because I thought I would be pushing things and at first I kept getting reassurances at first until it finally stopped.\n\nWhat really made me reconsider things is that this person decided to put down money for not one, but two tattoos. These tattoos are not exactly expensive but aren’t cheap either. They were telling me that the cost was somewhere around $300. It made me realize that’s part of what they own me, and despite them saying they don’t have any money, somehow they now have money for tattoos. On top of that they want to take a trip during the summer, which will easily run five to six hundred dollars. They’re more focused on these things than they are paying me back, if they even intend to still do that. \n\nI asked for advice from some of my not mutual friends that don’t know my friend if I should confront this person. One friend said though, if you confront them you’re going to look like the bad guy cause you’re taking away their money to do things like tattoos and going on vacation. Another said this person had no intentions of paying me back and is just using me, so why deal with it. One thing they all have in common is they think I should drop this friend as soon as I get the chance, one even saying I should try to get them fired as payback. \n\nI’m worried about confronting this person since because they have a very hot/cold attitude that turns very fast when they get angry. I have seen people be on the receiving end of it and have been on the receiving end as well. It’s not good and is only compounded more because they know I’m not someone who argues. I’ve learned the hard way though not to let people borrow money from me anymore. It was a hard way to learn it but now I know. \n\nTL:DR- Am I the asshole for wanting to get paid back since this person has made everything else but paying me back priority? ",

      "description": "Ok let me put this into context.\n\nUp until recently (9 days!) I was a pretty heavy smoker. My country would have to have the most brutal taxes on cigarettes, they are f*cking expensive.\n\nA few weeks ago I was outside a convenience store having a powerpuff when I noticed a disheveled, middle aged man in a wheelchair. He was wheeling up to every smoker in sight and having a brief interaction with each of them. Although I could not hear what was being said, the situation was all too obvious; he was clearly looking to satiate his nicotine addiction. \n\nI made sure I was not looking at him directly, but I monitored his movements in my peripheral vision. Inevitably I became the next nearest smoke that had not rejected his request and I notice him start to wheel towards me. I had headphones in, and had never looked directly at him, however I could tell he would be persistent in getting my attention. Two steps in the opposite direct (to him) was a set of stairs, that had at least 12 risers, leading down to the street. I pursed my lips around the butt of my cigarette, took a deep draw and descended the stairs.\n\nI have pondered on this situation a few times recently, concerned it may sway the balance of my cosmic karma...\n\nI guess cigarettes are bad for you... so like the other half dozen smokers in that man's vicinity, I didn't enable him to damage himself with a cigarette...\n\nI don't know...

      "description": "This is written on mobile, so apologies for bad format.\n\nI've been best friends with this girl, let's call her K, for about 5 years now. We're really close. Ever since I met her she's always been the \"mom\" of any group. She wants to have plenty of kids in her lifetime, and now at the age of 19, she is currently pregnant for her first time. About a month into the pregnancy, she moved into her first apartment with the boyfriend/father, and her dog. The apartment is small. 1 bedroom/bath, living room, and kitchen. Fine for her and the bf and maybe one dog, but I immediately saw a future problem with having a kid, and not having any room for him.\n\nThrough the pregnancy I've tried to help K anyway I can. Lunch/dinner dates when she had no food, I've bought multiple things like a crib, bouncer, etc for the child because she just cant afford it. \n\nA week ago, she sent me a picture of a 140 pound German Shepard. They adopted him. I told her it was a bad decision, but she didn't listen and they kept him. So they now have two very large dogs, two parents, and a child on the way. \n\nHer boyfriend just lost his job, and she lost her second job. They are running very low on money and have hardly any food. I talked to her, and explained that maybe she should second think things, maybe try to find somewhere else to live at all possible, but she just brushed me off and hasn't really talked to me since. \n\nI'm really worried about how this child is going to be raised up without even a bedroom and the dogs don't even fit in a room together without it being tight. I feel like an asshole telling her she made a mistake with the second dog, and that she just doesn't have room for a child, but I don't know what to do anymore. I'm worried about her future, and I know she expects me to babysit anytime she needs it..AITA for telling her off?\n\ntl;dr My best friend is having a baby In a one bedroom apartment with two large dogs and I'm worried about the baby not even being able to eat, so I told her how I felt. \n",

      "description": "So, this will be extremely short since it's all pretty straightforward.  I ordered pizza.  It was an hour late (that does not include the 30 mins I give them to prepare/cook pizza) I had to call up the place five times before I got an answer - funnily enough as soon as I said I had been waiting an hour,  they knew what order I was.\n\nAnyway, the guy is just leaving as I get connected to the call.  okay,  cool pizza will be here soon.\n\nPizza guy turns up,  I mention that I ordered a Pepsi Max and he rummages through his car. The following conversation happens;\n\n&gt;'Tango?'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"No, I ordered Pepsi Max.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'Oh ... Coke Cherry?'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"No. That's not what I ordered. I ordered Pepsi Max.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'Oh ... then I'll have to go back and get it.'  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Okay then,\"\n\nI don't know, usually, I just accept these things and say 'don't worry about it' but not tonight.

      "title": "AITA for wanting my girlfriend keep a baby that she wants to abort?",
      "description": "This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons but I really am not sure what to do or whether I am being really unreasonable. \n\nI have just finished University and got a job in my chosen career, my girlfriend is still studying yet she has a job at the side. We live together and we have been together 4 years, everything is perfect. We have never really been the couple to argue. It is my first ever serious relationship and I love her with all my heart as cringe as that sounds. We have spoken about wanting kids and she does want them but not until she has finished studying. She is on the pill and has been for the whole of our relationship. \n\nA few weeks ago she missed her period and hadn’t had it for over a week, she began panicking and went and got a pregnancy test. Sure enough it came back positive. She told me as if she was scared of my reaction but I was really happy which I think made her confused. I’ve always wanted to be a dad, I never had a dad in my life and I’ve always vowed to be the best dad I can to my kids in the future. Her reaction wasn’t the same she was crying hysterically and was visibly worried asking me what she was going to do? This hurt me seeing her like that but at the same time I was really worried because I knew she was going to be thinking abortion is an option. \n\nWhen she calmed down I was doing everything I can to support her, I reassured her no matter what she chose to do I’d stick by her. She immediately said she wanted an abortion, I asked why and she said she doesn’t think she could handle studying with a young child. I said I’d do everything in my power to look after the child, I’d quit my job and look after him/her because I truly want to be a father I feel ready and it feels right with her, I’m scared of losing her and not finding love again and losing my chance to be a dad. \n\nShe could see I was really hurt as I was tearing up, which I tried to avoid because I didn’t want to seem like I was guilt tripping her. It’s been 2 week since this and we have spoke about it every day. She still seems set on having an abortion but I think she is really worried about my feelings. She is putting off the doctors appointment. I know she has to decide soon and it’s down to her but I really don’t know what to do.   I really really want this baby I can financially support them, I am ready to be a dad. I am also scared if she aborts it I will start resenting her which I also don’t want. I feel like I’m already emotionally connected to this baby after 2 weeks and I’ll be heartbroken if she aborts. \n\nTLDR; my LT girlfriend is pregnant. She wants to abort / doesn’t feel ready. I really want her to keep the baby and I feel really ready to be a father. Need advice on what to do or how to handle it if she chooses to abort. Am I the asshole for wanting to keep the baby?\n\n(I am not against abortion I do understand it’s a women’s body and it’s in their right to abort if they don’t want to carry the child)",

I never liked that people work for money and decide to spend it on me when I don't deserve it, even when they are trying to be nice.\n\nMy best friend has a tendency to go against the fact that I hate this. Occasionally when we hang out we go driving around, for example, he will stop at a fast food place and ask what I want. He knows this is a pet peeve of mine, but does it anyways. I always feel bad when he tries to do something nice for me and I reject him, so I go along with it. \n\nSometimes we go to the store and I see something I want and I grab it. When we go to checkout, he always insists on buying what I picked out, even tho I told him I don't want him spending money on me. I can tell that it bothers him when I reject his offer.\n\nI know these are just a few small instances, but they bother me a lot. It seems that no matter how much I tell him to respect my wishes, he goes against it. I know it's not a big deal, but I can't help but feel bad for wanting to reject him when he wants to do something nice for me. AITA?",

      "description": "My mom tried to choke me last May, in my grandparents house. I don't remember the exact reason, probably because I was disrespecting her or was on my electronics too much. Regardless, I don't think that there's any reason to choke your own son, unless they're trying to choke you. Here's some messages I sent to friends the day this happened:  \n\n\n\"My grandparents literally saw me on the floor (side note, clutching my laptop because I like having access to communicate with literally anyone) and told me to apologise to my mother. They didn't try to defend me, rather her actions, saying shit like \"She's your mother, you can't disrespect her no matter what she does.\"\n\n  \nI did not try to choke her back, although I may have hurt her while trying to get away, possibly with my nails considering how long they used to be. I personally don't think hurting someone with my nails is as bad as choking someone.\n\n  \nI bring up the fact she tried to choke me often when she gets pissed at me and starts shouting at me, whenever she says \"because she cares\", I tell her that someone who cared about me wouldn't try to choke me, and she proceeds to tell me how I'm trying to guilt her by repeatedly bringing up that point, and how it's in the past, and that she won't fall for being guilted by that.\n\nAnother thing I bring up is the fact I have a video of her verbally berating me for 20 minutes straight, because I was shouting at my dad who was pissed at me for disrespecting my uncle. My disrespecting my uncle, he means \"talking back\", because my uncle said we left the lights on downstairs for 30 minutes when it wasn't even 10 minutes, and I told him that. This happened less than a month after my grandpas death, so my dad tried to guilt me saying that I don't care about how hard it is on him and my uncle that their father died, while he disregarded that their father is my grandpa, and I care just as much about his death. My mom took over from my dad and started berating me. I, for the most part, didn't reply, rather just recorded this for around 20ish minutes.  \n\n\nATIA for bringing this up multiple times? \n\n  \nSide note: I live in Saudi and my family are muslims, so not much I can do about leaving to some other house.",

      "description": "The question probably makes me sound like a dick. And it probably sounds trivial.     \n  \nBasically, my mum (60F) doesn't have much of an interest in makeup. She wears it every day, but doesn't care to do anything interesting with eye makeup or anything. I (31F) have quite an interest in makeup, am often complimented on it, have a good collection and skill and whatnot... however I am not a makeup artist. I do *my own* makeup very well, but I've had 15+ years practice on this face. I have done makeup on like 2-3 other people before, but one for a formal, and others just for fun... not for a wedding.    \n    \nLast week, my mum just flat out said (not asked), \"I fly back in around midday on the Saturday, so you'll have to do my eye makeup for the wedding. I'll do the rest, but I need you to do the eye makeup, so you'll have to get yourself ready early so you have time to do it\" (we are both going to this wedding). I told her I don't think I should, we have very different eye shapes and application would be completely different (hers are small and very hooded, while mine are not; we even have different colour eyes), and I've never done eyeshadow on her type of eye shape (which is notoriously challenging), what if I fuck it up? She said, \"You'll just have to practice on me in the meantime\". So I brought out all my palettes that night, tested a bunch shades that everything that one of us chose either didn't suit her eye colour, or her outfit, or just didn't look right in application on her. I haven't been able to do any other tests on her since I've been working and haven't really seen her much, and now she is in another city until Saturday... the afternoon of the wedding.    \n    \nI feel like I've been pushed into this, and I really don't want to do it because she can be a bit of a JustNo and I feel like if it doesn't look amazing and like a makeup artist did it, she will get pissed off with me and angry that it didn't turn out how she wanted. But if I tell her I can't do it, she will get angry because \"It's just eyeshadow! Just do it!\". I'm happy for her to use literally any of my palettes if she wants. She's done her eye makeup way more than me (which is literally that one time). I think she should just pop into a Mecca store and get them to put eyeshadow on her for her since they are trained, but she may not have the time.  \n  \nWIBTA if I told her I am not comfortable doing it? I feel like if I let her know now, maybe she can go into a Sephora or Mecca during this week and ask them what she should do on the day and it will turn out better. But also, she kind of expects me to do it now and she hates when her expectations are not met, and I will get blamed for things that aren't even my fault on the day just because she will be irritable.\n",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago but for whatever reason just popped into my head today. \n\nSo I get a knock on the door and it is a couple of Indonesian people trying to sell me LED lights or something. I just remember being vaguely interested and let them into the front room of the house. \n\nAfter speaking to them and realizing I wasnt very interested I started just umming and uhhing on their prices until I said 'I'm not too sure actually' \n\nAfter this they proceeded to speak to each other right in front of me in Indonesian, knowing that I couldnt understand what they were saying. I felt incredibly disrespected in my own house and asked them to leave. I told them I thought it was very rude to start talking in a language I didnt understand to hide a conversation from me in my house. \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "I(m-14) have been living with my mom for about the past 7 years (coming up on 8) and given the short opportunity to live with my dad. (This coming from a bed bug outbreak where I had to relocate.) I usually live with my mom on the weekdays and go to my dad's on the weekend. \n\nHowever, over the past couple of months or so, I've been living with my dad and doing occasional visits to my mom's house to reset my room so we can get new flooring. Usually, when I was asked if I was moving back over there, I would say that yes, eventually once the situation evened out, I'd be back. \n\nMy parents live very close to each other, maybe 5-7 blocks apart, very close, walking distance, even.\n\nRecently, however, I've considered staying with my dad reverse the old schedule (m-f dad, s-s mom). Just about 30 minutes ago, I told my mom that I liked my dad's house way more. I have my computer and Oculus rift here, I have an actual monitor here, my dad lets me go out way more, and I don't have to constantly be around 4 very annoying siblings who are nearly never quiet. My WiFi is way better and I'm expected to do well in school, otherwise I will have my things taken away. But here's where I think the infraction lies: I told my mom that I liked my dad more than her, only when she asked. That is the truth, but I feel like I overstepped and should have just lied. On the other hand, my mom has had near full custody over me since they divorced in 2011(~?). I'm insanely worried that I might've set her anxiety off, and I fell bad. I've told her I love her, but I just like my dad more. AITA?\n\ntl;dr: I didn't want to live at my mom's 5/7 of the week, said I liked my dad more and wanted to live w/ him. ",

      "description": "My roommate and I have lived together for over two years at this point. During this time, we've both been fairly messy as we've gone through various stuff in life, and are mid-twenties dudes. We've lived with other awful roommates, and have always gotten along great. At this point, it's just us and one other guy who we like. All three of us have been very close friends for over 10 years.\n\nSince we moved into this apartment last year, which is nicer than anywhere we've lived before, we've both expressed the desire to keep this place clean. It's been okay, but is still messy. The thing is, I am a lot cleaner than him. I am take the trash out literally 90% of the time. I have been the ONLY person to clean our bathroom the entire time we've lived here (the third roommate has his own). He's gone on week-long-vacation a couple of times and has left a bunch of dishes out.\n\nThe thing is, I feel partially responsible because I haven't ever really complained about it to him before.\n\nRecently, he's been really depressed. His girlfriend moved across the country a month ago, and he got laid off from his job a week ago. He's gained a lot of weight, and while I've tried to do what I can to be there for him, I can't exactly take responsibility for his mental health.\n\nOver the last few weeks, it's gotten to the point where I come home from working 10 hour days every day and spend 20 minutes cleaning the kitchen, sweeping, etc, before I even feel like I can sit down and relax. I tried to really gently bring it up, and he was amicable -- but nothing has changed. If I try to bring it up more forcefully, given what he's going through, would I be an asshole?",

      "description": "Hey everyone, using a throwaway acc for this because anxiety but\n\nBasically the story is as follows:\n\nBoth of my parents have smoked my entire life. They didn't used to be too bad about it, they only smoked in our garage or outside for years (although they would smoke with me in the car, leading to me not being able to breathe in properly as an adult). \n\nThis past year I finally moved out to go to university, and I don't know when it happened but they've started to smoke INSIDE the house, in our living room, their bedroom, you name it. So whenever I come home to visit, I'm practically holed up in my room so I dont have to breathe it. And whenever I go back up to uni I have to wash ALL OF MY BELONGINGS because they smell like smoke and it drives me nuts.\n\nI've straight up told them many times that I don't like being around smoke, I'd prefer not to breathe it, etc. And while my father is somewhat respectful, my mom usually gets really hurt feelings about it. \n\nI once told her I was making a presentation for my class about the dangers of secondhand smoking and she took it as a personal attack against her. I told her that wasn't the case and I was just suggesting that smoking in public areas should be a little more regulated because there is cold hard evidence that secondhand smoke is fucking dangerous. She told me it was all bullshit and I was only doing it to oppose her (which she has told me I do a lot regarding other things?? I don't know.) And not only that, we have two cats and a dog in our house. Cigarettes are HIGHLY toxic to animals and I've told my family on multiple occasions not to smoke around our animals as they can't really just get up and leave the house. They ignore me and say they'll be fine, and then throw a fit whenever we have to take them to the vet. \n\nAnyways, AITA for trying to set boundaries with them about this? I'm so frustrated and I hate coming home now. I'm currently in a dorm but next year when I move into my apartment I'm bringing both of the cats with me but I still feel terrible about having them there. \n\n",

Let's start with background on that.\n\nMy mom and dad met, mom got pregnant with my sister, they married. Had my other sister and me. Somewhere along that time my dad got addicted to drugs and alcohol, and it escalated to restraining orders, daily fights when he still came by etc. Eventually when I was 2, he came by and ended up locking us in the house and lighting it on fire.\n\nWe're all fine, house burns down though. Dad is arrested and sent to prison. Mom and him get divorced and he loses visitation rights/other parental rights. In that time my mom had to move from Michigan to Ohio(4 hours) for a job, and that's where I grew up.\n\nMy dad sent letters, called, and we visited him twice in prison, and both times I don't remember. So I basically grew up with him barely in my life until around age 12(I think) when he got released.\n\nWe visit him occasionally, but the 4 hours distance can be hard to work around school/activities/etc. Still, we see him in the summer and some holidays. About 3-5 times a year, from a couple days to a month long. It was somewhere along this arrangement that I realized I didn't love him. It isn't that I hate him, I just never was able to build a connection and now it just seems we are living different lives in different places.\n\nMy sisters get on my case about it(\"he's our dad you have to love him\") but whatever. What I'm here about is... AITA for not being honest with it?\n\nI always say I love him back, hug him, smile, basically just act happy and loving to all his typical dad advances. I only do it in response to his actions, otherwise I just treat him like any other teenager to adult would. Still, as far as he knows I'm still his \"baby girl\" and he's still my dad beyond just blood. I haven't told him about not loving him/my lack of any real connection and how building one now seems impossible. Honestly, I don't know if I ever will tell him.\n\nAITA for doing this despite knowing my true feelings? Or am I not since telling him wouldn't be really necessary with how little I see him currently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: Dad went to prison when I was 2, grew up without him in my life much, now live 4 hours away and rarely see him. I don't love him, but act like I do. AITA for not being honest about it?",

      "description": " I’m 20M and my older brother is 24. From when we were quite young (I was just starting grade school around this time) until he went to basic training, my OB constantly bullied, threatened, and harnessed my twin brother and I seemingly without provocation. When I was younger, I was grossly overweight and had a huge lack of self confidence. I was bullied at school and had a difficult time connecting with my peers. I was never bullied as harshly by my peers as I was by my OB. He was never kind to us and we almost never conversed except in a few instances where he used this false kindness to get something out of us like money, or silence when we caught him doing something at home that my parents wouldn’t have approved of (homemade fireworks, driving with just a permit, etc). Otherwise he would spend his time around the two of us making our lives especially shitty. OB constantly tormented me over my weight, called me a faggot and other choice homosexual slurs regularly for enjoying bookish hobbies over hunting and enjoying sports (that’s the kind of family I have, they all hunt and did sports, I didn’t. He was the only one to give me shit) . He would threaten to beat the shit out of us pretty regularly for trivial things like being in the bathroom when he needed to go, and standing in his way when he was going somewhere, and pretty regularly whenever we spoke or interacted with him. At family events he would exclude my brother and I when he and our cousins went to go do things, and actively encouraged them to be just as shitty towards us. Being the oldest of the bunch, they listened and were pretty shitty to us as well. There were a few times things got physical, but we were both responsible for escalating the issue to that step and I’d rather not go into it. My brother and I had to put up with regular bullying, threats, harassment, and a generally hostile home environment. for about a decade before he moved out for basic training. \n\nFast forward to the present day, I’ve lost the weight. I’m not an A&amp;F model, but I’m doing pretty well in maintaining my health. I haven’t spoken to OB since he moved out, and I actively avoid events where he will be in attendance. When we are together, I refuse to speak to him, or acknowledge him. Somehow my twin brother and I have made steps towards reconciliation. OB is also married now, his wife is a nice woman, no problem with her. However, she keeps pushing (along with my parents) for OB and I to reconcile. OB and I haven’t spoken much at all since he’s been back, and he hasn’t been a viciously abusive dink to me during family events we attend. Parents keep trying to justify his behavior by telling me how we were kids and how he was bullied at school as much as I was. I honestly could care less. I just don’t want him to be apart of my life going forward. He was horrible to me for years and years, he’s never apologized or even brought the subject up, and now my family wants us to just shake hands and make up.  Am I an asshole for not wanting someone who was abusive to me for years to be a part of my life?",

      "description": "For reference, the game in question is League of Legends, and we usually play as a premade 5 and we use voice comms. I play at a low plat elo but as a premade we average around mid-high gold.\n\nSo basically I have a group of friends that I play with, and because of contrasting personalities there has been some conflict. \nI like winning, and I don't really like losing when it's obvious what went wrong in the game. In comparison, X, one of the guys in my group (I'm not really that close to him, he's more of a mutual friend) likes to play for fun. And when I say 'for fun', I mean really like for fun. He will engage bad fights without thinking or 1v1 his lane opponent just because he can. \nThis gets me really frustrated, because we end up losing fights we shouldn't be losing, fighting at times we shouldn't be fighting, and in general just losing a lot of games because of it. The other guys don't mind, but I personally like winning. Probably a lot more than the others do.\nI don't consider myself a rager or tilter, and I haven't actually like shouted or inted/fed for any of the games yet, but I can feel myself inching closer to that point. When I tell X that he shouldn't be taking the fights he should does, he just tells me to not be so serious, and that it's just a game.\nBut the thing is I play the game so that I can improve and win. I like winning close games where the outcome was decided by inches, and where those inches came out of you fully trying your best. So when we end up losing game even when I'm super into it, I get really frustrated.\n\nShould I keep playing with X? Should I rage at him? Should I just int every game?\n",

      "description": "Whole family is visiting me in Germany and they arrive at 7am, everyone is annoyed. We want to catch a cab to the city center but we're a family of 6 so we need one of those big van things. I walk out to the street and see a bunch of other people waiting for cabs, among them a couple with their baby and a bunch of others. They're all standing behind a row of parked cars (as in no passing cab would be able to see them) so I decided to go out into the street by an open curb to hail a passing van, which I do in a matter of minutes. \n\nSuddenly the man in the couple runs up, starts yelling \"that's my cab!\" and trying to prevent us from getting in the car. After a minute of him yelling at me and blocking the van from us, I get mad and tell him to f off. The man runs off, the woman in the couple comes over and starts to scream at me too. This made me even madder since she started saying things like \"you're an egotistical asshole and if you people could even open your eyes you would see that we've been waiting for an hour\" which could be racially charged (we're an Asian family), or could be chocked up to a language barrier (she's German speaking in English). I don't know anymore, I was absolutely enraged. I encouraged my family to keep packing into the van as we angrily yelled at each other. And I kept it up for a minute even as she walked away in a huff. \n\nI feel pretty crappy about the situation and especially my reaction, which made me horribly angry for a few days afterward. I saw them, they were already there when we got outside to catch a cab AND they had a baby which wasn't even a year old I think. \n\nBut they were literally behind a line of parked cars, not only expecting someone to see them but also drive up to them? The car would have had to stop in the middle of the street and block traffic to allow them inside. Our cab driver confirmed that he was absolutely stopping for us and not them. Dunno, AITA here?\n\nBtw if it makes anyone feel better, I saw that as we drove off the couple was already packing into a van so they found a car very quickly afterward. ",

My fiance's sister has 3 kids, expressed she was upset, and brother made an exception for her kids. \n\nI have a 3 year old son with another woman, and we are in the middle of a custody battle. I currently get him about 30% of the time. To keep it short, in past occasions when we have switched dates, she has backed out and kept my son even when I was supposed to have him. The future is very unsure, as she is trying to move across the country with him. \n\nI do not want to change my time with my son.\n- As mentioned before, I have limited time with him.\n- I've been screwed out of time in past when switching time.\n- In the last 2 years I've asked to switch maybe once or twice, and I've tried to have the appearance that my time with him is my #1 priority, so giving up the weekend if she wouldn't switch isn't an option in my mind.\n\nMy fiance expressed the situation and my thoughts to her brother once she found out he was letting her sister's kids go because she has never had anyone other than the grandparents watch the kids. He replied that it's a firm rule. When she told him I wouldn't be able to come, he replied with, \"I'm sure you could figure out something, but that's your choice. You guys aren't married yet and I've only met his kid once.\"\n\nMy fiance is upset at her brother, but also upset at me, saying I'm being too stubborn.\n\nFor the record, if people don't want kids, so be it. But if that's the case I don't think they should be upset when people decline because of it.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I went on a swiping frenzy on tinder and matched with someone who I thought was kind of cute but wasn't interested in. He messaged me on tinder and I didn't respond, so he ended up adding me on Instagram (had it in my tinder bio) and sending me a DM through there. \n\nWhen he messaged me, I told him I was interested in someone else but that I'd be open to being friends. He was disappointed but continued to message me and we would talk on and off for the next couple of weeks. The conversation was pretty standard small talk but we both threw in a lot of sexual jokes. Kind of like how dudes talk to each other so I didn't think much of it. Also, we didn't talk all the time. He would message me once every few days and the conversations would last for an hour or so. \n\nFlash forward to last night, we were talking and he asked me when we could finally meet up. I told him I might be free this weekend and now he wants me to come over on Sunday before work (I work graveyards). I told him I wasn't really interested in popping by for a quickie and then having to go to work smelling like sex. In addition, I already have a \"FWB\" and although we aren't exclusive, I don't want to sleep around with a bunch of people at once. I told him we could hang out and maybe have sex if I'm feeling up for it at the time and he said he wouldn't expect anything from me. \n\nI don't mind casual sex but with how frequent he kept bringing up the topic, it put me off and made me even more uninterested in him. When he made a comment about sex however, I would respond in a joking matter by adding \"hahaha\" and laughing emojis (because I'm not a confrontational person) so perhaps he didn't take anything I said seriously. As the night went on, he sent a message saying that he's horny and that he can't stop thinking about me while strokeing his meat rod. \n\nBy now, I'm super annoyed and turned off that the only thing he seems concerned about is getting laid. I don't mind meeting him but I feel like if I do, I'll end up getting pressured to sleep with him. AITA if I cancel plans to meet on Sunday and tell him I no longer care to talk to him after all the talking and joking we've done? ",

      "title": "AITA for leading on my younger roommate?",
      "description": "This happened a while ago already, but it’s been on my mind recently. Buckle in for a long read, or **TL;DR** at the bottom.\n\nIn university, last year I had a roommate who turned out to be bi. We’ll call him Z— at the time, 20M. As a closeted gay, it was cool to have someone I— at the time, 23M— could relate to and possibly come out to, which I eventually did. \n\nStill in the closet to the family back home, because it’s the deep south and they’re deeply devout Baptists— parents far more so than siblings to the point I actually believe my mother would kill herself if she found out, but more because it might be the needle that breaks the camel’s back after what enormous disappointments she believes most of my other siblings to have been for her so far and she confided in me when I was younger that I was “her favorite”. This is in top of warning signs I’ve noticed in her speech as she’s already overworked and overstressed between her thanklessly low-paying school job and rocky marriage; warning signs which I recognize as I’m already guilty of burdening them with a couple of suicide scares myself in the past. Those... incidents are why I’m still stuck finishing school at 23 y/o with a 20 y/o roommate.\n\nSo all that, not to mention my dad would almost certainly refuse to let me back home from college if I came out.\n\nBack to the bi roommate, Z: one night he came into my bed saying he just felt like having someone to cuddle with. I’d never, ever been intimate in any measure with another non-relative before— I had been forbidden to start dating (ha!) or to even have a part-time job during high school and college so I could focus on academics (and thus no need for a car or drivers license), resulting in zero autonomy to really have any sort of social life outside of classes.\n\nNeedless to say, I was practically vibrating with nerves and excitement. Not that Z knew any of my baggage at the time.\n\nSo in the cuddling, contact slowly becomes more and more intimate, both of us testing the waters and pushing boundaries up to the point that he kisses me— not a peck, but full-on Frenching.\n\nHormones and a decade of repressed sexuality take over and we basically jerk each other off. That feels way TMI to type out, but it’s probably important to clarify that what happened wasn’t a “real hook-up”, or at least what I understand one to be.\n\nWe spend the rest of the night into the morning hours talking and confiding in each other our personal histories, myself sharing what I’ve explained here in detail above with my family and closet situation and how he was basically my first kiss. I learn that he’s led a much more boisterous and experimental youth than I have from a much younger age, being basically 7 years my senior in terms of relationship experience yet I’m 2– almost 3– years older.\n\nZ is generally cool and sort of an average-looking guy, not bad but quite far from the “type” I’m actually attracted to. But I don’t want to tell him this, especially since after he says I happen to be HIS type and that he likes me, otherwise he wouldn’t have advanced on me.\n\nJuxtapose my lack of real attraction to Z with my almost-incel level of starvation for both a relationship and intimacy, then throw on some deeply-ingrained religious guilt from my upbringing. Now add on our awkward 3 year physical age difference, and to make it even more confusing top it all off with the 7-year gap in relationship experience he has over me. I was overwhelmed, desperate to have something but at the same time not wanting to “settle” for him. I also never told Z my age, letting him assume we were around even.\n\nI tried to chicken out of committing to anything by using my home and closet situation as an excuse. Basically, that I can’t give him a full in-the-open relationship because I feared for my mother’s life if she found out... which was only partially true, because I’ve no doubt I could easily hide a relationship while in a different city. What I didn’t tell him was that I didn’t see him as boyfriend material.\n\nBut I still wasn’t ready to give up our newfound intimacy after having that first taste, so I had him settle for a no-strings-attached Friends With Benefits deal. He would come to me on nights he felt lonely, and I would let Netflix and Chill take its natural course. The whole year, I felt guilty that I might be preventing Z from committing to a more fulfilling relationship with other LGBT friends he found on campus, while I was more of a recluse who never went out with his groups nor could even remember their names. Despite claiming there was no strings attached between us and being generally unattracted to him, I did desire something more romantic and one night Z confessed that he thought I was frustrated with him for “not putting out” more often, which I denied. However as much as I tried lying to myself, I did start to feel twinges of jealousy whenever he spent the night elsewhere.\n\nIt never got more serious between us than occasional handjobs and cuddling, and one time I attempted to give my first blowjob. Towards the end of the year I started trying to push things further (MUCH further) than cuddling in the heat of the moment, probably making Z uncomfortable as he would break it off early and leave— our nights together started to become rarer and more awkward.\n\nAll the while I was continuing to basically lie to him, never revealing that I didn’t really find him attractive and only wanted him out of convenience.\n\nThe academic year ended and he barely said goodbye to me, and we sort of immediately stopped texting each other over the summer. This year Z is no longer my roommate, and though we’ve run into each other a couple times and I’ve invited him to text me more often, but neither of us have initiated further contact in the several months since and at this point I feel too awkward to try.\n\nWe never had any proper closure, but even though we both understood what we had was “no-strings-attached,” I still feel like I was dishonestly leading Z on out of convenience without wanting to commit to a real relationship and that spoiled any chance we might have had at a casual friendship afterward. And maybe he resents me a bit for that. The age gap also makes me feel dirty as if I was using him, which I guess I was, but the reverse gap in experience also makes it so confusing since this is my first time dealing with another person’s feelings on equal ground in an intimate context.\n\n**TL;DR: I used my in-the-closet sob story as a flimsy excuse to lead on my younger roommate who liked me into being just friends with benefits even though I found him unattractive, and then almost pushed past the no-strings-attached boundary out of thirst rather than romance until he started putting distance between us. And now that we’re not roommates anymore we basically ghost each other. I feel like I’ve mishandled my first relationship, except under the pretense of there being nothing between us, and by extension spoiled what could have been a lasting friendship with the first person I ever came out to.**\n\nSo Reddit: am I an asshole?",

But I'm sensing that's getting annoying too.\nIn the past few weeks things have started to get worse and I've spent most of the time at home in bed (up until the beginning of December I'd be out at least four or five times a week, social drinking was an efficient antidepressant) \nI have a boyfriend, who is incredibly helpful when it comes to my depression, but the more I talk to him about it the less compassionate he is. I understand that it's not easy to respond to rants and things like that, so I've chosen to bother him with these feelings as little as possible. Now here's the problem. I'm now feeling shitty most of the time but I can't really talk to him about it anymore (nor do I want to, I'm sure he wouldn't act bothered but I just wouldn't feel right putting him in this position) so I've been avoiding spending time with him when I'm not sure I'll be in the mood to be a proper companion and not just a sad mess.

      "description": "Oh GOD ok I have no idea what kind of reaction I’m going to get. Sorry about the formatting, I’m on mobile. And sorry if it’s super long, I have some pent up frustration!\n\nSo here is some background: I am a 19F Asian-American college student. My family is Indian. My parents immigrated to America shortly before I was born. I have lived in the New England area my entire life. I’ve been with my 19F boyfriend for almost 3 years (anniversary in April, yay!) and things are actually quite serious. We love each other a lot and have a plan for our future. My bf is actually not originally from the New England area, but from Georgia. He asked me to travel to Georgia for our week long spring break in March (we go to the same college) with him and his parents to meet the rest of his family. I really want to go, but here is the issue. \n\nMy parents 100% disapprove of me traveling with a boyfriend. My moms exact words are: “Only trashy girls travel with their boyfriends.” Every time I hear that I roll my eyes as hard as I can. My parents  grew up in India in the 80’s, so I know it’s a cultural issue. But that statement upsets me because so many people I know travel with their boyfriends. Here are some other reasons they have given for not wanting me to go on the trip, kind of jumbled up into one paragraph:\n\nI am too young to be in such a serious relationship. They are uncomfortable with how serious the relationship is. They don’t want me to travel with my boyfriend. What would their friends and family think of them? They think if I spend my spring break on vacation it means I am not focused on my studies. I am not an adult in their eyes and they can’t trust me (with what exactly I’m not sure). \n\nI want to say that I’m not an entitled kid. I’m simply not. I think about my parents’ feelings a lot before I ask to go anywhere or do anything. Up until a couple of weeks ago, my curfew was 9:30 pm, and my parents were slowly decreasing it to 9 pm, then 8:30. I finally negotiated 11:30, which I think is completely fair (NOTE: I don’t come home at 11:30 every night! I come home more around 9:30 or 10 anyway so that THEY can feel better about me being outside the house and so I can demonstrate that I am a responsible and conscientious person like I tell them I am. 11:30 is the time I absolutely have to be home, no matter what). I do what they ask and I always put their feelings first. If they are not comfortable with me going to a bar, for example, even if I promise not to drink, I just won’t go—even though I am 19 and could get into some of the bars in my home town. I do a lot to appease them because they are my parents, and I love them and respect their wishes. \n\nOn this issue, I feel they are wrong. It would be a 5 day trip with my bf’s PARENTS. We’d be staying at his grandma’s house in separate rooms. I understand their discomfort as parents. I really do. This is new territory for them and I get that. But I feel that their reasoning is flawed, and this has been one of the only times I have questioned their verdict. My reasons for wanting to go are simple: I’ve never been to Georgia; I want to meet my boyfriend’s family; and my next opportunity to go won’t be for years as my bf and I are both pre-med and want to spend the rest of our semesters focusing 100% on studies. My parents a) do not believe that I want to go to Georgia for myself (they think I only want to go to please my boyfriend...) and b) think for some reason that my studies/ focus on my studies will be greatly impacted by this trip. It’s a vacation like any other. Would my studies be impacted if they brought me on a week long trip? Only as much as if I went on the trip to Georgia!\n\nI plan on trying to get their blessing to go one more time, but if it doesn’t work, I plan on just giving them the heads up and going anyway. I know if I do this I will never hear the end of it for the rest of my life, so I am scared. But I am 19. I spend 5 days a week at school, and I study for the MCAT 5-6 hours every day WHILE studying for my other classes! I also manage to make time for clubs, the gym, and my lovely boyfriend. I would love to get this vacation in while I am still able to. I have tried giving in and telling my bf I can’t go, but he knows I really want to and is encouraging me to stand up for myself. My parents view him as very mature and wise beyond his years (which he is), so I am going to include him in my last plea when I sit to talk with my parents. Hopefully he can reassure them that it’s not as big a deal as they think it is. \n\nNote: my parent’s “blessing”/ permission to go is important to me because I seek their approval and I don’t want them to be mad at me about this. I can’t quite explain it, but I know Asian-American children of immigrants will definitely understand. I know plenty of other people understand as well lol, but all my Indian friends have similar relationships with their parents and similar expectations placed upon them, so I listed Asian-American children of immigrants for reference only!\n\nOther very important note: I am paying for my expenses myself! I have a job. I will pay for my plane ticket, food, activities, everything. They are not contributing money for this trip. \n\nSo reddit, if I go to Georgia with my boyfriend after my parents say no (if they say no), WIBTA? I will be consulting r/relationships again as well to prepare myself for any fallout from this (unless, of course, I and up being the asshole). If anyone is interested, I have a post about this situation on my profile if I left anything out or you are simply curious.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration, everyone!",

      "description": "This was over a decade ago but it's something that occasionally crosses my mind.\n\nFreshman year, a group consisting of me (15M) and five others of an academic club were hanging out. One girl, Robin, was complaining about how this group of popular girls always seemed to ignore her and didn't want to talk to her. She was bringing up how she was always nice to them and had never done anything mean, but these girls were being super rude by not including her in stuff and even sometimes walking away when she would approach.\n\nRobin has issues with her odor. For as long as I can remember (known her since 5th grade), she's always had a strong smell of cat urine about her. Some days you wouldn't notice it unless you were inches away from her, but other days you can smell it from a couple yards. I don't know much about her home situation except that her parents are hippies and nobody else in her family has this odor issue. Her brother and both parents smell normal. Everyone (classmates, teachers, my parents) knows about Robin's smell, but I do not believe anyone had ever actually confronted her about it (definitely not the classmates).\n\nI'm pretty good friends with this group of popular girls. I've been friends with a couple of them for years and still play some coed sports with two of them. One of the guys, Robert, mentions how I'm friends with these girls and maybe I know something. I'd grown up with the \"honesty is the best policy\" mindset, and I'm sure you can see where this is headed.\n\nRobin: OP? Do you know why?\n\nMe: It's because you smell.\n\nRobin, with a surprised look on her face: What?\n\nMe: You smell like cat pee. That's why they don't want to be around you.\n\nRobin then began crying and ran away. The other girl in the group, Rachel, gave me a sort of \"that was rough but it needed to be said\" look. Two of the guys were giving me glares. Everyone else appeared to just feel awkward.\n\nRobin was one of my friends and seeing her cry made me feel terrible. But at the same time, I was asked a direct question and gave the honest answer. I know I didn't say it very tactfully but those were my exact words (burned into my brain) and I don't think I was necessarily a dick about it. She seemed genuinely surprised when I said that she smelled, almost as if she didn't know, but it could just have easily been incredulity at me actually saying it.\n\nRobin and I didn't talk for a few days, but things normalized after a few weeks. After that semester, we no longer had any classes together for the rest of high school so I don't know if the smell persisted or if she did something about it.\n\nI do still feel bad about making her cry, but I'm not sure that is enough to make me an asshole in this situation. AITA?",

      "description": "So my ex-friend and I were in a band together. All of the members have been great friends for a long time. This particular friend (we'll call him Richard) though had OCD and EVERYTHING about weed freaked him out. If he smelled weed it would get him panic attacks and was actually a problem for us when playing shows but we managed. \n\nWell I did acid and mushrooms at a party and had a bad trip and went to the hospital (that's a story for another time). It freaked me out BAD and I quit everything drug related. I only did mushrooms and acid occasionally and smoked pot regularly. Me quitting of course made Richard happy and more comfortable to be around me although we already hung out literally almost every day. \n\nI never quit smoking for Richard, I did it for me. When I felt like I was ready to smoke again I didnt tell my friends because they expected me not to smoke anymore. When I finally made it clear I wanted to smoke again to my friends (I didnt start smoking at this point because I wanted to talk to them first) they were very upset, especially Richard. Well I didnt think it was a big deal I wanted to smoke again especially since our bassist (Richard's cousin) was allowed to smoke. Richard didnt want me smoking because him and I spent more time together although I would never smoke around him, before we hung out, and never even brought the stench of it near him. Which is a bit reasonable I guess but we practiced every or every other day and Richard's cousin came to practice obviously stoned nearly every day. Everybody knew and nobody cared, not even Richard.\n\nAfter Richard told me I wasnt allowed to smoke I didnt for some time but it was just driving me crazy. After awhile I felt my best option was to just go over his head and smoke behind his back. That's exactly what I did for awhile and one day I stupidly and carelessly smoked in my van. The next day the band and I had a show and when they went to open my doors the stench of weed washed out and they knew immediately. \n\nWell they and especially Richard were pissed at me, they were even sneak dissing me on their snapchat stories while I was driving us to our gig. This basically ruined our friendship and through time things deteriorated. I quit smoking weed a little after they figured out because it was the only way I could stay in the band and as much as i was becoming to resent them i still loved the band.\n\nQuitting really only prolonged what was inevitable, our relationships never completely restored. We still resented each other and we just fought more and more about everything. Before we knew it I was out of the band and they continued without me",

I don't expect my wife to make my plate, because she tends to put way too much food on my plate and I feel bad when I throw away the food that I can't finish. \n\nSome time passes and we are all finished eating.  Her friend stops by the house and after he says hello to everyone, my wife asks if he is hungry. He says he is and asks where the plates are so he could make himself something to eat. We were still in the dining room and the food was still on the table. My wife jumps up and proceeds to make him a plate.  I make the comment, \"Wow, y'all must be really good friends, because she has never made me a plate, ever.\" I admit that I said it very sarcastically, but it is a very true statement.   \n\nAt the end of the night my wife tells me that I embarrassed her in front of her family, that I was acting like a caveman who expected his woman to wait on him hand and foot.

      "description": "One of our dogs is a small elderly dog that my wife has had for a very long time. Recently, our dog started to cry and some times bark in the middle of the night when she wants to come on our bed and my wife picks her up every time, reinforcing this behavior.\n\nOur dog also to jump down 3 - 4 times a night to go potty on her training pads, and she wants to go back up after each time. This has been happening every single night for over 4 weeks now. At least twice a week, she'll also urinate on our bed, forcing us to wake up and change the sheets, waterproof mattress cover, and sometimes blanket. \n\nTonight was bad because she urinated once on our bed, then cried to come up after we changed everything. I asked her to not pick our dog up and to wait 15 until she's done crying so she stops waking us up. Without any response, my wife just picks her up and goes to sleep. Well a few hours later, our dog urinates on our bed again. \n\nThis time I'm furious, and we get into an argument. She says our dog is old and should get whatever she wants. I tell her we need to treat her like we do our other dog: negative habits like this need to be trained away. She eventually loses the argument, and says I can train away that habit. But she says I have no empathy and I won't understand her point. \n\nI already know I'm an asshole. I'm trying to see things from her point, and I do.

      "description": "I know it sounds bad, please read the whole thing.\n\nAbout six months ago a new coworker, Mike, asked me out on a date. I was upfront with him in saying that I wasn't looking to have a potentially serious or monogamous relationship. At the time, I had 2 FWBs and was exploring my sexuality. Mike told me he would ONLY want a serious and monogamous relationship, so I ultimately declined. He continuously brought it up over the week and I eventually broke down and just said yes to one dinner, \"just to see if we were compatible\".\n\nMike was (and is) a genuinely decent person and I had a good time at the restaurant. When he dropped me off at my apartment, he asked if we were dating. I was confused and figured he was asking if this was a first date, so I said yes.\n\nI want to be clear that I think of dating as going out with someone to see whether you are compatible as a potential couple. I don't see it as being in a serious, official relationship unless it's otherwise stated.\n\nI slept with one of my FWBs later that week.\n\nMike and I went out a few more times and I quit talking to my FWBs because I could see we were getting serious. He eventually asked me if he could \"make it official on Facebook\". I thought THIS was his way of asking if we could make our relationship official. I said yes and we dated for about 1 full month. It was after this point I realized he acted more like a 16 year old than a 26 year old. He also hid something from me that ruined any chance of continuing the relationship. \n\nWe broke up, but we're still friendly whenever we have to interact with each other. One of our recent conversations was making fun of how short our relationship lasted. Mike said something about it lasting \"almost 2 months\" and I said, \"Huh? It was only a month.\" After a little lighthearted argument, I realized he thought that when I said yes to \"Are we dating?\" he was asking if we were an official couple.\n\nI told Mike what my definition of dating was, and that I didn't see us as an official couple at that time. His face changed completely and he asked if I had cheated on him between our versions of when the relationship started. I said no because I was ashamed. I felt very guilty afterwards, so shared this story with a friend and she said that it was crazy for him to assume anything without explicitly stating that we were official. Now I'm conflicted.\n\nSo AITA for cheating if I didnt realize that's what I was doing? Should I tell him the truth?\n\nPlease help.",

They both enjoy singing a lot and are generally happy people.\nThe main story: I was invited by my best friend to go to Dollarama after school with her and her friend. Now, that day was wash day but I figured I had time. So I go with them only to be ignored as they sing Hamilton on overcrowded trains and walk ahead of me when we're out of the subway. When we get to Dollarama they basically talk to eachother for a solid 10-15 min. So I just leave them to go pick up a sketchbook. \nI've always valued honesty with my friends and telling people the truth so I texted her about it saying that her behaviour felt very exclusionary and rude/obnoxious. She said \"im sorry you felt like a third wheel but that's really not my problem. You know we like to sing and if you don't like it don't hang out with us\"  When I asked her why she invited me in the first place she said she didn't . I told her that she invited me after school and she replied \"I don't know what to tell you\"\n\nSorry this was so long, but I need to know AITA?",

      "description": "I’m adopted. My biological mother keeps producing children and not feeding them, so they’re taken away. As they all age (there are 8 thus far) they try to find me because I’m their oldest brother. I’ve meet (via facebook) three and they’re EXHAUSTING. one asked me to adopt him (15 yo) the day we meet which I cannot do, then kept asking me if he was a disappointment to me. Another OPENED the conversation with “even though I’ve never meet you I wake up at night crying because I miss you.” Another has been sending me PAGES of text about wishing we could be together as a family and loving me even tho we haven’t meet. They all send long, frequent, emotional messages to me and try to get me to visit them (they’re spread throughout the US) or call them. I didn’t answer one of them within five minutes and he felt betrayed and expressed he was suicidal because he thought I was mad at him. It’s uncomfortable trying to validate their feelings too because I don’t feel them and I refuse to lie and say I love and miss them even tho I haven’t meet them. I’m not gonna say I wish we were adopted together because I don’t feel that. I’m not gonna sayI wish I could adopt them. \n\n\nI went through the same as them, I relate to their attachment issues and emotional instability. My biological mother has been sending them my contact info. So far, I talk to the three of them and no matter how I feel internally I am supportive outwardly and try to tell them how I’ve coped with the mental illnesses our mother passed on and created through abuse. I’m being the big brother they’re asking for. However, I am thinking that the next one to contact me I’ll just not answer. All of them are a lot to deal with on top of coping with what my mom did to me. \n\n\nIf they were more casual about it it wouldn’t be as huge a deal but all of them demand a lot of emotional energy. at the same time, they do this because they need some support and see me as the one who got out and got better. WIBTA if I ignored the next five of them when they find me?",

      "title": "AITA for not moving my RV?",
      "description": "Hello, moral judges. Today I had an odd dilemma that I hope can be cleared up by the opinions of the masses.\nA little backstory to begin... My husband and I are traveling full-time in our RV, exploring North America. We have been doing so for a year. Our camper is not the biggest RV but it’s a bigger rig than your average car at 26’ long and 7.5’ wide. It has a billion blind spots and is just overall pretty cumbersome to deal with in places like parking lots but we have never had any issues with its size and get in and out of places just fine. People are very respectful of how large we are and give us space and forgive us for sometimes being in the way. We always appreciate the understanding. \n\nNOW, onto today. We were heading to a state park and stopped to do some grocery shopping which we do every time we drive to a new place. We often get groceries at Walmart because it’s consistent and literally everywhere. \n\nAll Walmart’s have differently laid out parking lots, naturally, but are all generally massive. With that said, some have two way lanes between the rows of parking spots and some have one ways. One ways are less common and today I goofed up. I accidentally turned the rig the wrong way down a one way but I did not fear because these lanes were huge and could easily fit two cars side by side - even two bigger rigs liked mine. Also, there wasn’t a lot of traffic at the time and I didn’t turn and block anyone from coming out or anything. There are also like 10 other lanes of parking for others to use so it’s no biggie. I figured instead of causing a bigger mess by backing up into pedestrians that I’d just continue.\n\nSo, I’m driving down the one way to the exit, pass a few cars, they look at me funny because I look like an idiot going the wrong way but all pass me just fine. Then this guy (older - 60s) in a small pickup truck comes down the way and just stops his truck in the middle of the street, just enough so I couldn’t pass him on either side due to parked cars and a cart corral. I thought maybe he thought we both wouldn’t fit so I pull my mirrors in and wave him on because he had a ton of space to get by me. Then he proceeds to turn off his truck and dangle his keys in front of him for me to see. I’m confused by this so I roll down my window and yell, “Hi sir! I’m so sorry, I accidentally went the wrong way down this lane, I’m not from here and got a little confused by the one-way so I’m very sorry about that but you definitely have enough space to get around me so please move over so that I can get by and we can stop blocking the lane.” He says, “I’m not moving. I don’t like that you went the wrong way so now you have to back up all the way or else we sit here all day.” I’m kind of floored by this because it’s not like he couldn’t get by?? Why did he have such a stick up his butt for my honest mistake? I didn’t personally affect his day at all.\n\nSo I get out of my truck to speak to him face to face and hopefully get him to understand that I realize I made a mistake and that it’d be much easier if he just moved out of the way rather than forcing me to back my huge rig down a lane with other people’s cars on either side, risking hitting them or a person with my blind spots. \n\n(I will add - I’m an expert at maneuvering this rig and can back it up with ease but at this point I was not going to inconvenience myself for his petty demands when he could easily go around me. Also, like I said, lots of parked cars around that I didn’t want to put in harm’s way.)\n\nAnyway, he doesn’t respond to me and just rolls up his window before I even finish my sentence. He’s dead set on not moving. I get back in my truck and see if I can inch around him. He yells, “IF YOU HIT MY TRUCK IM CHARGING YOU WITH ASSAULT!!!”. Sadly, I can’t get around due to the cart corral. I lay on my horn as I am getting pretty annoyed by his pettiness.\n\nThis situation is now attracting some nosy Nancy’s - to no one’s surprise as there is a Mexican stand off - truck style - in the middle of a Walmart parking lot. Then, a nice woman comes to my window and says, “That guy’s being an asshole. I’m going to get security so they can tell him to move out of the way.” I feel good that I’m not the asshole in her eyes. \n\nWalmart manager comes out, asks what’s up and I say, “This guy is having a moral dilemma with letting me continue down this lane because I mistakenly entered the wrong way. And he goes “That’s ridiculous. He has enough space to get around and it’s easier than you backing up your huge RV. He’s the one who’s putting people out by being in the way!” Manager talks to the man, he is very good with him, “Excuse me sir, could you please let this lady get around you? She knows her mistake and now you’re just blocking everyone else. Just go around.” Man doesn’t even roll down his window, and just shakes his head. Manager says, “Do you want me to call the police?” Guy shakes head yes. Manager asks me if I want to bring the cops here. I say, “I would love to due to my principles but I’d rather just get on with my day so I think I have to just give in and back it up.” I flip off the stubborn man before doing so. \n\nEven though these people backed me up...I keep wondering...\n\nWas he in the right? AITA for going the wrong way? \n\nThanks for your consideration.",

      "description": "Let me give you the context before I continue. My significant other and I are on a break, and she moved away. The friend helped her move, and in doing so, fell for the city. He got an opportunity to move out there as well, and so he moved in with her. To help with rent costs, and to keep each other company. My recent posts would reflect in the feelings I have for her, and my intentions to eventually move back in with her and continue our relationship. He knows this, and understands those plans. Now that you know this, we can continue.\n\nSo, friend moves out with her, and they struggle to find work. Things are rocky, and the relationship between me and her is extremely strained. He is kind of a \"you do whatever you want regardless of the repercussions\" kind of guy. Since they've moved out there, he enables her depression with self-medication via alcohol and weed. She became an alcoholic during our relationship, which is something she still needs to address. However, she only occasionally would smoke weed. Now, it seems to be a regular activity to do both in response to her depression.\n\nHe is there to support her, which at first seemed great. However, that would eventually come to damage my trust in him. When he left, me and the rest of his friends here hoped he would keep in touch and things wouldn't change, but he seemed to choose a side. When I needed him to be a friend, he seems more interested in protecting her. To add, I received knowledge that he apparently has developed feelings for her, and has a crush. Not to say that anything would come of it, but given the circumstances, I don't trust him. He's been going out and trying to hook up with other women, so there's that. The craziest part of all of this is that he made all of us believe he was gay.\n\nAm I the asshole for losing trust in my friend?",

      "description": "A few things you need to know: I’m a college freshman, he’s a high school senior. We’ve been good friends for the past 3 years. I am also incredibly oblivious to people’s feelings about me. \n\nThis happened this past weekend. I was visiting my old high school (it’s a boarding school, so it’s not weird for alumni to come back and visit). The night before I went, I texted this friend that I’d be coming. He suggested we watch a movie, and I agreed. I get there, we’re talking, it’s a good time. He suggests I go back to his room and smoke with him, I decline because I need to drive. \n\nWe meet up with some other friends, it’s a good time. He suggests I go back to his room when we’re done with friends, again I decline. He says something along the lines of “We’re probably not going to have sex” and I immediately respond “we’re definitely not going to have sex.” At this point, I am painfully oblivious to the fact that he wanted to get with me, at the time I thought we were just joking around as friends do. \n\nThe day goes on and he mentions going back to his room at least another 3 times. I continue declining, because I could get into legal trouble for doing that (and i also didn’t want to). After a while he begins being cold towards me, so we part ways and I visit other friends. \n\nI know I’m not the asshole for declining him, but I’m more wondering if I’m the asshole for not picking up on the signals, taking it as a joke, and then bluntly telling him that I wasn’t interested (although it was intended as a joke because I thought we were on the same page about our friendship). \n\nLooking back, i realized he may have had a crush on me the past few years and i just haven’t noticed. So, AITA for being oblivious to this guys feelings and bluntly turning him down without even realizing it? I’ve been lowkey stressed abt this because I feel I may have hurt his feelings without realizing it. ",

So my duties would be managing the ammo/knife counter, doing hunting/fishing licenses and sticking that area. But about two months after I was hired the hardware associate that works the same shift as me left so they told me to work hardware and sporting goods at the same time. Since they are right next to my department I can keep an eye on the paint counter and their customers without to much trouble. Shortly after that they let go of the housewares associate. They tole me to look after that department too. That one is more of a struggle because it is turned diffrent than my other two. Recently they have been calling me to the front to be cashier for a few hours a day or to push carts for awhile. When I go to a front register or push carts I am supposed to pass my keys to management because I wont be able to leave a line to come back and work my counter. The last time I was called up there I tried to give my keys to the front end manager.\n\nMe here I can't here them call me while I'm outside\nHer what do you expect me to do with these? \nMe I cant have them on me when I'm outside so I have to give them to management\nHer well I'm not going to take them\n As she walked off she badmouthed me loudly in front of customers and other associates.\nSo I just went outside and pushed carts till my lunch then asked if I could come in. A little while later I'm called to the office where her and two senior managers are waiting for me. She told them that i gave her attitude about the keys and that she felt like i was telling her i couldn't work both at once. So they wrote me up. She even told them word for word how she popped off to me and that she went into the conversation angry.\nThey then sent her out and told me that I could always be doing more work and that I dont do enough currently. At that point I didnt understand I told them that I usually run three departments on my own and do carts or register at the front every day. But they still said I could be doing more and that they disliked my tone. At that point I was really really upset and I asked them what they expected. Their cutting my hours and keep asking for more I've been asking for full time for months and every time I ask they promise next month well have enough hours to give it to you but it never comes. So they wrote me up again for attitude and warned me that one more would cost me my job. Aita for trying to defend myself?",

My parents have been divorced since I was in Grade 2, they do not get along at all, but they both had equal custody and thus raised my together (sort of?). My older brother and sister both made it through school with a RESP (registered education savings plan) which my parents had been putting money in up until their divorce. \n\nFast forward to Grade 12, it is my time for school and there is around 1.5 years worth of tuition left and my dad saved on the side around 2.5 years worth. My mom saved nothing and says that I will receive nothing. \n\nI was applying to go to school for engineering, but I have no idea what stream I want to do. I apply all over and get a good school which has a general first year (Queen’s) and a top school with a good reputation (Waterloo) but for chemical engineering. When I finally made the decision to go to Queen’s for various reasons she made it very evident she wanted me to go to this other school. My dad, also an engineer, told me it didn’t matter and both were good choices. My mom basically tells me I am making a bad decision and I should just listen to her. Now she brings it up all the time and has never once told me that she supports my decision. I always tell her this urks me a lot and she should drop it.\n\nAnyways I am a first year now and my mom asked me how my grades are, to which I responded, “they’re good”  then she started asking for specifics and I continued saying they are good no need to worry. She keeps asking and I finally told her I will not be sharing my grades with her until she finally shows she supports my school decision.",

      "description": "My parents split up about 3 years ago and shortly after my dad started dating this lady (we’ll call her K). She got pregnant and after the baby was born everyone moved into my childhood home, forcing my mum to move out. I’m f18, my sisters are 16  and 9 and K has two other kids f13 and m10 (plus 1y/o baby). \n\nThe house is a 4 bedroom house sleeping 8 people so me and the 16y/o had to move into the garage so Ks kids could have our rooms. The 3 youngest each have their own room then dad, K and baby share. Since their arrival, almost a year ago, the house has been a disgrace - the front looks like a junk yard, the inside has crap everywhere, etc.\n\nThe problem though, is that K is crazy. Like full on went-to-jail-for-assaulting-her-kids’-dad crazy, and is an alcoholic. She and my dad have a very toxic relationship, and my dad has admitted multiple times he’s only staying with her for the baby. Her daughter called the cops on my dad for supposedly kicking her (he didn’t) and my mum has called docs on K for calling me a c*nt. So yeah very toxic but whenever they have an argument she’ll suddenly play happy families so that she can stay (which my dad agrees to because of the baby). \n\nI honestly kinda hate coming here even though it’s my house and I love my dad. I also absolutely adore this baby and I know that if K leaves my dad will have very limited access to the baby.  But I feel like I can’t be here anymore. I’m in grade 12, I work, and I don’t need this crap bringing me down. \n\nWhat brings me to this ultimatum though, is that tonight I went into my room and saw that some postcards I bought during my year abroad had been deliberately ripped up and my sisters frame they were in was destroyed (I say deliberate because these photos were in multiple pieces and the frame was spread across the room). It wasn’t my sisters, me, my dad or the baby leaving only K and her other kids. My dad has said before that he’s going to go to court to remove her from the house, and has said tonight that he will be going tomorrow after finding out they have destroyed my property.\n\nSo WIBTA if I told my that unless he actually does get her removed from the house (because he has never gone through with it) I will not be staying here. On one hand, I feel fully justified because I should not have to put up with this crap but then I know it means kicking out my baby sister. Like I said, my dad will have very little access and if she grows up with just her mum this beautiful baby is going to grow up into a spoiled, entitled cow just like all the females in her family so far. My dad even said tonight “sorry I haven’t done it yet but I’m just trying to stay with my baby” which made me feel like crap (not his intention)  but I also feel like he made his bed, he should lie in it. I am genuinely conflicted. WIBTA??\n",

I went into my room with the ice cream and closed and locked the door.  A few minutes later, there's a knock on my door and it is my dad.  I said, \"Don't come in.\". So the next thing I know my door is being unlocked (you can unlock the lock with a fingernail) and he's walking into my room and starts laughing at me.  \nI tell him I wasn't messing around and I was very upset he came into my room after I told him not to.  He continues to laugh at me and I kept trying to tell him that I asked him not to come in and I was very angry.  This makes him mad and he tells me I'm being bitchy and he walks out.\n\nAITA for being upset he walked in?

I remember I used to hate being muddy or jumping around in puddles etc.\n\nI’m currently at university and have been living in residences for about 2 months. There are 8, including myself, in my flat. We have to share a kitchen between 8. The kitchen in all fairness isn’t really big enough for 8 people.\n\nBefore coming here, I knew things wouldn’t be the same. I knew I would have to be fair and accepting that it likely would get messy a lot. I’ve done my best to not comment on it, but every so often, it really does get to me.\n\nTonight, I went into the kitchen to find the sink full to the top, with plates and pots thrown on top by a specific flatmate, with a good portion of food left in the plate. Then, another pot full of bolognese left in the pot on the stove not covered in any way. The kitchen was smelling, and it had been for a few hours.\n\nI understand and appreciate if in the morning or the afternoon - people are busy. I can appreciate there isn’t always time, but these plates have been in the sink for a good 4 hours whilst said flatmate has been watching YouTube videos in their room. I know for a fact they’ve not been doing work as they’re with their partner anyway.\n\nI made a comment in the group chat saying “Whoever’s mess is in the sink, please sort it out, it smells really bad.” I’m a happy and jokey person, so I didn’t think they’d take this as a serious and arsey tone (although, I guess I can see why). In return, said flatmate told me I could be a bit nicer when asking and that they’d sort it in the morning. They added “I’ve been doing lots of work. We’re all adults we don’t need you nagging us.” To which I perhaps shouldn’t have replied, “I didn’t mean it to be rude, but to be fair, adults clean up after themselves.”\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "I asked someone on discord if they could make me a YouTube banner for free. Now they described themselves as a photoshop professional. I gave told them how I wanted it to look and I sent them all of the pictures necessary to create the banner. I was excited to see the results. But, I was mistaken. He had me explain to him how to make pngs with transparent backgrounds and exactly where he should place the images. It would have been a lot easier for me to do it myself rather than explaining it to him. The banner that I received didn’t even fit YouTube’s dimension minimums (and it is super difficult to adjust dimensions to what is acceptable without ruining the image). Now I still wanted to be kind because I don’t like hurting people’s feelings. I told him it turned out nice and thanked him.\n\nFast forward a couple weeks and I am making a T-shirt for my YT. I used the idea I made up that was supposed to be for the banner and replicated how I envisioned it on the T-shirt. After I put it up for sale, I got the message from the guy on discord and he told me that he didn’t like the T-shirt design. He said that the placing of the images was his design and that I stole it from him. (The images were not drawn by him, they were fair use off the internet, so my thoughts were that he doesn’t own the arrangement of the images). I thought it was a bit of a ridiculous argument, but I want to see if anyone else sees his side and explains if IATA.",

      "description": "So to give a little back ground I am 25 Yo M and my cousin sister is 19 Yo. I am quite open and generally don't like to follow social taboo's and unspoken rules. Recently we were talking about stuff and having a good discussion about general things in life, so she starts telling me about this creep who texted her some lewd stuff and his sexual fantasies. While discussing further i got to know that she is facing a lot of problems with peer pressure as she doesn't know what exactly happens during sex and feels quite ashamed when her friends talk or discuss about this. Some of her friends suggested watching porn but she is quite creeped out from the general thought of it and i strongly agree with her as porn will distort her expectations which is no good at all. \n\nThis did not seem so bad until I realized the extent of peer pressure and self esteem issues she was having. Since she does not feel comfortable discussing about sex with parents, she asked my help to explain her questions and general sex ed when no body is home.\n\nI don't mind the whole situation but I am not sure if I would be a creep or will this situation be borderline incest if i have the talk about birds and the bees with her. Also i do not want her to watch and learn from porn as it is quite far from what happens in real life (excluding kinks). \n\nSo my question is WIBTA or somehow negatively influence her if i go through this ?, will this in any way give off incest vibes ?

Recently, I was getting to know her again because she was a huge part of my life and it felt weird that we actively avoided each other now. As we got to know each other again we’re exploring all the changes we’d gone through over the years. Something I find out that she now identifies as pansexual, which was a strong shift from being “100% straight” when we were dating. But I didn’t pry, if she wanted to give me more details she would, it’s not my business. \n\nWell she gets really drunk one night and tells me why she identifies as pansexual. She got “suuuuper drunk” at a party and made out with a girl. I pressed her on it later, asking if she had any sober experiences, if she was sexually attracted to any other women or anything like that and the answers were all no, but I might be if it’s the right person.\n\nShe finds a lot of her identity in being an activist, helping marginalized people that kind of thing. She’s a genuinely compassionate kind person. But she also has some serious self-esteem issues. She’s accused queer people she doesn’t like of “doing that for attention”. I thought she might be blowing that one experience way out of proportion and claiming pansexuality as part of her identity for clout.\n\nI called her out on it and now we don’t talk anymore, to say the least.",

So after the 3 months it turned out he was going to be moving in, even though they’ve only known each other for around 4 months at this point. I was up for it however, because I just wanted my mum to be happy.\n\nSo he moved in and it turns out he’s a nice guy but he’s just annoying and the atmosphere of living in the house is very awkward, he doesn’t work as he’s off so he’s always sat around while my mums at work, me and my brother try to avoid seeing him as whenever he starts a conversation it’s impossible to get out of it, and he only ever talks about himself, he’s a bit self absorbed. We find ourselves trying to get away from him when he’s talking, because although he’s nice he is one of the most boring conversationalists I’ve ever met, and a nice conversation could be rapidly ruined by him.\n\nWhen he first moved in i thought it was ok, as I had in my head I just wanted my mum to be happy but after living with him for 2 months I feel really uncomfortable in my own house, to the point where I’ve almost been crying, I try and avoid this man that’s moved in in my own home because I know I’ll get verbally attacked by his boring stories. We also don’t know this person very well, my mums only known him 6 months and he was moved in after 3, it’s basically a stranger. Ive spoke to my mum about how me and brother feel and we’ve said that we don’t want him living with us, she says that he really makes her happy and she wants him to stay.\n\nSo I was just wondering am I and my brother being unreasonable and acting out of order?",

I knew something was off about her from the start, but it was nothing major. \nLater in the year, she told me she was abused, and talked about her supposedly shitty cousin who watches her. She told me how her cousin doesn’t feed her, and in return, I gave her a dollar every day (the school sells food in between periods).\nI figured it was the least I could do.\nThe year went on, and i managed to keep her fed.\nBut this year however, things began to change. As she gave more details about her abuse, it became more absurd, and I became more skeptical, and began to not believe her abuse story. But of course, as I began to run out of cash, she seemed to have felt entitled to the money I gave her, saying that I owed her money, because I didn’t give her any the day before. \nThere were also times where I would be starving, didn’t have any breakfast, and I’d ask her for some food (which she bought with the money I gave her), and she’d say no, and pull away when I reached out, and didn’t seem to care that I pretty much paid for it.\nI eventually gave up, and abandoned her, and left her to serve for herself. I feel kinda guilty, because there is a chance that she was actually abused, and I want to help people who are suffering. Am I the asshole in this situation?",

Currently I've got three pros to staying here:\n\n-Friends are here\n\n-Societies are actually better than my home uni\n\n-Things are (most of the time) cheaper than at home\n\nBut despite these good points I just feel miserable here, because:\n\n-I arrived to a disinterested and disjointed welcome, after 6500 miles of travel\n\n-I was asked to sign off on my uni room without even seeing it (which I did, because I was lagged)\n\n-I've struggled to adapt to the climate\n\n-I've lacked vital information for weeks\n\n-I've practically been forgotten by the uni (not even on the register for the first month!)\n\n-While juggling that, I've had to try learn topics I don't fully understand, so now I'm behind schedule\n\n-Been very homesick over the stay so far\n\n-Nearby neighbours either blast music, playing their instruments, or have a loud conversation well into 2am at night\n\n-Wall wardens do jack shit to stop noise\n\n-The two points above mean that I've have terrible sleep patterns\n\n-In addition, I've had low motivation to do much since the first month\n\nSo, if this was only up to me, I would have left a while back. I'm not usually the type to travel, and I'm not really a sightseer. It took a lot of convincing to even get me to go in the first place!\n\nThe main problem is, my parents want me to stay. I do appreciate their point of view (as I can often slip into a negative mindset), but unless things improve here it's not going to help.\n\nAdditionally, there's other problems at hand from moving back so soon, since I would most likely have to redo my 2nd year. Also, my parents put a lot of money forth to get me here, so I feel like an *Asshole* for wanting to just ditch this early.\n\nTl;dr - Am I an asshole for wanting to ditch my study abroad year and come home because I'm not enjoying my experience out here?\n",

      "description": "Well, backstory time. Since christmas is coming soon I wanted to make mother happy and buy her something she always wanted. What she wanted is probably not so important, the important thing is that it is very expensive. In fact its too expensive for me to buy it all myself (Im still a young teen), so I asked my brother if he would want to buy it together and that it would be a gift from the both of us (my brother is an adult, late twenties). I would pay half and he would pay half too, obviously.   \nWhen I first mentioned it he seemed to be happy that he doesnt have to think up anything and agreed. Today I mentioned it again so we can go buy it asap. He got very angry at me and said its too expensive. I will probably sound assholish here, but he has a stable well paying job and lives with grandmother (rent free, doesnt have to buy food), I dont know his financial situation but he always seems to spend money on pointless things like enormous tattoos or new vapes.  I got mad at him for not wanting to spend money on a thing that would make our mom overjoyed. She always buys stuff for him, even if its not a special occassion (like consoles whenever there is a newer model). He started attacking me that I can save up nicely when mom buys things for me, because I got new shoes recently (the old ones fell apart, I didnt have money on them myself so mother helped me buy them) and he also started attacking my mental illness, saying that I dont have to spend anything when I dont go out in the first place.   \nThe last thing made me teary eyed so I ran into my room. I realize I shouldnt have gotten mad at him in the first place when he said he doesnt have money for it, but it just made me worked up.   \nHe texted me that he decided to get mom some soap and a candle. That made me even sadder now though.   \nSo yeah Id appreciate every response, I would be happy to receive advice on if should I apologize to him or not. ",

      "description": "So a little backstory: I currently live with my gf of 1 year and we have been spending many meals together, naturally. I have been eating a paleo diet for about 4 months now and we both tend to eat similarly in this sense, but she does not always have the same ideas that I do about food. She will sometimes eat cookies late at night, a lot of carbs, and “not paleo” things.  I’ll be clear, we both eat healthily, I just eat a stricter diet.\n\nThis morning I commented on her choice of a breakfast sandwich (bacon, eggs, ciabatta, mayonnaise) and said she should not be combining a lot of fat with a lot of carbs, also stating that it’s ok to eat one or the other, just not a lot of both. She starts crying and claims that she feels judged for her food choices and that she hadn’t had a sandwich in a long time and woke up craving one. She says I made her feel shitty and judged. \n\nNow Reddit, I in no way judge her or her food, all I seemed to do, imo is just bring up the nutrition aspect of her food. She is adult and is able to make her own dietary choices, I feel like I was just trying to bring up some talking points on nutrition. So with all that being said, am I the asshole? ",

      "title": "WIBTA if I (21F) told my recently engaged sister (23F) not to get married?",
      "description": "Last night I found out my sister got engaged to her current boyfriend (mid 20s) and I’m not that supportive of her decision. They’ve been dating for supposedly over a year. I say supposedly because she slept with my roommate at the end of May 2018 while visiting me (we live in different states). At the time she claimed that she wasn’t officially dating her boyfriend. In the middle of January 2019 she made a Facebook post saying she’s been with her boyfriend for a year. So if that’s true, she cheated on him. On the other hand, he cheated on her about three weeks ago with one of her “friends”.\n\nThis would also be her second marriage. She got married at age 19 after knowing her ex-husband (mid 20s)for six months, divorced him after about a year of marriage and admitted to me that she married him for his uniform because he was a Marine. They had nothing else in common but he made good money doing what he did and she found military men highly attractive. She’s also highly manipulative and lied to him about being on birth control to get pregnant and basically tie him down, but it ultimately backfired because he didn’t renew his military contract to become a family man (a very poor one). He’s also cheated on her more than once. They have a red custody over their daughter who is now three.\n\nCurrently my sister is still making poor choices. She has over $1,000 in credit card debt, lost her well paying job for being late too many times that my oldest brother (26M) recommended her for at the company he works, and is very neglectful of her daughter to go out drinking at bars with her friends. When she has her daughter, she’ll drop her off at my parents’ house so she can go do whatever. According to her custody agreement, My sister is supposed to be living with my parents but instead got an apartment with her boyfriend and is never home. My parents don’t report it for the sake of my niece. From what my mom told me, my niece will say stuff like “I don’t like (sis’ bf), I miss my daddy”. I’m not sure what makes her strongly dislike him enough to say that to my parents, but that’s also a big sign that maybe he’s not right for my sister. My brother was also paying her phone bill for almost half a year but recently kicked her off because he’s tired of enabling her, and now she’s no longer on speaking terms with him because of it. She spends what money she has on alcohol, cigarettes, and tattoos.  Last time I visited my family a couple weeks ago, she had over $400 in unpaid fines and I saw a warrant for her arrest on my kitchen table for them.\n\nWe don’t have a close relationship but I’m really worried for her and want to work on it with her, and I feel like me telling her how I feel about this is a start. I just hate seeing her go down this road when I know she deserves and can do better, so WIBTA if I told her how I felt about her marrying her boyfriend?",

      "title": "AITA for not supporting my friend’s new relationship",
      "description": "My friend ALWAYS ALWAYS has to have a significant other. It’s honestly become such a pet peeve with everyone in our friend group because we see all her relationships go wrong and we feel that she needs to just be single to learn about herself and work on self growth. However, I work at the same business company that she does and I’ve become uncomfortable with all the events that I have seen unfolding. She has been in a relationship for 2 years and she had gotten into that relationship quickly (I’m talking like within a week of dating they became official and said I love you). She’s just not happy with her boyfriend anymore and I’ve been hanging out with her many evenings when we get off work. We work on different floors so we will usually meet at the parking structure and go out for drinks or to catch a movie. She’s been bringing this coworker along who is a guy to hang out with us. He has mentioned that he has a girlfriend that he’s getting engaged to but I can tell very obviously that he is into my friend. And it seemed like my friend was into him based off my observation of their body language. She is an lead executive and he works directly under her supervision, so she’s his boss. They both have significant others whom it very clearly seems like they are emotionally cheating on to me. She hides from her boyfriend that she’s hanging out with him before and after work and he’s hiding the same thing from his girlfriend. She got super defensive and upset when I brought up to her that I think her hiding this from her boyfriend is not a good sign. She mentioned to me that the coworker had asked her how she would feel about things leading to more between them. I told her that because she’s the head of the department, that it would be super unprofessional of her to be hanging out and having these intimate flirty discussions with someone she supervises. I also told her that if she’s unhappy with her relationship then she needs to end it instead of hanging out with another guy without her boyfriend knowing. She goes to the club with him, they go to dinner, they go running together, etc. They hang out so much to the point where she bails on plans with me and our group of friends to go do something with him. The more she tells me about things, the more angry and disappointed I feel with her because I think what she’s doing is morally wrong and fucked up. Fast forward a week later, she told me that they both broke up with their significant others, went out on a date together, spent the night at each other’s places and now they are officially together but hiding it from her department at work (all within a span of 3 days following them ending their previous relationships). To me this is just so wrong what both of them did to their significant others. I am extremely disappointed in and ashamed of her choices. I am livid that she lacks self awareness and introspection because she gets on mine and our friends’ case for seeing our boyfriends a lot when all she has done lately is hide from her now-ex about who she’s been hanging out with and bailing on plans with friends to go see this guy who wasn’t even her boyfriend up until this point. Am I the asshole for not supporting her relationship? I care about her and want her to be happy but I don’t agree with the way things happened. I don’t even want to be around her or even talk to her at the moment or else I will go off on her because she thinks she has done nothing wrong. ",

      "title": "AITA for ghosting a \"friend\" for her odd text messages?",
      "description": "Some context: I'm 17 [MtF], friend (we'll call her Mayo) is 17 [F]. Mayo and I had a very odd relationship. We used to cuddle, kiss, hold hands, etc. (She usually made the advances) but we never \"dated\" or anything. I saw the relationship as just being really close friends as I was very open with her. However, if she had wanted to date, I probably would have said yes. We would also go to the mall a lot or just hang out and talk. We had just made plans to go to the mall together and see a movie.\n\n\nOut of the blue, Mayo texts me- not unexpectedly as we would often text each other spontaneously. She texted me \"[Person I know] and I are smashing.\" Now my initial response was confusion but the new smash bros game had just came out (This took place back in December) so I thought she was jokingly saying that as a conversation starter. I played along, thinking it was a joke but she kept insisting that it was real. Eventually she sent me a picture of her with the guy which made me realize she wasn't joking.\n\n\nI was taken aback as it was a very odd way of telling me that she was dating the guy. She then told me I would have to get my own ride to the mall on Friday (we had arranged for her dad to drop us off and then my mom would pick us up later). I asked her if it was because the guy would be driving her there, in which she confirmed. As I would no longer have a ride to the mall, I told I wouldn't be able to go.\n\n\nI was pretty upset and confused about the whole exchange and felt that maybe she was trying to make me a jealous but I eventually called these thoughts off as me being irrational. I only answered with short answers while I was having these thoughts, however. I started warming up to her again tho and she asked me if I wanted to hang out with her one day after school. I replied asking her when and where? She responded with something along the lines of \"Oh idk. I didn't think you'd say yes.\" I was a bit surprised by this response and told her I probably wouldn't be able to go anyway due to transportation issues, although I was mostly just upset. We texted a bit more that night, all friendly and stuff.\n\n\nThe next day, she texted me a picture of her hugging her boyfriend (looking at the camera, smirking) with a message saying \"I lost a bet and had to send the worst picture imaginable to my best friend. I'm so sorry.\" This is when my thoughts of her trying to make me jealous kicked in again. I highly doubt she lost a bet, nevertheless the punishment being to send \"the worst picture imaginable\" to your best friend. \n\n\nAfter this, I just ghosted her. She texted me the a few days later. saying her and I should go to Dunkin' (something we did often) because she got a gift card. She also texted me Merry Christmas.\n\n\nI miss her and the things we do, even though I was the one to end things.\n\n\nI don't know if I misunderstood things or if she really was trying to make me jealous but some feedback would be greatly appreciated.",

Maybe unacceptable was poor phrasing and I could’ve done better there. \n\nDue to the nature of our place I can not go to another room and have respite, the walls aren’t thick and the were playing some war video game (tv shares a wall with our bedroom where I was).\n\nI didn’t say anything or cause a scene because of being drained and I’m already trying really hard to be calm and reasoned when addressing issues (thanks pre marital counseling) do what my fiancé asks when communicating with his family (trying to be engaged and interested and friendly to have a relationship with them). I did not respond well because when I brought this up he dismissed my concern as being ridiculous and that I’m trying to say he can’t have his brother to our apartment/I’m trying to drive a wedge between him and his family? He felt I was lumping family into the same category as other people and that I shouldn’t need a heads up if they’re coming over. I feel that it is a small shared space and it is the bare minimum of what is acceptable regardless of company.\n\n\n\n**AITA for asking to have a ‘hey [person] is hanging out at our place just FYI’ request for my SO, regardless of the company?**",

      "description": "My best friend's birthday is 2-3 weeks before mine. For her birthday, I was planning a big out of state trip, was going to spend hundreds of dollars for this party, but it ended up falling through because her (not yet) boyfriend planned another party without telling me (that's a different story but whatever). However, for the other party, he did nothing to plan it. I ended up buying $100+ on alcohol and about $100 on food and drinks. I even bought her a pretty nice gift, made her homemade cupcakes, and bought her balloons. Which I did with no problem, because she is my best friend and wanted her party to be great.\n\nHowever, for my birthday this past weekend, I asked her if I could visit at her university (a hour and a half drive from me). I went, and she gave me alcohol that I bought her, there was a lot of people in her apartment (that I didn't know) so she was being a hostess most of the time. She bought me a pizza at the end of the night, that I ended up paying her back for. She texted me on my birthday the following Monday a \"sorry I can't be there to celebrate with you.\" But yesterday she came down to visit her boyfriend with no problem and didn't bother coming to see me or text me to hang out.\n\nI'd like to just say that I didn't expect her to spend hundreds on me like I did for her. But if she says I'm her best friend, shouldn't I expect her to at least visit me? Get me a card? Celebrate with me somehow? Not sure if I'm just being dramatic and pissy for no reason, or if I have at least some right to be.",

I used to work a full-time job and have time to help A LOT around during the house (very relaxed job, boss was usually never around). \n\nMom would call last minute for a ride to an appointment no problem, dad would ask to run errands, need a new tap from home depot. no problem. Find the cheapest tool set from online retailers, no problem. etc.   \n\n\nNaturally this didn't seem too big a deal, I always felt/thought I owed them that much at least, and I was very appreciative I always had home-cooked meals, laundry done, fresh sheets at home, no rent.\n\n* Older brother wasn't able to do this as he worked full-time as well just had a lot more of a stressful job. \n\n  \nRecently I quit my very relaxed job and have been occupied with my own business, I just come home to sleep now...I even eat out 7 days a week. And with the money I've been making I have responsibilities such as payroll, overhead, etc. (looking to find a fantastic manager)  \n\n\n* Mom noticed this the most, and always has been negative saying how the added stress isn't good for my health, i should have just stuck with my job (I am on track to make about 8 times more.. for this year).\n\nShe also heard my talk to a realtor about showings (I am planning to move, but I didn't want to let my parents know until  actually put down a down payment on a place)  \n\n\nMom called me last week for a ride, I told I wasn't able to as I had a meeting in 15 minutes which was on the other side of town. I told her I can call a cab for her right now, who would get there faster. She said she doesn't want to wait to wait 10 minutes for a cab. I told her it would be faster. She said okay  she will just bus  instead? and hung up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I came home she made a big shit show how I was raised by her, and how awful of a person I am to deny her of a ride.  My dad ofcourse added onto it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess it was the added stress of my new responsibilities, I told them to leave me alone. IT escalated quickly where my dad said im living under his home, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't talked to them since but they've started saying to my older brother not to talk to me either?

I dont like to utilize food as a reward system I see food as fuel not enjoyment so when others try to use it as such I feel bad and dont bither trying to explain just stating oh I ate before or oh I'm not hungry.

After they played I left and saw Frank packing the band up. So, i went up to him to ask for a picture and for him to sign something for me. The next day at school I excitedly told my friends all about meeting him and how I was so excited to hug him and stuff. I was talking about it all day. When, out of nowhere one of my friends says \"u/friccinheckinidk will you shut the fuck up about your stupid emo guy forever\" I laugh it off and stop talking. Later i was describing the experience to another friend and she said a similar sentence. So I stop and don't talk about it again. Then, later in the day my friend asks me,  \nHer: \"anyways i have to go bye op\n\n\nAlso a little background: I am always supportive and happy for them when they get to do things and i always take their music suggestions and stuff like that so-\n\nTl;dr: I got to meet Frank Iero and my friend tells me to shut the fuck up about meeting him.\n",

      "description": "Okay, so long story short. A few years ago, I dated this guy for \\~4 months? It was pretty okay, getting kinda serious, but he was such a jealous, controlling person like he'd get mad at me for stuff like\n\n* Not wanting to do sexual stuff all the time\n* Talking to other guys\n* Not replying within like an hour\n* Getting mad when I'd go out for drinks with friends, or out in general\n* Here's the kicker: declining to schedule dates with him when my dad (who worked abroad at the time) would visit home\n\nNeedless to say, that ship sunk and I dumped him, told him I might consider getting back together if things changed, and stayed friends. We flirted and fooled around a while after that, but we were just friends. I went out with a few other people after that, nothing serious and ex would call me a cheap slut and all that. \n\nFast forward, he forced me to have sex with him one day while we were hanging out. Like I said no, he physically forced. There were a few other physical altercations, like us seeing each other at a mutual friend's party and me getting shoved to the ground on my back. \n\nI'm not the type of person to let things affect me externally though. He kinda went crazy with guilt, like threatening suicide every time I'd show signs of being upset about the stuff that had happened. \n\nSo he had this best friend (who I will from now on refer to as bff), who I met when ex and I were dating. Later on, bff kinda start chatting because we were both worried about my ex, who would always be going crazy with suicide threats and stuff. Bff really, sincerely cared about ex. Their friendship was pretty legit and real, they were tight for years. \n\nBff and I started talking and becoming pretty good friends outside the whole drama with my ex. Since we started talking, bff ended up becoming more sympathetic with me than with my ex. Bff also ended up sharing friendship issues between him and ex. We ended up going for drinks, and eventually ended up dating. We had a long talk on how our relationship would affect ex and his mental health and how there's the bro code \"don't date your best friend\" thing, but I was like \"how he handles things is not my problem, I don't owe him anything\", and I kinda ended up convincing bff to choose me. So now I'm in a happy relationship with bff, and I have been for almost a year now (yay).\n\nAnyway, so ex found out eventually, and he's now super pissed at bff for being a bad friend, for \"stealing his girl\", and was constantly sending both of us (bff and I) suicide threats, sending me photos of his self harm wounds, and all that. He also said I stole his best friend, which is true to an extent. \n\nI didn't really care that much, I'm kind of a bitch. If he kills himself, it's not my fault or responsibility- and I told him as such, then proceeded to block him. \n\nI stopped giving a shit, got pissed off at some point and started being publicly annoyed with his crap. Kinda ruined his social standing in a lot of circles. Don't really care. His grades went down the toilet, he almost got kicked out of uni, lost a lot of friends. \n\nIt's been about 10 months, he's got a new girlfriend, but people still hate him and judge the sorry girl who ended up dating him. He's still messed up though, people barely talk to him in uni, lost a lot of friends and social standing, and his life is just generally still messed up because people know he's a rapist and a bunch of other bad things. Bff now hates his guts, and makes it a point to rub our relationship in ex's face every time he gets. Ex is also kinda pissed that he lost his bff and \"his girl\" in one go, which is my fault. \n\nAm I the asshole for basically shitting on his life? ",

We gave her an entire truck's bed full of stuff - swing, 2 high chairs, a portable high chair, 2 bumbos, a couple nice toys, a designer diaper bag, a bassinet, a thing to baby-wear, etc and a bunch of small misc items. I said I understood if she didn't need everything, but anything she didn't want to just pass on the kindness.\n\nI've since seen her selling 5 of the items we gave her! - the swing, diaper bag, both bumbos (who doesn't want those!?) and a mobility toy that was barely ever used. It made me so angry to see her SELLING stuff I gave her for free and specifically said to give to someone else if she didn't want them. And that's just in the past day or so, who knows if she will continue to sell stuff or just keep the rest.\n\nWould I be wrong to say something to her? I knew I had another thing she wanted but I couldn't find it and said I'd let her know when it turned up but I'm def not going to do that now. And we aren't really close or anything, but it just feels so wrong to publicly sell stuff you got for free, on FB when you're friends with the person who gave it to you! \n\nI am not trying to be petty, but also I kind of let myself get taken advantage of in life and it's something I'm really trying to be better about - sticking up for myself when something bothers me.",

      "description": "So as the title says I bought a homeless man some food. Yesterday I was on the way home from work and decided to call in BK for a double cheeseburger (£1.49), I was  approached by a homeless man inside the store whom asked me to buy him a meal. I am happy to buy people food or donate money, but usually on my terms and not when accosted in the queue. \n\nSo, I offered to buy him a double cheeseburger, the same as I was getting and the he asked how much it is and I told him.  He then says he doesn’t eat the beef as he is a Muslim. I’m fine with this and offer some fries. He then asks for a King Fish Burger(£4.49). Now I should say I am terrible in confrontation and saying no to someone face, I accept his request and proceed to order my burger and his. So my spend has quadrupled as a result. \n\nSo I emailed BK to complain that customers shouldn’t have to be put in that situation. I understand he plight of being homeless, I’ve been there myself. I just feel as a company they should do more to protect the customers from this interaction. \n\nHad he been sat outside when I arrived I would have bought him a coffee without the need for him to ask for it. \n\nSo AITA? \n",

      "description": "I'll try and keep this quick as it is my first post on reddit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContext: i work as security officer and get paid fortnightly (previous jobs i was paid weekly so it takes some getting used to). The week this took place i was very strapped for cash as it was a week after i had been paid and didn't receive a lot as it was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my mum and dad were out partying with their friends that weekend and had left their car in the city (about a 35 minute drive from home) the night before. My mum isn't a big drinker but told me she had had a couple that night and was hungover, my dad was ok and enjoying his last day before heading back to work. i was on my way out the door to heading to sports training when my mum asked me, last minute, if i could drive her all the way into the city (which was in the opposite direction) to pick up the car. I told her no as i was struggling with fuel and basically only have enough to go to and from training. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nshe proceeds to tell me i'm a lazy little shit and to \"not expect anything from us when you need it\". This was the day after i had gone to work with a hangover myself because i knew i needed the money and would end up working 2 more times that week having to take public transport to avoid using petrol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMTA or is she expecting too much?",
