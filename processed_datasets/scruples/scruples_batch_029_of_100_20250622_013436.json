      "description": "So basically, I am a first time dad (22) living with my wife Nat who is also a first time parent (21) and my beautiful baby Amy who's barely a month old. Now, my greatest passions in life were playing soccer (since i was once a semiprofessional player in high school) and playing xbox online (big time halo and gears fan). But now I really love my baby, she's very small and I feel like i owe my life to her. I enjoy sleeping besides her, feeding her and carrying her. I work full time (since i dropped out of college) so I stopped playing xbox and soccer and that was WAY before my daughter was born and during the time Nat was pregnant. I'm not the world's greatest dad, but I do my best to help Nat out as much as possible, I clean Amy's bottles, prepare her things for bath time and to other things like the dishes and laundry. Throughout the day, when I feel that I'm finished with my daily chores and when Amy is sleeping and once Nat is relaxing I'll try to workout because my inactivity has made me gain weight and now I'm not even the shadow of the fit player I used to be. And on my days off at night I'll try to crack some skulls online. However, lately Nat has been saying I play too much and that I prefer playing xbox over Amy. When you play online, you can't simply pause and yet, I'll drop anything I'm doing to carry Amy. She also says I'm selfish for working out and that I should do that when Amy's older. She even told my mom (40) about it and she agreed so now both of them have made me feel bad. There's a soccer tournament next month at my office and I've thought about dropping out since I haven't played in a  long time and apparently can't train nor work out. Have I been that wrong all this time?",

      "title": "AITA Reporting former teacher on FB",
      "description": "My high school speech and debate teacher from 7 years ago posted on FB pictures of two of her boys in the bathtub. They're both really young (3 and 1 or 2 years old) and they were both naked in clear bathwater. You couldn't see their genitalia, but you could see EVERYTHING else, including their bottom.\n\nMost of the post said (I don't have the last part of the post), \"Confession... I don't bath little kids. Well, I do when l have to, but otherwise [husband] bathes them. He's handled bath time with all three boys from infancy until they understand when we say \"lean your head back.\" It's just something that I don't care for and Nick has stepped up and taken over. Tonight will be the second night this week that I tackle this...\"\n\nAnd I saw this, and I had a number of issues with it (explained throughout). So I sent my former teacher a message on FB. We had a pretty good relationship when I was in high school so I didn't feel too weird reaching out, but I also know that telling a parent how to parent is a huge no no.\n\nI said \"Hi [teacher]! I hope you're doing well. I'm in my first year of law school at [American law school] right now and staying busy! I know it's not really my place to mention this, but I noticed the pictures of your kids in the bath you posted the other day on FB today. If my parents did that to me (and FB existed when I was your kids age) I would be absolutely mortified and feel like my privacy was violated beyond reason. Nothing on the internet goes away, as I'm sure you know, especially as a teacher, and I wouldn't personally want pictures of me as a child out there with no clothing on. Once again, you're the parent and it's absolutely your prerogative in what you think is best for your children and what you want your 1,100 Facebook friends to know about them. The more I've learned in law school and from my undergrad degree the more I realize just how little privacy rights Americans have in general. I saw a good Forbes article the other day about the impact data has on kid's futures and thought it was relevant.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicabaron/2018/12/16/parents-who-post-about-their-kids-online-could-be-damaging-their-futures/\nI hope you and your family is doing well though!\"\n\nI reported it to FB after I sent the message. She didn't reply to me, but I didn't really expect her to (she did read it). FB removed the post later as it did violate their Community Standards.\n\nToday I saw that she posted something that said \"I‚Äôm out of Facebook jail! üôåüèª I was blocked because I posted a few pics of my kids in the bath, no nudity shown, doting on my husband for his endless help bathing our kiddos. Dumb. üôÑ\"\n\nI didn't realize it would give her a temporary ban. I don't think I did the wrong thing by reporting it, but you can do the right thing and still be an asshole in my opinion. So the question is AITA?\n\ntl;rd I reported an old teacher for posting naked pictures of her kids on Facebook.",

      "description": "  Been sick and off work past two nights. SO doesn't want to get sick because she is a nurse. They called her off work tonight so we both happen to be off. During our txt convo, she asked if I needed anything and I told her I didn't think so and that I just took some meds. She then continued on to say soup would help and then I thought that would be a good idea. I wanted to finish what I was doing at that moment so some time went by and I went to check to see what soup I had. \n\n  Decided on TOM YUM soup but didn't have any coconut milk. Asked my SO through txt if she had any at her house. She said she wasn't sure but wasn't at home to check and was headed to the gym. No problem. I told her ok and made a flirtatious remark about her working that booty out at the gym. No response. Over 2 hours later still nothing from her so I called. First call, she doesn't answer. I then sent a txt with a question mark. She called me right back and was at the bar with her friends. I didn't even care that she was at the bar but I was hurt that she didn't think to call or txt me after she left the gym. It also seemed shady. When I spoke to her while she was at the bar, she said,\"Was I suppose to bring you the milk?\" I just told her never mind and that I'd pick the milk up from her house then hung up. \n\n  I'm pretty hurt by this given that our relationship has been rocky (going on about 3 years) and whenever she left the bar, she still didn't bother to call or txt. I ended up having to call her back and trying to explain that her bringing the milk by or me picking it up from her house was a nice way to see her for just the moment and that it would've put me in a good mood. She then said I PROMPTLY told her I didn't need anything and she translated that to \"f\\*\\*\\* off\" and therefore did not want to bother me. Not sure how you translate \"I don't think I need anything\" to \"F\\*\\*\\* off\" but that's how she translated it. I don't understand whats going on or why this all got turned on me when she was the one that asked if I needed anything. AITA for wanting a better SO that I can communicate better with?   \n",

      "description": "So me and my partner have been together for over 4 years and he proposed to me a few months ago. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs like any normal couple. The biggest point of friction has been his incel best friend but it's never been a dealbreaker for the relationship just friction. When he told me he wanted that guy to be his best man I told him I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with that and don‚Äôt want that guy as a best man end of story.\n\nNow I didn‚Äôt do this without reason. I‚Äôm sure some of the unlucky ladies here will understand the situation of creepy friends of boyfriends. This is that scenario. The more I got to know this friend the less comfortable I felt around him. He‚Äôs over 35, complete virgin and never had a single relationship with a man, woman or whatever. Doesn‚Äôt own any pets and lives alone. I get the biggest incel vibe from him and that makes me uncomfortable. I‚Äôve even looked at the incel subreddits and some of those people seem to have very unhealthy views which makes me even more uncomfortable. I‚Äôve brought up that creepiness many times, but my fiance just doesn‚Äôt see it, but they‚Äôve know each other since primary school plus most guys don‚Äôt pick up on that.\n\nAs a replacement I suggested one of his other close friends who he has known just as long but is happily married with a kid on the way. Or I‚Äôd even consider compromising and let him potentially choose my maid of honour from a list. I feel like this is more appropriate for a wedding to have people who know what it‚Äôs like to be in a loving relationship supporting the bride and groom.\n\nMy fianc√© says it‚Äôs his choice and won‚Äôt budge on the choice but I believe both of us have to be completely comfortable with each other‚Äôs respective best man and maid of honour.",

      "description": "(Using throwaway)\n\nI am [M18], my sister is [F22], my cousin is [F7] and her parents are [M and F both mid 30s].\n\nSo my cousin and her parents came over yesterday. She was bored so was hanging out in my room playing with my things. I was busy with things so I wasn‚Äôt really paying much attention to her but then I noticed that she was playing with my pillow. (My pillow is a special cooling gel memory foam pillow which costs about $50 but was old so a little damaged in some places.) \n\nSo basically my cousin was playing with it and just picking at where there are holes. When I saw her doing this, I told her to stop otherwise it will damage the pillow further. She said okay. \nAfter some time I noticed her still doing it so this time I told her more sternly and she said she‚Äôll stop. \n\n\nI came back later to find my pillow completely destroyed and unusable, significantly worse than before. My cousin was still in the room and playing with something else. I confronted her asking what happened to the pillow and she flat out lied saying it was like this from the beginning and she didn‚Äôt touch it at all. I asked her why she lied, and told her to accept that she broke the pillow. Instead she got super defensive again and ran out of the room.\n\nNow I know she did this, so was going to go tell her parents so they could scold her and teach her the right thing. However on the way I ran into my sister so I told her what happened.  My sister stopped me from telling on my cousin, saying that she is just a kid and I should forgive her. I argued that she needed to learn the consequences of not messing with other people‚Äôs items but my sister said that if I told my cousin‚Äôs parents what she did, they would smack her. My sister claims that the only reason my cousin didn‚Äôt own up to her mistake was because she was scared her parents would find out and hit her, so that‚Äôs why she denied it. I do know that her parents do occasionally smack her even if it is only light slaps but IMO that is still physical violence. \n\nSo now I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I don‚Äôt care about the money and I don‚Äôt want my cousin to be hit but at the same time I think my cousin needs to learn a lesson (not physically) because right now she‚Äôs faced absolutely no consequences.\n\nSo WIBTA for calling out my cousin?",

And ever since I've tried to sit with her sometimes, but every time I do she always brings up that I'm not sitting with her so much and it makes me feel really bad and she is constantly guilt tripping me.\n\nHowever there have been times where she has threatened our friendship (as she says) \"snip snip, cut  a bitch out\" . I don't say anything about it but sometimes it make me unconformable. But today she asked if we could sit together and when I said i have a band practise to go to she started say \"of course you are, you never sit with us\" (I have sat with her this week i make sure too). my best fried says that i should be forced to sit with her and that shes in the wrong but i think that my best friend is biased so;\n\nAITA for not always sitting with my friend     ",

      "description": "For a little backstory, I'm currently a high school senior, and every morning my friends and I congregate in my car before the first bell rings so we can finish homework/talk without having to sit in the commons of our school, which are usually really crowded in the mornings. This also happened today, and today also happened to be a half day as it is the week for finals for my school.\n\nBasically what happened this morning was that my friend's car keys had fallen out of his pocket when he got in the car, and I didn't notice that they were there until after I had gotten really close to my home, which is about 30 minutes away from our school. The moment I noticed I had them, I called him, but he didn't reply until about 10 minutes later. At this point, I wasn't really willing to drive all the way back to school, and told him to call his parents to give him a key, and that I could give him his keys tomorrow. I later called him back and told him that if I really needed to drive to school to give him his keys that I could, but that I would prefer not to, and he said that his mom was on her way with an extra key.\n\nThe more I think about this the worse I feel, and I'm trying to decide how to feel about the scenario still, as I feel like the blame can go in multiple ways for what happened.",

      "description": "I've had this friend for quite a few months. She didn't really have any friends, so I started spending time with her.\n\nPeople didn't seem to like her, and she was alone most of the time, so I felt kind of bad for her. I thought she seemed pretty intelligent, had interesting things to say, and I just assumed she was misunderstood and didn't realise how she was coming across to people.\n\nAnyway, I've completely changed my opinion on her now. It turns out there's a good reason for most people disliking her. She's REALLY been rubbing me the wrong way for a long time, and I couldn't figure out what it was, so I felt bad for it. But I've figured it out. \n\nShe seems to genuinely think she's some kind of superior, intellectual being. She acts like other people are all stupid, naive, mindless sheep. She seems to think we're all beneath her. She's never actually said any of this, but it really comes across that way in her behaviour and things she says.\n\nAlso, she takes everything so seriously all the time. Even with harmless jokes, she'll find something to go on rants about. All she does is rant to me about tiny things that don't even matter. She's a negative person and is always complaining. Also, she uses such complicated language and talks so formally all the time. She also assumes I don't know what those words mean, and proceeds to explain them to me even though I already know the meanings. If I ever use a slang term or an abbreviation, she rolls her eyes and complains about how society is dumbing itself down.\n\nI've had enough. I always feel so negative and stressed out after spending time with her. I've finally decided to just cut her out of my life.\n\nExcept now she keeps crying and doing things that make me feel guilty. She keeps going on about how she doesn't have any other friends, and that she thought I was the only one who understood her, and that it's unintentional and I'm just misinterpreting her behaviour. She also keeps mentioning how lonely she is and how she's gonna slip into depression if I stop talking to her.\n\nI can't tell if she's being emotionally manipulative or if she's being genuinely truthful. I'm starting to feel really bad and feel this sense of obligation like I have to be her friend and that I'm the one in the wrong.\n\nShe's also started complaining to other people about me. She sent me this long, formal apology email, except it wasn't really an apology. To sum it up, it was basically just, \"I'm sorry that you're misunderstanding me and can't see the real me because of unconscious social biases instilled in you by society\" or something like that. \n\nShe also keeps calling me a dick and saying I'm really hurting her feelings. A couple of people have spoken to me and asked me to just give her another chance and make friends with her again.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I really liked this girl and thought it was going well so was surprised when she broke up with me. I found out a couple days after we broke up that this friend made a move on her and they slept together the day before she broke up with me. I also found out from a mutual friend that the reason she was interested in him was because he's black, and no other black guy had ever shown interest in her so she wanted to try it out. I was pissed at this guy for making a move on her when he knew she was with me so I talked to him about it (over text). He blamed being drunk but said it was her choice to choose him over me. I told him out of anger that the only reason she was with him was because he's black. He called me racist for this and we haven't talked since. All of our mutual friends are now angry at me calling me racist for what I said, even the friend who told me that it's because hes black in the first place.\n\nAITA for wanting to not be friends with this guy anymore?",

      "description": "Whenever I try to make plans with my good friend Heather, she is \\*always\\* busy, but Heather is a nice person and always invites me to tag along.\n\nWhile I initially appreciated this, I am starting to get very frustrated. Yes, she invites me to parties or events and they can be fun! But it often requires me rearranging my schedule to make it work, taking multiple trains and/or buses, traveling for over an hour, making small talk with people I don't know, etc. I have made this effort for months now, I like to try new things and meet new people, but I am starting to feel that all the work is on my end. I don't always want to just be a tag along to \\*her\\* plans as an afterthought, especially for plans that I'm not always even interested in. Heather says she loves me and wants to see me, but is busy so I should just tag along. But I feel that is basically saying, \"I'm going here at this time with these people, so if you want to see me you need to agree to that.\" Heather never asks what I may want to do or what my schedule is like.\n\nStarting about a month ago, I still ask her frequently to hang out, but if she has plans, I often say No thanks and make plans with someone else. She takes it very personally each time and sometimes lectures me. This came to a head when Heather and I had plans to hang out together Saturday, but texted me that she's actually going to a march madness viewing party and I should go with her. To be fair, she did apologize about agreeing to hang out when she had other plans. But when I passed on it, she lectured me again that I have no reason to not attend, that I'm being difficult, and need to make an effort. I finally snapped at her and explained my frustrations I outlined above.\n\nHeather was very offended and sent me paragraphs of texts. She said she just has more friends than me and is being nice by inviting me along to everything; that I am not making an effort; that its not fair I'm painting her as an bad/inconsiderate friend; and that she didn't realize I was sooo miserable attending her plans (I didn't say any of that, she was very dramatic honestly). I see her point that she is just trying to include me while juggling so many plans, but if she wants to see me \\*so\\* bad, why not ever consider my interests or schedule?\n\nNow we are in a huge fight and I don't know how to resolve it. Heather is calling me now and I'm not sure what to say so I'm asking for help here. AITA for shooting down her invites?",

      "description": "Please bear with me through all these details. \nLong story short, I got addicted to opiates, and then heroin, after a car accident a few years ago that left me with chronic pain. \n\nI am not debating my assholeness when I was at my worst. I know I was bad. I lied to my little sister (who is now 25 and I‚Äôm 28), I stole money and valuables from my parents (this is what I‚Äôm most ashamed of) and it eventually got so bad that they had to cut all contact with me. I got clean through my own doing and only after I was 6 months clean have they all been willing to reestablish any kind of relationship with me. \n\nMoving forward to now, it turns out my little sister is getting married in a couple of months. I found out when my sister told me that I wouldn‚Äôt be invited because even though I‚Äôve been clean for over a year and even though she‚Äôs proud of me, she still doesn‚Äôt trust me and her fianc√© agrees that neither of them want me there ‚Äúin case something happens‚Äù. She said she didn‚Äôt want me to find this out from someone else so she is telling me herself. \n\nWhen she told me, I didn‚Äôt yell, but I was noticeably upset and I said, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt trust me enough to not fuck up your wedding, why even bother having me around at all?‚Äù I then asked her if this was her saying this or her fianc√© saying this, as he only really knows me as the addict older brother and isn‚Äôt my biggest fan, to say the least. She then got upset at me so I just left as I didn‚Äôt want to start a fight. \n\nHonestly, I was and am pretty devastated. My sister and I grew up super close and she was my best friend for a really long time until the addiction took over. I can‚Äôt believe I won‚Äôt be there for such an important life moment. \n\nI feel as though I have proven I‚Äôm stable enough by getting a good job, staying clean, and am taking care of myself enough to come to her wedding. \n\nThis was all a few days ago and I haven‚Äôt spoken to her since. I don‚Äôt know what my parents know about all this but they didn‚Äôt bother to tell me about the wedding at all. \n\nAITA for being upset about not being invited? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So, apologies, first reddit post. Something happened today and I really need to get some closure. For background, my friend A. and I have been friends for years, we‚Äôre both girls and juniors in high school now, and she‚Äôs the kind of person I know I can trust with anything. So, for years, we‚Äôve had a close relationship, but then last year she got a boyfriend. She talks to him much more now, and sometimes I do feel a bit ignored, but let me make it clear that I‚Äôm not the kind to express all my feelings or act on jealousy. Anyways, since A. has had a boyfriend, the three of us often talk at lunch. I grew up in a very noisy home, so getting a chance to speak is a gift. Today, as usual, we were talking and everything seemed fine. Then, when I got home, I saw a somewhat passive aggressive text from A. asking me to try not to talk over her boyfriend when they are having a conversation and said that he was upset about it. The thing is, when I spoke, they weren‚Äôt even talking, not to mention I didn‚Äôt think I said all that much. Then again, I do know that in the past I was a pretty blabby person, but once again I kind of owe that to my home life. But even if I do talk too much, which I‚Äôll admit to, am I the asshole in this situation? The text A. sent me has had me really wrecked emotionally for the past hour or so, and while I‚Äôve sent many sincere apology texts, I feel like she‚Äôs still kind of upset with me.

      "description": "Hi, I‚Äôm a 15 year old male here. I‚Äôm stuck in a large group of friends that I‚Äôve been in since entering high school. They‚Äôre decent people, and I don‚Äôt hate any of them, but they‚Äôre all very loud. I tend to eat my lunch alone in a specific spot, and they all fill in, one by one, till the area is bursting with chatter. I‚Äôll only ever join in on conversations if it‚Äôs me and one other person, or I‚Äôm specifically asked something.\n\nI heavily value silence, and that‚Äôs why I initially chose the spot. I‚Äôm also not the best with social interaction, and I fear of saying something awkward. Then I was found out, and the results are shown above. I‚Äôd just like to enjoy my lunch alone instead of going through my last class with a headache. \n\nNow what I try to do, is just abruptly leave the area and find somewhere else I can enjoy myself. I avoid spots I know where they gather and do my best to keep my distance. I‚Äôm not trying to directly cut them off from my life, as I‚Äôll still enjoy the company of maybe one of these friends at a time somewhere, and I greet them in the halls if we notice each other, it‚Äôs just I‚Äôd like to see different people; ones who I can get along better with. \n\nWell, let‚Äôs hear it Reddit, AITA?

To be honest it sort of bothered me that I got no answer because it took some guts to say, but okay whatever.\n\n We walked to her bus stop (which is what she wanted I guess) and I told her i¬¥\bd be taking a cab home.

      "description": "I‚Äôm 30 M getting engaged to my 26 F girlfriend of a few years. She has personally wanted to wait until marriage to have sex and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been fine with. She‚Äôs never really made a particularly big deal about it, just something we discussed early in our relationship.\n\nThe issue is, I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit, I lost my virginity to an escort at 21 and since then had sex with a few more escorts in my early 20‚Äôs. During this time, I never had a girlfriend or sex with anyone not an escort. I eventually decided this was gross and vowed not to see another escort. Still, I was internally really ashamed of this and depressed for much of my 20‚Äôs. At some point, I started working out and getting out of my depression and shortly after is when I met my girlfriend.\n\nSo when the topics eventually came up early in our relationship, I had told her truthfully that she was my first relationship ... but then falsely told her that along those lines I was a virgin. I was head over heels for her and so I just didn‚Äôt have the courage to suddenly reveal my shamed history with escorts. And in a very real sense, I do still feel like a virgin. From my perspective, it‚Äôs less of a lie and more of a half-truth. And that‚Äôs when she told me she was a virgin too.\n\nSo fast forward to today and we‚Äôll be getting married in 6 months. She still thinks I‚Äôm a virgin and doesn‚Äôt know I had seen escorts in the past. Although we haven‚Äôt played it up to be a particularly huge deal, when we do get married and have sex I feel like it‚Äôs inherently going to be something very significant for her to believe that we have lost our virginity to each other. \n\nI mean, with her desire to wait for marriage, she never really articulated some dream of marrying a virgin too. If in reality I had lost my virginity in a more normal manner and originally told her that, I doubt she would have cared. But since now she‚Äôs been living with the half-truth that I am a virgin for the past few years, I‚Äôm sure it has made it more significant.\n\nBut still, I feel like my embarrassing sexual history is something very personal. A skeleton in my closet that I‚Äôd like to keep there. I don‚Äôt plan on ever revealing this to her and hope once we progress through our marriage, the details of our sexual history will have lost their significance and never really come up again.\n\nFew notes: I was tested twice in between the last time I saw an escort and when I met my girlfriend, both came back completely clean. If it matters, my girlfriend and I are still very intimate in other ways and I think overall have a very healthy relationship.\n\nSo am I the asshole here by not revealing this to my soon-to-be wife?",

We only see him when our school has a half-day and we all decide to walk to a nearby restaurant. He always tags along even though none of us really know him outside of these half-days.\n\nA lot of my friends are uncomfortable around him because he‚Äôs a little antisocial and so are a lot my friends so it‚Äôs really awkward when he‚Äôs around (this isn‚Äôt something I personally worry about but it affects our group as a whole).\n\nThe main reason he makes us uncomfortable is that he has a history of messaging creepy and sexual pickup lines to random girls he doesn‚Äôt know, including some of our friends. Because of this, a lot of us are uncomfortable with him eating lunch with us. \n\nThe main issue here is that some of my friends want to solve this by just ignoring him and meeting across campus so that none of us see him. Personally, I think we should just tell him how we feel. My reasoning is that avoiding him is an asshole move and just because he‚Äôs an asshole doesn‚Äôt mean we should be one too. But, me and my friends are all non-confrontational which is why we‚Äôre not sure if we‚Äôd even be able to talk to him. So, would we be the assholes if we deliberately met across campus so that we could avoid Gerald rather than just telling him the truth.",

She talked about how a friend with benefits situation isn't for her. I said fine and we ended our relationship. She asked to unfollow each other's accounts on social media and delete each other's numbers. I agreed to no contact on social media but said we can still keep our numbers. She said okay because she said it'd be nice if we could still be friends and talk.\n\nI told a female friend about this situation and she called me out saying I wanted to keep her number because I was attached and still wanted to have sex with her. It is true that I still wanted to stay in contact because my FWB has done this before where she wanted to stop the relationship  but contacted me anyway after because she wanted sex.

I accepted the offer.\nInstantly fell for her when we had our first session. She was just really receptive, witty, kind and beautiful. But I obviously didn't want to ruin our relationship, so I stayed quiet and was strictly professional.\nAfter a couple of months more of tutoring her, she got decent grades and I was happy for her. After I stopped teaching her, I asked her out on a date, and she was genuinely pissed. \nTold me I ruined our relationship and that she didn't expect me to be like that. She said we weren't compatible because she liked tough guys or people in the swim team, I wasn't her level at all. She told me to never talk to her again, and said that I she had just started gaining popularity and any interaction with me would be detrimental to her popularity.(It was at this point I realized why she told me to teach her 15 minutes away from the school in a small park. The open air excuse was probably bullshit)\nShe hung out with the popular bunch anyway so I didn't really care a lot. I had gotten over her at this point.\nSo when she came and asked me to help her with her chem finals, I outright refused to, even after she pleaded since she didn't want to see me just a month ago anyway.\n\nI have just come to know that she failed her class, and I honestly feel conflicted.\n\nPlease do help, genuinely means a lot.\n\n\n",

I've recently got into crocheting and wanted to make a gift that she would hopefully love. \n\nSo for the past 2 weeks I've been working on a blanket that has turned out really nice (if I do say so myself), and it's my first actual thing that I've crocheted so I'm genuinely super proud. This blanket has taken me literally hours. The wool that I've used this quite thin so it's obviously taken a while to build up. It's taken 3 balls of DK yarn with a 4mm hook so you can imagine the effort that I've put into it.\n\nMy mum is also going to the baby shower on Sunday and has mentioned that she wants to pool gifts, which at first I was fine with. I imagined that I would have my thing in a  bag and she would have her thing in a bag and that she would sign hers \"mum, dad, me, my SO\" and that I would sign ours \"me, my SO, mum, dad\". That way they're both together but separate. This isn't what my mum had in mind. \n\nShe simply wants to put her gift in the same bag as mine and then sign it from the 4 of us, which I wouldn't mind if she was going to the same effort but her plan is to go to the baby section of Lidl tomorrow and just pick something. If you're from the UK, you understand why I aren't keen on this. If you're not from the UK, Lidl is literally the cheapest supermarket there is. \n\nAITA because I don't want to mix the two? It just feels like I've gone to loads of effort and now my mum is trying to use that to go to none herself.",

      "description": "We had a conflict yesterday. We want to describe both sides in detail, point by point, to stay neutral for more accurate feedback. To preface, we each have personal bank accounts plus a shared joint account for shared expenses. \n\n  \nThis arose because we were trying to log into his steam account to play The Witness. She was manning the computer and when it prompted for his password, he wouldn't tell it to her. His reasoning was because it was the same password as his bank.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Her Concerns - Point|His Concerns - Counterpoint|\n|:-|:-|\n|1. Not sharing bank passwords implies mistrust and implies that he feels that I could use the information to harm him. |1. Not sharing my bank password does not imply mistrust, it implies my personal thresholds for security and trust are different than hers. |\n|2. I share all my passwords with him, even my bank password, because I trust him.¬†Yes, it is true that I use the same password (or variation) for everything. But even if I used a different password for banks, I would share it with him. |2. She shares all her passwords with everyone because all her passwords are the same exact password, from Netflix and WIFI, to serious accounts like banks. I have a higher threshold for security than her. I use my strongest password for any account that has access to my debit card, such as Steam. |\n|3. My ex-husband (with whom I share 2 children) hid money from me in an account I didn't know about while I shared all of my money with him. At the time, I thought we were living paycheck to paycheck and was always worried about making ends meet.  I want full transparency in this relationship. I am fully transparent with him. |3. I don't hide my online bank statements or accounts from her if she asks to see them, so there's no risk of me hiding money from her like her ex did.  |\n|4. He has phone alert settings lets him know about any transactions that day. I have no history of lying to him, nor deception in any past relationships, and I have been very careful to ensure if he pays for something, and I need to reimburse my half, that I always pay him promptly.  |4. I had an ex steal about 3 months worth of my income once because she felt justified in her situation at the time. I trusted her. I want to decrease the probability of that happening in this relationship. |\n|5. He kept a savings account secret from his ex-fiance (that contained significant savings) of almost 10 years. |5. I used to keep a savings account secret from my ex because she stole about 3 months worth of my income and I wanted to have an emergency savings account. |\n|6. He cheated on me when we first met.¬†I was, unknowingly, the other woman. Had either her or I seen his bank account, we would have known he had 2 different cell phones &amp; spending habits that would betray his deception. I certainly don't want to review his bank accounts regularly nor without his knowledge &amp; consent, but it feels triggering to me that he wants to withhold his password. I only ever reviewed his bank account after right after he revealed his infidelity (1.5 years ago) with his consent, to help restore trust and ensure that there wasn't further deception. I haven't requested to look at them since. |6. My ex and I were in a bad relationship. My ex was my first gf and we were together for almost 10 years. My ex cheated on me multiple times and stole money from me, but I didn't know if I could have a better relationship if I ended it. I had low self-esteem and no experience dating. Instead of ending the relationship, I made the regrettable decision to go on dates without my ex knowing, to see if I had the potential to have a better relationship. I met my gf and ended things with my ex. We went to therapy for over a year. I want to do everything I can to reassure my gf. I want her to be able to see my bank statements whenever she wants, but I don't want her to know my bank password because she would have the ability to take money out of my bank accounts.  |\n|7. While we aren't legally married, we live a married cohabiting lifestyle. (We feel that marriage is an entirely unnecessary step when committing yourself to your partner)  In my experience, it is common practice for married couples to be fully transparent about money.¬† He says he wants to be fully transparent, yet I only have a rough guess of his total savings. When i have asked how much he has saved, he has always hesitated and I don't remember ever getting a straight answer.|7. I want to be fully transparent about money. I want her to be able to see my bank statements whenever she wants, but I don't want her to know my bank password because she would have the ability to take money out of my bank accounts.  |\n|8. He has told me the password in the past (but my memory fails me) why does he feel unable to share it now?¬† |8. I feel unable to share my bank password now because I want to be assertive and stand up for my boundaries. |\n|9. In order to restore trust after him cheating, we put several safeguards (apps) in place. This fall he removed all of those safeguards.¬† I have asked him to reinstall them before. He readily agreed to, but so far still  hasn't done it to date. I will always have a small seed of doubt, because of his infidelity &amp; dishonesty, but he has always done well to ensure that the seed was never watered. These concerns, unmet, feel like the seed of doubt is being watered.|9. The safeguards to restore trust were apps recording my calls and tracking my location on my phone. She has those apps on her phone as well. Over the past few months I've had to install other apps on my phone and I deleted them because there wasn't enough space. I downloaded those apps on my phone just now. |\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Hes very romantic but after the first few month i discovered that that he likes to smoke and be 'adventurous' (mind you we are both 14) it didn't really change our relationship though. So last week I said yes to climb on a roof with him. I don't like that kind of stuff what did it anyway. He was very happy that I said yes. It made me feel guilty because it was happiness. But now he wants me to go out with him at 2 a.m. and I don't like that kind of stuff, I said no that I wouldn't sneak out of my room but he begged me. I still said No and said next week. But I don't want to do it next week. I don't want to be rude to him and not sneak out of my room at 2 a.m. but I am also kind of scared. He keeps pushing me and now i really dont know what to do.\nSo Reddit AITA for not wanting to go out after midnight with my bf?",

We were basically homeless at the time and they were letting us live with them.\n\nMy niece is very... touchy, if that's a word. I would literally wake up to her humping me or squeezing my ass. (She's 10) Again, I never reported it because their mom would probably blame me. We were forced to take a bath together once and she tried to put her toes where toes do not go.\n\nNone of this was helped by how i used to get beaten up at school, so I was already sensitive to being hit. Now, I fucking can't stand going over there. They're spoiled kids and get whatever they want and love to flaunt it. We live paycheck to paycheck and they've made fun of me for it. Everytime I'm over there, my nephew will start hitting me and when i start freaking out he just laughs because it's fun to him.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for hating them?\n\nTLDR: I hate my niece and nephew because they would beat me up and basically sexually harass me.",

Our group of friends tried to be supportive but we noticed how little effort he was investing in her. Always making up excuses when she asked to meet him, calling her at his convenience then she has to stay up all night on the phone due to time difference, not getting her anything for her birthday when she sent him a care package... little things that made our group of friends question what she sees in him. \n\nAs far as I know, they weren't on speaking terms when she passed, he asked her for a break and she wouldn't tell any of us why. She even reached out to him a couple of days before her death and was upset that he didnt pick up.\n\nHe has no way of finding out about her death because of the distance and she doesn't have any social media accounts. \n\nHer mom wants to contact the guy to tell him but the family hasn't managed to unlock her phone and has no way of reaching him.

      "description": " \n\nI'm really struggling with this and could use some outside perspective. There's going to be some family background because my family is complicated, but bear with me. Thanks in advance for your time.\n\nMy step-mother has been in my life for almost 26 years. And I really do think of her as my mother. She has been there for me and we have experienced much together. We've survived through hard times, and we've always had each other's backs. I cannot stress enough how much I care for this woman. Now I have a step-mother because my biological parents are divorced. My biological mother is in my life, and is equally as important to me. I consider them both to be my moms.\n\nHowever, my biological mother and father hate each other beyond reconciliation. The hate between them is such that they cannot be in the same room as one another without outburst. This obviously makes planning a wedding wherein they are both present...complicated.\n\nThe solution my soon to be wife and I came up with was for us to completely fund a very short and small ceremony, and do it our way, so neither side could stifle the other, and we would also host a separate reception with each side of the family so there would be no possibility of conflict. My biological mother and father agreed to be docile for the ceremony.\n\nMy father and step-mother offered to host a reception without us asking, but we graciously accepted such a generous offer. Similarly without asking my biological mother's side offered the same, and our plan was falling into place like we never imagined. (My fiancee's family lives in another country, but they too offered, we truly are lucky to have such family.)\n\nThe thing with the ceremony is, we want it to be small. We're not interested in doing the whole dog and pony show with hundreds of people. Which given the size of our families, could easily happen. We limited it to 30 people, our original number was 20 but we realized there were too many people that deserved to be there. Our closest family and friends, and people who have had tremendous impact in each of our lives, people without which we would not be where we are today.\n\nMy step-mother has 4 living siblings (formerly 5 until three years ago), even more nieces and nephews, and in the 25 years I've known them, not one of them has ever made any attempt to have any type of relationship with me, whatsoever. Or my fiancee, whom I've been with for six years. To be fair, I haven't either, but it is what it is and we have a familial bond despite this, at least on my end. But as far as my life is concerned, I only have contact with them by proxy of my step-mother, and they are basically strangers to me after 25 years. However they are \\*\\*very\\*\\* important in her life, as are her nieces and nephews, whose relationships with me are equally non-existent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContinued in the comments...",

And so a few weeks pass, and she shows me some of their conversations, talking about dildos and their different kinks, and a lot of stuff like that.\n\nI was a bit shocked, and honestly a bit mad, so I tried talking to her about how I felt, I explained I didn‚Äôt like her talking about that stuff with some guy online (not to mention he could‚Äôve been any age) and that I‚Äôd like it if they didn‚Äôt talk about that anymore.\n\nShe got defensive, and said something along the lines of ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I have a friend online?‚Äù So I explained that it wasn‚Äôt the friendship that was bothering me, it was the topics of conversation they chose.\n\nA couple more weeks go by and she shows me their conversation again, and I notice they‚Äôre still talking about sexual stuff occasionally, and I get upset, saying how I felt bad that she wasn‚Äôt having these conversations with me (to clarify, it‚Äôs not that she didn‚Äôt like talking about it with me, we had plenty of sexual conversations) and that I was finding out things about her through her and his conversations.\n\nEventually she stopped talking to him, and I was relieved, fast forward a few years and now my friends are saying I‚Äôm the asshole in this situation, but I didn‚Äôt think so, so what‚Äôs your opinion?",

I shushed my girlfriend during a story I was telling, she interrupted me with questions pertaining to the story, but all the questions she was asking were going to be answered upon completion or the very story I was telling.

      "description": "So a little background. I'm a 17 year old living in Finland with my parents. I have always been close to my grandpa because my dad took me and my brothers to see him often especially after my grandma passed. My granddad was very friendly and generous to us and wanted to help us and the only way he could help us was often giving money when we were struggling because he was old and blind(and had more money than he needed). My dad had a brother and he was doing much better than us and didn't visit granddad as often as us and neither did our cousins. \nMy dad and his brother started arguing when my grandmother died and haven't after 7 years come to an agreement over her belongings even tho' the value of the belongings isn't much and granddad got most of them, it's more about just arguing with each other because my uncle feels like my father was the favorite and he needs to pay back to him everything my dad got from my granddad. \nNow after my granddad passed my father and his brother need decide how they are going to split a house, a lot of money and lots of expensive collectibles. And because my uncle doesn't exactly need the money he will make this a very hard, long and expensive process. All this would't be too expensive because we could just use our granddads money to fund the process but in Finland we have to pay inheritance tax and the tax office want's a cut of the whole value of the inheritance even tho' there might be something other than money. That means you will have to sell or get the money elsewhere if you want keep expensive items like medals or cold coins which might have more emotional value.\nAll this means my father will have to get 80k$ dollars from somewhere just to pay the taxes and maybe someday if these things get solved get something back.\nThis is where i come to play. Because my granddad wanted to give something to his grandchildren, he invested to a life insurance fund so that we get something to help us to get a head start in life when he passes. I didn't know about this until when he passed and i got a letter that informed me that he gave all his 5 grandchildren around 40k$. \nSo one day my father decides to just tell me and my brother his plan on getting himself out of the tax hell he's bout get into. ''You two will loan me 80 000 dollars and i will pay it back to you someday'' I didn't know what to think about this and even though my father is a great person and all i don't want to give him my money and get it maybe paid back during a space of time i don't know. I have decided to tell him i wont give him this loan so does this make me an asshole.",

      "description": "This happened a couple days ago and I feel like I'm NTA but that woman seemed really pissed, and I think this sub can let me know if I was in the wrong.\n\nI routinely bike to the grocery store over the weekend so that I don't have to rely on my parents to get me food/snack items that I want to eat. (I'm a high schooler) Plus, I like biking. \n\nI use a bike lanes for the whole trip, but when it comes to the actual grocery store, I move over to the sidewalk for 2 reasons. First, I don't have to worry about being hit by, or pissing off, a car in the parking lot. Second, I just use it as a route to lock my bike up on one of those bike stands. Now admittedly, it was 100% possible for me to park my bike by coming from the parking lot-road as well, I just didn't. Mostly due to habit and reason #1. So this is when it gets interesting. \n\nA couple, a man and a woman, were walking almost side by side and talking, and effectively cutting off the whole sidewalk so I could not bike past. (I also could not bike on the parking lot road and then come back either by then bc I was blocked by a line of parked cars.) So I politely asked the woman if I could pass. She replied, pretty irritated, \"why are you biking on the sidewalk??\" So I responded, \"because I don't want to get hit by a car\" She then snapped \"you shouldnt be biking on the sidewalk you should be on the street!\" By then, I was tired of this woman who was still admonishing me so as she was talking I just kept biking away and talked over her, saying \"okay, sounds good\". I did not get off the side walk. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA? \n\nTldr: I biked on the sidewalk instead of the parking lot and when a woman irritatedly told me to get off I ignored her, told her \"sounds good\" and continued bipking on the sidewalk.

      "description": "So about a month ago, my father took my Xbox (a Christmas present from my grandparents, whom of which we live with) and took it to a pawn shop to get a loan from it. I didn't know what happened or where it was for two days until I started asking about it. He told me he lent it to a friend to play with for a day and forgot to get it back. Every few days I ask him \"Hey have you gotten my Xbox back?\" And he always says he forgot or makes another excuse. Fast forward a month later, our new car has a function where it reads texts aloud. I'm in the car with my grandfather and it reads a text aloud where my father is asking for $200 to get my Xbox back from the pawn shop. I confront him and ask him why he stole from me and lied to me. He said it wasn't stealing because despite him taking it without my permission, he intended to get it back.\n \nAm I wrong for doing this? I think he stole from me but he says he didn't and it's quite frusturating. I want to believe he stole from me but he's adamant he didn't. What do you guys think?",

      "description": " It was the week in school where we establish in-school businesses to raise funds (which would be donated to a charity). We were in a hit in the first day, (making more money that any other booths).\nThe second day, our facilitating teacher (who's like the one who managed the businesses) called us names (non-English offensive insults that means something like too-expensive-not-worth-it-greedy-name, there isn't an English translation for that that I can recall but it's an insult that if existed, is something people will call Apple Inc. for selling expensive stuff that aren't usually worth your money, just to capitalise). She insulted us in front of many other students, but not really 100% insulted, it sounds friendly-joking 50% of the time. It's true that we're being expensive though.\nAfter that, my classmates who didn't do much for our business started using the half-insults/half-jokes as an excuse to not doing more so our earnings significantly dropped to like 20%. We told her it was because of the insult and she said it's for us to learn and that other students and teachers are actually complaining.\nThird day and it's still the same, with us earning only 10% of what we earned the first day. Afterwards, my teacher decided to message me (I'm the president) apologizing for the problems and congratulating us for doing a good job in two separate long messages. I delivered the message to my classmates and some of them didn't like it. I easily forgave our teacher but many of my classmates didn't. Some of us find the message funny because it wasn't really a big deal and some felt that the messages were insincere, and demands a more public and personal apology. Some also took the insult to empower ourselves. college week ended and I'm really stressed out about that week that I wanna let things go and forgive and forget. Am I the asshole for thinking it wasn't really a big deal anymore and thinking talking to her and demanding a personal apology isn't really a good idea bc she could take it personally and it will heavily affect our grades (based on my past experiences)?

He said that he doesn‚Äôt care what people think and he‚Äôs gonna wear that regardless of the dress code. \n\nMy best friend tried to talk to him, saying that it‚Äôs a formal event so you‚Äôre supposed to dress formal. As well as how i‚Äôd be upset that he‚Äôs the only one not dressed to standard. He told her he didn‚Äôt care I would be upset and that it‚Äôs not my prom. \n\nHe also told her that suits are uncomfortable, she said he would only have to wear it for a short time and he could take it off afterwards. He told her that taking it off somewhere would wrinkle it, so why would he wear one.\n\nHe‚Äôs extremely stubborn and won‚Äôt budge, and at this point i‚Äôm not too sure if i want to go.

      "description": "So I run a pretty successful tech company, and am planning on retiring soon. My younger sister [44F], let's call her Julie, has been hinting for a while she wants to be CEO. But quite honestly, I don't think it's a good idea. \n\nSo, the thing I always make a distinction between is the role of an entrepreneur vs the role of a businessman. My sister and I, if I do say so myself, are good entrepreneurs. We're good at spotting innovations, we're good programmers, and we're good at working with a small team to grow the company as far as you can. \n\nProblem is, Julie is stuck in the entrepreneurial stage. Once your business is decently large, a lot of things change: it becomes less about tech and innovation (at least, hands-on tech and innovation that you personally take part in by cranking out code) and more about management and people skills. The larger it gets, the better of an organizer you need to be. You get the idea. And Julie, although I'll admit is a veritable tech genius, has no organizational or people skills. I've adapted to the businessman role better than she has, but admittedly even I haven't done the best job. Because we both are entrepreneurs at heart, not businessmen. And I'm retiring now, and I need someone to take over the company. Julie obviously wants it, but I mentioned her obvious problems she'll face in the role.\n\nEnter my son, Norman. Norman is basically the closest thing to a natural-born businessman I've met. He's a natural leader, has a natural knack for organizing and dividing work that neither of us do. Plus, since he's gotten into stock trading, I've realized he knows the psychology of people: what innovations are well-recieved, why? What aren't, why? And plus, he's pretty charismatic and disciplined to boot. And although he's not that interested in programming and tech in and of itself, he knows Python and Java and is technically literate. All of these traits are what I'm looking for in a businessman to lead the company. \n\nBut when I told Julie that (after a few years experience), I'm installing him as CEO. She got angry at this and said I was ungrateful for her help. While I can see where she's coming from, I think I'm plenty greatful: she's CTO, she holds the most stock options besides me, etc. And that aside, I think she's being kind of selfish here: she knows she hates managing people and yet still wants to be CEO, even though she knows that's a vital part of management.\n\nSo, aita?",

      "description": "I am a 21yr old trans man. My little sister is 12. \n\nMy sister is a smart, wonderful kid with a lot of natural talent and ambition. She's only a kid and already she wants to grow up to be a /neurosurgeon/ of all things. She's in the archery and art clubs at her school and gets good grades and would probably ride horses if my family weren't so poor. \n\nMy mother had me as a teenager, with a different man than my 4 siblings, who all have the same father that we all kind of consider our dad. He never adopted me formally, so i don't have the same last name as the entire rest of my family. \n\nI think most of why i resent her so much comes from before i recognized myself as a man, when we were the only two girl kids in the family and she was perfect, and blonde, and our dad's first daughter. She got a lot of leniency that i never did. I was punished and screamed and expected to be an adult and provide for my siblings and mother from a very young age constantly while she was rewarded and praised and loved for her flaws, like being spoiled or having sticky fingers/being sneaky. \n\nAll that being said, i dont blame her for our parents' choices, and i would kill and die for her because she is my baby sister, but whenever she talks about all of these wonderful things she's getting to do - i never even got to go to school - it makes my stomach twist. It makes me want to sob and it makes me want to hate her. Just today, my mom talked about how they were \"going\" to send me to the UK to visit my father's parents, but because i moved out at 18, they couldn't, so they're just \"going to have to try again when (sister) turns 18, instead.\" \n\nIt hurt me deeply and i dont know how to make myself feel about it. She's just a little kid, and i know that, and i shouldn't resent her, but i really really do sometimes. ",

      "title": "AITA For Not Forgiving Him",
      "description": "The backstory behind this is he used to be one of my two best friends, but I couldn't look past or forgive him for doing something to one of my girlfriend's best friends. They had broken up and everyone had went on thinking it was her fault, but fast forward a few months and I start talking to the girl as friends because I saw her crying one day. She comes out to me that it wasn't a really good relationship and he would take advantage of how much she loved him. For example, if he wanted to have sex and she said no, he'd get mad at her until she'd finally give in and then after he'd leave, she'd cry herself to sleep a lot. The girl never wanted to tell anyone, especially her mom. He told one of his friends (after we grew distant) what happened and the friend told someone who told another person and a lot of people knew. Many of his friends at the time, who i'll call the art kids all said that he changed or didn't believe that it happened while my friends and I stood by the girl. We had a lot of arguments about the topic, but fast forward a few months and he gets with my gf's other best friend. While dating her, he goes to the mental hospital for depression and a lot of people decided to forgive him, but I couldn't. They are now broken up and I finally feel like I can be friends with all of my gf's best friends again. Like I just didn't understand how everyone including gf's sister called me the asshole for the situation and that I was in the wrong for not forgiving him. I don't get how everyone forgave him so easily and so i still hate him to this day. I really hope that this doesn't make me an asshole.",

      "title": "AITA for Taking my Cat Back and Cutting off my Friend?",
      "description": "Hi, guys! First post. Thanks in advance and I apologize, but this is a long one.\n\nA cat followed me home one night (we'll call her Fluffy). I wandered around the city and he just kept at it so I brought her into my apartment for the night. I took her to the vet and he was not microchipped. I posted flyers for a found cat and even contacted a bunch of cat rescues in the city trying to find her a home. No one called looking for her, and the rescues were all to busy dealing with kittens to worry about a 1-year old moggy. :( I was still getting over losing my dog of 12 years. I didn't want to get attached to another animal again. And so I dropped Fluffy off at the local Humane Society (and cried all the way home). After my sister (overseas) told me about her own horrible experience with that shelter, however, I went back and got Fluffy the very next morning. I treated her for fleas, worms and even got her spayed and vaccinated. Fluffy officially became my cat and I lived with her in my apartment for about 6 months.\n\nWell, I graduated from school after that, and it turned out I needed to move to another very expensive city to seek out an internship in my field. This required moving back in with my father, who had made it very clear that he did not like cats and did not want a cat in his house. I turned to my good friend - we'll call her L - for assistance. L agreed to look after Fluffy until I got back on my feet and was able to take her back. As it turned out, L liked cats and wanted to see if she would enjoy having one of her own before she got one. Perfect!\n\nI paid her for Fluffy's upkeep, and inquired about her regularly. She shared pictures. I only went to visit once since she lived 4 hours away from me. Due to circumstances beyond my control, I unfortunately found and had to leave an internship. She knew all about what was going on with me. The payments continued regardless. But because of the circumstances, this arrangement lasted for a year. During this time, I said that I wanted to take Fluffy and place her with family so that she would be closer to me and not cause L any further inconvenience. L assured me that she \"wasn't going to steal my cat\" and that it was fine. So the agreement continued. I got another internship and after months of convincing, my father agreed to let me keep Fluffy at our house.\n\nI went to visit L and Fluffy. L had gotten herself a kitten a month before. We agreed about when I would come back to get Fluffy and how much I would pay her for her upkeep until then. But as soon as I got back home, L changed her tune.\n\nSuddenly, I became this irresponsible pet owner and terrible, selfish person. She offered to return the money I had paid her over the year she had Fluffy and keep her. Uh... No, that's okay. I don't want my money back, I want my cat. She even tried to bring up my dropping her at the shelter even though that was 6 months before she even knew Fluffy existed. This was especially ridiculous because I had never told her about this. It was none of her business and - to me - it showed that she had been discussing me behind my back. Finally, I told L that I intended to have my cat back and that she had no right to refuse. I hinted that if she did refuse, I would be suing her for Fluffy's return. She agreed to give her back, but if Fluffy \"missed her bonded pair (i.e. the kitten she'd lived with for about a month) or her human (i.e. L)\" after a month or two, I was to return her. She was behaving like such a nut that I agreed just to get Fluffy back. Once she was back, I blocked L across all of my social media accounts. L even tried to contact me through a mutual friend, and I had to block them too.\n\nFluffy has been back with me for about 3 months. She eats well, sleeps on my bed at night and we have generally fallen back into our old routine. This happened immediately. Heck, when I came to pick her up from L's house, she got into the crate and laid down. No fuss whatsoever, so I know she isn't traumatized or anything.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I am glad I have my cat back and I don't feel bad at all. But I am still curious to know what an objective observer thinks. AITA in this situation?",

      "description": "This happened a while back during boys night, where pretty much all of the boys just hangout and have a great time. Anyway, for this particular boys night, we decided to hit up the state fair. So we took two cars there, I drove one, and my friend (let‚Äôs call him will, not the friend in question) drove another car. In total there were 8 guys, four in my car, four in will‚Äôs car, simple, and comfortable seating. We get there and I‚Äôm having a blast with all my buds, losing games and eating fucked up food, but I couldn‚Äôt help but notice Tim (guy in question) was mooching just a bit much, like a solid 30 dollars mooched from me, will and a couple of others,each! I remember the most fucked thing he did was ask will to get him a turkey leg 8$, took one bite of it, then handed it to me, I didn‚Äôt want it, so he tossed in the trash. Around 2 hours into the fair, I notice my keys are gone, and I freak, because we are far from home, and if I lose my keys, we‚Äôre fucked. I search around, and also notice Tim and will are missing. Tim eventually calls me and says we all need to go (sounds high), I ask where he is and if he knows about my keys, and he replies stupidly he‚Äôs at will‚Äôa car with my keys. I get a little mad because that meant he sneakily took my keys out of my bag, and just left. He goes on and says he needed to go early so he can get to a party, I say ‚Äúfuck no you‚Äôre not, I need my keys.‚Äù He says he is gonna leave anyway, and so we send two people to go get my keys because they didn‚Äôt want to go on a ride. After a bit, they call me and say Tim gave them my keys, and he left. I leave the fair and take a full car load of people home. I‚Äôve stopped talking to him, and ignore any messages he sends, so he has been calling me an asshole, saying that I owed him because he introduced me to that devils lettuce, but I felt it was justified.

      "description": "First post, also on mobile. I'm sure I'm going to mess all kinds of formatting up.\n\nWe are both 22, been living together for about 3 years now. Met in high school, but didnt start dating until we were adults. I should add this was/is our first \"serious\" relationship since high school.Throughout this time he's always been a little insecure about his place in the relationship (he considers me out of his league, which is utter BS) and this has translated to him being very nosey about where I'm going, what I'm doing and who I'm doing it with, who I'm texting etc. He's never demanding and it could be taken as a joke if he didn't ask every single time that my phone buzzes. \nAlso, I can't go anywhere without him asking/ demanding to tag along. We have spent almost every waking moment in the last 3 years together, interrupted only by work and the occasional extracurricular obligation. I have tried telling him I need some space here and there that isnt me going to work but he sees that as me \"pulling away from him.\" If he wants to go to the store, he asks me to go too. Even down to the corner shop literally 30 seconds away, I have to go else he won't.\n It's getting exhausting but his arguement is it's normal for people in a relationship to go everywhere together. I don't know about y'all, but this was not how I was raised. I feel more like a third parent than a boyfriend sometimes. This is in addition to a bunch of other \"quirks\" he has (has to have a goodbye kiss in public, always wanting PDA, needing to be right on me when sleeping etc) and I'm getting to the end of my rope with it. All of this to me was classic \"clingy boyfriend\" material, but seeing as this is the only serious relationship I've been in I wasnt sure. Am I the asshole for thinking he's being clingy, or did I miss something very important in relationship training?",

      "description": "As the title says , I refused to go to an English competition just to stay with my grandma , and here is why :\n\nI was raised by my grandma and my aunt , and my cousin was like my brother . Sometime later my cousin left to get  a job out of my country and my aunt left for the same thing , but in a different city.\n\nGrandma took care of me every day , there wasn't a without her asking if I'm fine or if I'm hungry , etc.\n\nNow I'm in highschool and I love English a lot since I basically use it everyday . I got into a normal highschool but my English teacher is my best friend's mom ( that doesn't mean I get good grades just 'cause I'm friends with her son ) . In the 2nd semester ( started in february , I don't know if it's different in other countries , Romania BTW. ) I had a competition/contest which was easier than the exercises I did in class ( this contest was last Sunday , 24th of Februray ) . The day before the contest , at around 23:00 my grandma felt really bad , as in ill . I gave her some water and her usual pills ( she has heart problems ) and waited a bit to see if she would get better . She didn't . I called an ambulance and thankfully it arrived really fast because I live about 2 minutes away from the county's hospital . I didn't close an eye all night because I didn't something bad to happen without me knowing about it .  The contest was at 09:00 and we had to be there at 08:30 . I was really tired and in no shape to go to a contest which required me to use my brain . So I messaged my English teacher saying that I won't be able to come because I have to take care of my grandma . She didn't bother answering my message . Today I had English class and she started to rant about the fact that I didn't come and she said one thing that made me almost lose my mind : she wouldn't take me to any contests anymore because I'm not \"serious\". And everytime I would raise my hand and answer a question she would start saying stuff like \"if only you did this yesterday\" . My classmates started asking me after class what was her problem , what did I do to upset her . I explained everything and they didn't seem to be listening , so I just stopped . But one classmate who is in the same situation as I am , listened to the whole thing , which made me happy a bit .\n\nMy grandma is better now but still there is a chance that this will happen again .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL&amp;DR: Couldn't go to an English contest because my grandma felt ill , English teacher gets pissed and makes fun of me in class.",

      "description": "My partner of 5 years just received an invite to the wedding of my ex-boss. We both started to work for this man at the same time, I'll call him Dean. During my employment, it was my job to run the food side of Dean's business. This was the first time Dean had owned his own business, and although both my partner and I have worked within the industry for a while, Dean refused to listen to our advice. Fair enough, it was his business not ours.\n\nThere were a lot of limitations, and Dean pushed me to create a menu that wasn't possible to pull off within the restrictions of the kitchen (no ventilation systems, so it was against regulations to deep fry or cook with a lot of oil etc). This resulted in Dean getting quite aggravated. \n\nThis aggravation accumulated in him sitting me down for a 'meeting' and accusing me of wasting his money on purpose. We had a heated debate about the importance of costing the dishes and buying in bulk to lower the cost of the items, but he couldn't understand why I was buying 180 eggs in a box for $0.10 each when we could go across the street and buy 12 for $0.22 each. In his mind my way was more expensive.\n\nI left swiftly after I caught him searching my belongings without my consent accusing me of stealing from his business.\n\nNow, my partner still works for him, although coming close to leaving herself a few times. Only her and one other member of staff got the invite to his wedding, so now she feels obligated to go (although she doesn't want to). She suffers from anxiety quite bad and doesn't want to be by herself. I told her she doesn't have to go, but she thinks she does as the invites were specific. I was included in the invite, to which I immediately said no, I don't want to be within his company, as he still tells members of staff I was stealing from him. \n\n(funny fact, all his staff are girls now, quite young too. He says he doesn't hire men as they steal and he has bad experiences with them).\n\nShe's quite upset, and by the sounds of it, angry that I said I wouldn't go, stating that she has gone against her anxiety to attend events with me that have made her uncomfortable just to make me at ease during them. \nAITA reddit?",

      "description": "I took my wife and teenage son out to an Applebee's today. There were two young women, late teens or early twenties, seated at a table near us. The whole time they were being loud, obnoxious and making crude jokes. Really low brow toilet humor. I don't feel comfortable repeating this trash talk, but just to give you an idea: One of the girls said there was a lot of meat in whatever she was eating and the other one quips that there was a lot of meat in her pants; One asked the other where she would like to go after they finished their meal and she suggested they go to the theater to, verbatim, \"dick around with [their] dicks\"; At one point, they were making inappropriate banter with a male waiter about the name of a cocktail, I didn't catch all of it and then when he walked away, one of them said to the other that she had \"large dick energy\"(?) for so brazenly talking to the waiter in that manner. \n\nBy that point, I had had enough. It's a family establishment, I was there with my young son, and their behavior was inappropriate. They were ruining our meal, so I confronted them. I told them they were being immature and that kind of talk had no place around children. They laughed like I had said something funny and one of them, loudly, questioned who's dad I was. I didn't want them making a scene and it was clear they were inebriated, so my parting words to them were if they're old enough to drink, they're more than old enough to know how to behave in public. I returned to my seat and they left soon after. \n\nWhen we got home, my wife told me I was an ass for what I did and that our son probably makes worse jokes with his friend and they were just two gals having harmless fun. I don't agree with any of that and need Reddit to settle the score: was I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for choosing a guy over my best friend of four years",
      "description": "This is a long story, so bear with me as this unfolds. \n\nFor four years, I've been extremely close friends with this girl who I'll call M. She's always been very intense and opinionated, but that side of her never reared an ugly head until a few months ago. Recently, I became friends with a guy. I'd kind of known him for three years, but never talked to him until now. (He'll be called B.) He's a really chill guy. I trust him a lot, we've become really good friends, and I've developed crush-like feelings for him. All of my friends were supportive of this at first. (We even combined our friend groups and started hanging out together as one large unit.) That is, until a few months ago when M started saying he's a horrible person out of nowhere. \n\nI asked her why multiple times in a group chat where she first said this, then I confronted her privately. She just claimed he \"gives her bad vibes\". I tried to get her to elaborate on this, but she didn't. I let it be until she kept saying he was a bad person. I confronted her again on the issue; she said she was friends with his ex-girlfriend and their relationship ended messily. Of course, I already knew about this situation from B himself, but I asked her if he did anything to his ex, and she didn't answer. However, she wouldn't stop her claims that he was a bad person.\n\nA few weeks pass, and B cancels a date we were supposed to go on because he wanted to be there for a mutual friend having a rough time. M asked me about it, so I explained the situation to her. She flipped out, said that was rude and that I was being strung along. I told her I didn't care that he canceled, that I wanted B to help out our friend if that's what he thought was best. She claims once again that he's a bad person and he makes her uncomfortable. When I pressed her about it, she talks about the ex-girlfriend again, but just reaffirms that they had a messy breakup. Then, she says that I have to choose who's more important in my life--him or her--because he makes her uncomfortable. I say that I'm sorry she's uncomfortable around him, but I don't want to choose. She stops talking to me for the night. \n\nThen, I get a message from one of our mutual friends, R. R tells me that M ranted to him about the whole situation and said that she doesn't want to be friends with me. I freaked out. She and I had been fighting a lot (specifically about B), but I obviously still loved her. To hear she'd be talking behind my back hurt me more than what she said to my face. \n\nThe next day, I confronted her and said I shouldn't be forced to choose. She retaliated, saying I should've been more observant and known she was hurting from this. (Yes, she told me he \"gave her bad vibes\", but she also said she was happy because I was happy being friends with him. I know I should've checked in with her more on this, but I also feel like she should've communicated this better with me.) Then, she said I was friends with B because he \"shared traits\" with a family member who sexually abused me.  1. To my knowledge, B has never assaulted anyone. I encouraged M to tell me if he has, because I wouldn't want to be associated with him if he had. She didn't answer any of the times I asked her. 2. She doesn't know the family member in question, so she couldn't possibly know if they were anything alike otherwise. When I called her out for this, she said she was sorry I was upset, but not for what she said. After telling her how I was hurt over everything she's done (+other personal things in my life at the moment), she apologized for real.\n\nI know this is stupid, but I honestly forgave her for a while. We were mostly friends again after this incident. We still fought, but we both excused it as a thing that all best friends do. This went on for a few weeks until I got sick of her continuing to talk shit about B \\*and\\* me to friends and to my face. I finally texted her to end it all. She accepted it, and we didn't talk again for a month. \n\nA few days ago, I heard M was telling people secrets about me from the friend from before, R. I calmly texted her and asked her if it was true. She said yes, so I told her I wasn't happy about it. She claimed I was trying to text her again to pick a fight. At that point, I just stepped away and thanked her for answering my question. Today, she texted R asking him about what he told me. In their conversation, she said she had never been happier breaking off a relationship, that I guilt-tripped her into being friends again, that she never really wanted to be friends with me after that point anyway, that B was manipulating me, and that she never wanted to talk to me again. Keep in mind that she never communicated any of this to me. \n\nGranted, I was never the greatest friend in the last months of us talking. As she said, I should've been more observant. Often I ranted too much about my own issues, and I was probably an emotional burden in some way. However, I also listened to her when she ranted, even when she ranted about B to my face. I should've been more attentive, but she should've communicated her frustrations before they hit a boiling point. I don't hate her by any means. She was a very important person in my life, and I'll always reminisce about the good times we had, but the way she handled this, I feel, was unreasonable. \n\nKeep in mind that there are lots of details to this story, but I'd feel petty for including those, because they paint her in more of a bad light than not. This account is definitely biased in some way, but I tried to give her (both in real life and in this post) as much benefit of the doubt as possible. I just want closure now. \n\ntl;dr my close friend of four years was uncomfortable I was friends with someone she didn't like, so after months of putting up with her bullshit, I dumped her. ",

My natural instinct is to run towards the issue, so I instantly just started running towards the person running away. A few minutes later I caught them, shouldered them into a building and they fell. I held them down and called the police. I called my girlfriend right after and told her where I was, then she met up with me while I was waiting for the cop with tears going down her face. She said she was terrified for herself and for me, and her being scared makes me feel pretty awful too. \n\nShe said she loves me but she doesn‚Äôt know if she can stay with me if I continue to do this because she can‚Äôt ‚Äúhave her child be fatherless because he got himself killed‚Äù.

      "title": "AITA for declining dessert?",
      "description": "This happened awhile back, but it gets brought up in conversation among my friends whenever dessert gets mentioned, so I thought I would get some input on it.\n\nI (20'sM) had been dating my then girlfriend (20's) for a few months and visited her family who lived about 3 hours away with her. The last night that I was there, we visited her grandparents who cooked dinner. Everything seemed to be going fine, and I got along with them well. As the evening was winding down, her grandmother asked who wanted dessert - peach cobbler. It's not something that I enjoy eating, so I declined my portion (I think I said something like \"No thanks, I'm fine.\"). I also had to be back home for a doctor's appointment the next morning, so I had to leave soon after to make the 3 hour car ride back (My girlfriend stayed a few more days.). I thanked everyone for dinner and the hospitality and headed out after about half an hour and didn't hear any complaints about my behavior when I asked how things went other than her family mentioning that I was relatively quiet. \n\nFast forward 6 months. I had seen her grandparents once since then when they visited our town, and everyone was cordial. My girlfriend had just recently moved back to her home town due to her health/career, and I visited over a long weekend. While I was there, my girlfriend received a phone call from her mother saying that we would be having dinner with her grandparents again, which I was fine with since her grandmother seemed like a good cook. However, her grandmother was irritated and took offense that I did not have dessert the previous time, so I was expected to apologize for that and had to accept dessert on this occasion.\n\nI didn't know how to react to this information when my girlfriend got off of the phone. I thought it was a joke at first. When I realized that it wasn't, I got even more confused. Nobody had told me ahead of our first dinner that I should never decline dessert, and the first time it's been mentioned since is now 6 months later. I had visited with her grandmother since then, and she made no indication that she was bothered by it. When I told my girlfriend how I think it's ridiculous to be offended by someone's taste in food, she told me it's easier for her (and thus easier for me) to just bite the bullet and apologize.\n\nWe went over for dinner that evening, and I did apologize for not having dessert the previous time and that I didn't want the grandma to think I didn't like her cooking (I had seconds of the main dish and dessert this time - as I mentioned, she is a good cook.). I think it was evident by my expression and the way I said things that I was sincere in not wanting to have offended her but that I also thought that the whole ordeal was absolutely silly. \n\nAm I an asshole here for not accepting dessert? Is it something that someone should have to apologize for?",

      "description": "Earlier today I had a doctor's appointment to talk about changing my birth control. I have been on the shot since my mom forced me to start it when I was 15. I'm now 19, and it's time to change because you aren't really supposed to be on it for more than two years because it may increase the risk of osteoporosis. \n\nAfter talking over the options I have to switch to, I decided on a hormonal IUD (for those that don't know, it's a device that goes into the uterus and releases hormones to prevent pregnancy, and lasts 5 years.). The doctor explained how it works, how it's implanted, all that fun stuff. And then she asked \"Does your mom know you're doing this?\". I said \"No, why would she?\". She said \"Well sometimes mom's have different opinions about these things and it's important to consult them.\". \n\nSo I was like wtf??? And said \"well my reproductive choices aren't really any of my mom's business, considering I'm an adult and it's my body.\" And the doctor rolled her eyes at me. \n\nAITA? Was that too rude? \n\nFor context, about a year ago I had a similar appointment to talk about birth control options (same doctor), and my mom came with me to that one. I let her come back into the room with me because I didn't think it was a big deal, but as soon as the doctor came in and started asking me questions, my mom was constantly interrupting and talking over me. I finally asked her to leave after the doctor asked if I had any side effects and my mom said \"yeah she got fat\". Even after I asked her to leave, the doctor tried to argue with me and say it was okay for her to stay because \"bUt sHes yOuR mOm\", until I reminded her that I am an adult and have a right to medical privacy. Then after my mom left, she (the doctor) lectured me about how she's my mom and knows best, when I was just trying to get the appointment over with at that point. So my mom is kind of a sore spot, especially with this particular doctor, but was I too much of an asshole today?",

      "description": "So I‚Äôm going to keep this one short and sweet, because right now it‚Äôs really late, I need to be up for work in the morning, and my brain is currently fried due to the days events. I‚Äôm also going to skimp on a few specific details because of the filters for certain topics within the subreddit. Hopefully my ramblings will leave enough to piece together.\n\n\nRecently about mid last week, a friend of mine who I‚Äôve gotten to know really well over the last little while was in a really bad place and took some medication of which I‚Äôm unsure the exact nature of. She woke up some time later, threw up the most of the contents of her stomach, got something to eat, drink, and told me all about it. After the initial, obvious freak out, and some talking about it, and trying to convince her she SHOULDN‚ÄôT be going on a raging drinking frenzy when the weekend arrived (all attempts at which she completely blew off), I had gone to bed for the night.\n\nWaking up the next morning, I decided to check in on her, only to find out that almost immediately after I had left (approximately 6 hours after waking up from the attempt) she was getting drunk and playing video games like nothing had even happened. When I tried to bring this up, she brushed me off again, and went about ignoring me as she went back to her game. This put me in a slump. Due to distance the only thing I can do to try and help her was talk to her, but she wouldn‚Äôt listen. \n\nOver the course of the week she would try to contact me several times, but with my slump, I was reluctant to say much more than I absolutely had to. Picking up on this, she took her opportunity to slip out of the conversations. This of course made me feel even worse.  Fast forward to today, and after a few less than pleasant things uttered back and forth, I exploded. I‚Äôve just spent the last hour and a half yelling at her, telling her she can‚Äôt expect her friends to just not care  if she happened to *‚Äôdisappear‚Äô* the next day, while she seems to care genuinely for her own friends. A lot of stuff got said which I‚Äôll leave out for brevity. \n\nThis whole thing came to a head when I cursed her out for not taking proper care of herself, without thinking how it affects us. This actually made her speechless. But what got her was reminding her that she ‚Äúnever wanted to hurt anybody‚Äù, but went ahead with the intent of taking her own life, not grasping the fact that when she was gone, we would all miss her, wether she wanted us to or not.\n\nThis caused her to break down, she just began to cry and apologize until myself and another friend managed to calm her down. For the most part, despite feeling genuinely horrible about what I did, I feel like it was the right thing to do. \nIn the end, I think I finally got to her, and managed to hopefully have a lasting effect, if not a permanent one on how she values her own life. \n\nSo help me out here, guys and girls, because I really want to know what you think. Am I the asshole?",

My son was born September 2018. I get one year of maternity leave so I would have to go back August 2019.\n\nI have been saving money and plan to save my tax return to take an extra month off so I don't have to go back until after my son's first birthday.\n\nHowever, I do not want to return to that job. It was highly stressful (I would come home crying some days), it was highly demanding (I'd be running back to the office after I'd gotten home to do something), and I think the owner is a huge jagweed. And honestly, I don't think I was even qualified for the job I had but got it because the other lady left and I was the most trained in her job. Also, the lady doing my job while I'm away is a whole new level of incompetent and I didn't want to clean up her mess. \n\nI did make good money in the job, about $65,000/year. But I told my husband I didn't want to go back. I told him I'd rather start looking for a new job starting in July and I'd hope to find something new. I also said if worst comes to worst I'd go back to my old job but I'd keep looking for a new job because I didn't want to work there anymore. But realistically I'd like to not go back at all. He told me that that's just the way it worked around this area and I needed to suck it up because it's good money.\n\nSo WIBTA for not going back to a good paying job and possibly finding something that didn't pay as well.

      "description": "So let me start this off by saying I‚Äôm NOT a lazy person, I grew up in a low income family and have always worked as hard as I can at any job I find myself doing. \n\nThat being said. \n\nThree weeks ago I started a job in a dog daycare as a dog handler. I got this job because the owner of the business is a family friend and she knew I‚Äôd been looking for a second job for quite awhile. When I started the job I received barely any training, despite the fact I‚Äôd never worked with dogs in a pack setting (they knew this and were perfectly fine with it, they said they would give me all the training I need). \nI was told I‚Äôd only be working 15 hours a week, this was a dealbreaker for me since it‚Äôs my second job and I need time for my other job- this past week I worked 28 hours. Apart from that the job is very very stressful to the point where during some shifts I find myself going into the bathroom and bust out crying. On a normal day we can get around 50 dogs- it‚Äôs just me in a room with them and with that number of dogs theres constant fighting (which I was never trained on how to break up a fight). \nI feel so disappointed in myself that I‚Äôm considering quitting so quickly. I‚Äôm afraid that quitting will strain my families relationship with the owner. I also don‚Äôt want to quit because I know it won‚Äôt look good on a resume, and my other job is in a field that is overlooked. \nAny and all feedback would be appreciated!\n\nTl;dr: I can‚Äôt stand my new job but I‚Äôm afraid of quitting over something that isn‚Äôt worth quitting over.

      "description": "I‚Äôll try and leave a tldr at the bottom cause this may be long. \n\n\nSo my girlfriend (18f) and I (17m) are having a bit of a disagreement and I‚Äôm hoping Y'all can give us a different viewpoint, cause I think we are both being assholes in a way. \n\nAs a start, I dislike pictures, it stems from many things but at the base, it‚Äôs me being taken out of the moment and just not liking how I look. I never understood why people would use that phrase, but now that I‚Äôve felt it, the idea of pictures makes me get this sense of dread. On the opposite spectrum, my girl loves taking pictures. Her dads a photographer, she‚Äôs one of those super Instagramy people, and she just enjoys it all around. With that, I do try to take pictures with her, I rarely actually turn it down, but this time I feel it‚Äôs different...\n\nOne of her close friends wants to be a photographer and does couple photography sessions, and right now she is doing a Valentine‚Äôs Day sale where it‚Äôs 50$ for a session. Now I work in fast food and try to save money where I can while still enjoying life. She doesn‚Äôt have a job but will do some dog sitting when a neighbor goes on vacation, though that is obviously that‚Äôs quite rare, in turn, I‚Äôll usually pay for food or any activity we do. \n\nShe sees this sale and starts saying we should do it, I‚Äôm immediately put off by the idea because just taking pictures every now and then when out and about makes me uncomfortable, makings some of the time we actually get to see each other devoted to something I heavily dislike, obviously doesn‚Äôt sound appealing. \n\n\nSo we talk a little and its back and forth, her wanting too, and me not wanting too. She asks if it‚Äôd be better if she pays for half, I don‚Äôt really see that as helpful cause I still have to devote my time and money to something I don‚Äôt see as holding a lot of worth. So I recommenced either her father, or my brother (also a photographer we know a lot of them) could take them, cause her dad has offered, and my brother has brought it up before, but she said that would be more awkward. While I still wouldn‚Äôt necessarily enjoy it, it would (in my eyes) be more of a middle ground seeing as that would make her happy with pictures, and me happy on expenses. \n \nTldr: GF wants to take a 50$ photography session, I don‚Äôt like pictures and would rather save money. Both trying to find a middle ground, she wants to split the price, id rather take the photos with a family member for free.\n",

      "description": "Last week, I came back from the gym intending to take a shower, as I smelled pretty bad. My roommate had his friend in the room, let‚Äôs call her J, and they were working on history homework. I made it apparent to my roommate that I intended to take a shower, something along the lines of ‚ÄúI smell pretty bad, can‚Äôt wait to be clean again,‚Äù and no one in the room seemed to have any issue. J barely looked at me, so I assumed that she‚Äôd heard me and had no issue with the situation. \n\nNow, me and my roommate own a projector. We have a white sheet hanging from our ceiling, which we both typically change behind when the other is in the room. (Neither of us really care to see the other naked) \n\nAfter I got back from the shower, I milled about the room in my towel, picking up pants, underwear, and a t shirt as I went, and then went behind the curtain to change into my clothes. When I came back out, I noticed J staring at me a bit oddly for the remainder of her time in the room, though she said nothing to me personally. She left about a half hour later.\n\nFast forward to the next morning, J texts my roommate and tells him how uncomfortable I made her by changing in the room while she was there. I texted J myself and informed her that it was my room, and she had not been mandated to stay while I was changing. I also told her that I was respectful enough to go behind the projector curtain, which is almost completely opaque, even with all the lights in room on, so there was no way she‚Äôd seen (any part of) me in the first place. She ended up complaining further to my roommate and told me how disgusting I‚Äôd acted.\n\nMy roomate has been pretty neutral in all this, though he‚Äôs made it clear to me that I was in the right, having announced my intention to shower well before I actually had. I‚Äôve started to feel weird about what happened, so AITA?",

      "description": "I met my friend‚Äôs roomate, Luke, at the bar several months before I met my friend, Liz. Luke was a bartender and I slowly became a regular. Before I met Liz, Luke and I were not particularly close but he did flirt with me quite a bit and we had a lot of interesting conversations. I assumed Luke was flirting simply as a part of his job, and not due to any genuine interest. \n\nOne day, Liz comes into the bar. We meet and develop a pretty good friendship over the course of several months, despite the age difference between us. I even end up spending the holiday season with Liz and her family. \n\nThe more I get to know Liz, the more I get to know Luke as well. A lot of our conversations become pretty sexually charged. We often talk about sleeping together, and it‚Äôs pretty clear to both of us that this is something that will happen, it‚Äôs just a matter of when. \n\nOne night. Luke is ending his shift. He asks me if I‚Äôd like to grab a drink at another bar. Usually Liz comes and picks him up from work since he doesn‚Äôt drive. Luke tells Liz that I will drop him off at home after we go to the bar. He asks Liz if it‚Äôs okay if he invites me to come over. She says she really doesn‚Äôt want any company tonight. So I invite Luke over to my apartment to hang out instead. We end up sleeping together and falling asleep. \n\nI wake up the next morning to a couple of texts from Liz. She is freaking out asking me if I know what happened to Luke because he didn‚Äôt come home last night. I text her and profusely apologize. I tell her that we went back to my place. And that we‚Äôd fallen asleep before she had texted. \n\nLiz is furious. She accuses me of taking advantage of Luke. She tells me that Luke is a very sick man (depression, alcoholism, previous drug addiction etc) and that I‚Äôm a terrible person for putting Luke in a position where he was forced to come home with me. She tells me that she‚Äôs lost all trust in me, that our friendship is over. \n\nI show Luke the texts and he shrugs them off. He says Liz is just overprotective of him and she‚Äôll get over it soon. He also warns me not to tell her that we slept together or else she‚Äôll really go ballistic. He explains that Liz is a bit codependent on him and doesn‚Äôt like the idea of him sleeping with people, especially people she knows. This is not something I was aware of before we had sex. \n\nA few weeks go by. I‚Äôve tried apologizing a couple times but Liz won‚Äôt respond. \n\nFor the first time since the incident, after some goading by Luke, I come back to the bar. When I see Liz she gives me the cold shoulder and it‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs still upset. \n\nAITA? \n",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together roughly nine years, and lived together for about half that time. We're both working adults who live in an area with few public transportation options and where you need to be able to drive to get just about anywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend does not drive or have a license. This has been an entirely different complicated issue. Basically he has a phobia of it, and he also can't afford to pay insurance on a car anyway. As it is, we have one car, which only I can drive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to driving to different work locations over the years, we've had a lot of arguments. I've asked him to take the train when he can to where I can easily pick him up, but he doesn't like paying for the train.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's told me before that he can pay me directly instead for the gas for driving him, but when we've talked about this 1) he only wants to pay an amount that wouldn't even begin to cover extra gas expenses for picking him up directly from work, and 2) even after we agreed to an amount, I can think of maybe one time he's ever paid me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd my main issue with this isn't even the gas, it's the time. When I get off work, I want to go home and relax, or have time to go get dinner for the week or basically any other activities that go into running an apartment. Because he doesn't drive, I feel like he doesn't understand how much extra time it takes to get off the freeway during rush hour, then try to get back on the freeway during rush hour. \t\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt blew up into a big argument last week. I will fully admit I was being a bit passive aggressive, we were sitting in traffic trying to get back on the freeway and I was visibly in a bad mood, he kept asking what was wrong and I kept saying nothing because I really didn't want to get into another argument about this. Finally I just told him and the argument started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn that argument and in most arguments we've had about this, he basically says he thinks it's better to pay me directly than buy the train ticket (which, again, he's done maybe once, and the amount he wants to give is practically nothing), he doesn't want to be left sitting at the train station when it's dark (in the past when he would use the train station I was sometimes late picking him up, but this was when I worked a job that was completely in the opposite directly of the train station, meaning it would be difficult for me to gauge how long it would take to drive the extra way), and the biggest thing, which is how when his parents were our age they apparently did this commuting stuff and it wasn't a big deal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last part is was typically gets to me because I do feel guilty that I'm being a poor partner by being upset about this. I feel like I'm supposed to just be ok with doing this as a self sacrificial thing but I'm not, and I feel like I'm just selfish and immature. Due to fun childhood trauma it's hard for me to figure out the right balance of standing up for myself and being selfless to help others. I'm vigilant about not letting people walk over me as an adult, but I worry it just makes me go to the other extreme as a selfish prick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is why it's hard for me to bring this stuff up to him, because I feel like I shouldn't be feeling that way, and when I have brought it up he gets annoyed at me. I don't want to think my boyfriend's taking advantage of me, but then that part of me that's afraid of being taken advantage of fires up with things like this, then the other part of me that doesn't want to be an asshole fires up, and just the usual dumb shit that happens to a trauma brain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the argument we had last week, I mainly focused on his point of being left at the train station, and I just kept saying over and over again that I was sorry about that, the reason why was because it was out of my way so it was hard to figure out how much time I needed to get over there, but since the route to my current job and home passes right through the train station, I can literally just sit at the train station until his train gets there (since his train usually gets there a little after I would arrive). He still kept harping on it because he somehow expected me to drive past the train station all the way home after work, then leave home late to pick him up, which just spiraled into me arguing how that didn't make any sense...which it really didn't since the whole point of this was to save time and gas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually the argument finished with him saying he would start taking the train, almost acting like he would have done this anyway if I'd just asked him. Then the next day he said he would only take the train to the station on Mondays since I have a thing to get to right after work on that day. And at this point, again, didn't want another argument, so I just accepted this even though this was not something I wanted to compromise on in this way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the one hand, I feel like he's just refusing to be accommodating at all. On the other, I feel like I'm being too demanding. I know he has budgeting issues, but I also think I pay a hell of a lot more for gas than he would for the train. This feels like another part of all this bitterness I think I have over him telling me for years he was going to get his license and never actually doing it. I understand he doesn't want to have to pay for car insurance on top of everything else, but I keep telling him he should at least get a license in case I break my fucking legs. And at this point I'd be fine if he told me he never wanted to drive ever in his life, I just hate him constantly telling me that he's going to do something that he never does. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Boyfriend doesn't want to go to the train station from work so I can pick him up easier on the way home after my work, I really can't tell if I'm asking too much.

      "description": "  \n\nSorry it‚Äôs long, I needed a rant!\n\nA long back story to start: My partner and I have been together for around 3 years. We are both girls and we met at my old job where we worked together. Our friend still works with my partner at my old company and is also female and is a lesbian too. My girlfriend will be called GF and friend will be called Kelly (not her real name).\n\nI have known Kelly for more than 5 years. We have always got on and we have hung out a few times but mainly it‚Äôs because we both drank in the same pub and everyone would just talk to everyone else. Other than that, we would talk and have a laugh together at work.\n\nIn the first two years I knew her she has never given me anything on valentine‚Äôs day (relevant later). There has never been anything between us so it wouldn‚Äôt have even crossed my mind that I would receive anything for V day.\n\nFast forward to me meeting GF. We kept our relationship a secret due to working at the same place and I didn‚Äôt want to deal with questions. She began talking to Kelly because I talked to her a lot and they became friends too. The three of us would often sit and talk and laugh at lunch but Kelly didn‚Äôt know we were together. It soon became apparent that Kelly had feelings for my GF. Kelly is the type of person who falls in love with any girl that crosses her path and it was a running joke between us that she was in love with a different person each month. I was a little jealous but kept my mouth shut because as far as Kelly was aware my GF was single. \n\nQueue my first valentine‚Äôs day with GF (2017), we both got to work, and Kelly gave us some heart shaped chocolates each. I thought it was strange because she‚Äôd never given me anything for V day before but it was chocolate so I shovelled then down quite happily and thought no more of it.\n\nI went to tell Kelly numerous times that GF and I were a couple but kept losing my nerve until I blurted it out after copious amounts of alcohol a month or two after V day. I don‚Äôt think it would have been a problem telling her if she didn‚Äôt have feelings for GF. \n\nFast forward to V day 2018, I had a new job and therefore I don‚Äôt see Kelly a lot. We talk now and then but she got a new group of friends who think it‚Äôs cool to do coke every weekend and it‚Äôs not my thing so I barely see her. She now works in the same office as GF and they are still friends. I have no issue with them being friends, but Kelly gave my GF a rose and some chocolates for V day. I got a bit miffed because Kelly now knows we are in a relationship and this whole thing of her giving friends a gift for V day didn‚Äôt start until my GF was on the scene. She only gave GF a gift and no one else this year.\n\nFast forward to today. GF goes into work and Kelly gives her a card signed ‚Äòlove from your work wife‚Äô, 6 roses and some heart shaped chocolate. So now I‚Äôm pissed because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate. For me, Valentines day should be between my GF and I because we are in a relationship and the gifts from Kelly seem to be getting bigger.\n\nMy GF knows I‚Äôm mad because I told her that I think it‚Äôs gone too far. She now feels awkward about the gifts but she‚Äôs too nice to say anything to Kelly because she doesn‚Äôt like upsetting anyone.\n\nJust to add, there is no way at all that anything is going on between them. I have complete faith in my gf that she sees Kelly as no more than a friend and I‚Äôm not worried that anything will ever happen.\n\nI was due to pick up some flowers for my GF on the way home from work but now I can‚Äôt be bothered and I‚Äôm ready to put the card that I‚Äôve got her in the bin because today doesn‚Äôt seem special to me anymore. I can‚Äôt be bothered with today. I know she likes V day but I had planned the card and flowers but I‚Äôm just giving her the same things that she has already been given (minus the chocolate). \n\nI want to text Kelly and say that I don't think it's appropriate to give my GF gifts like that but I am turning to you guys to see if i'm i'm over reacting. \n\nAITA for not wanting to give my GF anything and just wanting to skip over Valentines because of this? Or AITA for over reacting to the gifts?",

      "description": "I'm in the car with BF who has kindly offered to drop my at the metro and realize I have a missed call from a traveling friend.  I say something like 'just a sec',turn off the music, and dial my friend.  She let's me know she has arrived and is setting things up for my arrival later, asks about things I might want, and warns me about the weather at her location.  \n\nI answer her questions and thank her for reaching out--my BF turns the music back on while I'm on the phone.  I hang up and ask him why he did that.  He notes that it was turned down, and I let him know that I think that was rude.  To be clear, every single time he or anyone else takes a call in my car, I turn off the music and turn it on once they are off the phone.  This call lasted 5 mins and 4 seconds.   We argue about whether his behavior was rude and he tells me he is \"not an Uber.\"  What? So I have to be paying you to expect the same courtesy I extend? \n\nHe notes that I should've waited to call my friend.  And I decide this argument is stupid.  Do I need to justify returning a friend's missed call? \n\nHe drops me off at the metro. We don't exchange goodbyes.  \n\nI text him.  And things go nuts: \n\nMe: You turning the music on made me feel like my conversation didn't deserve the same respect I have always given you.  And the throw away at the end about me calling xxxx later didn't sit well.  I called her back because I missed her call and had no clue what was up/could be wrong. \n\nHim: \n1/2 Just cuz someone called you, doesn't mean it's an emergency. That was rude--does she take precedence over me? Message received. We disagree--i believe tu2/2 rning your music down enough so the other person can hear the person they're talking to is good enough. You don't agree--I'm sorry. \n\nMe: It doesn't mean it's an emergency but it could have been, I didn't know hence the quickly returned call No one says she takes precedence over you.  She did not text. I had literally no clue why she called The best way to be sure was to call, which is exactly why I called \n\nHim: Look, that's the only conclusion I can reach. Literally, you could have called her back in 10 mins. But it's ok. Safe flight and have fun. \n\nThis goes on back and forth for a while and ends with \n\nHim: I'M MAD THAT YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE VOLUME OF MY MUSIC WHEN YOU DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO BE ON THE PHONE RIGHT THEN. \n\nWas my expectation of silent car inappropriate? Am aita for calling my friend back while in the car?  \n\nTldr: called friend back after missing a call. BF thinks I should've waited to call her back and shouldn't be upset that he turned his music on while I was talking. ",

      "description": "I used to have a crush on one of my friends, she was blonde haired, blue eyed, southern British girl with a matching accent (I found it cute as hell). Lets call her G. I am a half asian half white dude (Also American), average height for an asian guy but Ive been told I look like Godfrey Gao and Keanu Reeves so I would like to think of myself of being quite good looking (Even if I have fairly low self esteem in actuality).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I knew G for a while and found out she had broken up with her boyfriend, Wanted to comfort her because I knew how much she meant to him and I was sad to see both of my friends split apart. We start talking more and eventually get closer and I think to myself \"I really like this girl\". I told her how I felt and she acknowledged that and gave me a \"maybe\".\n\nI should have just walked away and cut my losses there because I should have known my chances were through despite herself saying that I did have a chance. I eventually get to know her best friend, lets call her B. Shes just as attractive (with the same accent as well) but is far more forward and forthcoming with information, not as secretive as G as i'd come to know.\n\nB tells me that G has liked me this entire time, but when I ask G she says she doesn't. Turns out she admits to leading me on.\n\nNow keep in mind G has never had a real boyfriend up until this point (only online with one of my friends). When she was in school she was constantly bullied by boys and no one ever seemed to like her romantically. \n\nG and I would eventually end up in a bunch of arguments about how she wants a boyfriend and someone to love her yet completely disregarded my feelings for her. I didn't even say \"You should date me\" it was along the lines of \"I know you've been hurt by guys in the past and no longer have trust in men, but give this a shot and if it doesn't work out then no hard feelings okay? \n\nB, her best friend was the one who wanted G and I to be together so I felt some kind of obligation to make it happen.\n\nI left my offer on the table and left. I eventually gave up\n\nI was gonna go back to my hometown in Pennsylvania and stop by New York City for the holidays. I found out that B was going to New York City as well.\n\nWe have a nice couple days in new york city and we really have grown closer (mirroring what happened with me and G I was afraid I was going down the same route) However it turns out G and B have completely different personalities and B has one thats far more like my own. Shes had plenty of relationships and made many mistakes in her past and admits that. Whereas G is far more inexperienced, no offense to her. Apparently once G went to uni she started having sex with every guy she saw in B's words which drove them to split as she didnt want to see her best friend make the same mistakes she did.\n\nI somehow convince B to come to my hometown, we get dinner and a movie and we eventually have sex at my place. G eventually finds out and calls me an asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I use to order her Ubers no problem. \n\nThe thing is that now she's starting to use them more and I really don't get why she insists on texting me to get her and Uber and pay it with her card (if she didn't have money I would understand but I'm not even paying for them)  instead of doing it herself.\n\nI feel really bad for telling her to consider downloading the app if she uses the service so much. But she says she wants me to know where she is. I tell her you can share your ride information whenever you get an Uber and she can do that. But she wants ME to do it for her.\n\nI guess what I'm annoyed by is the stress of my mom depending on me to get out of the house, but I don't want her to think I don't want to do anything for her. It's just that I really think it would be more beneficial to her if I teach her how to order an Uber but she just doesn't want to.\n\n Things are a little harder cause my sleep schedule is not very well aligned with hers, so I'm pretty sure she has woken me up and I've probably been kinda rude a couple times.\n\nTo get some context she asks me to get her an Uber about 2 times per week. And I also do whatever favor she asks me, like take care of her pets and house for the weekend a couple of times, or go print some documents (I don't own a printer) it's just with this particular thing I have a problem with. It's not so much that it represents any real bother but I want to know if you think I'm just a selfish asshole son, cause sometimes it feels like that.\n",

      "description": "Lost a parent a couple of weeks ago, my elderly father. He went relatively peacefully after a long life. I miss him, and the grief comes and goes, but I'm functioning. \n\nAnyway, a couple of acquaintances have pointedly not mentioned it to me at all, are acting frosty, and are making snide remarks about my lack of effusive emoting. Apparently I'm not acting bereaved enough. But I'm uptight about getting emotional in front of other people anyway. \n\nI find this situation is trying my patience. My view is that both of these people have a track record of playing the martyr card, long before this. This is just extra aggravation. I don't think it's a competition to see who has the worst luck. Or who is having the most difficult holiday season. Or who is the most depressed, bereaved, etc.\n\nAre they judging me too harshly or vice versa? \n\nShould I just take comfort in the fact that I am an ice cold a\\*\\*hole?",

      "description": "Alright folks this one is sort of hard to explain and kind of a doozy,  \n\n\n   I'll start with a little background that me and my sister are both mid 20's and have never gotten along our entire lives, we're just two fundamentally different people with different values.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n We have 2 family dogs 1 is mine 1 is hers, I don't want to keep spelling their names out so my dog is P my sisters dog is K and my sister will be DS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  DS trains service dogs in college and has now graduated and is training another dog that she wants to keep because the dog has a heart murmur and is now unsuitable to be matched with a person with a disability. She has been training this dog for just under 2 years and now wants to keep the dog\n\nKeeping the dog requires vet bills to check on her heart and an adoption fee that's thousands of dollars, because up until this point the company has paid for all of her things. The problem I have with this is I take care of both our dogs now because she moved to another state with the new dog she was training in college. \n\nI paid for my dog P to get her teeth pulled out of my own pocket that was about two thousand dollars and originally DS was supposed to pay for K to get her teeth done.\n\nShe didn't want to because she's \"broke\" and won't touch her ten thousand she has in savings, so I offered to split the cost instead because K really needs her teeth out she's old but still has a good 5 years or so left. DS denied that too.\n\nSo when I found out she'd drop all this money on a new dog that she's had for two years and not the dog we got when we were in middle school pissed me off. So i texted her and I said \"Thanks for reminding me how selfish you are\"\n\nwe didn't speak for six months after the incident where she told me she wouldn't help me pay for K's vet bills but recently started talking again, and the this happened and I called her out.\n\nmeanwhile I've been saving as much as I can with all my bills to try and get K her dental surgery and found a place where it's a little cheaper.\n\nDS called our mother on me and now I'm being yelled at by my parents that I need to leave her alone, All I want is for her to understand how she's acting.\n\nI'd do anything for my dogs and the fact she won't do the same makes me angry and disgusted that someone like her is my sister. \n\nI don't think I did anything wrong by calling her out on her behavior and saying she cares more about the new dog than her childhood dog\n\nAITA?

      "description": "I currently live with 3 housemates, one who shares a room with me and two who share another room. My roommate is in a long distance relationship with her bf who she sees at least once a month. She usually travels to see him more often than the other way around. \n\nLast week, she told me that he would be visiting for about a week. On the first night that he arrived, she asked if I could sleep in the other bedroom so she could have some alone time with her bf, since our other housemate was out of town and her bed would be free. I kindly obliged and slept in the other bedroom since I thought it would be nice for them to have some alone time and it was the first time she‚Äôd ever asked me to do this, even though her bf has visited before.\n\nThey left on a short road trip for the following couple of days. On they day they returned, my roommate asked if I could be out of the house/room and not return again until she asked when they arrived, so they could again have some alone time. I was fine with it since I had errands to run and would be out anyway.\n\nLater that night, she abruptly asks me to sleep in the other bedroom again since he‚Äôd be leaving the morning and they wanted to spend the last night alone. At this point, I‚Äôd had the final straw. I said they could have alone time for the next few hours because I could just study in the living room, but I still wanted to sleep in my own bed. She started getting angry and saying that it would make her too uncomfortable to have sex because I‚Äôd still be within earshot in the living room. I told her I‚Äôd be willing to blast earbud music on full volume if I had to. At this point she starts getting extremely angry and accusing me of being an inconsiderate asshole. She says it‚Äôs unfair that since she‚Äôs often out of town on weekends I get to have way more private time with my bf, which is true. \n\nFeeling like this argument was going nowhere and it‚Äôd be awkward to sleep in the same room with her and her bf after this ordeal, I slept in the other room that night anyway. \n\nI‚Äôm still pissed off. In her eyes I‚Äôm the asshole for not giving her any alone time when her bf visited. I agree it‚Äôs difficult to feel like you have privacy when your roommate is sleeping 3 feet away from you, but in my mind I gave her plenty of chances to be alone, PLUS they went on a solo road trip in the middle. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My cousin is married, has 2 kids, the youngest has cerebral palsy and requires constant care. Her husband was unemployed for over 8 months. The job he finally found pays a little over minimum wage. My cousin also lost her job in January so they had to give up the apartment they were living and move back to her parents house with the kids (her husband moved with his mom since the house is not big enough).\n\nMy cousin found a job 1 month later so she‚Äôs working now. At least both she and her husband are now working.  \n\nHer youngest child requires constant physical therapy and special attention as he is non-verbal and is in a special wheelchair. He‚Äôs also had multiple surgeries due to hip misalignments. It‚Äôs likely he‚Äôll need more. \n\nMy cousin is also deep in credit card debt that she refuses to pay. I believe most of this debt went into paying medical expenses for her youngest child but she basically lives on the edge engaging into risky agreements with loan sharks to cover loan after loan.\n\nShe does have a loving family. Her father somewhat supports her financially (pays for her grad studies, buys food, pays for family vacations). He would eventually pay for his grandson‚Äôs medical expenses, I think.\n\nLast year I was doing really well. Had a good job, travelled much. Paid off my debts. I tried to help my cousin. Fixed her resume, contacted her with a few people, and loaned her $1,000. \n\nUnfortunately I lost my job due to restructuring in my company. My insurance is gone and I have to take expensive meds permanently for a medical condition. It‚Äôs been 5 months and I haven‚Äôt found another job yet. My current expenses (rent, medical bills, fuel, food, etc) are piling up too. She‚Äôs never brought it up, paying me back, not even as a courtesy. Neither did I as it wasn‚Äôt my initial intention. Most recently, I‚Äôve seen pictures of her and her family in fancy restaurants and nice hotels and when I‚Äôve casually asked her she says her father is paying for everything. Should I ask her to pay me back? Please, am I the asshole??",

      "description": "Background:\nI have a work friend, ‚ÄúJesse‚Äù. We don‚Äôt hang out other than work functions and work. I like her as a person and focus on her good side. Her office mate, ‚ÄúMindy‚Äù is an insincere bitch, happy to your face talk behind your back type. We get along OK but I don‚Äôt like her that much. Then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúKen‚Äù, young and nice, I joke that I want to fix him up with my nephew, but he has ‚Äúflavors of the week‚Äù so no go. Joking around together all of the time with all of us until the last couple of months. \n\nWe used to all laugh together. Lately, our family-like work group has split in two; the clicky ‚ÄúBermuda Triangle‚Äù and the rest of us (5). We all blame Mindy because she has been the same all over no matter what department. She brings down the impressionable Jesse and Ken to her level. \n\nOh, and they are trying to get another coworker fired. He is their supervisor, space cadet, but works hard. They are in their smart phones half the day and complain about how busy they are. They leave 7 minutes early (the cutoff time) every single day. They set the space cadet up for mistakes. They ask him to do their work because they are ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù and then complain and blame him when they do things they told him to do. \n\nHERE IS WHERE I FUCKED UP. \nJesse made a huge mistake. I don‚Äôt write people up because it‚Äôs not my style. I cannot even remember the last time I did because it has been YEARS. Since Jesse and Mindy are trying to get space cadet fired and setting him up I wanted to even the score. \n\nWell, Jesse found out it was me and confronted me. I apologized to her and said I was pissed, it was impulsive, I‚Äôve been under a lot of stress lately and have been losing sleep. (All true). This incident happened and it was a major scheduling fuck up, and the family was very angry. Jesse said I should have given her the chance to explain (well HA- the Bermuda Triangle all 3 called out sick that day during the busiest clinic of the week.) I said I know your angry, I know it will be a while before you can forgive me. She said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not angry, I‚Äôm disappointed, you don‚Äôt have to ask for forgiveness let‚Äôs move on and yada yada blah blah blah. \n\nWhat pisses me off is that I know she is angry, the Bermuda Triangle practically UNfriended me on FB (but did the next level down (took a break which is almost like blocking). ALL of them. It‚Äôs none of the other two‚Äôs business this is between Jesse and I. And I‚Äôm thinking, don‚Äôt ducking tell me you are not mad and then completely ignore me at work (like saying ‚Äúgoodbye Space Cadet have a good weekend‚Äù but saying nothing to me when I was next to him. \n\nI don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm hurt. I know I was wrong in some ways. My husband told me ‚Äúif she is the type that will throw Space Cadet under the bus maybe she is not the type of person you want to be friends with. \n\nBut I always see the good in people and downplay the bad. I don‚Äôt care about Mindy, she is a bitch. I‚Äôm a little sad about Ken, but really hurt about Jessy. \nI‚Äôm not sure what to do. I‚Äôll maybe post in AITA too. \nTL;DR: I wrote up a friend with shady work ethic. She found out and is being a bitch to me even though she said she accepts my apology. \nAITA?",

      "description": "I had a weird interaction earlier and I don't know what I was supposed to do. I stopped by the mall on the way home last night, and as I was exiting down a street from the parking ramp to the main road, I approached three teenagers walking in the street. At first they appeared to be crossing, so I slowed but continued forward. They were not in a crossing zone, but I live in a city where jaywalking is common so it's routine for people to walk around your car as you pass by. \n\nBut then they turned slightly to walk down the middle of the street toward me. As they approached, one put his hand out indicating that I should stop. My sense in the moment was that they were not hurt or in danger. They were walking slowly and I feel like I saw them chatting and smiling. The one who waved me down definitely seemed relaxed, as if he was a parking attendant (he was not a parking attendant). I could be wrong about that; I'm just describing what went through my mind over the 10 seconds that this unfolded.\n\nAs I mentioned I live in a city, and people are always soliciting you for things. A couple weeks ago I had somebody approach my car at a stoplight and ask for a ride. People ask for money and then bitch you out if you don't give them anything. You just have to tune people out sometimes; if you're not a cop I don't trust your hand signals over my own eyes. So this situation felt a little off, like these teens were going to hassle me about some nonsense. I have lived and worked in my downtown area for several years so tuning out panhandler is instinct at this point.\n\nTwo of them were on my left side, and one was on my right, with about 15 feet of space between them. There were no other obstacles on the road in front of me. So instinct kicked in: I slowed down a little more and then just coasted right between them. This was not strictly-speaking safe, but I had room and all four of us were moving slowly. As the lead kid (who was motioning me to stop) realized I wasn't stopping, he slapped my side window and yelled \"STOP!\" That was the only thing anyone said in this whole incident as far as I know.\n\nNow I was rattled by the way the kid had pounded on my car, so I really just wanted to be away from whatever this was meant to be. I wasn't watching them them closely in the mirror, but they didn't chase after me and I didn't see any indication that anyone was hurt. I left and that was that.\n\nI'm sure I could have handled that better. But what could they want from me? I can't think of any way that I, as a random driver in a moving car, could be of more help than the mall employees on the other side of the nearest door. There was no apparent safety reason to start an impromptu roadblock in that spot. Maybe they just needed jumper cables or something, but then why shout at me? Still, I wonder if I wrote them off as panhandlers too early. In the interest of full disclosure, I'm a white guy and these were three black boys probably age 15-17. I don't think that race was a significant factor, but that's what everybody says isn't it?\n\nWhat do you think I should have done?",

      "description": "So I‚Äôm someone who isn‚Äôt the biggest fan of clingy behaviours and will get sick of a person quite sick if I see them every single day for extended period of time\n\nNow onto the issue\n\nSo I was unofficially seeing this dude (let‚Äôs call him Bert) for a little while. He‚Äôs a lovely guy and we naturally got along quite well. He had told me at the start that he was looking for something serious and at the time, I thought I was too.\n\nFast forward about a month in and things have moved incredibly fast. He wanted to be around me 24/7. Now I know this isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing but I needed my space and time to be alone with my friends.\n\nAbout a week ago, my friends and I went to a movie night at the bar on campus but ended up getting bored and heading to maccas for a cheeky $1 sundae\n\nWe told the rest of our group where we were and a few people were in the area so they showed up as well. Bert ends up driving 15 minutes to come hang out. I felt bad because I had to leave about 30 minutes after he arrived (because I still have a curfew) but we didn‚Äôt talk when he was there \n\nI felt terrible because he came all the way and I hardly even spoke to him but I felt so overwhelmed with how our relationship was going. \n\nWhen I ended up leaving, I sent him a message and he seemed pretty disappointed at the events of the night. I explained my situation to him, I‚Äôm confused, I don‚Äôt know what I want right now and I‚Äôm not ready for a relationship (he had been nudging at making it official for a while (reminder we haven‚Äôt even know each other for a month at this point) \n\nThe truth is, I‚Äôm not 100% over my ex boyfriend yet and I felt it wouldn‚Äôt be fair( to either party) to get into something serious with someone if I wasn‚Äôt completely emotionally invested in them, plus the clingyness was too much. He was everywhere that I was, the only times I wouldn‚Äôt see him was if I was in a lecture or in class. Plus, the idea of just being in a relationship (with him especially) just gave me an uncomfortable feeling and I guess that was a sign. \n\nI didn‚Äôt tell him about my ex but I told him that I just wasn‚Äôt ready and that it would be best to be just friends right now because I just started uni, I wanna focus on school and just have fun. He said it was fine and that he‚Äôd be happy to stay friends\n\nBut no no no, \n\nHe told all his boys how I lead him on and played with his feeling, even bad mouthing me to my friends (who stood up for me) and trying to get them to pick a side \n\nAt his point, I‚Äômover it and honestly don‚Äôt even want to really see him because he‚Äôs making me out to be a terrible person and over dramatising the situation.\n\nAITA for wanting to cut him off completely? Did I handle this wrong?\n\n\nTL;DR\nWas seeing a dude, he got very clingy so I told him I‚Äôm not ready for a relationship and then he started bad mouthing me \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Hello together, this is my first post here. Im curious what you think about this situation and I hope I can keep myself short but you'll need some background to fully understand my point.\nI'm also sorry for my beginner english.\n\nTwo years ago I planned with a group of close friends to make a trip together. We were about 8 people and everyone agreed months before. We've been seeing us regularly but never talked about the vacation again. One of them once asked in a chat where to go on vacation, but only about 4 people responded as most didn't already want to think about vacation.\nSo they just booked vacation and left 3 people out, which were then without plans for the summer. Me too and I was very pissed. But this whole thing calmed down after a few weeks as they really had forgotten us / didn't leave us out by intention.\n\nA few months ago we we're planning to make a party at new-years eve. I had already agreed to make something with my gf before and told my friends that I would only come if my gf was allowed to join too. They told us that this wouldn't be a problem so we went on with this plan.\nAnd then, two day before of the event they told me my girlfriend wasn't allowed to come. Another friend of us, wo didn't show up for about a year because he was to busy gaming, wanted to join them too a week before new years eve. Some of them got pissed and claimed they would stay at home because too many people joined (it was a stay for some nights and it wansn't a really big house). Then they then made an internal 'voting' for what to do. They voted out my girlfriend and the other guy in.\n\nThey told me I was still allowed to join and my wonderful gf also told me that it would be ok for her if I joined but that was absolutely no option for me.\n\nI was so dissapointed on them, also because they showed me before how they can be, and also got a bit vulgar because they tried to make me look like an asshole. They claimed that I had to be thankfull for all the parties I was allowed to attend (This would'nt have been our first trip over new year). Finally they also got mad because of my reaction.\n\nI broke contact with them for several months now and am not sure anymore if I overreacted. I somehow want my friends to think the way I do and in this case they clearly didn't. But still, that way I lost my closest group of friends.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons, and a heads up that the situation is a little weird.\n\nLong story short, I‚Äôm living with two women I‚Äôve known my whole life, they‚Äôre married, and I‚Äôm dating both of them. Everyone knows, there‚Äôs no secrets, no cheating, none of that. \n\nBut before we became a triangle, they would basically have weekly date nights where they‚Äôd go to the movies. They‚Äôd see literally everything. I see less movies these days, mostly because I feel like I‚Äôm turning into a bit of a snob, or maybe I‚Äôm just less willing to put my money into movies I just know I‚Äôm not into.\n\nThe exception is animated movies. I see basically all of them, and even if I know they‚Äôre bad (less than 30 on Rotten Tomatoes bad), I might see it if I‚Äôm bored and they aren‚Äôt interested.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon just came out, and I‚Äôve been on a new work schedule for a few months now. I work seven days, 12 hour shifts, then I‚Äôm off seven days. Naturally it makes seeing movies that come out on the week I work difficult, so there‚Äôs a bit of a wait on some of them. I told them they could see HOTYD without me, then a few hours later after really giving it some thought, I said I‚Äôd rather they wait. It‚Äôd only be a 4-5 day wait, but they went and saw it.\n\nOf course we can always see it again since they liked it enough that they‚Äôd be willing to, but for whatever reason I‚Äôve always preferred to see movies I know I want to see with them for the first time for all of us. It‚Äôs caused issues in the past, and they know I‚Äôm upset about it now, and one of them told me ‚ÄòYou always get angry about this kind of thing, and we feel like we‚Äôre not allowed to see a movie without your permission.‚Äô\n\nI know I‚Äôm at least partially the asshole, at least because I attempted to rescind the permission to see the movie but if they know it bothers me because this has happened before shouldn‚Äôt they be able to  see that maybe if they‚Äôre doing something that upsets me that maybe they should stop doing it? I‚Äôm not trying to control the movies they see, but for the movies all of us want to see that they know are a must see for me, is it too much of me to ask them to wait a few days?",

      "description": "So bear with me in this one, I don't feel like the asshole but who knows, boss my have a legitimate complaint. \n\nI work at a 24 hour diner but since we are right down the street from our University town's party district, by far the most lucrative hours are between about midnight and 7 am with a real peak between 2 and 4 AM. Students and club goers have eaten at our restaurant for 60 years and up until recently it was owned by the same family. I worked for both the old family and the new owner and things have changed dramatically. Old family's basic rule was every single customer gets treated equally. For example we get a 30 minute wait list every Thursday, Friday and Saturday and old owners were somewhat famous for making a presidential candidate who was wanting to dine with our teams football coach wait over an hour for his table. \n\nNew owner is a little bit more social media savvy and he'll let our city's famous instagramers, members of the football and basketball team, his friends, etc... but he's never formally revoked the \"everyone gets treated equally rule\" because most of our customers love it. \n\nSo Saturday night I was working the host section and working as manager, at about 1am we had a 45 minute wait list and kitchen, busing and wait staff were all busting our asses to get people in and out.  All of the sudden an entire entourage was standing in the front of the line just acting like entire self entitled douche bags. It created a minor stir in the restaurant as I guess these guys are famous enough to get noticed but it wasn't anything like an A lister like Drake or Cardi B popped in. The manager of this group came up to me and said they'd like to be sat. I told them we had a wait list and its the policy that there's no special treatment. The manager pulled the \"do you know who we are and what we can do for you\" line and I told him he could see by the people that were in line out into the parking lot in January that we really didn't need any help and I'd be happy to put their name on the list. Then the \"star\" of the group came up to talk to me and he was just a total obnoxious piece of shit telling me that he would put me on Instagram \"in a bad way dooooodde‚Ä¶..\"\n and that he and his crew were hungry. I told him I'd take his name and call him when his spot came up. He basically said as loud as he could \"fuck this shit we're going to Denny's\" and then left without causing any more trouble. I had to ask another person who he actually was to find his Instagram to see if he blasted us but so far nothing. \n\n\nSo I got off shift at 8am the next morning and by 10 my boss was blowing up my phone asking me how I'd made such a horrendous mistake and basically furious because I'd \"blown\" so much free publicity by not letting this group get preferential treatment at HIS restaurant. I told him about the policy and he told me (and I quote) \"that policy was fucking stupid and you're fucking stupid if you think we're still enforcing it, using your fucking brain.\" \n\nI calmly asked if he'd put it in writing because those of us who'd been around for a few years were very used to the old way and he told me (paraphrasing) \"it would be a public relations night mare to OFFICIALLY change something like that so he relied on his managers to not be fucking idiots every once in a while.\" \n\nHe didn't fire me which is good because I really need the job but I'm fucking pissed that he talked to me like that. But worried I could have just been a little more flexible and avoided the whole situation. \n\nbasically AITA?\n",

We are pretty close, have almost all met in real life, and speak to each other on discord most nights of the week. Four of us were born very close together, so for a period of time we have one birthday a week, with mine being the last. Something big has happened for each birthday so far: everyone has either sent gifts or has a gift on the way to their home, since the first birthday last week, the one that happened this week, and the one that's happening next week. The only one that isn't getting anything is me. I know this because no one's asked for my address or mentioned that they have anything on the way, as they have done with the others. Usually I don't care if anything happens for my birthday or not, and don't expect anything, but I'm a little hurt that I'm the only one that will be left out of this, especially since I've sent gifts to my friends with birthdays before mine. I've dropped hints by mentioning that my birthday is coming up as well, and everything I say has been ignored so far. Am I being greedy and entitled by expecting my birthday to be treated the same way as everyone else's? If I bring this up to my group of friends, will I be shunned forever for my avarice? Will the shunning be righteous? Please let me know, I don't want to be rude or unkind or hurt anyone's feelings!",

      "description": "First post ever, which is really kind of nerve racking! Long time lurker though.\n\nBackground: Husband and I moved to a rural island in Alaska roughly over a year ago. The move was prompted by him being unhappy with his current job in the \"big city\" and always wanting to live in Alaska. I was not entirely on board with the idea initially due to us having small children, the cost of living in Alaska, the opportunity for the kids and the fact that I had just started my career. It had been agreed upon that we would stay in the big city and allow me to get experience before making any major life changes. That didn't happen. We moved to this island for my husband. I tried to warn him of the downsides of living on a small island but it felt like they were disregarded with ease. Now he is feeling the effects and wants to escape. It is beautiful here but small. \n\nSituation: Now a year and three months later my husband wants to move yet again for another job opportunity. He did not tell me he had applied, I only found out after he had scheduled an interview. Fast forward he was offered the job. Now the AITA part comes into play. The place he was offered a job has many more opportunities for the children and is on the road system which is a huge plus. It also comes with a huge pay increase. However I don't want to move. I am finally getting established in my career, I am making friends, we have a good community for the children. I feel that my husband is always looking for the greener grass at whatever the cost. I didn't want to move here initially but I sure as hell don't want to move after a year of being here. Not to mention we bought a house when we moved here, huge investment that we would lose on...oh yeah and we were buying a house down in the big city when he decided he wanted to move up. We had to walk away from that as well, money lost. We are doing fine finically which furthers my want to dig my heels in on this. I told him I would not move yet again for his need to find happiness in a job. My children are established, we both already have good jobs and a nice house.      ",

      "description": "My dorm building is kind of old, and the rooms aren‚Äôt all the same size. Mine and my roommate‚Äôs room is bigger than average; we‚Äôre on the end of the building so it‚Äôs long and the ceiling is slanted so it can‚Äôt be tripled. It‚Äôs maybe 25% bigger than the other rooms in the building. There‚Äôs only 4 rooms of this size in the building that aren‚Äôt tripled (about 40-50 rooms total) so my roommate and I definitely got lucky. It also has a more private bathroom (one stall between 5 people instead of 2 stalls between 10-12). \n\nWe got assigned our rooms randomly. This girl ended up with one of the smaller rooms, which sucks, but it‚Äôs still bigger than your average dorm room. None of the rooms in our building are bad, hard stop. \n\nShe‚Äôs been in my room before to ask my roommate questions about a class they were taking together, and she always comments on the size and how jealous she is (her words). She complains fairly often about how small her room is and how she wishes she had more space. \n\nI know this girl from high school because we had mutual friends. We‚Äôre also in the same program together and have done group projects together so I know her fairly well. We don‚Äôt hang out outside of class so we‚Äôre not really friends, but definitely friendly. \n\nToday one of my friends told me that this girl had told her she was going to try and request my room for next year. When my friend told her that my roommate and I were going to request our room again, the girl said ‚Äúoh, maybe I won‚Äôt.‚Äù I know her though, and I know she would do it anyways even though she said she wouldn‚Äôt. \n\nWould I be the asshole if confronted her about it? I was really taken aback when my friend told me the girl was going to try and request my room. It felt like a really shitty thing to do. \nI know it‚Äôs not ‚Äúmy‚Äù room, because the school owns it and I was really lucky to get it in the first place, etc. etc. but I couldn‚Äôt help feeling a little betrayed. I was thinking about it and I would be genuinely mad if she got the room next year. Which isn‚Äôt exactly a fair reaction, bc again, the room isn‚Äôt technically mine, but I can‚Äôt help but feel some ownership over it since I‚Äôve been living in it for over half a year. I understand why she wants the extra space, but this is mine and my roommate‚Äôs room, and she knows we really like it. \n\nIf I did talk to her about it I would suggest she request the room across from mine and my roommates bc it‚Äôs the same size and I know the girls who live there are moving out next year.

      "description": "Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I have been married for years, have 3 children, one is a teenager, the other 2 are 4 and under. My husband works, I stay at home. Am I being unrealistic in expecting a little help? I cook, clean, do all shopping, and childcare. I'm up with them every day, and I put them to bed every night. I love my kids, please dont tell me I shouldnt have had them. They are my world. My husband will on occasion bathe the younger two (maybe once a month?) He works a crazy schedule which requires him to work 12 hr shifts sometimes during the day, sometimes overnight. Regardless of work or not, I get up with the kids every day. On his days off, he gets up leisurely,  takes a shower, and joins us after. I spend a part of my day cleaning up behind him. He leaves his clothes everywhere (living room, all over the bathroom, our bedroom floor). He spends the day generally in the same room with us, but often on the phone either playing games or whatnot, unless football is on. I should be going to bed when the kids do, because I know I have to get up with them. But sometimes it's hard to just immediately fall asleep and I'm up until 11 or so (Kids are up by 6-7) . \n\nHe doesn't like night shift, and has made it obvious he'd like to be off that shift. I tried to approach him today about either setting up a plan with his bosses or helping him look for a new job. He has a bachelor's,  I only have an associate's. His response was if I need a break, I need to get a job and put the kids in daycare. I just don't see that as a fix. Finally he agreed he would just do the laundry,  so I didn't have to. But it feels more like a tantrum than anything. He says anyone would die to be in my position. \n\nLet me say this, I love my husband. Hes a good dad. I know he loves his kids. \n\nI'm happy to give more answers, I honestly just want to know....is this right? Am I supposed to live day in and day out without a break, because he pays the bills? AITA for even bringing it up? ",

      "description": "Alright, so I am 16, just to get that out of the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically a bit of backstory here. My mother never bothers talking to me, she only even talks to me when its time to get a punishment, or when she's asking me to do something for her. Its obvious that she does not know about any of my interest, and its obvious that she isn't interested in knowing them either. She speaks to everyone else in the family, my other 4 siblings included. She always use to threaten to put me in a group home because I \"was bad\". She does not bother to teach me anything about the real world, and I feel she thinks that I am nothing special. I will admit, I use technology a lot, including discord scamming (which it isn't even scamming, they just thought I was scamming), and playing video games a lot, but I dont let it cloud my entire life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe goes to work a lot, and I think she feels that thats enough to being a parent. My father goes to work as well, yet he makes the attempt to teach me things about life. Whenever he tries to bring her into a conversation, she always finds a reason to go away. I am currently on punishment, in my room, having nothing to look forward to in life, just sitting here bored, just trying to get as much time to pass as possible, so I can go to school, and come back home to do nothing. I dont even have as little as a book to read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I am wondering, since my mother is supplying things for me, am I being ungrateful, since giving me the bare necessities is more than enough? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeres another question. Should I just go to the group home and stay away since I am obviously holding everyone in my family back by being the bad one? I live in a pretty ghetto and dangerous city if that has anything to do with it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople always say that the life of an adult is always hard and hell. So I am wondering, should I just skip to death and just get it over with?",

      "description": "sorry if there is anything wrong with this post, it‚Äôs my first.\n\nSo 2 years ago i met this dude through a mutual friend. Let‚Äôs call this dude J. J was a bit of a social outcast before he met my friend, who we‚Äôll call D. J was lanky, puppy dog eyes and slender face, a bit annoying. The next year J started making really offensive and downright racist jokes. He stank to high heaven too. D still kinda liked him. Eventually i could not bear him, and talked to D about cutting ties with him because i couldn‚Äôt stand him, but D still liked him and didn‚Äôt want to stir up drama. I took the advice of my Dad and had to grin and bear it. D was my only friend, and she was basically life support for my mental health, so i started avoiding J. D was always with J though, so basically i barely see her. This sucked. One day, i had an anxiety attack. I braced myself up against the wall, trying to ride it out. D caught on about my hatred of J, and helped me through the attack. I opened up to her about my grievances. She looked like she understood. Later through Discord, discussed that J was gay and had a crush on me. I‚Äôm not homophobic, nor gay, nor interested in a relationship. So i confronted him about it explaining that i was not gay. J overreacted, and threatened suicide. My thinking is that, because D helped me with anxiety and i opened up to her about past suicide thoughts. J put a pair of scissors on his wrist and threatened self-harm, but never went through with it. D had an argument with him, and he put a chair on his head and threatened to crush it. I developed depression from this ordeal. \n\nTl;dr: this dude gave me an anxiety attack and depression and i want to know if i‚Äôm in the wrong.",

      "description": "I started dating a girl years after my marriage ended. It lasted a year. I got close to her son. It's been a year and then one weekend when she's drinking at a friend's barbecue she starts berating me about my choice in my previous marriage. Mainly the fact my wife was white. Her friend had to stop her.\n\nOne week later we go to a friend's after a night at karaoke with their crowd. I was the designated driver, she was drunk. Starts saying shit about us and arguing with me in front of them. They're quiet and end up telling us to stop fighting, even though every sentence out of my mouth was trying to diffuse the situation.\n\nFast forward to three days later, Halloween night. We go out. I'm the designated driver. She's drunk. Starts arguing. I try to remove myself from the situation. She Spartan kicks me in the chest, hard. I gasp, try to leave, she's dragging me back in and I'm shocked I just got hit. She tried coaxing me into sex, and she was like grabbing my face and pushing me down to sit down and taking off my clothes even though I said no. It happened, and I still don't know how to feel about that.\n\nOne week after that her sister is in town. Both sober. She starts arguing with me on personal things again in front of her sister. \n\nI've become depressed and disenchanted and I just got off the phone with her ending it. I just want to ask, am I the asshole? I have drank quite a bit around her but I'm just a happy giggly person not aggressive drunk. So I'm not perfect. And I bonded with her son. She kept saying that in the phone call. I feel like shit and like an asshole, but I cannot deny that these things affected me to the point where I lost feeling for her. It's just sad. It's near Christmas. I got him a gift and everything, and now I'm having flashbacks of my own father abandoning. Am I the asshole in this situation? Maybe I should have worked it out instead of quitting but that's in the past now.",

      "description": "I  sing for a band that was contacted about playing a gig in support of a  teen girl with cancer. The mother had trouble reaching her GoFundMe goal  and cooked up the idea of a concert to raise the balance. Despite not  knowing the family, mutual acquaintances got the band involved.  Especially as my aunt died of the same illness, I was happily on board  to perform without compensation. Two other bands were to be on the bill.\n\nI  didn‚Äôt meet with anyone involved until the day prior when my bassist  and I checked out the venue. No issues there. Going by the GoFundMe  page, the girl was out of town receiving treatment for ovarian cancer  that was spreading to other organs. The only discomfort I feared in this  situation was having to come up with something to say to the mother,  who had a good chance of losing a child. The surprises started coming  the moment we arrived. There was a booth with an Arbonne banner. Mom was  happier than a pig in shit, directing people like she was decorating  for a wedding. First thing she does is hug us; second, tell us she‚Äôll be  streaming the performance on her Youtube channel exclusively; third,  introduce us to her daughter, purported to be near death from cancer,  who is playing on the floor with a toddler. Over the course of an  increasingly unbelievable conversation, it comes out that the ovarian  cancer was self-diagnosed and that the treatment the daughter needs is  to come from ‚Äúspecialists, not doctors.‚Äù\n\nOf  the many available options people have since reminded us that we had,  the band decided to go ahead and play‚Äîas a platform for publicly outing  the mother‚Äôs deception. I have since been told that I jumped to  conclusions without seeking the full story, or that I failed to consider  that there were a lot of kids in the audience at 2:00 in the afternoon  when we rage-performed ‚ÄúAnarchy in the U.K.‚Äù with lyrics changed to call  out the mother as a total fraud. I admit there were obscenities. It was  the most awkward when we finished. I looked all over for a video camera  to flip off, but didn‚Äôt see it. We just packed up our gear quickly and  left giggling from the catharsis.\n\nNow,  not all members of the band and their girlfriends feel this was the best  use of our energies. There is worry we may have opened ourselves to  repercussions, or at least made the most negative choice. I stand by it.  AITA?",

      "description": "Once Upon a time, this co-worker and I were friends; then she got a boyfriend and decided I was somehow jealous of her and convinced our group to \"forget\" to invite me to group events, change details or flat out lie to me about prior plans we'd made before \"the shunning\" took place.\n\nI had a little breakdown, dealt with some shit, etc. Plenty of crap was said about me behind my back and for the most part it all died down in months. We all ended up going our separate ways.\n\nFive years later...\n\nShe comes back to talking to me because she needs a favor. I ignore her, I somehow end up still getting moved to her old position so she can change shifts.\n\nWe still don't talk. We work in the same place, do the same job, don't talk to each other.\n\nA year later (present time)....she's pregnant (not telling anyone, but everyone knows kinda deal) and she's using it to get out of doing a good chunk of her work.\n\nOur work schedule was altered to give her more time off.\n\nThen she gets a doctor's note for restrictions; can't go over X-hours per week. So more of her work becomes my work because it has to be inspected/shipped same day.\n\nShe calls in and I'm expected to drop what I'm doing and get my ass to work to cover for her, despite having my own life and a second job, or it's going against my attendance.\n\nRecently she had a death in the family and is taking her bereavement; everyone is acting really sad for her and like we should all get together and do something for her. Even new temps that don't know her are getting roped into it.\n\nI bowed out without comment. I didn't say anything to anybody, I'm not signing the card, I'm not contributing. She's got more to worry about than whether or not my name is on a card.\n\nH.R. noticed and decided to ask, directly, if I wanted to sign the card or make a donation, in a very low-key threatening tone. I've seen how this works before, signing the card means someone down the line is going to come collecting the cash behind it. And I'm not in a good place budget-wise, which is why I work 2 jobs.\n\nI said no and that was it. Begin the gossip and the rumors. Which takes some doing because we're off a couple days for the new year, but Facebook is working OT.\n\nLike, I get it that she's the office pet and has it in good with the higher-ups because she married into their collective, but I can't seem to force myself to be concerned for her. And I don't feel like I should be bullied into faking it.",

      "description": "Recently, this girl who I used to spend some time around has practically invaded the group of people that I typically spend time with, and it's getting on everyone's nerves. She is always asking for money and food because she forgets to bring her own, inserts herself in conversations that have nothing to do with her and has tried to break up two of my friends who are in a very happy relationship. All of this in addition to her inability to socialize like a normal person has stacked up to be this obvious inconvenience to me and my friends.\n\nSo, the solution brought to me by my friends is that I just tell her we don't like her, and tell her to move on. I have a hard time saying no to people as it is, but to be put in this kind of situation is a whole new level of hell for me. She's a nuisance to my friends even though she's kind of a nice person, and it's now my responsibility to tell her we can't have her around. I admit that it's exhausting to deal with her, but I didn't have the first clue on how to tell her off.\n\nBut then the pressure came. I had to tell her to leave us alone. It had to be me, cause she wouldn't listen to anyone else. So I did the most asshole-ish and cowardly thing I could do. I texted her. I drafted just the right thing to say so she wouldn't be too upset and I texted it to her. She hasn't responded yet. I feel very guilty. Am I The Asshole? ",

      "description": "My best friend (B) and I were at a thing that our church runs on Sunday evenings for high school students. Both of us are seniors. All names have been changed.\n\nWe get to church, we're all hanging out and laughing and having a good time, and B and Todd walk away to go talk, alone.\n\n(For context, B had told me earlier that she needed to talk to Todd about something personal, and I was like okay? you do you boo. Harpago was less supportive and wanted her to talk to him about it instead, but every time she'd brought it up to him previously, he'd gotten angry and impossible to reason with.)\n\nI did not see Todd and B walk away from our group. Seeing as both the guy I have a massive crush on and my very sick best friend have disappeared, I, understandably, panic.\n\nSaid panic gets worse when another guy we know, S, walks over and whispers something to Oliver, who immediately gets angry with him and tells him to stop trying to start rumors. I, already being wound up from Todd and B's disappearance, freak out even more and ask Oliver to tell me what S said to him.\n\nOliver explains angrily that S was trying to start a rumor that Todd and B were 'spooning' on the metal stairs outside and that they'd gotten caught and yelled at by a leader. I then start shaking and put my head in my hands, because B has had issues with one male leader in particular because she's dating Harpago, a known troublemaker. Now, I know that Todd and B would never do anything bad, but I do know that Todd is parked in the back lot by the metal stairs and that they might've gone to a Walmart up the street, which is something we do often.\n\nI try to call B. No answer.\n\nI send a text in my group chat with Todd and B. No answer.\n\nI call Todd. Rings once, goes to voicemail.\n\nI call B again. No answer.\n\nI'm now on the verge of a panic attack- this is my closest friend and she's in pain, both mental and physical, and now she's missing, and so is the guy I like (who I am also close friends with). Oliver, Calvin, and Lily are all telling me that I'm overreacting and that everything is fine, but I can't calm down.\n\nLater, Todd and B reappear, coming in through the doors that lead to the lobby area. I yeet over there and ask B if I can hug her (there's a story there), she says yes, I pull her into a bone-crushing hug and when I let go I give her a stern talking-to, choked up and with tears in my eyes. Todd explains that they've been in the lobby, and everybody goes back to hanging out as normal.\n\nLater that night, I get a series of four texts from Harpago. He's berating me, telling me that B doesn't have to report her every move to me and that I need to 'stop being an asshole to her all the time' and that I'm 'not him when I  am not there'. I'm thinking to myself, dude, that's really controlling, but because I was not doing well mentally, I just apologized and said it wouldn't happen again.\n\nAITA?",

I am the mage. The ONLY mage in the group, which is important. My character has a disad called \"Secretive\" meaning I  have to basically hoard information. I take that seriously, although I do my best to work around it and share information that's necessary with the rest of the party. \n\nSo we're playing and there's a message hidden and I use my arcane lore skill to decode it.

I convey the pertinent info to the rest of the group, we move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few minutes later, the player sitting next to me snatches the note out of my hand. I object.

Stealing the paper from me seems to defeat the purpose of having the message encoded in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe DM doesn't notice, as he's settling a skill issue with the bard. Our first major encounter begins, and I just kind of let it go for the time being so we can get through the fight. After we've cleared it, I bring it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe DM says that the player should have had to roll to read the message, too. He has no Arcane Lore skill, so good luck. But unfortunately, he already has it. Everyone in the party is annoyed and says I should just let it go so we can move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for being upset that another player physically stole something in my possession, then shared information he shouldn't have had with other members of the group?",

      "description": "Basically what happened was my boyfriend and I had plans for a movie date and just relaxing at 6pm. He said before that that he was gonna go to the store with his roommate and might be a little late (like half an hour). Well it turns out, they didn‚Äôt go to the store until 15 minutes until we were supposed to hangout. I wasn‚Äôt angry or anything, I knew he would be a little late. \nHe messaged me from his roommates phone saying he left his at home and would message me ASAP when he got home. I said that was great and to just let me know so I could head over (I am about 20 mins from his house). \nAn hour passes and I‚Äôve heard absolutely nothing. An hour and a half in I message just to make sure they‚Äôre okay. Then two hours. Finally he messages me and says they got distracted. He has a watch and knew the time and sees no issue in the fact that he was two hours late. \nI should mention that I had work at 6AM the next morning so I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to stay extra late and was hoping to spend all the time possible. We were only seeing each other 1-2x a week. \nWhenever I expressed that I was upset he made it seem like I was being unreasonable. Mind you, I didn‚Äôt lash out or act angry, I just said that I was upset and was wanting to spend time with him because I missed him. And by the time I got over there (like 8:40) I only had like 3 hours to spend with him. \ntl;dr- plans for 6, boyfriend was late and I didn‚Äôt end up getting there until almost 9 \n\nAITA for being upset that I waited for two hours and then got told I was overreacting because I was upset? \n",

      "title": "AITA for submitting a complaint letter about my physics teacher?",
      "description": "Hello reddit,\n\nBasically, as the title says, I have recently submitted a complaint letter about my AP Physics teacher. I think most people know that physics can be very hard for many, but at the same time can be one of the most fascinating subjects in the lives of many. Since the beginning of the year, however, my teacher hasn't really been teaching the class, he always just said to read the book, and rarely did anything. In class people either sleep or study on their phones through online sources(Khanacademy, crash course, Organic chem tutor, would recommend all of those btw). He didn't give any interesting labs, he gave us one lab that involved dropping a car on a ramp and then measuring the impact with a sensor. The bad part was that all cars were either broken or sticky from some kind of glue. All other labs came in a form of .jar files that contained simulations. All would be fine if it weren't for the fact that many people couldn't open files on their Mac computers and some just didn't have a computer at home. When asked what to do he just shrugged and said \"I dunno, figure it out yourself.\" It all came to a boil when he changed the grading system for the 5th time this school year, making the class harder once again. Many people in our class say how after school he answers physics questions by first looking at you like an idiot and then either giving just an answer without an explanation or dodging the question(not sure what they mean by dodging the question but I am guessing that he just talks about something else? You can disregard that point as even I am skeptical he actually does that but I felt worth mentioning). So last week I compiled everything into one file that is about 4 pages long and submitted it.  If it means anything to you guys, on ratemyteacher websites he has 1 star out of 5 and all comments basically reflect what I already explained. The deen told me to \"give him a break, he is a new teacher!\" but I, at least at the moment, thought to myself that I don't care how new he is, if it means that I can't pass the AP exam at the end of the year, or get proper support to get my education. I do admit that it is partially our fault, maybe if we were to listen closely, he would change the way he acts towards us? I also didn't mention earlier but he also shows us powerpoints that summarises everything in one sentence and has images STRAIGHT from the textbook. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngoing back to the original question, was it an asshole thing to do, to send this potentially harming letter to the principal of my school? (about half of our class have submitted some kinds of verbal complaints to the principal about him already)",

      "description": "I worked with a girl for three years and we became really close friends. I moved to another state and I started to hear from her less and less, so I continued reaching out to her but our conversations inevitably did become shorter.  \n\nI've invited her and her husband to visit for years since we've moved and they've always declined and any time we're back in our home state we always invite them out, but it's been one excuse after another, mainly \"oh we forget you were coming home and we made other plans\"  \n\nIt's really confusing because at this point I never hear from her, I'm the only one that initiates conversation and it always makes me feel like why am I doing this, she is clearly not interested in being friends anymore, but she'll always say \"omg I've been meaning to text you I've been busy I miss you so much etc etc\"  \n\nI guess I'm mostly just annoyed that she puts 0 effort into our friendship  \n\nI know that her husband has had a problem with me since before their wedding because I had initially rsvp'ed to her bridal shower that I would come home and go, but then we found out my husband was deploying that weekend, so as soon as I found out I let her know and told her I would come home prior to the shower because I wanted to take her out to dinner and give her the gift I got her. At dinner she told me her (now) husband \"is really pissed at you for missing the bridal shower just because your husband is deploying, he thinks it's a bad reason to not go\"    \nAbout a year ago I had called her just to catch up and while we were on the phone her husband asked who she was talking to and she said me and he said \"oh my kid is going to be 18 before she even meets him\" .. which made me so upset because every time we're home we try to make plans with them and they won't see us, she did however invite me to her baby shower and I did travel home to attend  \n\nSo something just happened in her and her husband's life which falls into the area of my mom's job. I had told my mom about what happened and despite them not being my mom's clients she offered to take a look at their stuff and see if she can offer them any advice  \n\nI haven't told them this because I guess I feel like where our friendship is at the moment .. she's not made any attempt to see us when we're home in years, she never texts or calls... why am I going out of my way to help them? I feel like the right thing to to is put it out there for them, but I'm kind of tired of it at this point",

      "description": "So last August some friends of a friend needed a place for their dog since they moved into an apartment. The dog was already at their parents, but they were moving houses so they need somewhere for 2 months. They offered about 40 bucks a month for food for him (just barely enough for him).  \n\nAfter they eventually dropped him off he settled in nicely. The dog is a very active breed and we have a decent sized yard, and a dog park nearby which he loves. \n\nHe was meant to be gone by December so my mum and I tried to not get attached. December comes around and the owners visited because I found a tick and had already taken it out at the vet. So they also came to drop if some tick protect since they pretty much get it for free. They only visited the dog once before a couple of weeks after we got him. \n\nAt that time they were saying it would be be best he just stays at ours, and essentially saying they had no where for him to go for the foreseeable future. I was happy because I had already grown attached, but my mum had been wary till then. So they stopped paying every month, since we thought he was ours.\n\nFast forward to yesterday when we got a text from the owner saying they want to move him to live in an apartment with their friend in the city. We were furious and saddened. We were mad that they wanted to keep him in an apartment with no grass (active, medium breed) and sad that they wanted to take him.\n\nThe owner says she misses him but has only visited them twice in 8 months, to which they in the area every weekend. We've put so much love into caring for him and have even taught him new tricks. The poor dog has been uprooted so many time already and is still very young.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to keep him?\n",

I asked my other friends in the group but they won't even bother. They told me to accept him for who he is and the fact that he started smoking. That made be frustrated because they don't even care about whether he smokes or not.

We live and support each other and have built a life and family together that we are proud of. The one rough part of our life right now are some fertility issues that have made it difficult for us to conceive our second child. We have had multiple miscarriages and have been trying pretty non-stop for a most 2 years at this point. We are a few months from implanting our first round of IVF.\n\nMy wife is very uptight about anything baby related. When trying to conceive she has drunk no alcohol, no caffeine, is incredibly sensitive to things like lunch meats etc. basically all the things you would expect an already pregnant person to do. I get it, these are things she can control and I have done my best to support her.\n\nHere is where things get a bit difficult. My wife is an infectious disease physician. We have not traveled below the Mason Dixon line in 5 years due to her concerns around the Zika virus. I have done my best to be supportive of this but it has been incredibly difficult to negotiate with my job.\n\nIn a few weeks I am expected to be in Vegas. Under normal circumstances I would bow out but this is one of those few situations where I really can‚Äôt. I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as to say I will get fired but I would be SERIOUSLY screwing some people over.\n\nI know that the likelihood of me contracting the Zika virus is essentially null and have tried to reason with her but she is drawing a pretty hard line and is clearly pretty upset. I feel like I am caught in a really hard place here. At the same time I think I have been enabling some behavior on her end that I probably shouldn‚Äôt be enabling.\n\nSo Reddit AITA in this situation. Should I just suck it up and screw over my job in favor of my wife‚Äôs concerns? \n\n\n",

      "description": "throwaway acc\n\nThe other day at around 3am I got a call from friend (S) that his mom scratched him with a knife and she was furious cause she found out he was gay. I stayed on the phone with S to calm him down\n\nI told S he needed to leave, and that he had a spot at mine for as long as he needed. He refused saying it would make things worse. I said he was an adult and she had no power over him. His safety was more important than anything (he told me he was afraid of being stabbed)\n\nS had to talk to his dad so he got off the phone but texted me. I called other friend (L) S lived closer too, explained some if S needed a place closer. L said yes so I told S. I call my gf. S texted me throughout saying he couldn‚Äôt leave, but he would stay awake until he had class and call me driving. S called me elaborated, and I tried saying my place was open. S refused, I had class so I dropped it\n\nFF afternoon. One of the friends (A) in the group asked if S was alright cause of snap story. L told A S is ok\n\nA texted S, who said he was fine. A texted me and L asked for more info, we refused\n\nLater in the day (we have group skype to) S asked if anyone was up for a call while he drove home. I said yes so I called. Nobody picked up and A told me S was driving\n\nFF to later A texts me telling me S and her talked during ride home. I asked if S was ok or told her anything. A said yeah got told everything. A said that his mom was batshit but leaving would‚Äôve made the problem worse and it was a hard situation. I said don‚Äôt say to S that leaving is bad it‚Äôs gonna just make him feel trapped. I said his well-being is worth more and he has places to go. A said but where is he gonna go pay for his college etc\n\nThis infuriated me. I left my abusive house just last August because my girlfriend convinced me I could leave. Nobody else ever helped me. I felt trapped with no way out and didn‚Äôt want S feeling that way. A is aware this\n\nI told her that she didn‚Äôt understand what she was talking about and that S was with his mother who hurt him. he could come to mine and that he was feeling trapped when he could leave if he‚Äôs being hurt. A said that that‚Äôs not what she meant. I said that‚Äôs what she just said. I didn‚Äôt look at any more cause I was angry\n\nTwenty minutes later I get a call from my sister saying L said A is crying and freaking out that she upset me. I said I was upset with her but I‚Äôm not gonna stop being her friend I just need time to cool. My sister said okay and it ended there\n\nI looked later and A had sent me a bunch of texts apologizing. I didn‚Äôt reply. We still streak on Snapchat but I only had vague convos with her\n\nI get a long text the next day about everything she‚Äôs going through in life and with this. I told her that I would still be her friend, but I‚Äôm still upset I just need some time\n\nL is saying I‚Äôm just freaking A out these last few days. I‚Äôm not ready to say it‚Äôs ok. I need space. Everyone has their own opinion on me being angry at A and I need to know AITA",

      "description": "Sorry it‚Äôs long. There‚Äôs a TL;DR. I think I was the asshole but w/out realizing? I added a lot of my own thoughts but tried to make the events as factual as possible. Please tell me if I sound like I‚Äôm just trying to justify it bc IDK.\n\nI was getting a burger at the dining hall. I prefer no cheese and try to mention this because a.) there is def. cross contamination and b.) I‚Äôve mentioned it before + it was all good.\n\nWhen I went it was v slow + they were still restocking some stuff. I asked them for no cheese on one. Once they were done setting up things, I said  ~ ‚ÄùHey so you know it‚Äôs not an allergy, just a preference bc yeah‚Äù and  trailed off because I wasn‚Äôt sure how to finish it TBH.\n\n(I realized late it sounded kind of self-praising, but I can get awkward with strangers, so what could I do after the fact.)\n\nThey sort of neutrally said ‚ÄúOh, is it a problem? I can cook it in a separate pan if you need.‚Äù I was kind of confused and repeated it. They seemed about to move it to another pan (I thought) so I said it again and then after like 20 more sec they motioned to me and put the burger on my bun.\n\nI was holding the bun just in my hands bc circumstances. I just can‚Äôt remember if they made any sort of signal to take my bun before the third time I said it bc they had only been put in the pans a few min before.\n\nI was kind of embarrassed bc I was confused but I thought it wasn‚Äôt awful/too long, and look, I was just standing there holding a burger bun. It wasn‚Äôt on a plate that they could motion to or say something about.\n\nI left but as I passed back by the burger area I hear the worker talking semi-loudly to the people in line (~5 feet away? The dining hall was pretty loud though):\n\n(This is as much as I remember) ‚ÄúYeah, they kept telling me it was l an allergy and not a preference like three times but I was just trying to give them the burger. It‚Äôs the small things you know‚Äî‚Äú (pretty annoyed)\n\nI figured I was the asshole unintentionally and was racking my brain to try and remember the interaction, if they tried to give me the burger, how they acted, etc. TBH I should have just not mentioned anything at all and just said ‚ÄúNo cheese‚Äù and I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do next time or I‚Äôll just say my line once, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôll def. pay more attention.\n\nBut when I told my friends later, in private, they said I was probably just clueless and not an Asshole. So now I‚Äôm confused. The worker sounded really annoyed from where I was. I wish they had just said something to me directly so I would have known, but they‚Äôre not obligated to, so.\n\nSo, AITA for repeating myself about a preference and not realizing the worker wanted me to get my food and keep moving?\n\nTL;DR told the worker ‚Äúpreference not allergy‚Äù three times without realizing that the food was done and I should get it and go. Worker talked loud enough for me to overhear it (prob. unintentionally) and sounded very annoyed.",

      "description": "So this weekend my friends got me to go to a LAN party. I was already skeptical, it was about 20 dollars entrance fee and everything there is expensive to a 18yo dropout. I gave the thing a chance since they kept talking about it and asking me. I went there with horrible back pain from work, to be met with a bunch of Fortnite kids, my friends and some people I can't stand. \n\nAnyway, I give the shit a chance, I get some snacks and play some games with my friends. I'm already exhausted at this point when one person in the group tells me to play a specific character. I'm already 100% sick of everything and I end up telling my friend to fuck off, and I spent the remainder of the match just sort of passive agressively standing there, not doing anything. \n\nAfter this I call up my other friends, and my mates in the room overhear me telling the guys on the phone stuff like \"I want to fucking die\", \"I hate this place\", how i wasted my money, and how I should never listen to them again when they want me to do stuff. They go ask me what's okay, and I just sort of having a breakdown of sorts. I throw some of my shit on the floor, pack the rest and walk home. Then I deleted my snapchat temporarily and I've refused any contact with them since saturday. Am I the asshole here? I'm just ignoring them temporarily",

Technician came to my house to inspect the bathroom and the mold and what not so anyway turns out this pos house has plaster walls and the tub leaks hot water so its gonna keep spreading. The technician said first things first, a plumber has to turn off the water. The mold remediation company then does what they have to do INCLUDING a complete demolition of the bathroom and some kind of spray or something in the attic + we have to install a vent and completely redo the bathroom. Clearly, I don't have the money to do this because I'm fucking 20 years old working basically less than part time at a shitshow of a job + I'm in debt from school and I still don't even have my license or a car because I was lazy and waited too long. My grandmother who owns the house and lives downstairs in a seperate section (it's a family house) made poor decisions with her money and is basically always broke and my dad has very low monthly income from the state etc claiming disability  point is not one of us can afford all of this. Everyone is arguing with me because I'm deciding that there's no way in hell I can do this and if I can't it just won't get done so anyway I'm basically deciding to leave because my grandmother doesn't care she literally said \"you and your father can move or you can just move, i don't care\". So she's essentially ignoring the problem and willing to let it spread. I'm definitely 100% going to move but my dad has no where to go and since my grandmother is ignoring the problem eventually it'll just spread everywhere and my dad is at risk of getting sick because he has no where else to go. Either way I'm leaving but AITA? Sorry for the life story lmao",

      "description": "I'll keep this short. My girlfriend is like every other 22 year old girl these days and had an Instagram. At first it was just for all the routine stuff but maybe a year ago a pic of her on the beach (that cropped me out btw) was shared on a \"hotties of XXU\" account and overnight she went from like 1000 followers to well over 80,000. She now makes a substantial amount of money from IG and her sponsors and partnerships.  I was like mostly ok with this because she's not in college debt any more but she's completely given up looking for real work. She basically treats Instagram like her job, in fact she checks her google calendar every day it's so formalized it will say things like \"8 AM, post pic from Peak shoot, say \"inspiration is every where you just have to see it\" and then \"9 AM, follow up with BoutineLA about plane ticket\" and \"1PM, take selfie at starbucks...say \"can't make it through the day without a hit of the good stuff! tag #starbucks #scottsdale, #goodlife\"\n\n\nLike I said I dealt, but I really want her back the way things were. I don't want to be with just another IG girl. She recently was picked up a major swimsuit company for a partnership. She is supposed to fly to LA tomorrow and spend the week at one of the owners AirBNBs where she is going to spend the week shooting. I am freaking the hell out because I don't want her to go. At all. She's going to LA as part of a group shoot and even she describes it like it as \"its shooting photos in the early afternoon while the light is good then it's just a party until everyone goes to bed early.\" What she's not saying is there's going to be other guys there, her ass and sideboob are going to be on full display because it's just the way this company makes their suits and she says she's not going to be hit on? yeah right! \n\nI told her just now that I'm sick of her Instagram hobby and she called me an asshole because this is her job. I told her this isn't a job this is just some stupid shit she uses to fill the time until her boobs and ass sag and then where will she be. She called me an asshole again and stormed out. She wont respond to my calls. \n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "My husband and I are in the process of buying a home. We sold our last home and moved to this area last spring. We originally tried to buy here but there was nothing on the market we liked so we signed a lease and decided to wait. We used a great, very knowledgeable agent back then. Really nice, competent guy, who has been in the business awhile and helped a family member close on a home a couple yrs ago. \n\nWell, last summer my sister-in-law's bff Ann Perkins (not real name) got her real estate license. I have always really liked this girl. She's vivacious, bubbly, all around sweet woman. She is working full time as something else, and just wants to do real estate part time. She closed on her first home just last week so she's very new to the business.\n\nI shot her a question a few weeks ago about a property, and we texted some about that and another. She said she'd check in on a property and get back with me and then never did. \n\nWe felt uneasy going with her since she has no experience (and we watched the buyer of our last home fumble and bumble with a brand new agent and were not eager to live that again). A few days after she didn't get back with me, I reached out to our old agent and he immediately got on the ball (because this is his full-time job) and got us connected with a lender. A week and a half later, he rode around with us and we toured some properties with him. Literally while we're at one of the houses--which was one I texted with Ann Perkins about--I get a picture text from Ann Perkins asking if that was the property I was wondering about. Weird coincidence or small town talk? Hmmm.\n\nI never texted her back (this was last week) and just yesterday she texted me again asking if I got her text. I told her I did and chatted some about the property and apologetically explained that we'd gone with our original agent. I think she's upset and my husband is positive his mom and sister told her and the original text wasn't a coincidence.\n\nI feel guilty, but my parents even warned us to choose our agent wisely and I felt like going with Ann Perkins wouldn't have been the wisest choice (she gave us some bad advice about pre-approval, for example, that I only caught because we've bought a home before). My husband thinks we're assholes and now regrets going with our old agent (even though he prefers him and 100% shares my concerns about Ann Perkins). He says sometimes it's worth taking a hit or not getting the best possible deal for the sake of our social circle and to help a family friend out.\n\nTLDR: We kind of snubbed a family friend who recently got her real estate license to go with an experienced agent. Family friend is now upset and husband thinks we're assholes.",

During the movie, I kept moving my hand closer to his to try to make a move. He was either oblivious or not into me as he was on the complete other side of his seat, which is totally fine and I stopped. \n\nHowever, before the movie hit the halfway point, he had been on his phone 11 times. Scrolling through something and checking texts and such. I felt very disrespected by that, as well as really embarrassed that he was doing it. (His phone went off once and then he silenced it, but he never turned his brightness off. We were sitting in the back row, but the row was full.)\n\nI started to have a bit of an anxiety attack and couldn‚Äôt breathe and my leg was shaking. I felt as if this meant that he was so disinterested in me and couldn‚Äôt even handle spending a movie with me. I kept trying to convince myself to leave, and after the 10th time I had decided, but he did it again before I actually left.

      "description": "A few weeks ago my wife and I took a vacation for a week at Las Vegas and booked a room at a hotel on the strip. When we checked in, I tipped the employee behind the counter $50 and asked for a complimentary room upgrade, which they provided us with (becomes relevant later).\n\nFast forward a few days later, we woke up to get ready to find that we had no running water (no shower, sink etc.). I called the front desk to ask what was going on and I was told the water had been temporarily shut off, and that we could use the spa showers on the floor level or wait 1-2 hours and the water would be turned back on. We opted to shower at the spa because we didn‚Äôt want to lose upwards of 2 hours of our day. Vacation time is precious. The spa is on the floor level of hotel resort though, where there are stores around and a lot of foot traffic, so we‚Äôd have to trudge through a bunch of commotion to and from the shower.\n\nWe showed up to the spa and were sent to separate rooms for male/female. The spa consisted of a shared shower room with a door to each shower but pretty much open everything else. I hate shared public showers and was very uncomfortable with it, it wasn‚Äôt a very clean environment, And I had nowhere to put my change of clothes or shampoo, etc., so I was overall fairly bothered by the experience. I finished my shower and had to carry my dirty clothes through the floor level and up the elevator back to our room to finish getting ready.\n\nMy wife had an even worse experience. She mentioned that the clerk was extremely rude to her and treated her as though she was an inconvenience for trying to shower there. She didn‚Äôt feel comfortable in the showers either, also stating that it wasn‚Äôt very clean, and when she asked the clerk for a bag for her dirty clothes after her shower she received plastic bag to carry her clothes with her followed by some more rude stares.\n\nAfter already being upset and hearing my wife‚Äôs story, I went down to the front desk to complain while she finished getting ready. When talking to the front desk, I remained calm but let them know that the spa shower was uncomfortable experience for both of us and recounted the especially poor experience that my wife had. She never apologized, but instead mentioned that ‚Äúwe are not told when the water will be shut off. Sometimes the water is shut off in the morning and we are not even told until it happens‚Äù. I told her that I was aware that wasn‚Äôt her fault that the water got shut off and wasn‚Äôt mad at her, but that it resulted in my wife and I having a really poor experience. This also made it really apparent that this kind of ‚Äúwater shutdown‚Äù happens on a semi-regular basis and that they make no attempt to notify customers beforehand or take the initiative to make it right, just provide a sub-par and shower solution that is worse than what we have in the room. She offered to comp our resort fee for the day (worth about $40). I was unhappy with that and countered and asked isn‚Äôt there anything more that you can do for us? Do you have free buffet passes or anything? I was told they could only give me one or the other since they are equal value. From now till the start she had been extremely un-empathetic and I was still pretty pissed. She she must have noticed because she asked if I‚Äôd like to talk to her manager. I said yes.\n\nThe manager comes around and right off the bat has a face that tells me that he doesn‚Äôt plan to budge on anything. I gave him a shortened explanation of our experience and asked if there‚Äôs anything more that they could do for us. He just stated matter-of-factly that ‚Äúthe water was only shut off for two hours‚Äù, completely ignoring the fact that we found out without any prior warning, detested the showers, and (I am guessing this part did not get relayed) that my wife had a terrible experience with their employee. Furthermore, he mentioned that we had already received a complementary room upgrade (that I tipped $50 for) and that he wouldn‚Äôt be giving us any other compensation, and that was that. He looked at me like I was obviously trying to play up my frustration and he had me figured out. I was kind of at a loss for words and all I could say at that point was that ‚Äúthat is really shitty, man‚Äù and repeated that a couple of times. Where he then responded with nothing but ‚Äútoday‚Äôs resort fee is comped, you‚Äôre all set‚Äù and promptly walked away before I could say more. \n\nSince I had already tried to escalate to their manager, it became apparent that I wasn‚Äôt going to get anything else and decided to leave so I could get on with my day, albeit much more pissed than I was before.\n\nWhile I do admit that I was trying to get as much compensation as I could out of this, you never get what you don‚Äôt ask for, and I was legitimately bothered by my wife and I‚Äôs experience. This left a sour note on us that made has made us really dislike this particular hotel/resort and regret our choice a little bit. It was the Flamingo in case you‚Äôre curious - and I do hope they lose business as a result. \n\nSo, am I an entitled a-hope or was I justified in prodding for more compensation?",

      "description": "Ok so this was yesterday and I went to a school dance with my mates \n\nWhen we got there we hung around for an hour and then I saw a girl in the corner of the room and I asked her to dance (note: her date was on the other side of the gym talking to other girls and I didn't know he was her date) so we danced for about 2 hours and then he came back and said she was his date and I apologized and told her to go dance and hangout with him and she left.\n\nNot 10 minutes later I'm sitting talking to my mates and she comes up and grabs my shoulder and pulls me to the dance floor I told her this wasn't right and she told me she didn't like him anyways so we danced for 10 minutes while I tried to slip away from her. I sipped away after 10 minutes. \n\n\nFast forward to the end of the dance and her date ditched her I being nice walked her to her mom's car once she showed up.\n\n\nSo tonight I went to play cards with another group of my mates and we had a good time but I don't even know how but she followed me to cards she played for abit the whole time I'm feeling uncomfortable. \n\n\nWhen I get home I look at my phone and there like 90+ msgs in our friends group chat trash talking me and saying they are all gonna jump me when I got to school.\n\nI tried to explain what actually happened and everyone was saying what a piece of crap I was for dancing with her. I spend the next hour explaining what happen and they still ignore me and keep threatening and insulting me and I told her about this and she apologized for bugging me and making me dance I took screen shots and sent them to me and they ignored that so I cut ties with all my friends (it's ALL of the friends at school that bullied me) and the girl who danced with.\n\n\nSo am I the asshole for dancing with her be as harsh as you want I don't care anymore",

      "description": "Alright its valentines day time to get something settled that I've been wondering about for years now. My ex would constantly flirt with friends that made it clear they liked her and would let it continue past the point I was comfortable even when I brought it up. Once she went as far as to break up with me preemptively thinking she liked one of the guys. Afterwards though she would come back and apologize and I'd get mad saying she betrayed my trust or something but she'd tell me that I wasnt understanding her POV and that I was in the wrong. I usually ended up being the one comforting her because she felt bad for cheating. Idk if I can even call it cheating. Anyways we broke up permanently a few years ago and it's been on my mind ever since,  she claimed me getting mad was abusive and that completely destroyed my self esteem and worth. I'm sorry I know this probably sounds open and closed for some of you on both sides but it's been ruining me for the past few years and I have to get some sort of answer, she won't give it to me  ",

      "title": "AITA For not taking my daughter a concert last minute at the expense of another child?",
      "description": "So this actually happened in October and I really thought I made the best decision at the time. But it's now January and seeing how things have become, I'm wondering if I was actually so wrong. I'm using a throwaway.\n\nI have an extremely high conflict ex-wife. Last June, I finally got 50/50 custody of my 13 year old daughter. I spent thousands of dollars in lawyer fees and actually moved so she would have her own room. \n\nSo here is the main situation. My daughter and my stepdaughter (who is also 13) are HUGE Taylor Swift fans. They are obsessed with her. Don't ask me how but I managed to get three tickets. These were supposed to be each girl's only birthday gift from us. Both girls were so excited they cried.\n\nA week before the concert my ex calls me and says she got her own tickets for the concert and she was taking my daughter. I was pissed off as hell but it was technically her custody day so I didn't have any way to fight it.\n\nSo I offered the extra ticket to my stepdaughter's best friend instead. \n\nThe concert date comes and in the morning I get a call my ex saying that the tickets she bought were fake and that I had to take my daughter instead.\n\nAt this point my stepdaughter and her best friend had a sleepover, watching Taylor Swift videos all night and just getting themselves excited out of control. The friend's mother wasn't even in town because we agreed to keep her the weekend.\n\nI could not for the life of me tell this child that she couldn't come and that she had to stay at home while someone else went.\n\nI thought of sending the three girls themselves and wait outside but no one agreed that they should be sent to a concert by themselves.\n\nI had to do the extremely shitty thing of telling my daughter while she was bawling her eyes out that unfortunately she couldn't come this time but I promised her I would take her and only her the next time Taylor Swift is on tour.\n\nOf course, this didn't calm her. We went to the concert. The two girls had a blast while I was absolutely depressed. My phone was buzzing all night with phone calls and texts from my daughter.\n\nI could not salvage the situation by trying to take her to a different city because that was the second last North American date. I could not find tickets.\n\nEver since then, my life has become absolute shit. My daughter refuses the 50/50 visitation that I fought years for. I tried to get it enforced and the cops ask me if they want to drag her kicking and screaming. Of course not. So it's back to weekend visitations except she doesn't want to them at my house so I see her at my parents' instead.\n\nMy daughter has done a total 180 in her attitude towards me. We used to be so close. Now, she is rude and disrespectful to me and will bring up the concert literally every time we meet. She has cried to my parents about how we treat her stepsister better then her, which is completely untrue.\n\nThe worst has been my daughter turning her friends in school against my stepdaughter and her friend. They literally had no fault in this. But they are now isolated and bullied in school. My wife and the friend's mother are furious and we've been fighting a lot.\n\nI understand my daughter is upset but this was completely out of line. She has always been a sweet kind girl. This is completely out of character. And I can't even discipline her for it. My ex even refuses to allow me to take her to therapy.\n\nMy father told me yesterday that they changed their will so most of the inheritance will go to my daughter because they are afraid I wont be fair when splitting it up.\n\nIt's their money and they can do what they want with it. But the meaning behind this move really made me depressed. I love my daughter more than they can imagine.\n\nSeeing everyone pile up and blame me is really making me wonder if I really did such an asshole thing? \n\nI'm paying the original child support. It will go up because I have my daughter less then before. We are stuck in a house with higher mortgage payments that has an extra room no one is using. And my poor stepdaughter and her friend are being bullied. This breaks my heart the most.\n\nI thought I made the right choice. But maybe I should've broken that girl's heart for the \"greater good\"? I didn't think it would get as bad as this.\n\nTL;DR My ex said I had to take my daughter to a concert last minute using a ticket I promised to another child. I said no.",

      "description": "So, bit of a back story, my roommate got sick and has bronchitis. Obviously she can‚Äôt help it, the cough itself isn‚Äôt the main problem, but my issue with this is she won‚Äôt close her door at night. (This has caused issues for other reasons, such as being loud with friends or her not turning off her alarm). If her door is closed the sound isn‚Äôt that bad, and certainly doesn‚Äôt wake me up at night, but my door is broken and I can hear everything clearly. She stays up very late at night, so I have been waking up at 2-3 in the morning everyday for the past week because she won‚Äôt close her door and her coughs are VERY loud. Since I have 2 jobs and school, sleep is very important for me,  I have been unable to fall back to sleep so basically I‚Äôve been living off 3-4 hours of sleep a day. \n\n\nI‚Äôve asked her to close her door before, for other reasons, but she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal and didn‚Äôt take it too seriously. I‚Äôm not sure if I should approach the issue because I am pretty sure I would look like an asshole. \n\nSo, give me your opinion, AITA/WIBTA if I confront her?!  If so, how can I confront her about this without looking like an insensitive douche? ",

I‚Äôm suppose to be meeting with a girl who I like this Wednesday alongside her Sisters and mother, my mom didn‚Äôt trust me to meet them going by myself so she insisted that she comes with me to meet the girl and her mother which I am fine with. But she told that she refuses to go with me if I didn‚Äôt get my haircut and if she doesn‚Äôt go then I can‚Äôt go since I have no one else to take me (I can‚Äôt drive yet) I like a lengthy amount of hair but my mom doesn‚Äôt and think it‚Äôs makes me look ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù which I have never heard anybody say I look homeless or seen people make that accusation besides her. I personally think I look more my age with my hair. But when I get a haircut I just get a sudden drop in self esteem and when I look in the mirror I don‚Äôt feel good about myself and I personally think it looks bad for and it doesn‚Äôt seem like ‚Äúme‚Äù if that makes sense. I often end up in a bad mood which my mom notices and it leads to big arguments. I forgot to mention that either way I would‚Äôve gotten my haircut eventually but I only got it sooner because of me meeting my crush this Wednesday and I‚Äôm honestly kind of scared of meeting her now. Because I don‚Äôt feel good about myself anymore. I hate more that I don‚Äôt really get much of a choice either or some sort of compromise even though it‚Äôs MY HAIR.

We would always do childish stuff like moan or yell ‚Äúpass the weed‚Äù if we were on the phone with our mom. As we got older it turned to stuff when we were around (or OTP with) our gfs/exes we would say stuff like ‚Äúwhich one is that?‚Äù Or we‚Äôd name drop a friend of theirs as jokes. All the people in the past have caught on and understood that it was jokes so it has never been an issue. Now him and his current gf have been together for 3+ years. She knows the deal because we (all of our friends) do it a lot to each other. So We‚Äôre all cool with his girlfriend (despite her calling us gay for our friendship), but it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre calling or texting her but if she‚Äôs around or OTP We‚Äôd say hi and have a quick conversation. So recently I went to his house to chill and talk about something and she was on FT w/ him. I heard her voice  and said ‚Äúoh is that Sierra (his and girlfriend friend) you need to tell your girlfriend about her already (the type of things we all say constantly) then I laugh immediately like I always do then she says ‚Äútell gorilla to stop playing right now‚Äù she sound mad so I assume they were arguing and he looks kinda mad. He said he‚Äôd call her back and catches me up. Apparently she thinks he‚Äôs cheating with Sierra (he‚Äôs not) and they were arguing about it just before I came. She calls back a few minutes later and they go back at it and she says ‚Äúsee even your friend knows‚Äù he says ‚Äúyou know he‚Äôs joking‚Äù and I basically see that as my cue to leave. I dap him up and leave and they‚Äôre going at it. Last time I seen him he was mad and just basically called me an asshole but in a passive aggressive way. I think they might of broken up and my ‚Äújoke‚Äù added fuel to the fire. I just didn‚Äôt think to much about it as it‚Äôs something we always do and usually she‚Äôs would say that he‚Äôd cheat with us before another girl, or joking say ‚Äúoh is that right John I‚Äôm going to go find a new man right now‚Äù so I never thought she‚Äôd ever take it seriously. If it bothered her and she told him he would‚Äôve told us. At the end of the day you guys decide. I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong given our history but I could be wrong. \n\nTLDR: joked about my friend cheating, in front of his gf, with a girl that she already suspected of him of cheating on her with. This may have caused them to break up (or at least add to the reason). ",

      "description": "So this happened about a year ago. I still kind of cringe when I think about it. He picked me up from my apartment, and decided later that he would drive himself to work, and I would take the car back and leave it at my place, and I could come get him with his car at the end of his shift. Perfect. \n\nEverything goes according to plan, he drops himself off and drive home. A few hours go by and it's time to go get him. I try to start the car and it won't start. I try again. Nothing. **Shit**, the battery is probably fucked (with my luck of course.) So I tell him and he gets really mad. So I go pick him up in my car and take him back to his car. \n\nHe told me the battery was drained because I'd left the headlights on. Now, it was the 2nd time I've driven his car, again, I took control of the car *after* he had already been driving it. It was mid-day, sunny and clear out. Unbeknownst to me, he turns his (manual) headlights on no matter what. The sun could be blinding from the north, south, east and west and he would **still** turn his headlights on. When I turned off the car and got out, it didn't make that beeping noise that cars usually make when you leave your lights on, and since it was bright out, I couldn't tell that they were on. \n\nSo to make the rest of the story short, he was **furious**, we had to end up jump starting his car. I offered to pay for a new battery, which ended up not being necessary in the first place, apologized profusely and felt like a huge piece of shit for like a week. Obviously this was in the past and it's all well and good now, but I still wonder from time to time if I'm really 100% to blame here. \n\nIn my defense, though, who turns their lights on in the middle of the day? And how was I supposed to know that, especially when his car wasn't alerting me when I was getting out? ",

They were mostly the kind of stuff you would find on r/darkjokes, so I made a joke to my friend *whispering* in his ear, \"When your dad beats you for eating the painkillers but you can't feel the belt.\" And we both burst out laughing. \n\nBut then this girl that was eavesdropping ***two*** seats behind me said that what I said was extremely offensive to her because she was abused by her father. So my friend stepped in for me and says that he was abused by his father too, and he didn't get offended by the joke. And then this girl starts telling me and him to stop, and right after she said that, my friend says \"I'll stop when my dad stops beating my mom.\" \n\nThat's when we fucked up. She started crying and half of the class turned against us. They started yelling at us and telling me and him to apologize. So I say sorry, and this other girl says that it needs to be an actual sorry. From there I actually get pissed. If I don't actually feel sorry, a sorry that isn't heartfelt is more than enough that I owe, and got very to tempted to say something like;  *I feel so bad that you were eavesdropping on us and got offended by something you shouldn't have ever heard.* but I just kept my mouth shut knowing that I would just get myself in more trouble.\n\nSo now that I discovered this sub I want to know, AITA?",

      "description": "In today's world no one seems to ever wanna slow down and take a minute to ensure the task is thoroughly complete before shoving you out of the way for the next person. This can be witnessed at the checkout line, the post office line, the lunch lines in school, DMV lines, practically anywhere there is a line of people waiting. I get that technology is changing the way things are done and helps speed up the world in many useful ways. However, when I'm standing in line and I have to take my wallet out of my purse to pay for an item and I have to wait for my bags to be filled and the cashier to hand me my change ( or my receipt if I paid with credit), and I have to put the receipt away and my card or change back in my purse, I do not move out of the way until everything is fine. That's not too say I take my time doing so, I just don't move out of the way the minute they start ringing up the next person if all my stuff isn't put in my wallet and my cart, until it is. I always turn to the next person in line and apologize.\nHowever, this particular time the words of frustration escaped me before I could stop them. The scenario is the same, I'm putting my stuff away and the cashier starts ringing up the next person when the cashier turns to me and says, \"excuse me, would you mind moving somewhere else to do that (by that he meant put my credit card away) so I can finish ringing up the next person?\" I just looked at him and said, \"I'm sorry sir, I'll just be a minute.\" and turned to the lady behind me and said, \"I'm sorry ma'am, I'll be on my way in just a sec, sorry for the inconvenience.\" She seemed fine with it and said no problem at all, the clerk, however, seemed rather annoyed and couldn't control it. As I was walking away he said to the last that was behind me,\" I'm sorry ma'am, some people are just so inconsiderate of others!\" I wanted to, and I almost did, but just like the clerk, I couldn't control it so I turned to him and said, \"do yourself and everyone else a favor. Go buy yourself a pocket dictionary and pull it out before you use words with more than 4 letters. You sir, are the epitome of inconsiderate!!!\" I wished I could have basked in a glorious moment, but as soon as I said it, I felt bad for doing so.",

      "description": "I have a fairly complicated last name. It is long and most of the letters are unique (only appear once).\n\nThat being said, I've worked for my current company for a while now. My name is spelled properly in the Active Directory system. It's on all of my emails and my email address itself is firstName.lastName@company. We have one of those \"work social media\" things and it's spelled right there. They've almost never had an issue with it.\n\nJust recently, however, they've been putting out documents to the office with my last name in them, and it is constantly misspelled. I'm even working under a new manager who mispronounces it because he's saying it in it's misspelled form. The most aggravating part is that it's close. It's like someone tried to spell it correctly and gave up halfway through. The first time I noticed, I brought it up and was told it would be corrected. Then it happened again, so I brought it up again and was told it would be fixed again. Rinse and repeat two times.\n\nI just got another email with a document that has my name misspelled in it this morning, and brought it up in our morning meeting. Today I was met with, \"Hey, you're still getting paychecks aren't you? It's not like we're calling you bad names. Don't worry about it so much.\"\n\nEveryone else seems to be of the same opinion that I should just let it go. So am I really the bad guy here?",

      "description": "My GF (21) and me (23) have been together for roughly 5 years now. After 2 years I moved away to study. It¬¥s roughly a 5h ride, but we decided to give us a try.\n\nThings weren¬¥t always easy, but we managed and were super excited for this long distance relationship to finally end sometime this year. My GF actually made me say a few times, that when I¬¥m back, we¬¥ll move together, so I thought that this was the plan and I was excited about it, since being in a LDR for 3 years really sucks.\n\nMy Gf is in her first semester and kind of unhappy.\nShe doesn¬¥t want to just study and then start working right after since that¬¥s a \"boring life\". \nShe is now playing with the idea of moving to another country and staying there for maybe ~3 years or something like that. Yesterday was the first time I¬¥ve ever heard of this idea.\n\nI knew that she wanted to travel and maybe go to England for a year, but she has never spoken about going anywhere for longer than a year.\n\nNow I really want her to be happy and believe that a relationship that started in such a young age, will only last if we both can do what we want to, and have no major regrets later on. Obviously, this does not mean that we can just hook up with other people, but you get me.\n\nAfter she told me of her potential plans, I told her that I don¬¥t think that I can stay in this relationship, if she leaves the country for a few years right after I came back. I told her that I wanted to try a LDR since I believed that 3 years are manageable and we both are young, but 6years+ is too much. If it would be 1 year, then sure w/e, I can manage. But any longer? I just can¬¥t and honestly just don¬¥t want to anymore.\n\nShe told me that I¬¥m an asshole for telling her that since I had the chance to leave home, but she doesn¬¥t get that chance.\n\nI totally get her point. I grew a lot by moving away and I really think that it¬¥s a great experience. But if I knew that this LDR would last 5; 6 or even more years, then I would not have agreed. We are together for 5 years, but we haven¬¥t lived with each other for longer than maybe 1 month at a time. I don¬¥t know if this relationship actually can last when we are living together.\n\nI don¬¥t want to wait until I¬¥m at least 27 to find out if we can actually be together for good. By then I want to start talking about kids. I don¬¥t want us to \"waste\" our 20s, because we are both stuck in a LDR, especially since this is our first real relationship, which makes this whole thing a lot more difficult already.\n\nI really want her to do whatever she thinks she needs to be happy, but I don¬¥t want her to be surprised if I end the relationship after she made the decision.\nI also don¬¥t want to influence her decision by telling her, that we won¬¥t make another 3+years in a LDR. But I think it¬¥s only fair, that she knows what I think and feel, or am I wrong/ an asshole?",

The situation that made me post this was about something that happened today. She was going through my younger sisters test week grades and talked about some very bad grades she had gotten infront of me then said \"you are doing better then your sister\" I then told her \"normal parents don't compare their children\" she then responded by saying \"I'm more normal then you\" this didn't really bother me that much because I am kindoff used to her passive aggressive nature, but it still kinda hurt me because i've really been dealing with some insecurity issues lately.\n\nSo I was wondering AITA?

      "description": "So for those of you who live in places with seasons this might not make much sense to you, but here in Florida it is sweltering non-stop. I'm renting a room out of a small house near my university with someone I know from high school, and he keeps telling me not to turn the air down from 77 to 73 because it could break the AC. I told him that I was paying rent and the utilities were included with the number (which he just raised by 100 because he just moved to another city for a job and wants to buy another house out there), and he told me these were the rules and \"buy a fucking fan\". That didn't sit well with me.\n\nBeing in the computer science program at my uni has helped me meet a ton of different engineers, including one of my best buds who now works as a project planner/construction manager for a hospital. I asked him about the loudest fan he could possibly get me and he really came through with a fan that they use to dry floors which essentially sounds like a small air craft is taking off in my room. I told them that I got the best fan I could find so the AC shouldn't be a problem anymore. So for the past week I have put that fan on full blast while I am working on my stuff and they are starting to tell me that this needs to stop, and I just keep telling them \"It's hot in my room but this fan really does the trick\".  \nAITA for being petty after rudely being told to fix the issue?",

      "description": "In Oct of 2017 my mother crashed her 2012 dodge challenger and supposedly got me a car, a 2012 Chrysler 200 that I quickly adored. I named it crystal, full pun intended. \n\nShe said that i could have it as fully mine when I could afford to take over the payments, which is fully valid and understandable. The thing is, she got it financed for 5 years at $400 a month. She did this knowing full well that i have a physical disability where I cant work enough to afford that any time soon, as I'm 18 living on my own with entry level skills and cant afford to get further education to make a better living. Well, more like my mother dropped me off back in my hometown with my brother who can barely support his self so I'm barely doing the same. \n\nShe was visiting last week, which was nice. She was staying with her best friend to help her after she had her reconstructive surgery, as she has had a double mastectomy from breast cancer. As i was driving home with my liscense i had gotten that morning, she was talking about selling the car but doesnt know what to buy when she does. \n\nI offhandedly mentioned how that i really do need a car now, since shes taking her car back to NC when she goes back. She popped off with \"hey its your car, I'm just using it till you can afford its payments\" and i said something along the lines of \"its not my car, its your car. I understand the sentiment of you calling it mine, and that's sweet, but its been your car from the start and you knew I wouldnt be able to afford to pay for it.\" \n\nShe was enraged by this. She yelled at me for about 5 minutes on how she hates the car and got it specifically for me and she absolutely hates it. Well, i just shut up at this point. Ive always been the kind of kid to tell her and show her my appreciation and love, but I flat out told her how rude it was even in good meaning but not thought out or taking enough Things into consideration. And for the honesty its made me feel like a piece of shit son. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I can understand why, but there's also parts of me saying that I'm not but that could be pride/ego. ",

      "description": "I met someone at the start of my freshman year of college, aka 6 months ago, who seemed somewhat lonely. The more I got to know him, the more it seemed like he didn't have any good friends. At first this was a hunch, but I came to realize that many people knew he had autism and thus distanced themselves. That upsets me still. \n\nWe started out as coworkers and one day I said something along the lines of \"that's what friends are for right?\" one day after work. It seems like it hadn't registered to him that I'd been acting as more friendly to him than I had to other coworkers. From then, we've become good friends. \n\nHe's a good guy. He has a very bright life ahead of him. I do enjoy hanging out with him time to time, but... Things have gotten a little stressful. He calls me once, sometimes twice a day. He has some magic way of finding me wherever I am and giving me massive, exaggerated hugs (even at formal or quiet events,) he always wants me to go over to his house for dinners (which usually lasts past dinner,) and recently he said he wanted to take trips to my house over summer break. He's come to saying we're like brothers and yesterday, he said he \"could see a lifelong friendship developing.\"\n\nNone of this is unreasonable for friends, but I CAN'T HANDLE THIS. I'm one of the busiest people I know. The responsibilities I've filled my time with represent some of my greatest passions in life. And outside of work/class/my volunteer work, I have many other friends with varying degrees of connection. Not to mention that sometimes I just want to be alone with space to think, but he doesn't seem to understand that (\"come over to my place, it'll help you relax!\") \n\nThere's also just something about the intense way he refers to our connection. I like hanging out with him, I think he's a good guy... But I don't feel such a strong connection to be able to call him my brother. This may sound cold, but I don't know if I want any lifelong friends. Maybe one or two of my friends fit that bill, but he's not one of them. I'm extremely independent and with the vast majority of my friends I expend more energy hanging out with them than just being alone. For me to want to know somebody for life, something about them has to hit me, it's a very specific type of connection and I don't feel that with him.\n\nI just don't know what to tell him. Whenever he mentions our friendship so passionately, I feel uncomfortable because I have to act like I feel the same way. Obviously I can't just break off the friendship, that would definitively be assholish. But I don't know if I should sit down with him and explain all these thoughts either... That would almost certainly hurt his feelings to tell him I don't want to talk to him everyday right? And saying I wouldn't be sure about being lifelong friends... I should probably leave that out either way right?\n\nPlease give me some guidance",

Bradley and I have had issues with each other in the past, usually stemming from the way that he treats other people. According to him, he has a disorder that converts stress into pain (conversion disorder, for those interested). Because of this, he usually refrains from feeling/expressing any emotions, even those outside of stress. This wouldn't be a problem if he could figure out how to still be nice to people, regardless of how he feels (or doesn't). A good example of this would be that at one point, he made a joke to a more distant friend about selling nudes of another close friend, we'll call him Jack, in exchange for borrowing a calculator. When Jack found out about this joke and was understandably upset, Bradley continued making jokes. It took three of us ten minutes of telling him that his actions were inappropriate, he hurt a Jack's feelings in a serious way, and that he needed to apologize, for him to finally give a measly \"sorry bruh\" (direct quote, by the way). Issues like this happen a lot of the time, and almost always involve him refusing to understand that his actions are hurting other people (even when directly informed)\n\nNow, on to the main issue.\n\nI consider myself and Alex to be close friends, and they have told me they feel the same way. In Alex and Bradley's relationship, Bradley's refusal to recognize when he is hurting others causes frequent issues. When that happens, Alex will often vent to me. The issues range from accidental hurt feelings to deliberate, admitted manipulation. Alex has BPD, which makes them what most would consider \"high maintenance\" as well as easily hurt, and easily manipulable. Bradley knew about this before the two of them started dating. Bradley also thinks himself to be an expert on any and all mental illnesses, to the point where he says he \"cured (his) own depression but then gave it back to (him)self again because it was boring not being depressed\". He tries to cure Alex of their BPD, manipulating them using the silent treatment, among other things, to try to basically train them out of their behaviors. I have BPD as well, which is one of the big reasons Alex vents to me - I understand their point of view better than an otherwise mentally healthy person would. Bradley feels that Alex is too sensitive and impulsive because of their BPD, and is trying to fix them. I feel that what he's doing is hurting them, and he isn't a licensed therapist, and so he needs to just be more considerate of their feelings (or end the relationship if he can't handle dating someone like Alex)\n\nNow, I know if I were just shoving my nose in out of the blue, I would be the asshole. Toxic relationship or not, it wouldn't be my business. However, before doing anything, I asked Alex if they wanted me to intervene, and they said yes, and that they appreciated having someone try to defend them. They also said that it might help Bradley to understand what he was doing wasn't OK if it was coming from an outside point of view. \n\nBradley, however, does not know that Alex is OK with me involving myself. He sees it as me sticking my nose into places it isn't wanted, and has started treating me somewhat badly because of it. I can clearly tell that from his point of view, I am the asshole. But from mine, he's the asshole. So, reddit, what do you think?\n\ntldr: Two friends are dating, pretty unstable relationship. One asked me to help try to keep the peace between them, the other sees me as rude for sticking my nose where it doesnt belong. AITA?",

I was like yeah she's very condescending towards you and me. My gf gets pissed at me and says you can't say anything about them. \n\nI bring up how she talks shit about my SIL and brother.

      "title": "AITA for not returning a dog I found/adopted to their previous family.",
      "description": "I'm sorry if I'm a little descriptive with my writing... I want to emphasize the state of this dog, not to defend myself, but to give a clear picture of why I did what I did.\n\nA few weeks ago I found a Lhasa Apso in my back yard. The dog has clearly been neglected for some time, as he had horrible mats on his face, the size of clementines where his mustache hair should be, a sharp plastic like mass on the bridge of his nose where his eye goop had coalesced, severe matting on his sides, stomach, and hind quarters, and was covered head to toe in his own filth.... The dog smelled like a sewer. The dog was wearing a faded collar that was rusty on the metal bits with no tags (name tag, or county registration/rabies vaccine tag as required by law), and attached was a 6 foot length of vinyl coated braided cable that looked to have been cut.\n\nIt was 22 degrees F outside and snowing hard, with about 2 inches of snow on the ground and this little dog was prancing around leaving brown streaks in the snow as he went. I managed to snatch up the lead he was dragging around and walked him up and down the alley to see where he would go, or see where his tracks led, but he was so excited by everything around, and cars had been up and down the street so I couldn't find his house of origin, and honestly with the state he was in I didn't want to.\n\nSince there was no way this garbage dump of a dog was going anywhere near my car, I brought him inside and cleaned him up. I gagged from the smell as I bathed him but he was agreeable the whole time, and even while I picked twigs out of his mats and picked the dried dingle-berries of his hind quarters he didn't put up a fight.\n\nI took him to a nearby shelter the next day and was turned away because it was a city shelter, and I had to turn him in to the county I found him in. They checked for a micro chip, which he did not have, and were clearly disgusted by the state of the dog. They didn't say anything specific, but asked me if I had taken pictures, and advised me to keep the collar and lead to give the other shelter \"Just in case the owners come back\". The nearest shelter in the county would be closed by the time I got there so I would have to take him the next day.\n\nWe are now 3 days in, and I have been monitoring craigs list and stopping by near by vets to check for missing dog posts and found nothing, though at this point my motivation was to file animal cruelty charges. I found several ads for shi tzu dogs stolen in the area, but none for him ( he is much larger than a shi tzu and has inique markings).\n\nIn the days I've had him I noticed he has many bad habits that make it hard to adopt out. He barks when alone, he tears up anything he gets his teeth on, he has major food aggression, among other things. Things that are manageable or can be trained out, but not good news for a shelter dog, especially an older dog.\n\nI took him to the shelter and I asked about adopting him. They were thrilled and told me there is a 3 day wait period while they monitor lost dog ads and give the owners a chance to claim him. They expressed concern over how I found him and took the lead and collar.\n\nAfter 4 days (the shelter was closed due to the ice and snow, adding another day for the owner to seek him out) I got a call that I could come adopt him, but I had to pick him up between 3-6 PM or he would \"No longer be available for adoption\". I can only speculate what that means, but I assumed the worst and picked up the dog after work.\n\nFast forward a few more days. I'm walking the dog and an older woman and her 16 year old daughter come running up. The dog immediately recognizes them and jumps up to the daughter.\n\nThe mother tells me that it is her dog, and I tell her that I just adopted the dog and describe the way the dog was found. She tells me that I was lieing about the smell and filth on the dog, but she knows about the matting, and says she just had other things going on in her life. I had a long haired dog once when I was near being homeless so I can relate to not being able to afford a groomer, but a hair brush costs a dollar so I wasn't particularly moved. I told her that I needed to talk to my wife about it, because I can't just give up the dog without her input. She agreed and I took the dog inside.\n\nI told my wife what happened, and that I thought they were nice enough people. The woman was very kind and the daughter seemed to really love the dog. We agreed to go out and discuss how we found the dog, why it was tied up outside, and give them the dog if they could assure us his conditions would improve.\n\nThat was the plan anyway, until we came back outside and the woman came running at my wife swinging, shouting \"I'll fuck you up, you fat bitch, if you don't give me my dog back right now I'll beat your ass every day until you do you nasty bitch! You'll see a side of me you've never seen before!\" as her daughter struggled to hold her back.  My wife told her that we adopted it and he had clearly been neglected, and asked if she had called the police, which she had. My wife told her that since she was threatening her and trying to attack her she was calling 911, which she thanked us for so they could drag our \"nasty dog stealing asses to jail\". She shouted that she saw me sneak into her yard and cut the lead and run off with the dog as she went back into her house.\n\nThe police arrived and we both gave our sides of the story separately. We showed the paperwork and tags to the officer and he said that we followed the law to the letter and had no obligation to return the dog. I asked what she had told him about why the dog was outside in the first place in weather that cold. She told him that she had only put him out for 10 minutes (which is the legal limit you are allowed to leave a dog out in the cold in our county) until she saw me sneak in and take him. The officer said it wasn't his place to judge who's story was true based off hear say but noted she never called it in. Based off her time line the dog had been missing for 3 hours before I found him. When the officer asked her why there were no tags found on the dog she said that she \"Keeps them inside where they are safe\" but could not produce them when asked.\n\nI have always taken in strays, and made my best effort to find them their homes, or find them new homes if I cannot. I have 3 cats, and 2 bearded dragons (and 2 room mates) from this habit. I really was not in the market for a dog, especially one with behavioral issues that need to be worked though, and ultimately don't think I will be keeping the dog after I have done what I can for his behavior. I have been wracked with guilt over the whole thing. I am NOT happy about taking away a young girls dog... but there is no way that dog is going to go back to them. \n\nI stand by my decision to keep the dog, and my friends and family say I did the right thing, but I hope to hear the judgement of an unbiased group.

      "description": "Background: 13 year relationship with my fiance, some points off and on, but mostly on. Live together in a house we bought, have a dog, etc. I don't like beer, but always like to taste everything for science.\n\nLead up: Go out to dinner at a pub. Reviews said service can be slow. I order water, she orders random draft beer. I get my water right away, it takes her 15+ minutes to get the beer. We are sitting next to the bar and see those drafts going out left and right, seems like just busy. Joke around, speculate why it's taking so long, having a nice time. During this wait, we are sharing my water and since she drank it last, glass was on her side of the table. Waitress puts beer in front of me as from her perspective it made sense since I didn't have a drink in front of me. \n\nIncident: She walks off, we look at each other. A few seconds go by, fiance doesn't reach for her beer, I decide to do it for her and decided that while I have the beer in my hand(all about efficiency), might as well take a small(really small) sip to taste since I would do it at some point anyways. Put the glass on her side of the table and see her giving me a \"look\". Demeanor immediately changes and I start getting the cold shoulder. A bit confused, try to pry out what's wrong, but just silence. After a few minutes she asks me do I really not realize how rude I just was. I am still not 100% sure what I was rude about, but obviously something to do with me tasting her beer.\n\nConclusion:  Giving me cold shoulder for rest of the night, maybe 10 words exchanged max. Next day similar, again brings up that I was rude. I disagree. Me best guess is it's not that I had a sip as we share food all the time (see water above), but maybe it's because I had the first sip especially since it took so long to get to the table. I don't believe this exact argument has come up before in the 13 years, but she has expressed annoance if I try to eat off her plate at the same time as she has a fork in her own plate (so fine sharing as long as I am not disrupting her creating a \"perfect bite\") AITA for taking the first sip or overreaction on her part?

      "description": "Two bits of background: I (m24) recently broke up with my girlfriend (f25) of 3 years because she was abusive and manipulative. She belittled me, threw things at me, and would try to convince me I was making it seem worse than it really was.  Also my father died of pneumonia when I was 5 and I do not remember a thing about him. I was raised by my mother who did damn good job. We have a solid, positive relationship and we've never had a blowup fight like this before now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my mom about the break up and about why, without getting to specific. My mom  was upset because she really liked my GF and hoped we would eventually marry. I told her that while I was still upset now, I didn't doubt that I would find someone else, thinking she was just worrying about my being lonely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom then told me that she hated how people ‚Äútreat relationships like paper towels‚Äù and throw them away as soon as things get a little rough. I told her a little more about , letting her know that it wasn't on a whim that I had left her. My mom told me that If we had stayed together my ex would have probably stopped the abuse and we could have settled down together. I was getting kind of mad now because my mother was telling me I should have stayed in an abusive relationship. I told her that abuses don't usually stop abusing and if we had married, did she want her grandkids being raised by an abuser? She kept shrugging it off and saying we could have worked things out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I asked her if she would stay in a relationship with a man who called her an idiot and threw things at her. She said if she hadn't, I would never have been born, because when she married my father he did hit her a few times. I was shocked because I had only ever heard good things said about my father. She told me that if they ever got into fights it sometimes ended with a slap across the face, but that after she had me, he almost never hit her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was still pretty pissed from the rest of the conversation and said ‚ÄúIf any of that is true, then no, you should not have stayed with that bastard long enough to have me.‚Äù  She flipped the fuck out and started yelling at me that he was a good man and would have been a good father to me.  I said I was probably better off without his influence in my life.  We kept arguing and soon I just left and went home. This was yesterday evening and I haven't talked to my mother yet today and don't know what to say. I know she's wrong for trying to defend two abusers. I also know that what I said really upset her. I feel bad about making her feel bad, but I really did mean what I said.  AITA?",

      "description": "I met \"A\" through mutual friends about 10 years ago, and we became very close. He was the best man in my wedding and we had a lot of shared interests and passions.\n\nSo eventually A‚Äôs wife left him, after a long period of steadily increasing toxicity in their marriage. Ten weeks later, A moved in with ‚ÄúM,‚Äù the new woman. I don‚Äôt believe he intended me to know this. Aside from some \"let's get together sometime\" that never came to fruition despite my sincere efforts, contact between us substantially ceased completely.  \n\n\nAlmost exactly a year later, A contacted me out of the blue asking to meet and asked me to be his best man when he married M. I didn't give him an answer at that time, but expressed several reservations which, over time, solidified into a hard pass. They were:\n\n* A was presuming on a friendship that he had essentially killed by his own choices (not his lifestyle choices, but specifically his ignoring-me choices).\n* Although I took into his account his repeated assertions that their relationship was much healthier than the one with his previous wife, and that he was very happy, everything else I knew from a distance was negative. A relationship that progressed extremely quickly to cohabitation presumptively tending toward marriage, while he was, by his own subsequent account, still a wreck from his previous failed marriage, and which had, once begun, and which had resulted in the severance of most of his other social relationships (danger signal!), and in which there were financial, practical, and, I‚Äôm sorry to say, professional reasons to stay in the relationship, left me with the impression that his decision-making was probably compromised. \n* Also, I morally object to premarital cohabitation, and he always had as well, which meant that he was now in a relationship which was inducing him to contravene his own stated morals and beliefs, another nontrivial danger signal. But also, even if he had undergone a moral epiphany and was ok with it, I wasn't prepared to endorse it.\n\nIn a subsequent conversation, I told him that I'd stand up in his wedding on one of three conditions: That the couple make other living arrangements until the wedding (then some 8 months distant), or that they immediately get married by a judge, or if their premarital counselor could convince me it was wise. He promised to consider these and discuss them with M.   \n I'm not sure whether he considered or not. We continued to interact casually, but eventually he called me up and told me he was up against a deadline for tuxedos and needed me to answer one way or the other. I told him my concerns had not been dealt with and that unless he had new information for me, the answer was still no. I attended the wedding as a guest. And I've been struggling with the decision ever since. AITA? ",

      "description": "AITA here?\n\nOk, so, I have really been sitting here thinking on this one because I genuinely don't know if i'm in the wrong. I actually created an account just to tell this story here and get opinions lol. I don't have any negative feelings towards the people in this story, in fact I really enjoyed meeting them and did have a nice time, so this isn't to bash them, just to hear what people outside the situation think.\n\nSo the other night I was drinking at home watching Netflix and swiping through Tinder. I am a female and have my tinder set to only show me other females. Any girl who uses tinder will tell you this is kind of a nightmare because you get absolutely bombarded with \"hey girl my boyfriend and I are looking for a third xx\" messages or just straight girls who will talk to you for hours but never actually meet up with you. Because of this I RARELY meet anyone from tinder (I think i've met like 3-4 people ever) but this night I think a combination of me being drunk and bored made me a little more open.\n\nSo I get a message from a girl. We'll call her Taylor (not her real name). She asks what i'm doing and we chat a bit about how we're both at home drinking. This is when she mentions a boyfriend. Right away I was like \"mmmmm idn\" but she didn't act like most of the couples that normally contact me, which is that they pretty much immediately make clear their intention of bringing you in to have a threesome with them. In fact, she said that her boyfriend was in and out doing some stuff, and that she was just hanging out alone for the most part. She asked if i'd like to come over and drink with her. Now, I need to make this very clear: what was said to me was \"do you want to come over and have some wine with me and hang out\" she then added \"no expectations\" and said that she just wanted someone to chill with. She did add that she found me attractive (based on my photos) but what I was getting from this conversation was that she was not bringing me over with the expectation that I was to sleep with her (or her and her boyfriend) but of course if things happen, they happen.\n\nI know that right away people are going to call me naive and say that tinder is just for hookups but of the people that I have personally met on there, these were my experiences. One was a girl who I ended up not having a connection with but we did hang out a few times as friends. The other two were guys. One took me out to dinner, no real connection, didn't speak again. The other had me over to his house for drinks and was respectful, didn't try to sleep with me at all. Tried to meet up with him again but due to him living a few hours away it didn't work out. So I just want to make clear that in my experience, not everyone on tinder is just looking for you to come over and fuck them immediately. In fact, I have friends who have met their boyfriend or girlfriend on tinder and didn't sleep with them the first time they met.\n\nNone of this would probably have ever ended up on reddit were it not for what was apparently the worst thing i've ever done (sarcasm) .. not telling this girl before I went over to her house that I was on my period.\n\nSo I arrive and I meet Taylor and her boyfriend. We'll call him John. She was right about John mostly being in and out as he left a few times to take out the dog, to go to store, etc. Nearly the entire time I was there I spent sitting on the couch with her, talking makeup, hair, pets, etc. Pretty casual topics. After about an hour or two John is home for good and Taylor suggests a drinking game. We play the drinking came for a while (cards) when I go down the hall to use the bathroom. When I leave the bathroom and go back into the living room I see they are gone. I hear \"in here!\" and realize they are in the bedroom.\n\nSo.. I go into the bedroom where Taylor is naked and John is partially undressed. I get up and sit on the bed and look her dead in the face and say \"I just want you to know, i'm on my period\". She says she doesn't care and begins to undress me, where I then tell her again that I am on my period, and she says \"you are, really?\" but doesn't stop anything. We all hook up, but it becomes mostly Taylor and I or just Taylor and John since I am limited to what I can do. The entire time I really felt like John was not into this, at all, which I totally understand. I kind of just made the best of the situation even though I didn't know these people at all or where their boundaries lie, I kind of just followed Taylors lead.\n\nAnyway, I end up calling a cab afterward and go home and pass out.\n\nIn the morning I wake up to texts from Taylor which seem pretty casual. \"Did you get home ok?\" etc. Pretty soon she starts discussing what had happened the night before saying \"I wish I had known you were on your period\" to which I reply something along the lines of \"yeah sorry, that just felt like an awkward thing to say to someone you haven't met before you come over when you aren't sure what is going to happen\". The fact that she said so early on in our tinder chat \"no expectations\" kept replaying in my mind.\n\nI'm not going to go into too much detail about what was said, because it would get too graphic, but basically, she said that it felt more like her and I just hooking up (it did) and questioned why I didn't allow John to penetrate me. Honestly? John didn't seem too upset to not have that chance (he was really, really stoned also lol). I also told her I didn't want to assume that John was ok with something like that and it's an awkward thing to ask of someone you've just met, especially in the middle of the \"moment\". Some guys are cool with it, and some would be disgusted at even being asked to have sex with a girl (and a girl they don't know!!) on her period. This went back and forth for a while, with her basically explaining that it was a big disappointment for her (but not John, apparently? She said he was cool either way and was just really high and wasn't too concerned) and me saying sorry over and over in every way I could think to. One of the last messages she sent me ended with \"... because that was NOT a threesome\".\n\nI've been left feeling very guilty and as if I did something wrong, ruined their evening or wasted their time. It upsets me too because I really felt like I connected with them (whether that connection was purely platonic or whatever, who knows, but I had a GREAT time hanging out with them, laughing, drinking, talking about our country vs Johns home country, etc).  \nI almost felt... shamed? If that makes any sense, for not telling them that I wouldn't be able to do certain things and for not giving them a night that was up to their expectations, even though I went there without the premise that the night was about sex. I just felt bad, and guilty, and like i'd somehow made a huge mistake that had wasted peoples time. I still think Taylor is a really nice person and I could absolutely see us being friends (or more) in the future, but i'm not sure that'll happen now lol. I spent much less time with John and haven't texted with him at all but I did also find him really funny and interesting to talk to.\n\nSo... am I the asshole for not telling the girl I met on tinder (and her boyfriend) that I had my period before going to her house for drinks? Should I have said something before I found them in the bedroom? If I am the asshole, should I just not meet people on tinder at all when I have my period?",

There's just barely 11 months between our last two kids and I'm freaking tired and sore.\n\nMy pregnancy has been rough the last 2 months. The baby was breech up to 37 weeks and when he finally flipped the unexpected pressure caused me to end up with several hemorrhoids that I had to have removed and left me nearly incapable of walking. He went breech again and this morning I was in the hospital to have him flipped again. They told me I was full term and good to go into labor at any time but being that I had three more days to 39 weeks they couldn't induce me because of insurance purposes. Given the baby has gone breech twice, which would mean I needed a c-section, I was not eager to have to wait it out and risk him flipping again. \n\nWe came home after the successful flip, I went and layed down for a nap and woke up to contractions. Given I was having some decent contractions I wanted to go for a walk to hope to speed things up. Like I mentioned I'm very tired being pregnant. I also historically have had very long labors with my shortest one being 8 hours from the time of checking into hospital to birth and my longest being 74 hours from check-in to birth, my third being 36+. \n\nMy husband got upset at me because I was trying to walk and speed things up and he wanted to go to his kids swimming class. I got upset because I didn't appreciate his kids swim class being more important than me possibly going into labor. I never asked him to stay home with me, although I do believe he should have and in the end I adamantly told him to go to the swim class because I was so angry he was trying to get me to go sit down and slow things down.

      "description": "This all started around November 2018 when this friend of mine called me out and asked me to tell her the details of my mental health issues (I have aspergers). It was messy night of me crying and her literally making me tell her everything \"that's wrong\" with me. Of course I didn't speak to her for a while after that.\n\nWe made up on new years eve but didn't speak for a month or so after. A few weeks ago she called me at 10pm telling me she had been kicked out of her house (she's 23 and this happens often) and her mother wouldn't even let her get some shoes. I send her money to get a taxi (about ¬£20) and she turns up an hour later with no shoes, soaking wet from the rain. Of course I feel sorry for her so I sit her down and pour her a glass of wine and give her my cigarettes. This of course is totally fine to me, don't think twice about it.\n\nI tell her I'm away from 11am until 1am the next day and she says that's okay. I get back 1am on the Sunday and she's drunk with my parents and says \"duanxiu i smoked all your tobacco and took the money from your room\" and I say that's fine.\n\nThe next day we had a family dinner scheduled at a family restaurant and of course they invite her. On the way there she asks me if I'm buying tobacco, which I say yes I am. We finish dinner which my parents pay for and we go home. I have 2 bottles of wine, one is an expensive white one that I love and paid for, the other is a cheap red. I tell her the white is mine and that she will have to drink the red, at this point she starts telling me that it's unfair because she doesn't like red wine and that I'm being mean to her. I'm annoyed but I oblige and give her the expensive wine and she continues to smoke all of my tobacco. \n\nThe entire 5 days this has been going on she has been telling me she will pay me on Friday (she left on Tuesday) so It's fine with me as long as she pays some of it, I don't want it all, she's in a bad situation.\n\nFriday comes and she sends me ¬£20, the taxi money. I don't think this is right but I don't wanna say anything so I don't but it troubled me, so I asked my family and friends and they all said I should just ask her for ¬£10 and I was like... okay.\n\nSo I do, I send a polite message stating that \"I know you're going through a hard time right now but could you possibly send me a tenner for the booze and tobacco?\" and the next day she responds with \"This is the most disgusting message I have ever received.\" I tried defending myself that i'd sent her a polite message asking for 1/4 of the money I spent on her but she continued to say cruel things to me so I blocked her.\n\nLast night she sent me a message that I haven't opened but it starts with her apologising. I haven't responded and I don't want to but I feel like an arse for ignoring it.\n\nAITA for ignoring this message?",

      "description": "Every year my immediate family makes an effort to have a Christmas with both sides of our family, this event on my Dad's side involves traveling about seven hours by car and staying in a small town and spending time with an uncomfortably large number of relatives that I don't really know well.  I decided I'm not going and, my family, especially my mother, is very upset by this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give some background, this is the first time in a couple years that I am physically able to make this trip due to past medical issues, also, this is the first time I am not living with my parents, so they can't pull any my house my rules crap.  Before that when I was able to go, I never related much with anyone there.  I am quite introverted, living on my own now, I enjoy choosing when to socialize and who to socialize with.  Having grown up in a family is everything kumbaya type of culture it took me a while to figure this out.  I don't consider family to have any special meaning, I'm pretty indifferent towards extended family, and I honestly don't like my parents.  I do make the effort to visit and meet up with my parents every once in a while and I'm going to the other Christmas on my mom's side, which is a smaller travel and time commitment.  But all gatherings with them is a chore for me that I really don't enjoy, and I draw the line at them taking up so much of my time and social energy at Christmas.  They will never understand this and I'll never tell them that I don't really like being around them, obviously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's it, my main reason for not going is fuck traditional families stick together culture, I don't feel like making the trip.  Am I an asshole?",

C and I have been on extremely shaky grounds since December, however, our relationship with each other has improved significantly since them to the point where I would have classified us as somewhere between acquaintances and friends. \n\nLast week, we held elections for the positions that needed to be filled next year, C was the one facilitating the elections. Since everyone who ran for a position ran unopposed, everyone received the position that they ran for, including A and I as co-presidents. C named us co-presidents and wrote our names next to ‚Äúpresident‚Äù on the elections chart we made on the board. \n\nToday, C sends A and I an email saying that she was reading the club constitution because she was bored and that there can‚Äôt be 2 presidents and there can only be 2 Vice Presidents. She told us one of us had to either step down or we had to hold re-elections. \n\nI replied saying that if that is the case then the constitution should be amended and that I am unwilling to step down since we have already been elected. They proceeded to reply that the constitution can not be edited at all and that it was difficult for them to have co-presidents this semester. A said that she feels that we should respect the constitution and that she feels that we could have worked well together but if the constitution doesn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs possible to have co-presidents, then we should do re-elections. C then proceeds to say that she will send out a poll to vote between A and I (which at this point I still have not agreed to.) I then said that I would rather not be in an organization that changes its decisions when it‚Äôs convenient for the presidents gain. C then says Sounds good and says I‚Äôm absolutely welcome to drop out of the club if I want to. \n\nI then went to speak with the faculty advisor of the club who agreed that we should keep the position that we were fairly elected to and that the constitution can and should be amended. The current constitution also states that it is possible to amend the constitution. C then says that this sounds good but to be sure to add that if there are 2 presidents then there can be no Vice President. I told her that was not acceptable considering we elected a Vice President at the last meeting. She then says that she will talk to the faculty advisor tomorrow and then I requested to be part of this conversation as well to ensure that my voice wasn‚Äôt lost or misrepresented. C and Ch then both respond saying that they are going to speak to the advisor during class and that I can‚Äôt come.\n\n I have not responded since then, I‚Äôm genuinely incredibly angry. I feel like I‚Äôm being made out to be the bad guy in this situation. Am I the asshole for refusing to step down from my position?\n\n",

The moment I get it all set up with the games back on and downloaded, my bfs little sister wanted to play it. Long story short she played way more than I did, always wanting to be first to play, and first player on the one multiplayer game we had, Pok√©mon let‚Äôs go evee. She changed my whole character on fortnite, except for the emotes. Typical kid stuff, nothing I wasn‚Äôt expecting but a little annoyed at her taking over and not letting me have a go at my own gaming system. I maybe played for 10 minutes. For this, I wouldn‚Äôt have moved my switch. \n\nYesterday, I was home from 5pm (when she‚Äôs back from after school program) and I decided around 7 or 8 to play fortnite with my bfs brothers gf. The moment I go in to get my game, she asks if I‚Äôm playing, and I said yeah, she asked if she could play. I said no she asked why, and I replied because it‚Äôs my turn. She said please (I love it when she asks nicely but hate it when she is told no and starts begging.) I told her no and she said please again. I told her if she keeps begging she won‚Äôt get what she wants. I leave to play with my friend on fortnite. Eventually her bf comes and tells me his sister wants me to come to her. She would usually come in or ask to come into the room where we are. But she wants me out. I don‚Äôt, because I know that she wants the switch and I want to play on it without her trying to take over it. She gets upset and her mom talks to her. We talked today and I figured out that she didn‚Äôt want to give something to me like she told my bf, she wanted the switch. I‚Äôm thinking she wanted me to come out because her mom was there and to pressure me to either giving up the switch for her to play, or say no and she gets upset in front of her mom, making me look like the bad guy. After this behavior yesterday, I had taken the switch from the living room and put it in my room. Anyone can still use it, but now it‚Äôs under my supervision. AITA for doing this?",

      "description": "Writing this for a friend:\n\nI‚Äôm a small business owner who has a pretty dope site with a ton of small (tasteful) style features. Of course it gets complicated when designing the site which I take a very hands on approach alongside freelance developers. I don‚Äôt mind paying for what I want and to make it look amazing (the site gets redone seasonally).\n\nI have icons on a menu that were working fine until they turned into little error messages without any changes having been made to the site. Everyone working on the site and the customer service for the services I use all say that it‚Äôs a problem on the hosting side. Ok, so I call the hosting service (hint: the largest one) and the customer service representative says I‚Äôll need to speak to premium support and pay $50 and hour to fix my issue. If this was development there would be no problem but all indications point to it being the host‚Äôs issue that I have not messed with in a long time so of course I‚Äôm not going to pay that so I decide to keep this guy on the line forever (I have multiple phones) since he‚Äôs not allowed to hang up. Fuck it if they want to be scummy I‚Äôll cost them money and get this guy some overtime pay, he didn‚Äôt complain, or really comment at all at that.  \n\nIt‚Äôs been a few hours now and I‚Äôm down to run this marathon till the cows come home from pasture and then some.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTLDR:\nWeb company wants to charge premium customer service to fix their error so I‚Äôm holding the free customer service representative hostage over the phone. I‚Äôm not stingy and have paid for all manners of site service before no problem.",

      "description": "This might be long. Okay so my dad used to worked overseas he came back home a few months ago and less than a month before his trip he tells me he's bringing a French bulldog with him I didn't know about it. Now the landlord said no to dogs but his cool so he allowed. So I should mention that my partner and I shared a house with my mom and brothers along with our toddler.\n\nAnyway he comes home with the dog everything was okay bc he would care for the dog well in August he leaves to work in another state leaving the dog in my preteen brothers care the first few weeks they all about the dog but lately we gotta remind to take the dog out, give the dog food, bring him back inside and everything. Now when they in school I do all of that. But recently when his outside early in the mornings (bothers leave him out before going to school) when I'm asleep he starts barking idk what he's barking at but I'm woken up by it and so is my son. \n\nSo I'm talking to my dad a few days ago and he tells me he's coming for Christmas so I asked him if his taking the dog with him and he tells me yes to which I said good bc I'm tired of being woken up in the mornings by his barking also I heard the neighbors complaining. He then starts going off on the phone about how we got his expensive pedigree blue collar dog out in the cold and rain and how we just don't care about the dog and that's probably why he barks so much, he keeps talking without giving me a change and I'm like we don't let ur dog out in the cold okay it's not always cold here and when it rains I take him out on the leash to the front yard to do his business but he just keeps on saying how expensive his dog is and we should care for him better he's yelling at me when he should be talking to my brothers. I'm getting fed up with his yelling so I tell him that I'm not responsible for his dog bc I never ask for one and that he needs to talk to my brothers bc it's their responsibility, now he's all offended and mad that I said that and he said he bought the dog for us and that it's a family dog. I told him again I'm not responsible for a dog I never asked for bc I got better things to care about like work and my son and that he's only saying it's a family dog bc someone gotta take care of it and that he only got the dog to breed and make money and that when he starts making money from it, is it gonna be for everybody? no, it won't. So he kept going off and before he knew it I had gave the phone to my brother.\n\nI also told him it's a good thing my partner and I getting our own place soon bc I'm pregnant and had always suffer from insomnia which is also why I'm tired of being woken up by a barking dog in the mornings like i need my sleep and i want to enjoy it as much as I can.\n\nAnd of course I still watch after the dog.\n\nSo AITA for telling him I'm not responsible for his dog?

When I found out that she was seeing this boy, she pleaded me not to tell my parents, and initially I agreed.\n\nBut a few days later, I realized that having a boyfriend was a huge distraction for my sister. She was dwindling a bit on the studies front. She was really smart, and I wanted her to get into an extremely good college.

It was the most painful week of her life.\n\nBut fast forward one year, my sister has just gotten into UCLA, a very prestigious school.

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nWe (90 kids) are on our way back from a geography excursion, and we are catching public transport (bus) back to school. Half of us got on the first bus and even with our group being split up, surprise, seating was a bit of an issue. Luckily it was the middle of the day and the bus was nearly empty. \n\nMy mates and I run up the back being and get seats first. Everyone else gets on and all the seats are now full, obviously a few people are standing up. I see a friend of mine (C) go up to a girl (F) and ask if he can sit next to her (she has her bag on the chair taking up a space). She says no and my friend just continues up to the back and stands. I ask C what happened and he tells me F was saving it for a friend. I give C my seat and stand and don't think much about it.\n\nHalfway back to school I notice F still has her bag on her chair, it didn't look like the friend she was saving the seat for planned on showing up. Bit of background info, F is bisexual and very out going. She has been bullied (the teachers know about it I think it's mostly stopped) in the past about it by people I am in no way involved in. C is also quite shy but otherwise a very nice person, also not involved in the bullying. I go up to her, and knowing her personality (she is very emotional), I do my best to be as non threatening and as easy going as possible. I ask her if either myself or C can sit there, as I've noticed that the seat is empty except for her bag. F then groans and goes \"omg can't you just leave me alone!\". She seemed pissed off. I'm confused so I ask why can't I sit there. At this point a few of the girls behind her are telling me to piss off etc. One of them is my mates gf and I don't want to get into the shits with her so I leave it at that and go back to my mates.\n\nFrom the way people responded it seems like I was being a dick, which is why I brought this here. If I am the asshole an explanation as to why would be great.\n\nTL;DR: Ask a girl to move her bag because the bus is packed and there are no seats. She responds as if I've slapped her. AITA.\n\n",

      "description": "So me(24/F) and my roommate, let's call him G(27/m), have recently moved in together. We were not very good friends beforehand- but since we moved in together, he has been trying to be my best friend. I state this because it feels like it makes him feel like he can get away with more things and cross more boundaries this way.\n\nHowever, the major issue at hand for me is financial things. He eats my food, and justifies it by saying he made a meal for us- when I didn't ask for it. I don't have that kind of money as someone who's out on her own for the first time. The MAJOR issue is that he insists on turning the heat up to 80, when we pay gas separately. We decided on a 50/50 split of all utility bills which was great for me at first. So, I decided to talk to him about this and tell him that 80 degrees especially during springish weather is not financially smart and I would prefer him to keep it lower. He would then go behind my back later, after I turn it down, to turn it to something like \"79\" so it's not technically 80.\n\nSo, being at my wit's end, I ask him if we could change the dynamic of the bills considering he sees a higher temperature as something worth it to him- whereas for me, that high of degrees honestly has me sweating. \n\nHe says no. He says that in the adult world, that's one of the challenges you deal with as roommates, and he doesn't consider it a \"50/50\" roommate arrangement if I'm only paying a third of the heating bill. So, I decided I'm going to get a smart thermostat that connects to my phone- and will allow me to lock the temperature from being changed while I'm gone, in my room, etc. WIBTA?",

She was diagnosed with cancer when we were all still in elementary school so we tried our best to help. When she asked, we would get her water or make her food most of the time.\n\nOf course, us as kids, we would getting annoyed with it sometimes (we would have rather continued playing games or whatever) but never out right refused anything from her. \n\nAt the time of this incident, our cousins were living with us and they had 2 daughters who were also close with my grandma, they would hang out in her room her and just be really sweet with her. \n\nMy great aunt (her sister) took her to an appointment (something that she rarely did). When they got back, me and my siblings were all called downstairs. They told us that the cancer had come back, and my great aunt started telling me and my siblings (11, 13, and 15 years old at the time) how we needed to step up and if we didn‚Äôt we were going to be banned from our grandma‚Äôs funeral. My great aunt told us that my cousin‚Äôs daughters took care of my grandma more than we did. We were all really hurt by this since we did the best we could to help our grandma. \n\nAlmost 3 years later, me and my siblings have never been apologized to. My grandma eventually passed away and we didn‚Äôt even hold a funeral so she couldn‚Äôt ban us from that. I don‚Äôt really see my great-aunt a lot but when I do she acts like nothing ever happened and i‚Äôm still really hurt by what she told me. \n\nThere‚Äôs probably way more I could add on background but I think I got most of it. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for holding an almost 3 year grudge against my aunt?",

I didn‚Äôt find her physically attractive anymore. \n\nI asked her friend what they did at the gym. Her friend told me that they didn‚Äôt go to the gym together. She had apparently never trained my girlfriend. When we went on dates it would be our ‚Äúcheat days‚Äù so we‚Äôd be eating unhealthy foods. Apparently she was still eating badly almost every day. \n\nI met with my girlfriend, broke up with her for lying to me and getting unhealthier. \n\nA lot of people are telling me that I‚Äôm an asshole for breaking up with her, because I should never have tried to make her lose weight. Plus, by lying to me I got healthier.",

Now this Saturday finally worked and it was also great because it‚Äôs valentines day this week so we can celebrate that at the same time! So I‚Äôve been looking forward to this for a while. We‚Äôre not gonna do anything fancy, just lay in bed watch stupid movies and drink prosecco but I love these moments. \n\n\nBut my boyfriends sisters birthday is on the day after, Sunday, and when he asked what she was going to do to celebrate it on Saturday she said she would just stay home because non of her friends could meet that day. So he invited her to our date night, he also invited her out on Friday when he‚Äôs going out with his friends. He didn‚Äôt ask me beforehand and later told me what he did. I just got really disappointed and he said he would make it up for me next Saturday. I told him okay but that I wasn‚Äôt super happy about it.\n\n\nI thought more about it today and I really wasn‚Äôt happy about her joining our date night. I asked him if he maybe could ask her if she would be fine just going out on Friday because Saturday is our date night. He said he would talk to her, but now I feel bad. I get that it sucks not celebrating you birthday by going out, especially when you‚Äôre younger. But I don‚Äôt want to lose the date night because it‚Äôs been such a long time and I really love them! And we are going to celebrate her on Sunday with their family but I get wanting to go out and get drunk. \n\n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting her to come and asking my boyfriend to uninvited her?",

      "description": "My best friend likes KPOP a lot. With the recent League of Legends opening ceremony, they released a song sung by a KPOP band, but also sung by a made up band of LoL champions. (KDA) I told my friend that I was finding myself really liking that song, but the parts in english where they have a VERY strong accent throw me off and make me kind of annoyed. She shared some of her favorite songs and I found a few that I liked and a few that I didn't. I complimented the videos and the music on their aesthetics (which wow, it was like going back to the 90s with NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys aesthetic!) and sometimes their music. (She likes softer, upbeat tunes while I like rockier ones)\n\nI thought I was being pretty respectful and then another song had some particularly bad lisping/mangling of the English words in the song and I straight up said, \"Oh I didn't like that. That was annoying. I wish they would actually learn to say it properly.\" She became uncomfortable and told me that they were speaking the english words like a korean would (with associated pronunciation/accent) and that I was being racist. I told her that it wouldn't matter if it was an English native with a lisp or speech impediment or if it was a non-native speaker, it would be annoying to hear mangled english. Their race doesn't matter. \n\nI don't know if that was one of her more favored songs and she felt a bit attacked or if she genuinely misunderstood me. (Maybe I could have said it better?) Or hell, maybe by today's standards I'm a closet racist, which would be news to me. We dropped the subject and moved on, but it's bothering me that she would think I'm racist. I don't want to bring this conversation up with her again, but next time she wants to share her hobby interest, I'd like to not come off as an asshole to her.\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole, and if I am, how the hell can I not be?\n\n\nEdit: In case anyone cares: a day or so later she was listening to some KPOP and we were chilling and she mentioned how she couldn't get over what I said. I admitted that what I said sounded pretty racist, and I showed her mumble rap as an example and explained a bit more kindly that I just kept getting thrown out of the music by random misspoken English because I had to think too hard to understand it. We're cool again. Thanks y'all.",

It's any. \n\nWhenever he doesn't get his way my friend acts like this. He doesn't want me agreeing or taking sides it seems.

      "description": "Sorry, I‚Äôm not quite sure how else to word the title.  Essentially, the situation is this; A few days ago I left my debit card on the kitchen counter overnight. The morning after, I came downstairs to find it was gone, but I figured it was probably just my mum or my dad tidying up. Later that day, I went into my banking app to find I had about ¬£40 taken from my account from a tombola website, and ¬£40 put into it from hers. I‚Äôm not entirely sure why she had to use my account but I was entirely bothered considering she‚Äôd put the money back in. \n\nThis has continued since then, with me going into my account earlier this evening to discover she‚Äôs spent about ¬£210, and only put back in ¬£130. Which has kind of ruined my plans for the rest of the week. I‚Äôm a student at college on minimum wage and every time I‚Äôve tried to bring this up to her as it making it difficult for me to save for uni, she gets defensive and says things like ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt really saving though, are you?‚Äù implying I‚Äôm spending my money badly even though she‚Äôs the one making...choices. \n\nAnyway, she‚Äôs said the money she owes me is going into my account and she‚Äôll give me ¬£20 on top but I really just want it to stop. I suspect the reason she‚Äôs using mine is due to a block on her, prior to this I had no idea she was so addicted to online gambling AND this is in the wake of her losing her job. Also tiny little AITA - she asked me to buy her some stuff the other day that came to ¬£15. I wouldn‚Äôt mind but the stuff in question was a bottle of vodka and coke, so I think I‚Äôm in the right to ask for that money back too. ",

I also looked to get some help to figure out what I wanted to do for a living and I found that rather quickly, there is a formation that could take me even though I didn't have a highschool diploma, so I'm currently trying to do that, but to be eligible I needed 6 month of traineeship.\nThat school also provide formation in alternation with a company. \nSo I have been contacted and doing traineeship with a hospital in my region to be able to pursue the formation and then doing it with the hospital when the formation begins. \nHere I am now currently doing the last week of traineeship to unlock the formation and the guy above me is asking me if I want to do another month of unpaid traineeship (the first ones were unpaid as well). The thing is that when I work I can't find time to do sport or usually I'm too tired to do so, I also want to focus on my diet maybe find a psychologist and find an apartment for my future studies.\nI liked my stay the staff was nice and I learned a lot, I want to continue to work with them with the formation center but I think I need time in between this traineeship and the beginning of the formation. Will I be the asshole I take this time for me and say no for another month ?\n\nIf you read so far thanks and have a good day.",

      "description": "Throwaway because I don‚Äôt want this tied to my main account. \n\nMy husband and I have been together for 7 years and married for 2 years. I am a lawyer. He is in grad school. \n\nBefore I went to law school, I asked my husband where he thought he wanted to live and raise a family.  I enrolled in law school in the state that he chose with the plan that I would take the bar there and then we would live there indefinitely. Of course, things change and I‚Äôm open to moving to a new state and taking the bar again if that‚Äôs where life takes us. \n\nRecently, my husband decided that he wants us to move to a different country once he graduates from grad school. He has an informal offer for a job in this country. I told him that I‚Äôd be open to him taking the job and doing long distance for a while if it‚Äôs his best option, but that I‚Äôd prefer that he look for a job locally. This made him upset but he brushed me off when I asked him to tell me what was wrong. \n\nA few days later, my husband brings up the foreign job again. I reiterate that I‚Äôm open to doing long distance but I would prefer that he stay here. He says that he wants me to be open to moving with him. I tell him that I‚Äôd consider it but, in all honesty, I can‚Äôt imagine ever wanting to move to this country. Moving to this country would mean giving up my career. I‚Äôd have to start all over with a new career in a country where I don‚Äôt speak the language. \n\nThis upsets my husband and he drops this bomb on me: that he resents that I prioritize my career over his career. \n\nHe‚Äôs not totally wrong, we are prioritizing my career but not in the way that he thinks. He thinks that I believe that my career is more important than his. That‚Äôs not true. I think his career is equally as important as mine. \n\nThe thing is, he can do the SAME JOB here that he plans to do in foreign country. His argument is that he doesn‚Äôt have any offers to do this job here but that‚Äôs because he hasn‚Äôt applied to any jobs here. \n\nStaying here for my career would mean that he would get to do the same job. Moving countries for his career would mean that I would have to give up my career and start over. So, yeah, I‚Äôm prioritizing my career but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm wrong for doing it in this particular situation. His point is that he would make more money in the foreign country so I‚Äôm holding him back by not being willing to move.\n\nPeople we‚Äôve talked to about this are pretty split. My friends are on my side but they‚Äôre MY friends and they‚Äôre all lawyers so they‚Äôd obviously agree with me. His friends are all on his side. His family is on his side. My family is split. I‚Äôm starting to doubt that I‚Äôm on the right side of this argument. AITA?\n\nTl;dr: my husband wants to move countries for his job. This would mean giving up my career. I said I don‚Äôt want to do that. My husband says I‚Äôm prioritizing my career over his. ",

      "description": "AITA for being mad at my friend? \n\nSo last night was my birthday and me and some friends got together to celebrate, we met at friend 2's place to pre-game a little. One of my friends (friend 1) was from out of town, who I hadn't seen in while and while we were walking up to the bar I offered to get everyone's tab. I'm pretty well off and just wanted to thank them for celebrating, they had offered to get me a drink before hand but I planned on drinking a lot too.\n\nFriend 1 asked me why I'd do that and all I said was that they are my friends and I can pay for it and that was that. So when I went to the bar and said I'd cover it, Friend 1 said no and said he and my friend 2 we're covering. Now after that I was decently drunk, it was my birthday so you know, but I heard friend 1 saying to friend 2 I was being really passive aggressive about the tab, like it bothered him. He was right next to me and I could clearly hear him but he wasn't talking to me, still I asked him about it and he told me to forget it? Later after that he was actively ignoring me the whole night and excluding me from all conversations, specifically calling over friend 2 and 3 to look at something on his phone or to talk to just them and didn't say to me a word all night.\n\nLater on drinking as much as I did I threw up on the walk back to friend 2's place, I was throwing up but I wasn't blackout, I could walk and stand nobody was holding my hair back per say. friend 1 started bad mouthing \"seriously are you doing this right now?\" \"whats your problem lebowskiman85\" I stopped to throw up for 30 seconds and then we continued to walk back, I didn't say a word and just went to sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I was drunk but I cant help to think friend 1 was being a passive aggressive asshole or AITA? I'm really confused on it honestly.",

      "description": "One of my mom‚Äôs co-workers throws a big party every year at his house. He invited me (through my mother) since I was in town last weekend. I am 22 and everyone else at the party ranged in age from 25-65. \n\nI didn‚Äôt really know anyone there and my mom‚Äôs (new) co-worker‚Äôs date didn‚Äôt either. The co-worker/girlfriend, who is in her early 30s, had been drinking a bit but was having a good time, talking and dancing with her co-workers. \n\nHer date, who wasn‚Äôt dancing, started talking to me. He asked me about college, what my are plans after graduation, etc. It turns out that he had a lot of friends who went to my high school so we chatted about that. I think the conversation lasted about 10-15 minutes. To note, he was drinking a beer and I don‚Äôt drink at all.\n\nThis evening, my mother told me how inappropriate I was with her co-worker‚Äôs date. I had no idea what she was talking about. We were simply talking about mutual people we knew and my college life. She told me that her co-worker had just started dating him and he broke it off with her sometime after the party. My mother said something about how pretty I am (I‚Äôm average), I can get any guy I want (pfft), why pick this guy (I didn‚Äôt?), etc. I had no intention of stealing someone‚Äôs guy from them, especially a guy who is in his early 30s, when I am in my early 20s. (I‚Äôve never dated anyone more than two years older than me so more than ten would be a lot!) \n\nFor some background, I am a very nice and friendly person which, I guess, could be misconstrued as me being flirty. I can be pretty shy in situations where I don‚Äôt know anyone so when her date started talking to me (we happened to be sitting near each other, alone), I was excited to have someone to talk to. We didn‚Äôt go into another room or anything, and his date was within eyesight of us, only about 20 feet away. I was talking to other people throughout the evening but they were much older than me.\n\nAnyway, did I do something wrong or are my mom and her co-worker overreacting? Obviously, I will be avoiding her work parties from now on!\n",

      "description": "My sister, as much as I love her, sucks at taking care of her tech stuff. Her laptop is filthy and barely works, her phone has many scratches, and she has had dozens of phone chargers, because she either brakes them or looses them. A few months there was a little drama over her buying a 20$ phone charger with my dad‚Äôs credit card without asking, a charger that she of course, lost last weekend. And when she has no charger she often takes other‚Äôs like nothing, which annoys me a lot. So today, I arrived home with 10% of charge left, I connected my phone and tried to kill time on my laptop. She then suddenly opens the door and takes the charger while telling me she‚Äôs in a hurry and needs to take it. To which I replied fuck no, it‚Äôs not yours. She started freaking out about her issue and how serious it was, so I told her that if she want it she could charge her phone there, but I wouldn‚Äôt allow her to take it elsewhere. We started arguing, cursing, etc. She eventually agrees but keeps cursing at me and insulting me. I got so pissed that she was insulting me in my bedroom, so I told her to ‚Äúget the fuck out of my room‚Äù. She told me to shut up and to which I lost it, so I lifted her up and pulled her violently out of my room. Now I feel like ass, because I could have simply allowed her to take it and avoid that shit, but I was just so damn tired of her shitty attitude. AITA?",

We arrive and of course, all my aunties immediately surround us and want to cuddle/ hold my 9month old as we havent seen any of them for 2 or 3 months so me, being the pushover i am said 'sure' \n\nAt first everything is fine, im sitting at same table as my aunties and the baby can see me, so she is calm and happy. After a few minutes the aunty holding the baby steps away from the table and mingles with some of my other family. The baby was ok at first but as she was taken further and further away from me i can see she is getting a bit grumpy.\n\nMy aunty doesnt pay any attention to this and instead decides to let about 3 people that i dont know hold my kid! Like it was no big deal! After being palmed off to the third random person the baby loses her shit and so do i. \n\nI stormed over to my aunty as she was trying to settle her, grabbed her and said 'if you could stop handing her to random people that would be great', shot her a filthy look and went back to my seat. I could tell she was a bit shocked and hurt, and my husband said i probably overreacted... \n\n\nTL:DR- aunty mingling with party guests i dont know decides its a good idea to let random people hold my baby and is surprised when i get angry \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Ive interviewed seven candidates (out of 30 applicants) for one job i need filled asap. \n\nI narrowed my selection down to four people. Theyre all pretty much equal in experience, knowledge, and confidence. Ones a bit more charismatic than the rest but really thats just superficial.\n\nIll be honest, I did actually look at their social media. Its connected to their LinkedIn so its kinda hard to resist.\n\nOne woman out of the four is imo completely off the rails politically and ideology wise. Not just disagreeing but expressing outright hatred and disdain for the other side (which i subscribe too). Posts basically saying that this half of the country is stupid and morally bankrupt. Also a lot of posts that i consider to be trolling or meant to provoke.\n\nIdk it just weirded me out that someone could seem so normal in person and have such strange beliefs. I never would have connected the dots from our interview and text messages.\n\nSo I basically wrote her off for it and went with someone else. My wife thinks that may be illegal (i dont think it is, just to look at the social media of someone) and that even though the woman is a poltical troll that maybe i shouldve just ignored it. In general she agrees with me though that the posts are provoking. But what do you guys think.",

      "description": "Hi guys,\n\nI just want to know if I am an ashole. Momentarily I live in another country then I was born in...I have lived in this country for 8 years. For 6.5 of those years I was not able to work or even save. Since a year ago I got a new resident permit to work legally. finally I can work save etc. A few months ago I reconnected with a childhood friend and things turned romantic. When I first connected with him he told me he would be traveling to the country I live to come visit. \n\nThings turned serious and we started liking each other. That we began making plans for him to move to this country and I would be helping him with a permanent resident permit. \nBut I told him let's meet when he comes to visit to look if it can work. For some reason or another his Visa process was delayed. And he still has not come to visit.\n\nIn the first months when we started speaking he started to ask for money...he was so amandment that if I care for him I should be helping him. I caved and send him a small sum. I left it at that. After a few days he started to demand that I should also pay for his ticket and buy him some clothes(namebrand) because it would be cold. He also insisted I buy him some name brand sneakers. I told him that even I don't wear name brand so I will not be buying it for him. \n\nNow we got into a huge argument and I really want to know am I an ashole for refusing to pay his traveling expenses. I don't make that much money because I don't work full-time..I am studying to become a nurse while working in my field. I don't mind contributing but I want to do that on my own Merritt.\n\nI make just enough to pay bills and buy groceries and maybe once a month to eat something with friends. What I have left which is not much I save up for a rainy day.\n\nAm I an ashole by not buying him clothes sending him money or even buying his ticket?\n\nHe also said that other women have offered to pay his expenses but he choose me so I should do it.  He said if I love him I would do it because that what relationships are about.\n\n* I had promised to give him 200 euro for a ticket when he was going on that I must help him because I care ..but after a few days he said it should be 350. I told him that was not the agreed. Now he says I am lying that I said 350. I would never have said that.\n\n",

      "description": "My relationship with my father has always been a strained one. He was verbally ans physically abusive to my mom, and because if that I didn't even meet him until I was 12. Things were fine until I was 16. \n\nAt 16 I was going through my goth phase, Tripp pants where high on my list. My dad got me them for Christmas, but around that time we had a huge snow storm so I didn't actually get the package until weeks later. As soon as I opened it I called and said thank you, left a voicemail and a message with the house sitter, but after that I never heard from him again. I reached out a lot (phone calls, snail mail, email) but he never got back to me. Then in '09 my grandmother passed away. I called my dad because I needed him and his first words were \"I'm not helping you.\" No I'm sorry or anything. Then in 2010 I'm in a bad accident and he came to visit me in the hospital. At the time I asked him why he just abandoned me and his only response was that I didn't call and say thank you for my Christmas gifts. \n\nAt that point I was done. I haven't talked to him since. Well I was talking to a friend and the subject came up about parents passing away, and I said I couldn't care less. She now wont talk to me and thinks I'm heartless, but I can't bring myself to care about someone who doesn't care about me. I'll support my siblings (different moms) when the time comes because I do love them, but it's just hard when it comes to my dad. ",

      "description": "Okay, before you hate me, here is some context. \n\nA while back I was the final say in whether or not my in law could move in with us. I was okay with it but cautious. It didn't end up working out because she threw a tantrum in front of my toddler, blatantly disrespected me and my position as a wife, and admitted to leaving shaving razors out so my son \"would learn\" that they're sharp (I previously asked her to place them higher in the shower, out of reach). I had enough of her being a rude guest and had her leave.\n\nFast forward a few days and I realize a \"gift\" she got me, one piece out of three in a facial cleansing thing, was missing. I asked my spouse to ask her about it next time he saw her. She told him that \"[i] didn't like it nor use it so [she] took it.\" I later explained to my husband that her response was a lie, since she had seen me use it, complimented the results, and asked if I liked it which I always said yes. At this point I was annoyed she lied, adding onto the already rude behavior.\n\nFast forward to last week, she visited my husband for lunch. I asked him (she has me blocked everywhere) to tell her that I'm willing to let the past be past if she apologizes for the theft (I'm even okay with her just saying it was a misunderstanding at this point). He talks to her but she dismisses my attempt to fix our relationship by saying she \"does not have the emotional capacity to deal with [me] right now.\" Okay I guess.\n\nFast forward to today. Since she doesn't want to admit to theft, the new rule is she can visit but not come into the house without me being there to make sure she doesnt get happy hands, per say. She stopped by while I was at work. I wasnt too happy about this so I went there on my break to make sure she understood the boundary. I parked at the entrance of our complex and made my way to our building when I saw her car approaching me. I didn't let her pass, so she rolled down her window.\n\nI explained that she is not welcome here because of the theft, and unless she apologizes, she will not be allowed to enter my home. She changed her reason for the theft from the response earlier to \"it was mine so I took it.\" I told her that's not how gifts work, and even explained that her original response was also not true. She told me, \"I would buy a thousand of those [gift item] if it would shut you up.\" At this point I'm frustrated. I knew she was going on a road trip, so I said \"I hope you crash on the way there.\" As I walked away she called me an evil bitch.\n\nI know I could've passed on saying that, and I also know I could've been a lot more harsh. I'm so fed up with a woman twice my age treating me like garbage, despite me being the wife of her only son. \n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "We're both female. I'm her first real girlfriend. We've been together for 4 months. Here's my list of reasons/things that annoy me.\n\n* she throws her clothes all over the floor in every room. \n* she doesn't rinse her dirty dishes.\n* she constantly mentions her Male ex, saying he had a big dick, that they would've had beautiful children together, she could get him a job at her work, etc.\n* shes closed minded. My opinions are wrong.\n* she refuses to agree to disagree.\n* shes always offended by any and everything. \n* she thinks all white people are racist.\n* she doesn't support my choices.\n* she tries to control what I do with my body. I'm passionate about tattoos and had over 100 when I met her. Every time i want a new one she complains. Same with my piercings. \n* I've been riding motorcycles for over a decade. I've been saving up for one (I have no vehicle rn) since before I met her and she knew that before we were officially dating, yet she bitches at me not to get one. \n* I was also considering buying my friends car at a great deal but she bitches about that too.\n* I love to travel but she doesn't want to go along, which is fine, but she also doesn't want me to go.\n* i was offered my dream job and when I told her about it, she ignored what I was saying and changed the subject.\n* she tells her mother every single damn thing about our relationship, including private things I tell her not to repeat.\n* shes constantly pressuring me for sex. All day every day. It's making me not want it at all. Since the first day we hung out, I had to literally physically 'fight' her off of me. I thought it was just cuz she was drunk. \n* I've explained to her that, 1) I have aspergers, and 2) I suffered some really bad stuff when I was younger. Sex or even the idea of it sometimes really weirds me out or makes me uncomfortable. Especially if I'm being groped or pressured. \n*after I told her about what happened in my childhood, SHE IMMEDIATELY SMIRKED, THEN ASKED IF I WANTED TO HAVE SEX. \n*she told me she loved me after a week.\n* she almost always interrupts me when I'm speaking. Even after she asks me a question. \n* she is weird when she drinks... and she drinks every day. I drink too, but my personality doesn't change. Hers does, and not in a good way.\n* she wants me to stay at her house all day, every day. Even though shes at work. I'm bored and want to be at my own house sometimes, see my friends, go to the store, play on my computer, blah blah blah etc. She gets upset if I even go home 1 day out of the week.\n* she listens to really shitty rap music. \n\nAm I a total asshole if I break up with her? Shes complely into this relationship but my needs are falling on deaf ears. I have tried to speak to her about these things soooo many times but she doesn't listen. I feel like we are incompatible. I'm unhappy and I think I would rather just be alone.",

I say we shouldn't go because it would be financially irresponsible of us, we don't make a whole lot, it's a huge expense with a relatively short notice, we're saving up for our own wedding, and I just think it would be different if the family was paying for our flights or if it was actually her best friend, but it's not, it's her friend's sister.

      "description": "I live in a fairly rural area. I actually have a small farm on my property. My son‚Äôs mom and I divorced when he was young. He generally spends vacations with me, even though he doesn‚Äôt really have to anymore since he‚Äôs 18 (almost 19) now. \n\nThis is his first year in college and his first winter break. He asked me if he could bring some friends back for a week to spend with me and I said okay. We did some skiing, ice skating, and other stuff during the day. But at night it‚Äôs pretty boring. Not much going on. \n\nSo I let the kids (though again, they were all 18-20, so not really kids) drink when they wanted. I basically just stocked the fridge and refilled it when things got low. I did have a rule that they couldn‚Äôt do certain activities drunk, for safety reasons. But it wasn‚Äôt as if anyone was driving or operating machinery so I wasn‚Äôt too worried. \n\nAnyway my ex-wife (son‚Äôs mom) ended up coming up to drop off the dog so my son could see him (that‚Äôs a long story and was somewhat annoying but I decided that the dog could stay over break since my son would still he here after his friends left).\n\nShe sees that the kids are drinking and gets pissed at me and we go in private so she can rant. I let it roll off because I‚Äôm used to her always having an issue about *something* whenever she sees me. \n\nBut I thought I would get some outside opinions. My son‚Äôs friends are leaving in a couple days to go be with their families for Christmas. They‚Äôve all had a really good time, I can tell. What‚Äôs done is done now, but I‚Äôm wondering if I did something wrong in this scenario. ",

      "description": "Our 2 year relationship was great, but recently we drifted apart and realised we wanted different things. Neither of us can afford to move out at the moment so we decided to just be respectful and try to get through the next month or so as easily as possible. \n\nAt first it was weird, we would still go out to eat together, sleep in the same bed, etc. It was as if nothing had changed other than our relationship status. It almost seemed that the distance that had grown between us over the last few months was no longer there. I was reinvesting myself to the idea that this might still be salvageable. We talked about it and she thought this too. \n\nSo we got back together. \n\nNow, months later, it's happening again for the 3rd time and I recognize the pattern. It's not healthy for either of us to keep dragging ourselves emotionally through the mud like this, so I've told her this time I'd like to go no contact. I'll sleep on the couch, make my own meals, lead a single life essentially. I made this decision several days ago and since then she has been crying nonstop. She's asked for hugs the first couple of days and I only shake my head and walk away. Now she just cries harder everytime we're in the same room. It kills me because I want to be there for her, I just know where that path leads. \n\nSo, am I being an asshole here? ",

      "description": "I'm a Hispanic attending college with predominantly white students and I room with 3 people in an apartment, all white and are some of my close college friends. Occasionally when I'm making food, I purchase the materials to make a meal, tacos, and I always pick up some fresh \"limes\" to add flavor.\n\nI finish cooking and tell them my food is ready if they want to have some and I tell them there are lemons to squeeze on the meal. Upon hearing this they correct me saying those are limes and not lemons, which I apologize about because growing up in a Hispanic neighborhood we call them limon in Spanish, regardless of the color, practically my whole life. They then tell me to learn the difference since they are \"VERY different\" things. I decide to not fuss with it so I just shut up. This is maybe the third time this same conversation was had.\n\nNow today, I end up throwing some stuff out from my fridge and find a few limes. I am about to throw them away and one of them catches me and ask what I'm tossing away, I'm sure they were only asking to make sure I wasn't throwing away their stuff on accident. I tell them \"I found these lemons-,\" they then respond with \"limes.\" I correct myself and tell them it's just a common thing in Spanish and that it isn't a big deal. Another person comes up, overhearing the conversation and disagrees with me. This is the conversation that followed.\n\nRoommate 1 (R1): You can't keep calling them lemons. These are limes.\n\nMe: I know they are, it's just common to say lemon for me and my family. It's just one letter off from limon, so it's not that big a deal.\n\nRoommate 2 (R2): That's like saying (my name) is the same as (my name with a wrong letter).\n\nMe: Okay, but just translating it gives me the word lemon anyway. It's not a serious thing.\n\nR2: What if someone was allergic to LIMES and not lemons. You can really harm someone with that mistake!\n\nMe: I don't know anyone with lime but it's just a name within the family of citrus.\n\nR1: With that logic you are okay calling oranges lemons.\n\nMe: That's silly because that's not what I meant with the family part. It's translation based.\n\nR1: Regardless that is what your logic sounds like.\n\nI then just walk away and drop the conversation again, hoping not to deal with it again.\n\nR1: Would you be okay if someone put limes in your lemonade?\n\nI just ignored it and shut myself off in my room.\n\nThere was a third time the same conversation happened in the past, but again I just ignored it.\n\nAITA for wanting to call limes lemons? It's just been culturally accepted for my entire life and not a single person I have been with had ever given me any issue calling them lemons up until now. I really think they are being jerkish about coming about it and I'm really not trying to upset them when I call them lemons, it's just a translation error from Spanish to English.",

      "description": "Hello there,\n\nSo for some Background, my gaming group consists of 2 other friends I've known since high school. We've been playing games for a while now. They are around 2-3 years younger than myself, me being 24 them being 21-22. They are engaged to each other and the argument happened with Friend 1's fiance who I'll refer to as Jess. \n\nJess and I have had some squabbles before over various things but nothing too serious, usually it would just be a conflict of ideas. However one trait of Jess' is that she gets super frustrated and angry and any game with that has the slightest hints of competitiveness. I understand competitive natures and how it feels really bad for people to lose and they want to try their best to win so at first it was fine. Jess would get huffy when we would lose something but later be fine.As of the last maybe 6 months or so, she's developed into a more, blaming others view. Something goes wrong, it's everyone else's fault except her own, I'm sure everyone has had to deal with this at some point or still know people that do the same. I tried to be understand and her fiance and I would  tell her to relax whenever it got too bad. \n\nAfter a while of the same things happening however, My patience was growing limited, Jess' fiance is a patron saint of patience and can deal with a lot for a long time, but my own patience isn't as vast, so when we were playing a game, lost, and she went on a tirade about \"her team this\" and \"her being the only one doing anything\" I just kinda lost it and screamed how she made every game we played that showed any level of competitiveness not fun and miserable, that maybe we might be the problem sometimes but she definitely doesn't help either, and that she makes me want to avoid playing anything with her. She didn't confront me on any of these point, let out a big sigh and left and has since blocked me and removed me on everything. \n\nThis is starting to sound like a validation post but where I feel like the asshole here is when I spoke to her fiance about everything. He let me know she had a somewhat abusive household and the yelling I did triggered a bit of her early childhood trauma and she thought I didn't need to be as harsh as I was. While I understood the idea of traumatizing events causing people to shutdown, ignore the outside, etc, I explained to him while this does explain a bit of her behavior, I personally don't think it excuses much. I decided to be more adamant about my viewpoint and say that I refuse to offer any sort of one sided apology as I feel that would just downplay all of my own genuine  feelings as nothing but an outburst to be forgotten about. Jess' Fiance explained to me I really hurt her and should offer an apology because my words were harsh. After this much time has passed and no progress I feel like IATA here so I want some other perspectives and insight from others.I do want to know if I was a jerk here. Thank you for the read and any advice.",

She says that watching the baby and homework keeps her SOOOOO busy but I can't see how that takes up every day....

      "title": "AITA for getting frustrated with my girlfriend‚Äôs friends at a party?",
      "description": "Earlier this month my girlfriend asked me to go to a party with her that I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable at. However I agreed to go to make her happy and she said we‚Äôd be there for just two hours, to kinda meet me half way. \n\nJump to Friday, we go to the party. I knew drinking was obviously going to be apart of it, and I‚Äôm not too big on drinking anymore (especially with people I don‚Äôt know and of course I was driving). Anyways, we show up and people are already hammered, and the host is absolutely obnoxious from the start. I keep getting told to drink, and I continue to decline due to me driving home later. As my girlfriend is having fun and drinking, I‚Äôm just making small talk with people and trying to have a good time. But every ten minutes or so the host would keep telling me to drink and eat pot brownies, and I kept (what I think to be politely) declining. At one point, the host put 3 giant pot brownies on me which crumbled and made a giant mess on my shirt. And that really pissed me off.\n\nObviously, alcohol played a large role, but the host kept getting more and more aggressive with me. Telling me I‚Äôm rude and a buzzkill and that she doesn‚Äôt like me. All while my girlfriend sees this and does nothing, and I bite my lip and stay polite because I don‚Äôt want to cause a scene in front of my girlfriends co-workers and friends.\n\nEventually, more people show up and they start smoking pot. Now I don‚Äôt personally have anything against it, but I myself don‚Äôt smoke and I can‚Äôt stand being around people who do solely because the smell gives me really bad headaches. So as soon as people start smoking, I get very obviously uncomfortable and annoyed, and my girlfriend continues to do nothing despite seeing me in a not so fun mood.\n\nIt gets to around 1130 (when we agreed to leave at 11pm) and my girlfriend texts me, ‚Äúlet me know when you want to leave.‚Äù Still trying to make best of the situation, I jokingly reply ‚Äúone hour ago‚Äù. So she begins to think I‚Äôm upset with her, even though I‚Äôm just annoyed with the party itself and the host. \n\nFinally, my girlfriend starts going up to people and telling me that we‚Äôre gonna go and we finally leave at around 1145. While driving home, I apologize for my obviously annoyed attitude and explain to her that it was the host and the headache that killed my mood, and she gets irritated with me and tells me that I just shouldn‚Äôt have gone with her then and how I should have know what to expect. \n\nI knew alcohol would be there, but not obnoxious people or pot. Am I the asshole with getting annoyed over that party or is it my own fault for agreeing to go and it‚Äôs more so like a ‚Äúwhat did you expect?‚Äù",

      "description": "Hey all, sorry if the answer seems obvious, but I'm kinda tangled up in thoughts here and would love some advice.\n\nSo I (22F) recently came to the realization that my brother (24M) molested me several times when I was between the ages of 10 and 13. Currently, the only other person who knows is my boyfriend, since we started dating just as I was figuring all this out. So here's the dilemma:\n\nI feel like this is something that I need to talk about, and that the people who care about me should know about. However, it would be absolutely devastating to my parents (especially my mom - she recently wailed and screamed at my brother for cheating on his gf, so one can only imagine how she would react to this). Furthermore, my brother is already on rocky terms with them, so it has a very real chance of destroying their relationship with him. As important as it feels to me, I can't help but think it would be selfish to prioritize my comfort over their happiness. \n\nI should note that my brother has recently apologized (though he might have been blackout drunk) for one incident that happened when I was 10, but hasn't acknowledged any others. To be honest, it wasn't the best apology, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to forgive him, but that's beside the point.\n\nI love my parents so deeply, and I don't want to burden them or taint our family dynamic, but this is really weighing on me and I can't stand withholding something so important from them. WIBTA if I told them?\n\nPS: I haven't seen a therapist about this yet because lol @ my university's mental health services, but I have no intention of telling anyone else until I get some professional advice. There isn't exactly a handbook on handling these things, so any advice or reactions are welcome. :)",

One brother totally disowned our family 6 years ago when our parents divorced, and the other two simply never return phone calls, emails, or texts. The only time I have seen them in the last 10 years was for my wedding, even though we grew up together. We haven't spoken over the phone or via email in years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sent them Xmas cards every year, I send them texts and tweets when something big happens... when our father went into the hospital two years ago for heart issues, only one of them bothered to get in touch with me, and returned to radio silence after my dad was back home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI informed them all via every means of communication I know that I was expecting a child some months ago, and none of them replied. With the birth almost upon us, I have become very frustrated with the lack of response or acknowledgement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote them a letter and sent to in as many ways as possible to all of them, stating how bad I felt them never contacting me or responding to any of my phone calls, texts, or emails.

No responses from any of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst thing is, I have no idea why none of them will talk to me or each other. Am I the Asshole?

      "description": "I recently came out of a pretty serious depression during which time I put on weight. I'm in the gym and making good progress to get back to where I was but am still noticeably larger than I was. During this time I wasn't as social and as a result it's been awhile since I had been out on group activities that included members of my girlfriend's social circle.\n\nShe has a particular friend who is known for \"blunt humor\" as they like to put it, basically the ballbuster of the group. I always found it to be a convenient excuse for her to be rude and give her unfiltered opinion under the guise of \"just joking\", but never made much of it. The other day I went to a little get-together with my girlfriend and a lot of her friends were also present, including miss \"i'm just joking.\" Things were going well and most people were perfectly polite and happy to see me, hugs and that sort of thing. We bumped into \"I'm just joking\" and literally the first thing she did was a very exaggerated look up and down as if sizing me up then goes \"holy shit, you got fat!\" then touches my arm and laughs. \n\nAgain, I've never been close to this woman and I've never really taken part in her style of humor so I found this inappropriate but I figured what the hell, let's see if she can take it as well as she dishes it so I said \"Thanks! I seen how well you pulled off the husky look and figured if you can do it so can I!\" Immediately she tensed up and asked me to repeat what I said, at which point my girlfriend touched her arm the same way she did to me and said \"I'm sure he was just joking\" to mimic her. She told us to go fuck ourselves and left five minutes later and has been blowing up my girlfriend's phone calling me a piece of shit since.\n\nNo one at the party said anything and we had a good time, but now word has gotten out and some of her friends feel I was out of line, others think it was hilarious and she deserved it. My girlfriend is fully on my side. In my mind, if she didn't appreciate someone commenting on her weight, why would she do it to someone else? Nevertheless, I'm here asking, AITA?",

This question is about the same neighbor lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a few times helped her out by taking a return to walmart for her or something like that. She has a husband but these types of errands typically fall to her and she would sometimes ask me to help. One day, she called me and when she found out I was driving home from somewhere, she asked if I could pick her up some baby formula on the way home so she didn't have to load the 2 kids in the car to go get it. I knew her husband's work schedule and that he would also be driving home at this exact same time so I asked her why he couldn't just stop and grab it on his way home. She acknowledged that while there was no reason he couldn't, she knew that he wouldn't be willing to (he's basically a mild/moderate asshole at times). At this point in the friendship, I was already pretty annoyed by her frequent requests and ended up telling her that I would feel a little put out doing something that I think should be her husband's duty and that he's capable of doing. She replied something like \"I know he should do it, but I also know he won't do it and so I'm asking you.\"  I described this situation to someone else later and they said that I'd lowered myself to her husband's level by not doing it and that I was an asshole too. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a side note,  this was a couple years ago and for other reasons the 'friendship' is over but we now have a normal neighborly relationship ",

Like, he will talk about how a show he watches is filled with lesbians. When I tell him that I find that anime turns lesbians into a fetish and it's one of the main reasons I don't like anime, and that I like shows like Gumball and She-ra. He then goes on about Cal-Arts style and how my reasoning is poor.\n\nHe has also called me basically \"lesser minded\" when he told me about a cross dresser in anime that becomes trans. I told him that while trans representation is good, posing them as \"traps\" is not good. Where he then called me stupid in fancy terms.\n\nYesterday, while we were eating, he told me how I'd love visual novels and dating sims, when I told him I wouldn't and I'd rather read an actual book; he said I was not seeing outside myself.\n\nToday I couldn't take anymore of this, we were out by ourselves, and the whole day he talked anime and how much I would love it if I watched one with a lesbian king Arthur (???), how I would love visual novels. When I told him the types of games I did like, he told me I couldn't tell good game desgin, mind you this was for a game he had never played, only watched youtube videos about.\n\nAfter about 2 hours of this, when we got back in the car and he started talking about anime again, I told him directly that I despised anime, and that I wanted him to not talk to me about this stuff, and that he was always being immature about it, since I having been telling him for over a year. He then said he wasn't being immature. When I directly told him to talk about something else, he started talking about politics, when I told him I don't like politics, he told me I was being stupid and that I need to be educated before voting. I told him that not wanting to talk about politics isn't being stupid, he said I was wrong.\n\nAITA and being immature or not?",

      "description": "Earlier this year I decided to attempt this exam for a certification that would help me in my career. I‚Äôve never been a great student, and I made it through college by paying for tutoring whenever things got really bad. It worked often. Just having someone around that‚Äôs there only to push me was effective.\n\nStudying for this exam was no different, and after a month of getting nowhere I decided to reach out to a tutor. I found someone on Craigslist who advertised GRE &amp; GMAT prep help. I contacted him and asked if he could help. He‚Äôs in his early 50‚Äôs and has been tutoring for 19 years. I knew he had not heard of the exam I was taking (and he didn‚Äôt claim to know anything about it either), but I did not really need help with the material, just with my study habits. \n\nI really enjoyed working with him. He charged $30 per hour with a 2 hour minimum. He gave a $5/hour discount if you spent $250 on one of his packages.\n\nI bought 2 packages and spend around 12 hours with him. During our last session I took a practice test and did very poorly. I decided to push my test from April to October as it cost $500 to take the exam and I do not feel at all confident that I would pass.\n\nI met with him today to tell him my decision to stop tutoring. We had a two hour appointment scheduled. I told him he could keep the money for the two hours but I wanted my remaining 150 back for the hours I did not use. He said he would have to think about it. \n\nI tried to get him to see my side of it. He simply said he would think about it and he would call me in 24 hours to tell me. He said he could legally keep all of the money, even though there was no contract signed and I paid in cash. I told him I would be very hurt if he does not refund my money. I‚Äôm 27, and not rich. I wanted to get angry, but I felt it would get me no closer to getting my money back. I‚Äôm absolutely seething right now.\n\nIf he calls and tells me he won‚Äôt refund me tomorrow I intend to report him for tax evasion. He made some comments about his contempt for the government so I figure he has not been paying taxes on the income he makes from his other students as well. I am so pissed and I can‚Äôt get the conversation out of my head.\n\ntldr: I asked my tutor to refund me for 6 unused hours and he said he would have to think about it since I bought a package. ",

      "description": " \n So, my girlfriend and I woke up late this morning and were running around hurrying to get ready for work. She had to leave 30 minutes before me so I let her go ahead and use the bathroom first. After holding it for 10 minutes I hear the sink running and figure she was brushing her teeth and wouldn't mind if I went ahead and came in to piss. I walk up to the bathroom door and through the crack I see her shaving her face, which she has never before told me she did before, so I decided to just wait.\n\n\n Just to be clear I wasn't disgusted or think she was a guy or anything, I just never knew she did that, never seen her shave her face before and she's never told me, which I felt a little betrayed about at the time. I mean I know women don't usually do that but I thought we were really open and honest with each other, it just really shocked me she wouldn't let me know that.\n\n\n Anyways, I decided to keep it to myself for the time being because we were running late, but wanted to ask her about it eventually just to know why she didn't tell me. She's usually not the type to be embarrassed about stuff like that so I thought it to be weird.\n\n\n Well a couple hours ago we were sitting on the couch and I had the opportunity and asked her about it. She got upset and told me it was due to this girl problem she has (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) and started arguing with me, saying I wasn't respecting her and her space (WHICH I WAS). I told her it was an accident and I didn't think of her any less, then she started crying. At that point I asked her to calm down and reminded her that we both agreed to be honest with each other and explained I just wanted to know why she was keeping that from me. Then she called me an asshole, which is something she has never said to me before in our 1 year relationship. She left our apartment and went to her friends apartment and now I'm pretty sure our whole floor thinks I'm a dick.\n\n\n I want to apologise because I feel like I've done something wrong but at the same time I'm hurt she called me all that and now feel like she's keeping things from me. I know she has that problem but the fact that she didn't want to tell me leads me to think she isn't as open as I thought she was.\n\n\n Is she overacting or Aita? \n\n(Sorry for any mistakes, am on mobile)",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons, please be patient with me as this is my first time posting on reddit.\n\nFor the past 9 months, my boyfriend's family has been going through some financial difficulty. It affects my boyfriend negatively because he is used to a luxury lifestyle. I have tried to be sensitive to their situation by paying more for gas and buying food and gifts. With my part-time job, I try to support his goals- one of which is gaining weight- so I bought him a blender, protein powders, and health bars for him to start off with to motivate him. From my perspective, it seems like he sees right through what I do for him. I never come over empty-handed. I bring him food to make sure he's eating, and bring little snacks for his parents. I thought I was being more sensitive to his situation by not pressuring him to go out with me. From his perspective, he claims that my family doesn't care about him by \"not buying him things\", when my mom has been helping me purchase food for him and continuously asks when he will come over next so she can cook for him. (He never comes over, I always drive to him.) I feel like there's nothing else I can do to help him. I believe he deserves to have spending money, that he shouldn't have to feel stressed out financially- because he does go to school full time and work on top of that. He has accomplished so many things that many aren't fortunate enough to do and I'm so proud of him.\n\nSo, because I feel I can't do anything for him, I suggested he go on welfare, because even for a little while, he can get back up on his feet and feel better. To him, this was a huge insult. He claims that welfare is for \"lower class\" people (single mothers, black people, poor people) and that insinuating welfare could apply to him means I am categorizing him with those people.\n\nI found this extremely offensive- because welfare can be abused- but so many people really need it and categorizing government aid to any type of people is offensive. He told his parents what I suggested, and they're equally as offended and currently I am not welcome in their home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hi everyone. My first roommate (20, M, we'll call him R) wants us to move out of our tiny townhome into a bigger place so his girlfriend can live with us. Currently it's just the three of us, me (20, F), and another roommate (20, M, let's call him J). Our place is great, it's less than a mile away from the university we all attend, rent is extremely cheap, I get my own bathroom (the boys share the large upstairs bathroom), hardwood floors, quiet neighborhood- the whole nine yards. R already lives in the master suite already, which is the size of J's and mine room combined, and mind you that's still really small, my bedroom has enough to fit my full bed and a chair and that's about it, but I'm so busy I'm really only ever in my room to sleep. Recently, R's girlfriend (19, F, let's call her L) has spent the night at our apt every night for about the past 5 months, I'd say. I have no problem with that, she's super nice, is respectful of all of us, etc. but she complains that it's always cold (we barely run the heater to keep our utilities low + the big windows make it hard to keep warm, anyway) and that R's bedroom is way too small. She has her own apt nearby but her roommate is moving out at the end of the semester. She brought up just her and R moving into a place alone when our lease ends this summer, but R isn't ready for the commitment of living alone with his girlfriend (dating for 2(?) years)  so he wants all of us to move into a bigger place. R, J, and I have been friends for a long time, and I really like living with them. I have made it very clear I'm completely open with moving as long as 3 conditions are met: 1. It's still close enough to walk to school (R and L have paid for the expensive parking passes, J and I usually walk of take the bus), 2. Each of our rents doesn't go up more than $100 (including L who would be paying rent, now.) and 3. I still have my own bathroom. Am I being unreasonable? J and I are the only two roommates that are completely financially independent (both from single parents, my mom barely makes enough go sustain herself, and J's mom has 3 younger kids) while R and L both have their parents pay a cut of their rent. We had a big talk last night, looked at apartments and R &amp; L said I was being unreasonable to want all 3 of those things, so I asked why should we move? Why doesn't L just move in full-time with us? Why don't they just move out into their own apt and J and I find a new roommate? Or why doesn't she find another roommate and we keep the arrangement we have now? I think I hurt her feelings and I really don't want that, but I'm also not giving up such a good apt because one person who doesn't even live there is unsatisfied with it. Am I the asshole? Or should I be more open to compromise?",

      "description": "So for a little context I have a bearded dragon called Smaug (she's a girl btw) and I've only had her for a year, she's around about 4 years old now and I'm deathly protective of her. \n\nI live with my mum and my brother who is around the same age as me, I have another brother who is younger though (he's 8) and he doesn't live with us but stays on the weekends. When he first saw Smaug he was kind of captivated, I told him he could look through the glass but her couldn't get her out unless I was there (I didn't want him accidentally drop her or something) I also made this fact very clear to my mum as she also likes to look at her, they both agreed and understood. Recently though I've been spending a lot of the weekends at my boyfriend's as that's the only time we get to see each other, and after coming back from my boyfriend's I find Smaug terrarium a mess. There is dried up vegetables everywhere and a whole box of crickets in the terrarium, obviously I was very mad so I confronted my mum about this, she said that she thought Smaug might be hungry so she threw a box of crickets. literally. now I get it touching the crickets isn't my favourite thing in the world either but you don't just throw a whole box of them in the terrarium with her. I told my mother this and I showed have the proper way to put the crickets in and that I'll tell her before I leave if she can or can't feed Smaug. If you don't know older bearded dragons don't need to eat bugs as much as younger ones do, you can give your beardie a lot of health problems if you do over feed them. A couple weeks go by and I come home to the same thing, messy terrarium filled with crickets. So now I'm even more pissed, my mum has a very bad habit of not listening to me at all. So I did the logical thing and I bought a lock for the terrarium. When I got home after the first week of using the lock my mum wasn't happy, she asked me why I had to go and buy a lock and that my brother was really upset that he couldn't feed Smaug anymore. I told her that if she wasn't going to listen to me I couldn't let her keep going into my room and trashing smaugs terrarium. She didn't seem happy with this but didn't say much else just that she thought I was being selfish. so am I the asshole for not letting my mum and younger brother trash my lizards terrarium?",

      "description": "So I am getting married in April 2019 and it‚Äôs been challenging with the invite list because all the parents (my fianc√© and my parents are divorced so it‚Äôs like 4 families instead of 2) have lists of people who they wanted to invite. Normal right?\n\nNow my mother is going to be divorcing my step-father. No papers drawn up yet, still together at holidays, etc. but she had a list of 10 people she wanted to invite. One of those people was this ‚Äúold friend‚Äù of my actual father‚Äôs who they knew growing up. Now he lives in Florida and my mom has been going down to visit him frequently. She even cried to my grandmother (her mom) that she loves him and he doesn‚Äôt reciprocate those feelings a couple of months ago. I feel massively uncomfortable with the idea of him coming to my wedding. This will cause drama with my step dad, who will be walking me down the aisle.\n\nSo I told her I didn‚Äôt want to invite him because we were at capacity for who we wanted to invite to the wedding on Sunday. A slight fib but I figured it was better than fighting. But last night as I was getting addresses for our save the dates she started cutting people from her list. First it was fine until I asked for some of my stepdads families phone numbers so I could add them. She got upset that he put two people on the list. Saying he‚Äôs delusional for adding them and that he‚Äôs denying they are divorcing. I had to tell her I‚Äôm not going to ignore them when I went to their sons wedding 3 years ago as nothing has been done yet and they probably aren‚Äôt coming anyway it doesn‚Äôt hurt to send a save the date. So then she says ‚ÄúOh Michael doesn‚Äôt have to come or Corey. But now Kenny‚Äôs address is ....‚Äù and I had to stop her and tell her we are not inviting him. She got upset on the other end of the line and then just gave me the rest of our families addresses and said bye. \n\nI know I could have been more forthright with her on Sunday about why I didn‚Äôt want to invite Kenny but my mom and I already have a strained relationship and I didn‚Äôt want to get into a fight with her. Am I the asshole?",

I‚Äôm all for helping my friends but I don‚Äôt like giving out notes in fear of my teacher catching on. Our teacher always reads the notes and sometimes asks us about them. The notes about the chapter were due yesterday.After a little back n forth I just tell him No. \nToday, I saw him in the morning and said hi. He just walked past me. I asked my other friend ‚ÄúJ‚Äù , who has the same hour as him, what‚Äôs wrong with him. \n\n‚ÄúOh he‚Äôs upset he got put back down to a D in the class‚Äù.\n\nI feel a little guilty but just go on to my first hour and forget about it.

      "description": "Hey AITA,\n\nThis post should honestly be cross posted with r/antiMLM as well, but I don't really know how to use reddit to its full extent. So a bit of a background, an old friend from high school just posted a facebook fundraiser in attempts to try to raise $15k CAD for the remainder of his college education. Prior to him going out to live in Canada with his wife, he tried to recruit me into an MLM company that he worked for (and still does). He and his company tried to pitch me a story about how said company would be able to help me make a lot of money and gain financial freedom. I knew from the beginning of the presentation pitch that they were only here to make additions to their pyramid scheme and so I went on with my life thinking that was it. Forward 2-3 years and I come across this fundraiser that he started to help him \"make his dream a reality.\" I've noticed several high school friends and teachers that have contributed to his cause and I completely detest that. Aside from trying to recruit me into MLM company, he hasn't done anything to me or anyone else that warrants this hate. AITA for not wanting people to donate money for his cause?\n\n[https://imgur.com/6gCXUg6](https://imgur.com/6gCXUg6)",

      "description": "Alternate account for privacy reasons. \n\nThere‚Äôs a bit to unpack here, but the details are important. There will be a TL;DR at the end. \n\nI‚Äôm currently a college freshman. In April I began dating a girl I went to high school with. I knew this girl and I would go separate ways after graduation but I underestimated how much the distance would affect the relationship. \n\nThe universities that we moved off to are ~6 hours apart. Our college experiences so far could not be more different. I have made all new friends and I‚Äôm pretty involved. I have pretty much separated myself from my high school life. However, she hasn‚Äôt made any new friends other than her roommate. I feel bad for her, but that‚Äôs just how it is. I might be at a party and not checking my phone much, while she‚Äôs waiting for me to text her back. Keep in mind, she always knows if I‚Äôm at a party or with friends. I didn‚Äôt hide anything from her. \n\nI began to feel kind of lame around my new friends because of this high school relationship. I‚Äôd talk about her but then have to explain that they don‚Äôt know her because she goes to a university 6 hours away. I didn‚Äôt like being they guy at a function texting his high school girlfriend that nobody knew. \n\nHalfway through the semester I started to realize how much I HATED having a relationship through a phone. I didn‚Äôt see the point. There were still feelings, but the entire sense of companionship was lost, and that messed up the emotional connection. I expressed this to her.\n\nEarly November I started developing a crush on a girl that went to my university. I brushed it aside, as she probably didn‚Äôt like me, and I had a girlfriend. Around Thanksgiving, the feelings became harder and harder to ignore. She started flirting with me at parties. \n\nI broke up with the girl when the semester ended. I told her I couldn‚Äôt do a relationship where I only saw her a few times a year for 4-5 years and that the distance wasn‚Äôt working out for me. Which was true, but I didn‚Äôt tell her about the crush I had on another girl, because I didn‚Äôt see the point in completely destroying her self-esteem. \n\nI‚Äôve started talking more to the girl at my university. It‚Äôs very obvious that we like each other a lot. \n\nOld girlfriend just texted me and told me she‚Äôs thinking about transferring to my university, claiming she‚Äôs depressed at her current one and mine is closer to home. However, she also says that I play a role in her decision because she wants to be with me. \n\nAITA for not wanting to get back with her even if she moves here?\n\n**TL;DR:** Girlfriend and I moved to different universities. Distance sucks. I start liking another girl. I break up with girlfriend and claim it‚Äôs because of distance, which is true, but I didn‚Äôt tell her about the other girl I liked. Now she‚Äôs considering transferring to my university and I don‚Äôt wanna get back with her. AITA for not wanting to get back with her even if she moves here?",

      "title": "AITA for kicking my \"ex\" out after finding out she slept with my friend in my living room?",
      "description": "So a little background on this girl, who for this story we'll call Sarah. I met Sarah back at the beginning of October, about two weeks after my long term girlfriend had broken up with me. We started hanging out, and I thought she was really cute but she was a huge druggy, bouncing from place to place cause she got kicked out of her house and she just didn't really have her life together so I wasn't really into her. Well, one weekend she ended up going to another city, doing meth, for the first time, for a few days, returning to our city and going to rehab, and then she was released like five days later.\n\nShe ended up coming over to my place and telling me she wanted to turn her life around. Said she was going to go completely sober, get a job, and try and fix things with her mother. Later that night we ended up having sex, and after we cleaned up and everything I immediately told her that I was still trying to get over my ex so I wasn't really looking for anything serious. She said that was perfectly fine, and was generally understanding about it.\n\nWe were just fuck buddies for about two weeks, and after much thinking I realized I really did like this girl and told her I'd like to give us a shot, so we started \"dating\". We ended up going to a friends that night, a friend whom she had a falling out with (who I found out later she also had sex with before we starting \"dating\"). They ended up making up and all was good, we all had a few drinks and were chilling. Then my friend asked us if we were exclusive, and I said that I personally thought we were, and she.... ran to the bathroom. I went to check on her and she said she wasn't ready for a relationship, and that she needs to focus on getting her life together. Alright, cool. That's understandable, I was not upset about that, cause it definitely made sense.\n\nWe stayed fuck buddies for another two weeks until she told me she didn't want to do it anymore, and I said that was fine. Well last Monday (about two weeks after she told me the above) we started talking, and she said she wanted to start dating again. She said she was ready to do so, telling me she really loved me, and I really liked her to, and she was doing a great job at turning her life around. She ended up getting a job and was completely sober. I had been helping her out a ton, driving her too and from work some days, letting her stay on my couch, eat my food, buy her food, etc.... So this \"relationship\" continued for a few days, with her telling me she loves me, calling me her boyfriend, telling me how much she liked me, etc... just the general boyfriend/girlfriend stuff. This all lasted until Friday. We went to a party and she barely talked to me the whole time. Wasn't a big deal, she was being social with other people. Then we came back to my place and my roommate had people over. So we all drank, played some games, and were having a good time. Later that night I went to give her a hug and she pulled away, and once again, told me she didn't want to be exclusive. I straight up told her that I couldn't be with someone that I'm not exclusive with and that this was the last time we'd ever be together cause this was the second time she'd done this. I went to bed, with her and my friend (who we'll call Kyle) slept on the couch. Now I met Kyle about a month ago so we didn't know each other too too well but we were still pretty good friends. He did not know about me and Sarah's relationship so I do not put any of the blame on him.\n\nI guess they ended up sleeping together that night, right in my living room. Now keep in mind, I did not know about this, but I was still generally upset with her because I felt like she played with my emotions. A few days later (which would be last night) we ended up talking about it, I told her I was a bit mad at her, and I was trying not to be. She apologized and things were decent again. I started drinking some, and was being super nice and talkative to her again, definitely cause of the alcohol but I also felt like talking about it helped. I ended up asking her to not sleep with anyone I was close with, like my roommate or Kyle, especially since Kyle is moving in with us later this month. Well, she ended up telling me she already slept with Kyle, the night she ended things with me. I got really mad, and asked her how she could say she loves me yet sleep with some dude the same night she ended things with me. She went on this whole thing about how she's \"able to love multiple people, and that sleeping with others while being in love doesn't mean she feels any different\". I ended up telling her she doesn't know what love is, and that all the problems that are going on in her life are her fault. I told her that she is the cause of all these problems, and told her she needed to leave my apartment. I didn't care how, but she had to leave, so she had a friend of hers pick her up.\n\nAm I the Asshole here? I truly felt like she kind of played with my emotions, and was just generally with me for the convenience of it. Cause as soon as she starting meeting new people and being around other dudes, she ended things. Not once. But twice. And I personally felt kind of played. Especially since she ended up sleeping with my friend, in my living room, the night she ended things with me a second time. \n",

But I already went thru all the bills he asked me to, the house, and the appliances we had to replace and I know what we should be left with. I'm being realistic, I thought. He stomped off and went to bed angry because I'm just a selfish bitch. But keep in mind, we currently dont have a vehicle that runs and is large enough to fit our family of 6.

My heart just about sank when I saw that both messages back was \"Visa gift card\". \n\nThe place where I work charges an activation fee on top of the amount that one would want to load onto one of these prepaid cards, so in my mind it would be cheaper if I just straight up gave them $20 cash and then spend the money on people who would appreciate the gifts. WIBTA? They're literally asking for money and have not specified an amount. \n\nP.S.\n\nI would also like to say that one of them is older than me and works as a paralegal while studying for the bar, and the other is younger than me and already gets plenty of support from our parents. I can't see either of them needing anything more than pocket cash, which is why I settled on $20. ",

      "description": "This is kind of piggy-backing on the locked thread from the other day of the guy whose fiance won't eat his cooking.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/af3x7l/aita\\_for\\_being\\_upset\\_when\\_my\\_fiance\\_wont\\_eat\\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/af3x7l/aita_for_being_upset_when_my_fiance_wont_eat_my/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy case is slightly different, so I really don't know if I'm the problem here or not. We've been married about 8 years. More importantly, I don't know what perspective is the healthiest to take on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample: tonight, my wife (47), mother-in-law, son (5) and I (45) are getting ready to have dinner. Like the previous poster, I do enjoy cooking; I like to experiment and hate using recipes. Sometimes, I lose- big time, but usually, I can do a pretty good job of making something delicious and healthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, about a year ago, my son (5yr) was diagnosed Celiac, and about 6 months after, I figured out that my 30 year gut problem is an IBS caused by onion, garlic, and all kinds of other foods containing fructans. Those foods containing gluten (a protein) also have these fructans (a sugar), so wheat, barley, rye- my son and I both get hit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think my problem goes beyond serious, explosive, burning, toilet discomfort for a couple days, but my son truly will have problems if he ingests more than a sugar packet's worth of gluten in a year (put your knife in peanut butter, wipe it on your 'regular' bread, go back to the peanut butter jar with the knife, guess what's now in the peanut butter- whatever kind of bread you spread it on next).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, as soon as I found out about my son's celiac, I cleaned the house of gluten. Anything remotely suspect, I put in boxes intending to give away. Wife came home; within an hour most everything was back on the shelves. Perhaps I over-reacted, I'm not sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward about 8 months. We now often just prepare three meals for dinner. My son, being five, well he'd likely get his own meal in any case, not just because the gluten thing, but also, he's five.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife though, she insists on buying both regular and gluten-free, well just about everything.  So, we have gluten, and gluten-free peanut butter, gluten and gluten-free butter, gluten and gluten-free breads. Still gotta use the same toaster and all though. She made pizzas the other day using her bread-maker. One gluten-free pizza for the boy and I, a 'regular' one for her and our guests. Using the same bread-maker she'd been using for years. A sugar packet's worth of the gluten molecule, remember. But maybe I'm over-reacting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway- things are settling to where I cook meals and my wife does dishes/cleanup (I hate dishes- hate it- and I do it 'wrong' anyway too often). She'll still make meals occasionally too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my wife has a thing with beef- I can't pin down her reason though, because it often changes. For years, the reason was that cows produce methane, take up too many resources, bad for environment, etc. But then I pointed out her milk drinking habit, and the fact that there were more buffalo in North America before the slaughter than there are cows now, and that they share a similar physiology, etc. So now her reason seems to have switched to that it 'makes her feel bad'. Though I still hear the environmental piece from time to time. She has no problem with other meats- birds, pigs, fish, not much a fan of lamb or goat though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she'll eat the beef pot pies her mother makes. And she'll eat beef other times at her parents' house, or at other's houses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo tonight, I go to make dinner for myself, my wife and my mother-in-law.  I decided to season some ground bison (having this onion/garlic thing, I've got to create all my own seasonings from scratch- EVERY seasoning mix has onion or garlic powder). Then I put it over rice and made a tomato-cucumber-corn salsa to put over top of that (because, again- I defy you to go find a salsa without onions or garlic).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it's good- it's really, really good. But my wife won't have any of it. Because I used the bison ground beef. She said last time she tried it, she had too much and it made her feel bad.  So instead, we just get in each other's way in our cramped kitchen while she prepares an entirely different meal using nothing I had prepared tonight except the rice. The meal she decided to have was my leftover veal-tomato-sweet potato crock pot disaster that I don't intend to have another bite of myself, I'm so disappointed with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn any case, when the meal was over, my mother-in-law said, 'Thanks, that was good.'. And I said, 'Thanks, I'm glad somebody enjoyed it.\" My wife said, \"You didn't like it?\" I said, \"No, it was great!\".  She again said something about how last time she tried the bison she, 'Didn't feel good'. Then she proceeds to take another bite of the vegetables she'd picked out of the crock pot veal leftovers. Knowing full well that veal is cow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis kind of behavior, is regular. When she makes me salads with the bitter, yucky plant leaves I just don't like, I eat them. I might complain a little, but I don't just make my own meal instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo folks, AITA for sitting here feeling bad because I live in a family that has to have three separate meals on a regular basis? Is this any different than the previous poster's situation with his fiance? Should I do more to cater to her choices of food items, when my son and I have diagnosed medical problems associated with foods that she refuses to adapt her own eating and grocery habits to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease ask for clarifications if you need them- I'm not looking for validation here- I really don't know if I'm an asshole or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR- Wife prefers not to eat beef. I make family meals and will use bison or beef (usually bison if I can find it) maybe once a week or every other week, but my wife won't eat it and just makes her own meal instead. My son and I have diagnosed/medical food issues, but she brings the offending foods home anyway. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She one of those people that will do anything to make her self look better then you and she fights with and talks shit about everyone. For example she get arrested for drunk drive and blames the cops for catching her. She drank and smoked during her entire pregnancy and had my mother convinced to the doctor said she special and can do this with not effect on  her first baby who is autistic.  Anyway. She asked me when she found out she was pregnant. I only said yes so may mother wouldn't get upset. My youngest (3) and her newborn where both born on St Patrick's day, March 17. Things is she called the birth date nine months and actually said \"there are no babies born in March.\" , and continued to act like my boy does not exist. To the point were she'll bump in to him and be like I just didn't  him. It sounds crazy but I feel like she made it so she was induced to give birth that day and I just don't want her around me. ",

      "description": "This was a while ago, but I still get blamed for it.\nSo, a long story short: I met a guy and we became great friends. We had the same interests and we liked the same things so we had a lot to talk about, and I barely have any friends so I was very happy with this!\nWe later decide to become ‚Äúfuck buddies‚Äù as you call it I guess, and we both made it VERY clear that it was strictly sex and no emotional bond, so we were free to be with and talk to other people. This worked out great (the friendship, not the other part) until he said that he has feelings for me, and probably had a crush on me. I made it clear that I did NOT have those feelings for him, and I really liked our friendship and I wanted it to stay like that. He got mad, but it got better when I explained that I couldn‚Äôt help the fact that I didn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúlove‚Äù emotions for him more than a friend. He accepted it and moved on. We stopped having sex, because I didn‚Äôt want him to fall for me more I guess? But at last he convinced me that it was fine and that his crush on me had passed. I know, my fault for trusting that. \nAfter a while, we stop the whole sex act because I didn‚Äôt see the point of it. We had a really good friendship and it was really fun. He talked to other girls, I talked to other guys. He started acting weird tho.\nFew months later he tells me that he‚Äôs in love with someone else and that he really really likes this person, which obviously makes me happy since he seems so happy! At this point, I had also developed feelings for another guy and everything seemed to work out great.\nBut, alas, two months after that I made my relationship public with the guy I loved (since my friend more or less had done the same?) but my friend got so angry at me. He said horrible things and did horrible things. I was confused because he was dating and in love with someone else, so I truly did not see a problem?\nBut am I the asshole for not having a crush or romantic feelings for my friend? ",

This has been going extremely well, even with my nervousness beforehand. We get along well and I really felt like I was improving. We even became friends in a way, which may have been a mistake. \n\nHe's a lovely guy and obviously knows what he's doing. However, a few weeks ago he asked me if it'd be alright if we trained together, assuring me I would get the same level of workout I would normally get. In the beginning I also really enjoyed the working out together, but now it's gotten to this point that he trains more during this hour than I do. (For example, we alternate on the same exercise with one person doing it and the other person waiting. Now he always does 4 sets and I do 3 or even 2 with me waiting during his 4.)\n\nAs I'm paying a lot of money for this - and as nurse it's a real big part of my paycheck - I want to ask him if we can go to our usual workout where he just supports me while I'm doing the exercises. However, I fear it might be selfish of me. And he's really enthusiastic about it, defintely not rude. \n\nAs a non-assertive person, I'm wondering if it's worth bringing it up, or if I should just keep going like this and be grateful for the workout I get. \n\nTL:DR; My personal trainer starting working out with me during my sessions, giving me the feeling that I don't get the same level of training as I used to.

      "description": "This happend a while ago and I belive it has been resolved, but sometimes I still wonder if I was truly in the wrong. \n\nLet me paint a picture, of two girls, good friends, talk 24/7 and are known friends. Let's call my friend... Katie. Katie and I were friends for around three years, but around the beginning of last year we've been growing in distance. We start not talking as much, and simply becoming less and less close. Soon enough, I start to find her annoying, yet I'm still friendly and respectful twords her. Never ignoring her and never being rude to her. Let me explain that her and I have a close friend who is still currently my best friend and has been for almost five years now (much longer than her and I have been friends). Let's call my bff... Jim. Katie, Jim, and I were connected at the hip, before she started drifting away from us. Eventually, shit hits the fan when my birthday rolls around. \n\nI had decided that year to just have a small party with close family and maybe a couple of friends, very different to the massive parties I've had every year before. I was sitting at my normal lunch table with Jim and Katie and our immediate friends, talking about my birthday. \nJim: So, what are you going to do for your birthday?\nMe: I don't know, probably a movie or something small. *Me talking directly to him* But whatever is it you'll obviously be invited. *I say it in a joking tone, because everyone knows Jim and I are very close.* \nKatie: I'm clearly invited too, right? *talking in a smartass sort of tone* \nMe: *laughs nervously* I don't know man... I don't know how many people I'm allowed to invite. (This is complete and utter bs because my parents are super chill and would've allowed me 50 guests of I'd ask). \n\nThe conversation is finished there and the table is left with a tense mood for the rest of lunch. Fast forward to the day of my Birthday, by this time Katie has been on my nerves for weeks and I'm very annoyed with her. Right as the last bell rings I see her running up to me.\nKatie: We still on for that movie tonight?? \nMe: *very confused, I'd never given her a definate  that I was ever going to a movie, I just smiled and laughed it off, and told her I hand to catch the bus* \n\nAnother fast forward to the night of my birthday, the movie is over and my parents have just dropped Jim back at home, I was going through stories on snapchat when Katie's story had caught my eye. The post was something under the lines of: \"Today I've been betrayed by people I truly trusted. These people have been ignoring and discluding me lately and I don't know why. I really thought they where my friends, but I was sadly mistaken.\" She then goes to list all the differences we have and ends it with \"I guess some friendships aren't meant to last\". (I dont remember exactly, but I do remember it was unnessisarily dramatic). \n\nNow this pissed me off, it was my birthday and she was saying this shit on snapchat?? I replied to her story with:\nMe: Hey, I have no idea why you're posting these lies on snapchat, I have NOT excluded you. YOU WERE NOT INVITED!! And don't you dare bring Jim into this because he has NOTHING TO DO WITH IT! Goodnight. \n*the next day* \nKatie: You have NO RIGHT to talk to me that way! You've been rude and unfair twords me. \n\nI didn't reply. I was in shock, I showed screenshots to Jim and we both had no clue on how to handle this situation. Now, fun fact about Jim he is what's called... the nicest person on the planet. And because he didnt want any bad feelings, he continued to be her friend and talk with her. And I was totally cool with that, sure it bothered me a bit, but he is aloud to be friends with anyone he chooses. \n\nFinal flashforward, it's the new school year, summer has gone buy and I'm officially on the \"I dislike Katie\" bandwagon. Now, I haven't spoken to her in months, when I see her at school, she seems to have forgotten everything that happened. Which, honestly, I'm okay with. I just want to go back to being aquantences. The first day of school she runs up to me and gives me a big hug, and I reciprocate as to not be rude. But I just get her annoying vibes all over again. I am so angry to be around her and, to this day, I have no idea why. I start ignoring her, like, actually ignoring her. And yeah, kinda a bitchy thing to do, but get this, one day I was at lunch when a friend of mine suddenly texts me. \nFriend: Hey, do you know a Katie? \nMe: Katie (Last Name)?\nFriend: Yeah, she just talked shit about you to me. \nMe: What'd she say?\n(This is the legit text my friend sent to me)\nFriend: Okay so she asked me if you and I were friends and I said yes. And she was like \"well be careful she stopped talking to me and was talking shit\" so I said \"no she wouldn't do that\" and she said \"well she did\" and I said \"you must have misunderstood I know she wouldn't hurt someone like that\" and she was again like, \"she did\" and offered to show to the texts between her and Jim. So I saw the text and it was basically about how Jim told her than you didn't want to be friends with her but he still did.\n\nI am completely dead, my heart sinks. I HAVE talked shit about her behind her back (sounds horrible ik) but that was before the school year started. I was PISSED. I stormed off and texted Jim. \nMe: Katie is talking shit about me. \nJim: WHAT?! What'd she say?\n*I send him was my friend showed me*\nJim: Oh my gosh! I'm so so sorry. I never intended to cause drama, I was just trying to keep it real. \nAnd me being the big teddy bear that I am, forgave him. Afterall, he is my best friend and I trust he wasnt trying to ruin my life or anything. Days past and I've told this story to basically anyone who would listen. Surprisingly everyone I told was like \"yeah she a bitch\". I had NO IDEA everyone hated her so much. \n\nBut what REALLY BOILS MY SOUP is that only days later she comes up to me and gives me a huge hug, congratulating me on the role I had just been given in the school play and asking for a selfie. I say okay, because I hate confrontation. Why the HELL would you talk crap about someone BEHIND THEIR BACK and then go up to them and hug them like NOTHING HAPPENED?? I understand I wasn't very kind twords her in the end but she has NO RIGHT to be such a bitch twords me MONTHS LATER. I know I couple handled the situation better but I'm still upset about this.\n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\n\n(Sidestory, just last week I found out that a good friend of mine confronted Katie about this shit, this is how their conversation went.\nFriend: *sitting next to Katie due to seating chart*\nKatie: Hii (friends name), I'm so happy to be sitting next to you.\nFriend: I'm not. \nKatie: *face drops* what?\nFriend: You've been talking shit about (my name). *turns to teacher* Can I be moved? I dont want to sit next to her. *the teacher moves her*\nKatie: *almost crying*\nI do not know if this is true, this is what my friend told me.)\n",

      "description": "I go to university in the US and am part of a Faith-based organization in which we do stuff ranging from Bible study to soccer games. Since we do not have too many people in our group, we are always on the look out for more. Many people join us for soccer or playing board games but not many of them are interested in studying religion. I think that if someone plays soccer with us, they should join us for other things as well, as part of the group.\n\nThere was one freshman who called me out. I thought he was way out of his limits. He joined me to play FIFA one night, and then stopped answering my texts. I keep asking him to join our faith meetings but he just ignores. Since he doesn't tell me to stop, I keep messaging him and asking him to join, because if he does pick up an interest I don't want him to skip anything. Same applies to the other people I message. I believe that God loves all His children, even the ones who don't care or believe in Him. I want them to at least join us for one session of Bible study. But they don't. Even worse, they have started ignoring even the invites to do other fun things.\n\nBack to that freshman. I messaged him about a large group meeting we had planned to discuss Christianity as well as do other stuff like talk about college experience. He finally responded, but it wasn't what I had hoped. He was like \"Stop messaging me, I am not interested in any of this. Please don't force your meaningless values on me, how would you feel if I kept inviting you to atheism meetings?\" Then he blocked me before I could answer his question.\n\nI may sound like an asshole here, but this is what happens at college. Anyone else in such a situation can understand.",

      "description": "I know you‚Äôve probably already concluded that i‚Äôm the asshole but let me give you same context.\n\nI‚Äôve been friends with this girl for over 6 years. We‚Äôre not as close as we once were but i‚Äôll say she‚Äôs a good friend of mine. \n\nSarah tweets a lot of depressed shit. And yeah we‚Äôre young and wanting to die is now kind of a meme but Sarahs tweets are another level depressed. But the way she is irl is kinda different. Her life is pretty good tbh. Her parents paid for uni so she‚Äôs not in debt, she has a pretty good relationship with her family, she‚Äôs somewhat comfortable with money (as comfortable as a 20 something year old person can be, really), she‚Äôs pretty social, is always up for a night out and is overall a social person (not saying social people can‚Äôt be depressed just added this in just incase it would be relevant.)\n\nShe also has the worst mood swings i have ever seen in a person and she‚Äôs pretty fucking passive aggressive. When she doesn‚Äôt get her way, she emotionally manipulates people by making them feel bad about their decision and at this point i‚Äôm immune to it but it doesn‚Äôt stop her. She doesn‚Äôt hold herself accountable for her actions and playing victim is basically her middle name but I learn to live with it because everyone has their bad attributes right?\n\nI find that people are usually more honest on the internet so i try to take her tweets seriously but there‚Äôs only so much i can do as far as helping her. i check up on her, I always tell her i love her and reassure her whenever i can but there‚Äôs nothing like professional help. I suggest good therapists that she can go to but she always gives one excuse or the other about why she won‚Äôt go for therapy.\n\nFast forward to today. She came over to my house and we were just chilling. We‚Äôre pretty good friends as i‚Äôve said before so we were both just working on different things in each other‚Äôs company. Suddenly she stands up and wants to leave. I look up at her and she‚Äôs sniffling. I ask what‚Äôs wrong and she just says she wants space and leaves. Mind you, this isn‚Äôt the first time something like this has happened so i let her leave.\n\nAbout an hour later (this is at about 2pm btw), a mutual friend calls me and tells me to check up on Sarah. Apparently she texted another one of our mutual friends ranting about how ‚Äòshe pushes hard but nobody pushes her harder‚Äô and some cryptic shit about being tired of everything. Of course the guy is confused and asks her to explain and she replies with ‚Äòyou‚Äôll know soon‚Äô. \n\nHer number wasn‚Äôt going through, her texts stop delivering and no one knows where tf she is. We‚Äôre all freaking out of course and calling her phone constantly. I‚Äôm the only person who lives in the same city as her but I was tied up at the moment and couldn‚Äôt go to her house so I called her flatmate. Her flatmate said she wasn‚Äôt home yet but would be in about 30 minutes but 30 minutes is a long ass time and a lot could happen in that time so I was basically going crazy.\n\nWhen her flatmate finally got home, she called me kinda pissed and said Sarah was in her room chilling. Apparently she rushed out of work early because she was scared about Sarah too. I was livid. I told her to give sarah the phone and that‚Äôs when i told Sarah that i wasn‚Äôt gonna keep being her friend if she kept pulling shit like that (not her first suicide scare but definitely the scariest). I told her that i couldn‚Äôt handle the emotional turmoil and i was just tired of chasing her instead of taking care of myself.\n\nAlso, it wasn‚Äôt really a spur of the moment thing that i regret now. I‚Äôd been thinking of it for a bit and i still mean everything i said to her.\n\nSo, AITA for telling her i couldn‚Äôt handle the weight of her friendship anymore?",

We hand made this bookshelf and we have our books on it, he put them up only like 2 months ago (so 9 months after we moved in...) after a particularly bad time. (After christmas. He spent it alone because his family didnt invite him over -they dont like him-and we were at family who dont like him so he wasnt invited there. He asked if we could bring some food back but we didnt get his text.\n\nHe was mad, next day his dusty figurines were on our hand made bookshelf.\n\nHe's moving out after our lease, we told him we weren't renewing last month. He immediately took his dining room table and put it in his room for a week before moving it to a friends house.\n\nSo I knew he wanted his stuff away from us, Im cleaning the apartment up a little bit, see his dusty figurines and put them in a box and set them infront of his door. Didnt close the box so he can look and make sure all his shit is there, I have a few figurines honestly if he tries to claim them I dont care, take them all, get out I dont care if I lose my figurines to get rid of him.\n\nBut he be upset I touch his stuff. Am i the asshole? I want a clean apartment. I dont want his figurines to dust up the place and make my future roommate afraid to move in, thinking we're dirty. He visits a lot and I want to make sure he knows its not us.\n\n(Deep cleaning today for a surprise for my boyfriend bc he's going through a hard time) \n\nOne last thing. I left it open for a reason. I wasnt packing it away, I was getting his stuff for him so he can do something with it. I can understand someone being upset if I tried to pack their stuff so that they didnt know if they had all their stuff.",

He was always an ass and I was always a snitch ( not anymore), but we were children, it was always common for siblings to fight. We would always disagree on a lot of things but as a kid, he was still my brother and I loved him. My brother was an extrovert and he had a lot of friends but he was egotistical, selfish and a troublemaker. I was always a shy introvert who had harder time with people and I did what I was told and tried to be a good kid.\n\nNow here's the problem\n\nWhen I was around 6th or 7th grade ( my brother was in high school), I grew up a little bit, I stopped being annoying to him and mind my own business and even tried to be nice to my brother but everything changed. He started to bully and harass me every single day ( I was getting bullied in school and had low self-esteem and confidence and he didn't help). He always called me a retard or dumb and if I tried standing up for myself he would get physical and that lasted for two years. I would cry myself to sleep because of him. My parents knew this and they did everything they could like talking to him or threatening him but they couldn't do much. I don't know what I did to deserve that but he did it with no regrets.\n\nNow we cooled off and I try to avoid him but even now when we do talk he would still try to put me down. I don't love him because of it and because people always compared me to him and said to be more like him and I lived my life thinking I should be like him and things he said to me were truth. I learned that I am not perfect but I shouldn't be yo hard on myself. For all of that I don't like him and hate him even though I try to love him he is making it hard for me. \n\nHe stopped that behavior towards me for the most part but I still can't move on from what he did to me with no regrets.\nWhen I tell people this they tell me stuff like \" That was in the past\" or \" He's family \" and I don't know if I'm the asshole for still holding grudges towards him.",

      "description": "On mobile, I'll try my best.\n\nAt the end of 2018, my old roommate moved out. He decided to go to a different college. He was a really messy guy and didn't clean up after himself, especially in the kitchen. The day he was supposed to leave, the sink was completely full of his dirty dishes. Like completely full. He had mentioned that his girlfriend would be coming to pick his things up. I was under the impression that it was a big blue bin he had left. \n\nBeing that I had cleaned his dishes in the past because he had no intentions of doing them, I decided to throw his dishes out. I didn't want to waste MY time and energy cleaning them. I figured they weren't that important if he left them there dirty anyways.\n\nSo, come the end of January, I get a message from his girlfriend that she was looking to pick up some stuff. I said that the bin was still here and ready to go whenever, but I was going to toss it at the end of the week.\n\nHis girlfriends says that she didn't know about a bin and was looking for dishes. I said that I threw them out. She did not like that. I said something along the lines of, \"They're gone. They were sitting in the sink dirty, was I supposed to clean them?\" She continues on to say that I had no right to do that because they belonged to my roommate (Who had moved out 2 months ago). The conversation ended with her calling me an liar and saying that I can talk to her boyfriend if I had anything else to say. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTL;DR - Roommate leaves dirty dishes in sink after moving out. I throw them away. His girlfriend messages me 2 months after he moves out trying to get his dishes back. Calls me a liar.\n",

      "title": "WIBTA for reporting my prior place of employment to health department/food inspector?",
      "description": "I worked at this place for a few months over the previous summer. I‚Äôm considering reporting them to some type of food inspector because I feel that since I worked there and have been aware of some things, I‚Äôm partly responsible.\n\nSome background: Place is a small business that specializes in whole foods and ingredients. Common stop for the typical small-town hippie all organic wave. However, also good for people with allergies or health issues. They also have a small kitchen where they make deli-type foods to sell, like pint of pasta salad, or chicken salad, etc. \n\nThis place has committed what I would describe as food crimes. Something Gordon Ramsay would shit a brick over, possibly have a stroke from. They blatantly ignore food safety regs and guidelines and neither of the owners who work in the kitchen are serve safe certified, nor do I think they‚Äôve done any research or inquiry in to proper food etiquette and sanitation methods for serving the public. \n\nHere are some things they‚Äôve done when I worked there:\n\n- upon finding moldy, dark, slime covered lettuce (they don‚Äôt order by supply and demand so there‚Äôs always extras) they insisted it was fine to pull off the rotten leaves and salvage anything that looked ‚Äúokay‚Äù underneath to serve \n\n- emptied out containers of seafood chowder that was old &amp; hadn‚Äôt sold, put the soup in a strainer in the sink, and rinsed off the sea food to make clam cakes with to serve\n\n- thawing chicken at room temperature, in the summer, over night. In the AM it had an internal temp of 70 degrees (safety range is below 40F or above 165F) and they still insisted I use it and not waste it \n\n- frequent use of expired food, like pasta, noodles, canned goods, etc to make food w/ and sell \n\n- came to work to find tofu on counter, I‚Äôm supposed to make a tofu style salad. I make a beautiful, yummy salad and package it, it goes on floor for sale. Employee then informs me it had been left out over night. Owners knew this and never told me, they wanted me to use it anyway. \n\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking I should‚Äôve spoken up about this stuff. I did, multiple times. I tried to explain that chicken must be at 165F or above to serve, and they‚Äôd mock me and scoff at me, like *I* was trying to waste their money by not wanting to use chicken out of regs to serve  to the public. I tried to do things within servsafe/food safety regulations but it was always an annoyance to them. Like it offended them to conduct their business ethically. \n\nSo I probably sound like a total uppity asshole, right? Like who hasn‚Äôt eaten expired corn before? I‚Äôve had plenty of ‚Äúprobably shouldn‚Äôt have eaten that expired yogurt‚Äù moments and eaten questionable things, and out of date milk. \n\nBut what makes it so different for me at work is the fact that when I eat something out of date, I‚Äôm making that choice for myself. I‚Äôm not feeding it to other people who are under the impression that they‚Äôre eating really strictly regulated food from a kitchen certified to feed the public. Not to mention, a lot of our customers have compromised immune systems and health problems. Foodborne illness is going to wreak a different type of havoc on a person who has a bad immune system or cancer, and some food borne illness can take anywhere from a couple days, a week, to a month to show symptoms. The customer wouldn‚Äôt even be able to identify the trigger of the illness and so I don‚Äôt see how this business will ever be forced to practice proper food safety and be held accountable for their negligence.\n\nSo I‚Äôm stuck with this sense of responsibility, to maybe report this anonymously to people who inspect kitchens or cooking methods. Idk. I don‚Äôt want them to know I did, obviously. I don‚Äôt want to tear down their business, I am by no means being vindictive, but I just feel at odds. Would it be fucked up of me, or even more fucked up of me to not do anything? \n\nI‚Äôve secured a new job that I‚Äôve worked since September that I love. I work at a great restaurant with amazing people. We‚Äôre like family over here, so I‚Äôm not worried about losing an employment opportunity from my previous job if I do report this. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd go into detail about their actions, maybe just suggest to an inspector to check them out, anonymously? \n\nTL;DR\nPlace I used to work at had really disgusting habits with the food we were serving to customers, don‚Äôt know if I should report this anonymously or suggest a routine inspection or not, WIBTA for doing this to a small business?

      "description": "So a few months ago I had an altercation at a concert and I've been wondering about how others would have reacted/if I might be a bit of an asshole here as well so here's the story. Usual apologies for formatting on mobile, etc. \nIt's Slash and Myles Kennedy in Denver CO on a Wednesday night so there are a lot of people there more interested in socialization and drinking than live music. I must preface the story with this detail because if you love live music (as I do) then that crowd can become a bit of an annoyance as the show goes on. \n\nSo my girlfriend and I started about halfway from the back and immediately noticed behind us a guy basically pouring booze down the girl he seemed to have just met. His buddies kept disappearing for more drinks and, the more they fed her alcohol, the louder she got. So - as is the trend at GA shows we kept moving upwards as people left. Problem: they figured out I knew how to move through a crowd and followed. Steadily. \nAfter about 3/4 of the show we have been steadily moving up closer to the stage (with them finding their way to us every time, her getting louder and louder) until it gets to the point where I can hear her over Myles Kennedy. Now... For those of you who don't know who he is go listen because he has a higher register and I really don't know how she was drowning him out but she was.\nSo I finally turn around to the sober guy (the one getting her drunk) between songs and say \"hey could you quieten her down a bit? She's so drunk she's yelling over Myles. Thanks\" and turn around to watch the show. \nWell about a song later his buddy (the booze-fetcher) tries to turn me around and loudly and aggressively explain concert etiquette (i.e. \"It's a concert man it's gonna be loud\") to me but when the next song started (World On Fire) I shoved his hand off my shoulder and said \"I understand concerts but NOT during this f***ing song\" and turned around again. My GF (who had stayed out of it to this point but had been bitching for an hour about the drunk)  sensed my tension and dragged me further into the crowd before it escalated (as the grumbling behind me was starting to imply) and this time they couldn't follow as 2 of them were too wasted to negotiate the crowd. I was angry for a bit and haven't really doubted myself until another post on this sub earlier today so now I have to ask: Am I The Asshole? \n\nTL:DR: sober guy pours drinks down drunk chick at a concert - when she starts yelling over the band I ask him to shush her cuz she's too drunk and him and his buddy take offense. AITA?",

So the closes thing I‚Äôve done to ‚Äúcheating‚Äù was dming a celebrity and saying she‚Äôs gorgeous.

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to get married to my girlfriend for not having enough sex in our relationship?",
      "description": "This is my first time posting here so forgive me if I mess anything up. Im doing my best to follow every rule that you guys have. \n\nSo onto the issue at hand: I met my current girlfriend when we were in college (about 5ish years ago). We started out as fuck-buddies to blow off some steam in-between classes. We both had huge sex drives and would have sex at least 3-4 times a week, often times with multiple times during a meet up. We both eventually developed feelings for each other and we‚Äôre now happily in a relationship. Sex/physical touch is really important to me. It‚Äôs how I feel close to my partner.\n\nWe‚Äôve been together almost five years now, and for the last two I‚Äôve noticed a significant decrease in our sex life. I‚Äôve tried addressing the issue with my partner multiple times but she just kind of blows it off, blaming it on stress or being tired. \n\nHere‚Äôs some background: About two years ago, I got a promotion that required me to move to a new city. I talked with my partner and we both agreed that we would relocate. However, that new city is notoriously more expensive than where we were living. We weren‚Äôt struggling, but she got a second job to help out. She would often work 20 hours a week on top of her normal 30 hours a week at her primary job. This is when I first noticed a drop in our sex life. But, I understood. We were in a new city, had new jobs, she was working more. So our sex decreased from 3-4 a week to maybe once a month. We also put on a bit of weight (both of us) nothing drastic, maybe 20-30lbs. Relationship gut and all. She still looked absolutely stunning. I would do everything in my power to tell her that she was sexy, beautiful, gorgeous, etc. I complimented her constantly, but when I tried to even makeout with my girlfriend, she would push me away and tell me to stop. That she didn‚Äôt feel attractive or that she was tired, or that she wasn‚Äôt in the mood. I tried to motivate us both to get to the gym but she would go with me for a bit and then give up. Not to mention that whenever we would go we would bicker and argue, so we stopped going. \n\nThis went on for about a year. Then I got word that I was up for another promotion at work that required me to move‚Ä¶ right back to the city where we started. So up we go, we pack and move back down to the first city. We‚Äôre happier, living in a place that costed half of what we were paying in the other city. So she only needed to work one job. Yay! \n\nHowever, then we find out her mom is sick. The doctors give her about 1-2 weeks before her mom is dead. So she packs everything and flies out to take care of her mom. Well, it turns out that her mom rallies and she ends up being out there for 3 months taking care of her mom in this never ending roller coaster of will she or won‚Äôt she die. She ends up coming back home while her mom is still sick because she ran out of time-off and had to go back to work. Now, I know that she‚Äôs in a pretty fucked up headspace from this. So, I give her some space and don‚Äôt pressure her whatsoever. Our sex life has dropped from once a month to basically non-existent. I try a few times but get pushed away. Not a big deal. I totally understand. I comfort her during this hard time, staying up late talking with her, building blanket forts, taking care of the chores around the house, giving her back rubs and doing everything I can to ensure that she feels taken care of and secure.\n\nA few months go by, and we haven‚Äôt had sex. I try talking about it and she bursts into tears about her mom dying and how she can‚Äôt even fathom being sexual. It sucks, but again‚Äî I get it. This goes on for about seven months, all the while her mom is on a transplant list (I literally don‚Äôt know how she went from 1-2 weeks to seven months. Call it a miracle or just the classic Russian stubbornness but it is what it is). Finally, she gets a transplant! Yay! She flies back for the transplant and all goes well. Her mom is in recovery and doing well!\n\nAwesome! So, she comes back home but her sex drive still hasn‚Äôt changed. It‚Äôs been about six months since the successful transplant and we haven‚Äôt had sex in almost 4 months. Everyday she comes home and smokes a ton of weed and gets way too high, and won‚Äôt even kiss me let alone anything else. I‚Äôve tried talking to her about this subject so many times but all I get is lip service and her telling me ‚ÄúI‚Äôll work on it‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to therapy‚Äù but nothing changes. I still am doing my best to take care of her and let her know that she‚Äôs loved, but Im starting to get really frustrated with her because for almost 2 years we‚Äôve only had sex a handful of times. Maybe about 4 or 5. And like I said earlier, sex is really important to me. It‚Äôs how I feel close to my partner. And without sex (or physical intimacy) I feel more and more distant to my partner. I‚Äôve tried talking with her about not having sex but just doing foreplay or just making out, but she refuses to compromise and just falls back on how ‚Äúemotionally hollow‚Äù she feels and how she just can‚Äôt give that to me. \n\nShe‚Äôs talking about marriage soon and I cannot even begin to think about getting married to someone who can‚Äôt be intimate with me in any meaning of the word. I still love this woman to death and I can‚Äôt imagine being without her, but I feel like a complete asshat for having needs and wanting to have sex with her. Life is full of stressors and emotional events and I think it‚Äôs important for us not to let that get in-between our relationship or our intimacy.\n\nSo, AITA for being hesitant about marriage because of our lack of intimacy in our relationship?\n\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend and I have been together almost 5 years, but our sex life has decreased significantly for the last two years of our life due to multiple stressors in our life. Girlfriend is talking about marriage but I don‚Äôt know if I can get married to a woman who doesn‚Äôt want to be intimate with me anymore.",

      "description": "So today a friend of mine told me and our other friends that she talked to the local army recruiter and intends to join the armed forces of the United States of America. She has some time before she can join because she needs to study for the exams and get in better shape first.\n\nWhen I heard the news, I nearly turned pale and sick with worry for her. Not only am I obviously horribly worried for her life, I also personally am very much so against the United States as a country, particularly the military, and while I do share my opinion about it when it is relevant, it is far from the only thing I talk about. I am also currently reading Johnny Got His Gun, and this book has only further driven me away from the path of American nationalism. I don't want to see my friend crippled or dead fighting for the men that lead this country.\n\nSo I want to have a talk with her about why I am so worried about her and that I don't think it is worth her life for whatever salary and benefits that she is promised. And that it isn't right to fight people in their countries halfway across the world for it. But I am worried that I might be overstepping my boundaries. We used to be romantically involved so us talking about serious topics isn't something we aren't used to, but I think that I may come across as forcing my beliefs down her throat and not letting her make her own decisions. I don't intend to have more than one conversation about the matter, because she can make her choices without me on her back, but Would I Be The Asshole for even bringing it up?",

      "description": "TLDR; scared that homophobic parents will cut me off financially so i've been lying to them about being straight \n\n\nMy parents immigrated to the US after my dad's job led him here. I'm incredibly lucky to live in an upper middle class family, and they've always told me that money was not an issue. \n\nAbout 8 years ago, I came out as bisexual to my sister and she was incredibly accepting. I felt safe telling her this, because despite my parents more non-tolerant beliefs, we lived in a very liberal suburban city. Plus, I talked to her all the time so of course I knew, lmao. Since then, there's been no qualms about my sexual identity, and we just basically send each other gay memes (even though she is straight) and laugh at them together. It felt great to tell a family member because I knew that I could never tell my parents. \n\nMy dad is an avid Trump supporter and always made negative comments about how he saw gay people walking in the park, or warning me not to go to the city alone because there's a lot of gay people there. Over the years, he's become more tolerant (but I wouldn't go as far as to say accepting) and even allowed my lesbian friend of 10+ years to sleep over in high school with me and a few other childhood friends. We are strictly platonic, and she even has a gf, but just the fact that he trusted her was a huge leap in my book. But I'm so afraid that this progress is just an illusion because tolerating gay people is one thing, and having a gay person in your immediate family is another. \n\nBefore going off to university I've always told myself I'll only come out to my parents if I were in a serious relationship with a girl. Honestly, this mental barrier scared me from initiating any relationship throughout college, because even if I ended up with a man I would want to let him know I'm bisexual. But in the end, this made my secret keeping much easier. \n\nNow that I'm applying to medical school, I realize just how much of their money is being poured into me. My dad was so proud of me for applying, and even made a deal with me saying he'd pay for all of my graduate studies. I know I'm so incredibly lucky to have the prospect of being debt-free but I'm also so wrought in guilt for keeping a huge part of my identity from him. I've already kept this secret for so long, and I was honestly planning on keeping it until I'm at least like 30 years old. AITA? ",

      "description": "My BF (26) and I (23F) have been dating for 3 months. He Likes a lot of right-wing meme pages on Facebook (Count Dankula style stuff) and watches lots of comedic offensive YouTube videos. I can date someone with different political beliefs or humour to me as long as they aren't hateful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hate r\\*pe and p\\*dophilia jokes and asked my BF to stop making them bc of my trauma, and he mostly has. While he's toned down the offensive humour around me, he makes a lot of anti-Semitic references. We live in a place in England with a .7% Jewish population, I think he gets most of it from the internet because he references Jewish people controlling everything, which they blatantly don't. He used to enjoy spouting random Holocaust denial things to get me riled up. One time I got really upset by him doing this, I raised my voice and said if he was an actual Holocaust denier I was going to break up with him. He laughed, recorded me saying that and sent it to his friend. Later he said he's not actually a Holocaust denier. He calls taxes \"Jew taxes\", when KFC stopped delivering to him he called it a \"nosy move\", and when he's angry instead of swearing normally he'll throw around words like \"k\\*ke\", \"f\\*\\*\\*ot\" and the n-word. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne time we were drunk and I told him his offensive humour is upsetting to me and he said he wanted to unlearn it bc he accidentally fell into it. I think he started to get involved in it when his ex dumped him in Feb 2018, he had 7 months of breakdowns and drunken blackouts. When sober, I said unliking the FB pages would be a good step (he spends 4+ hours a day on FB). He said he would, I'm not sure if he did or not. Later he said \"you know I do actually care about minorities, right?\" I said I didn't, the only time he references them is when he's being mean about them. He says he'll stop being offensive, then he'll say stuff like \"I'm 26, I don't exactly see my sense of humour changing at this point\" and is proud of that stubbornness. He says I'm too sensitive, but the anti-Semitism in particular seems to come from an unironic place because of how persistent it is. I've learned to just shut down and not reply because he enjoys getting me aggravated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's a nice BF, he looked after me when I'm sick, was patient when I couldn't have sex for a long time, comes over sometimes even though he's allergic to my cat, and he's proud of my accomplishments and protective of me. I've had awful boyfriends in the past so I'm patient because I know everyone has flaws. The reason I haven't broken up with him is because he did stop making the r\\*pe and p\\*dophilia jokes and stopped saying the n-word so I thought he might stop the anti-Semitism too and that I'd \"unradicalised\" him or something. But he's not really stopping and I'm constantly guilty because I feel like I'm betraying my values or I'm being too controlling. AITA?",

      "description": "Obligatory \"phone post, bad format\" warning.\n\nThis problem starts a month ago: In mid december, We had a project where we had to make a christmas-themed dessert.\n\nThis period in our school is project hell week with deadlines for seven projects in the same three day period, followed up by our periodical examination, before the Christmas party then Christmas break.\n\nI immediately thought of making a cheesecake because my brother studies culinary and he had experience making cheesecakes. This led to me having to bring cheesecakes for us to decorate.\n\nTime goes by and the day arrives when I have to bring the cheesecakes. I bring them, as promised, but no one brought anything. This was to be expected, to be completely honest.\n\nNow, let's call my friend \"Jake\". He's currently at top 9, with me at 7. Jake was supposed to bring the decorations: something for snow, a gingerbread man, and whatever else they thought of.\n\nWe ended up not being able to make one, but this one project made up 30% of my grade, which is dangerous since our system works in a way that if you get a grade lower than 85, even if all your other subjects are at 99 or 98, you wont be in the honor students list.\n\nSo after classes, I pleaded with our teacher to allow me to record myself making the dessert, and she approved of it.\nI admittedly was angry at them. I didnt want to drop out of the honor roll. Knowing I can get at most half of the total score, I did all I could and passed my dessert on the resumption of classes in January. \n\nThey, of course, saw this and asked me why I brought it. I explained that and all else, and passed my USB and dessert. Fast forward a few days, today, and Jake had a grade in TLE of 81, and he bawled his eyes out in the cafeteria. \n\nI feel bad, but I feel like it was my fault that I didn't let him join in on my project. I moved down to Rank 8 and he was removed. \n\nMy teacher explained to us, when Jake confronted about her it, that she didnt tell them because I was \"the only one who had the drive to ask her for consideration.\" \n\nNow Jake hasnt talked to me since earlier, even when I approached him. I've said sorry many times already but I'm curious as to see if I was really in the wrong.\n\n\nThis ended up being way too long, I can never get straight to the point.\n\nTL;DR - I recieved consideration to be able to still pass a project even when my group failed to make one (group mates failed to deliver), and decided not to tell my friend. This resulted in him being removed from the honor roll, and now I think he doesnt want to talk to me because of it.",

I worked hard to meet up and play video games over the coming months.\n\nBut unfortunately my mental health decreased further with increased stress from my Masters course, working 3 days a week and struggling with self harm and feelings of suicide. I made sure that I messaged her every day to stay in touch but had to consistently turn down gaming requests and phone calls - which would be a minimum of 2 hours. I was barely surviving getting out of bed, working on my thesis and eating. I hadn't even switched on my tv or hung out with uni friends for the past two months.\n\nA week before my birthday and deadline for my thesis project, I get a message after cancelling on a meet up i made in a brief moment of positivity, telling me that she deserves better people in her life, has tried to be there for me but needs to think of herself, then calls me a selfish bitch and that she needs a friend now and cant wait another second. \n\nI begged for another chance, promised to change and cried my eyes out, but she said goodbye.\n\n\n I graduated and moved back home a week later. Some time passed with no contact other than her liking my photos on Instagram. I was mad that she thought she could cut me out of her life that way and then continue to like my photos, so I blocked her.\n\nShe confronted me about blocking her and then we spoke again about what happened and she tried to understand my side of the story, apologised for what she said and I accepted and apologised for not thinking of her feelings and how me not spending time with her made her feel, especially considering her anxiety, depression and abandonment issues stemming from her mother. \n\nBut I was still absolutely furious about what had happened and grieved the loss of the friendship. \n\nWe spoke for a bit but i realised that i hadnt forgiven her for the way she treated me. I went on a night out with my old school friends and it made me realise that even though we'd (school friends) met up 3-4 times a year and spoken infrequently, we all were just thrilled to see each other and understood that life gets in the way but doesn't affect our friendship and love for each other. Even when I'd cancelled on meeting up with them more often than not and they had done the same to me.\n\nI got drunk and angry, reread all the old messages and sent a strongly worded text telling my best friend to go fuck herself, that it was over. She was draining and self-centred. I'm not the meek little mousy girl who would follow her around anymore and be treated like shit at the worst and lowest moment of my life.\n\nFurther texts were sent back and forth and I didn't hold back. I was a dick about it. I could have been nicer, but I was so angry and just relieved that I had finally said what had been bubbling away since she sent that text before my birthday and I'd rolled over and begged for her back.\n\nI regret the way I did it, but I don't regret the outcome. \n\nIt probably makes me a cunt, but I'm glad it's over. I would have been cut out again by her later on and made to feel like shit later in my life when I got a full time job/partner/moved because life just fucking happens, I don't owe anyone my time in the way she seemed to expect from me. \n\nSo yeah, I've tried to be honest here and not leave anything out.\n\nWhat do you guys think, am I the arsehole for ending the friendship?\n",

After a minute he told me that he would give me a pound(sterling not punch)if I told him the answer now instead of at the end of the lesson(this happened during math).I told him that I would agree to that so we were thinking of a person to give the pound to hold so no one could back down I thought to give it to friend2 and we agreed. When I told him the answer (which is i(which stands for imaginary))he turned to friend3 and took the money from him. I was pissed since when I asked for the money he said that i was the scammer because apparently telling the fact that there is an answer for the question: what is the square root of -1 by saying that its an actual number so they can be sure it exists.

      "description": "So, I‚Äôm disabled and normally that isn‚Äôt too much of an issue. I can do most things on my own and my family and friends know that and they treat me pretty normally. If I really seem to be struggling they might ask if I need help, but they don‚Äôt push it if I say I‚Äôm fine. And unless I‚Äôm literally about to drop all my stuff everywhere or fall or something, they never just jump in to help without asking. I think that‚Äôs only happened a couple times. \n\nThat isn‚Äôt always the case with strangers though. I know they mean well but oh my god, it is ridiculous sometimes. I don‚Äôt mind people offering to  help or asking. Sometimes I actually do need help and I am extremely grateful for it if I actually needed it. I also love how most people are very kind and will help if I ask for it. \n\nHowever, there are some cases where I am doing something that I do often, if not every single day, and some passerby assumes I cannot do it and asks if I need help. That is totally fine and I appreciate it. What I hate is when I say ‚Äúoh no thank you, I‚Äôm fine‚Äù and they just keep on saying ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù. Some people just keep on asking. And occasionally someone will just do the thing for me anyway. I even had one guy ask if I needed help picking my couple of small shopping bags up when I was at the bus station and getting them on the bus. I said no thank you, and before I had a chance to even tell him my bus wasn‚Äôt there yet, he picked up my stuff, carried them onto the bus he was getting on, sat them on the front seat, and went and sat down. So I had to get onto the bus, get my stuff, and get off. \n\nI was kinda complaining about this recently and my couple friends I was talking to all basically said I was being petty and unappreciative and that I should ‚Äújust be grateful people care enough to help‚Äù. I later brought it up to someone else and they said the exact same thing. Originally I did appreciate it but it is so annoying to have to explain to people that I can do my normal every day stuff whenever I go out. I never really thought that being annoyed and even kind angry about this was an asshole thing to do but apparently the people around me seem to think it is. What do you guys think? Am I just overreacting? Should I be more grateful that people try so hard to help me? Like I said, I originally thought it was totally reasonable to be annoyed by this but now I‚Äôm second guessing it and wondering if I‚Äôm just super petty and negative. ",

      "description": "My fiancee seems to think that I'm a jerk for not liking to visit my dad, who lives an 80 minute drive away.\n\nI can't place my finger on it lately, but the gist of it is this: While I respect him, I don't really like him.\n\nHe's a complete slob when it comes to keeping up his house. Everything is held together with bits of string and jerry-rigged with duct tape. The shower broke two months ago and rather than just buying a showerhead, he bought a garden foot hose, ran it from the utility room sink, out the window, and into the bathroom.  The replacement showerhead was cheaper. There are other larger repairs that need to be made but he won't even let me pay to get the stuff fixed, because that would involve waiting at home with for a repairman rather than going out golfing or fishing with his friends.\n\nMy dad thinks he's an excellent cook. We usually go out to eat (another story, because he'll rant and rave about how having buttered toast or medium-rare steak is going to kill me) when I'm there, but my dad has some strange ideas. He thinks that \"high temperatures\" cause metal pans to turn into lead, because he read it somewhere on the internet. And that frying anything at all is unhealthy. So his MO is usually to boil everything together in a pot - usually after combining random ingredients together like meat, fruits, vegetables, and instant oatmeal - then slathering everything with ketchup.\n\nHe never throws anything out. Old newspapers, old laptops going back to the 90's, and radios all over gathering dust. Most of the time I'm sneezing constantly there because the place is a mess. Then he'll say it's because I use tissues instead of a handkerchief.\n\nBasically, I still respect him and I'm grateful for the fact that he raised me and paid for my education when I was younger, but now I really can't stand to be around him.",

      "description": "So I just recently found out that an old friend I went to school with (and am still in the same social circle as) and their spouse have been habitually selling sub par / unsafe products (of high value) in their business. It appears to be either flippant carelessness or deliberate misrepresentation of the state of the goods as it has been happening for several years. I believe it's the latter as the owner has been taken to court 20+ times for the offenses lodged by shafted customers. Despite this, they have never paid any of the money they have been ordered to pay back. Meanwhile have been living lush and ostentatiously, which now appears to be thanks to what is basically fraud.\n\nI was really shaken to find out via a Facebook post from a customer (on a local page) who had paid several thousand and weeks later is still waiting for product. The company's ph lines are disconnected and no one responds to emails. The customer is a young family with a kid and they can't afford to lose the money they spent and its putting them in a very stressful situation.\nI read their story and the story of many others and I thought I needed to help if I can.\n\nAITA if I get my nose involved in the matter when it's really not my business? Am I wrong to use my knowledge /position as a friend to go against my friend because I feel their actions are immoral? \n\nOr AITA if I don't try and help those they have ripped off? Should I just pretend nothing is happening and leave it to the authorities who have so far been toothless and little helps for victims?\n\nI'm conflicted. I just want victims to get their money back.

Basically, he has bipolar disorder and he's always moping around about everything and just in general he's always thinking irrationally. We were just talking about this thing on the news about a kid who committed suicide. That's where it kinda took a turn and he said that he can relate to them. I was already irritated because he changed the topic to something depressing like usual. He also just destroyed the mood. I regret saying it but we started having an argument about it and I was just trying to explain to him that he needs to stop talking about his mental health when he denies to take medication. It ended with me saying that if he's so depressed and if he hates his life so much, to kill himself. I caught on immediately and apologized but he was already hurt by it. He didn't reply to my apologies, he just left. I feel like an asshole but at the same time it's kinda true.\n\n",

      "description": "***Please note:  I am simply asking if I‚Äôm the asshole for how I handled things, NOT if my BF is the asshole***\n\nMy BF (36M) and I (38F) have been together over 4 years, and friends 12 years before that.  I‚Äôll call him Joe, to ease storytelling.\n\nOne night last week when Joe was drinking at home, he took his Ambien and went to bed.  He started acting amorous.  We‚Äôve talked, in the past, about how unwilling I am to accept his advances when he‚Äôs taken his meds. I don‚Äôt feel he can give consent if I know he won‚Äôt remember our lovemaking.  \n\nJoe told me he was fine with it, and appreciated my concern.  We‚Äôve had evenings where when spooning for the night one thing leads to another and we have sex.  \n\nLast week, the booze plus the Ambien caused him to start sexy-time.  Joe went down on me with no warm up.  It felt awkward, and I pulled away. He told me that he knew I wasn‚Äôt going to get off that way, and was going to try something different.  He grabbed a vibrator (Hitachi) and started playing we me. While it was intense, I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to orgasm.  I was stone cold sober, and just felt awkward about the whole experience.  \n\nWe‚Äôve played with BDSM where I am very much submissive. This particular evening, he decided to top me in ways we had discussed but never formalized the boundaries.  Joe started getting rough.  Fingering me really hard, realizing it was his ticket to get me to squirt, then trying to shove his fist in me-something we‚Äôve never done before.  When that wasn‚Äôt working he kept insisting I ‚Äúrelax‚Äù and tried to get the hitachi into me. It became him alternating between the toy and his fist. Even with lube, I asked him to stop several times. He would use his dominant voice and tell me to relax and open up.  \n\nEventually, it moved to anal play. He was just as aggressive, and not able to hear me asking to slow down or stop.  \n\nThe end resulted in me bleeding from both ends as I had several tears. \n\nBecause of work and all around life issues, we weren‚Äôt able to talk right away. 2 days later, I texted him to say that I needed some serious aftercare.  He cancelled his plans for that night, came over, got naked and climbed into bed and held me.  I then told him a very abridged version of what happened.  ‚ÄúYou were very ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù ‚ÄúYou pushed me far past where I expected to ever be‚Äù.  I even asked if in that kind of situation, should I have used our safety words of colors to get him to hear me, as stop and no didn‚Äôt work. \n\nHe apologized several times.  And I accepted.  I know he would never intentionally hurt me.  I know I can‚Äôt possibly make him feel worse than he already does.  And the truth is I don‚Äôt want to.  \n\nTonight he made a comment about my wearing underwear to bed recently. He assumed it had to do with my periods.  Which is so completely wrong. I‚Äôm wearing underwear because there‚Äôs medication for the tearing on both sides.  I told him it had to do with our ‚Äòrough‚Äô night.  \n\nWe just had an argument where he tells me ITA, because I haven‚Äôt told him everything.  I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to.  All I can think, is that if I‚Äôm 100% candid, he‚Äôs going to feel like a rapist.  \n\nI do NOT see his as such.  I just know I‚Äôm in physical pain, and don‚Äôt want to rehash as bad choice he made.  He got pissed off tonight, and has since fallen asleep because I‚Äôm upset over something that‚Äôs he‚Äôs already apologized for, and I‚Äôm shitty for not telling him everything. \n\nSo AITA for not disclosing all the details from that night? And if so, how do I tell Joe what he did?",

However, now I am home for winter break and I can see how ill she is.

I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready to say good bye yet. I‚Äôve had her for basically her whole life since I was 6, and I just feel like I wasn‚Äôt the best owner to her.

      "description": "I was on an eight hour flight from Hawaii to Orange County.  My parents and my siblings were on another flight since it was cheaper for me to fly separately.  My dad asked if I wanted to switch tickets with him but since I knew he'd be taking care of my baby brothers during the flight, I felt like flying separately so I could get some good sleep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat down in my seat which was closest to the aisle.  Almost everyone was in their seats until this really loud mother came on with her daughters.  Her daughters were a little younger than me (16-18).  They came to my row and sat their luggage up in the storage compartment.  She then asked me if I'd want to trade her seats a few rows back.  I looked back to where she was pointing and it was a window seat next to two pretty large individuals.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI respectfully declined and said I would remain in my seat.  She started to get super irritated and went on a rant about how crazy her trip has been and how she didn't want to be separated from her daughters.  She went and sat in the back and I thought it'd be the end of it.  Just as we were getting ready to take off, she came back up and said she couldn't stand being back there.  By this point, everyone was starting to look in our direction.  She asked me again if she could have my seat and I told her no.  One of the air flight attendants came over and asked if there was a problem.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lady told the attendant that I wouldn't give up my seat so she could be with her daughters.  The attendant asked me if I could move back and I told her no.  I'm a pretty tall person and having the aisle seat let me stretch out my legs a bit more.  Plus it was my seat.  The lady and the flight attendant seemed upset but there was nothing else they could do.  She went back to her seat.  I looked over at the people across the aisle and said something along the lines of: \"Well that was something.\"  One of them said I should've given up my seat even if the lady was being rude about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout halfway through the flight, the lady woke me up and said she was going to switch spots with her daughter since she couldn't be back there anymore.  She sat down next to me and made her daughter sit in the back.  I couldn't really fall back asleep and we finally made it to the airport.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI obviously think she was being an asshole but was I also being an asshole for not giving up my seat?",

We all attend an an all-girls Catholic high school. A whole group of us girls (~10 girls) just finished a major volunteering project, and we wanted to go to an outdoor cinema to celebrate. Our local outdoor cinema was screening Dirty Dancing, so we all agreed to go. B had never seen the movie before, but we assured her she‚Äôd like it. We brought a large picnic rug and sat near the back since we had such a big group. Now, the situation: during the movie there were a few sex scenes. I use the term sex scene really lightly because in all honesty it wasn‚Äôt too explicit. During these scenes B would start acting embarrassing. She would squeal/whimper/cover her eyes with an empty crisp packet. I got a bit annoyed but just brushed it off. Finally, she said really loudly, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs disgusting, who wants to see that?‚Äù. People literally turned around. It was embarrassing that she was being so loud and immature. I made the ‚Äúshh‚Äù gesture and said we could talk about it later. I thought that would be the end of it. But when the movie was over we all went to get ice-cream. She brought up these scenes, telling us that she didn‚Äôt understand how we could watch those scenes/like the movie. She started talking about how sex is dirty and impure, and that her parents raised her better than to have sex before marriage. At this point the other girls were making eyes at each other. I was getting frustrated because I‚Äôve had safe sex before and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äúdirty‚Äù at all. So I said, ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs a natural part of life, I‚Äôm sorry your parents raised you to fear sex‚Äù. After that comment B got really defensive and said that I had no business saying something like that. She left shortly after that. My best friend, A, thinks that I should apologize and offer to go see a clean movie with her. The other girls are split, some think I was right and some think that I made things too personal. I don‚Äôt really want to be friends with someone who thinks that I‚Äôm dirty/impure. AITA?",

He always says \"I can't, I'll just end up crying\" His parents are telling him to suck it up.\n\nIt's been this way for months and seems to be getting worse each day, from what he is telling me. He shuts down every suggestion I give him. \n\nI feel at this point it's like he doesn't even want help.

      "description": "I went through a divorce where my ex got our 3yr old and 14yr old because of financial reasons (I was a stay at home mom and he's an engineer) so he can afford to have them. This leaves me seeing my 3yr old, who until September 2018 lived with me full time, only seeing him every wednesday and then every other weekend. The time away is very hard on us both so when I have him I take extra care to give him the attention and focus from me he needs as he gets very clingy because he doesn't see me much (understandably). \n\nLastnight he had just arrived at my house and we were busy playing together when the man Im seeing calls me. I was busy with my son so I didnt hear my phone. He called 10 times in a row until I answered the phone. Because we were busy playing I continued showing him attention and didn't want to take my focus off of him, while still listening to what my boyfriend was telling me (it was about a phone plan he's getting). \n\nFinally he got annoyed and said he would just call me back. I apologized and started explaining that I hadnt seen my son in a week and wanted to spend focused time with him, but while I was talking he hung up on me. I texted him and said I was talking when he hung up,and thats rude (he often hangs up on me). He replied by telling me that Im the rude one for still interacting with my son while on the phone with him. I told him that because I dont get to see my son alot, Im going to keep my focus on him when I have him, and that its not rude but Im being an attentive mom. He replied by telling me he just wont call me when my son is around. I told him thats fine.\n\nAITA? \n\nTLDR; boyfriend gets mad when I dont give him undivided attention on the phone while my son is visiting me.",

      "description": "tl;dr cock blocked and cucked by two cats.\n\n\nSo we got these cats a bit ago when they were kittens.  She wore me down and I agreed to getting one cat; as they are not allowed where we live and we already have a dog.  I asked her to not go without me to pick them up or to see them, because I know all too well that we're going to get two if she had.\n\nWell she went without me anyway, and lo and behold we had two kittens reserved for us when they got weened.  I should have spoken up - me going with her was to help ensure we wouldn't had gotten in a situation where I'd have to break her heart and telling her to choose just one.  But she went without me, and started fantasizing how they'd be brother/sister and friends and so on.. So hey, guess that sucks for me.\n\nI had only a few reservations I outlined in a couple rules: No cats on the dinner table or counters, and no pets, including the dog, in the bedroom.  I don't like the cats digging in their litter and then jumping up on food surfaces, and I don't like pet hair in the bed.  I felt that reasonable.\n\nWe live in a small 2bed/1bath home.  We share one bedroom, and the other room has my music equipment, the computer, other expensive stuff.  It's the office, and I do bills and school work in here as well.  She used to have art stuff in here but since moved that to the bedroom. It isn't a man-cave or anything; moving in, was supposed to be a hobby room/office for both of us.  \n\nThe dog's a puppy still, and played rough with the cats, so my fiance said they should stay in the hobby room until they're big enough.  Okay fine, I said \"Once they're big enough though we're moving the cat box to the bathroom, I don't want the room to be a cat room\".\n\nThe room I am in is known now as the cat room.  I've tried to diplomatically say 'hey, c'mon now, they're old enough let's move them out'.  It's particularly important because my music equipment is in here.  They've knocked over amps, damaging them.  They've eaten two power cables.  They completely destroyed my computer chair, the window blinds.  Knocked over my guitar and chipped it.  Shredded my sheet music, and chewed holes in my piano pedal cable, and the cables of my expensive mixing headset.  My school work gets batted off the desk, they knock things off that my dog eventually thinks is cool to eat.  So on so forth.  I try to express my frustration of it, but it falls on deaf ears because I feel it just doesn't affect her.  The only way I can see me getting them out of the room is making a huge thing of it and moving everything out.  I feel really claustrophobic.\n\nNot to mention the cat box is 2 feet from me.  One of them just took a shit.\n\nA lot more goes into saying it, but it really feels she cares more about the cats than me.  The rule of no pets in bedroom? Broken.  Cats on table? Broken.  The side room becoming a cat room? Broken.\n\nWe have a strained relationship already, and suffice it to say sexy time happens like seasons change.  Last night I finally got fed up because we finally got to have a little sexy time before bed, and this cat was shut out of the room and wouldn't stop meowing, because she allows them in the bedroom. \"Aww she just wants some lovin, poor thing\" she'd say.  \"Aww she just wants to be with us,\" \"Can you get up to see if the cat room's door is open?  Completely obliterated any mood I had.  Came back, and after laying there for a few moments took my pillow and thought \"Fine, you can sleep with your cats instead\", and slept on the couch.\n\nAITA for being upset about any of this?  My finace makes it seem like I'm being unreasonable and imposing on the cats, or otherwise doesn't listen to me about how I feel or want to be accommodated about it all.   ",

      "description": "My aunt lives in a different country than I do and I occasionally visit her. After I graduated college, I decided I had a little bit of time off and decided to spend a couple of weeks at her place. I should add that she has 2kids (my cousins). One of them is around my age and he‚Äôs an overall great kid with a lovely family. The other one is about 7years my senior and an overall deadbeat. He didn‚Äôt go to college, doesn‚Äôt have a job, isn‚Äôt allowed to see his daughter because he doesn‚Äôt pay child support, but his parents let him live in their place completely free... \n\nAnyway, I know what a dick he is, so i never visit my aunt if he‚Äôs staying with her. he‚Äôs been to jail, and even stole around 400$ from me (he never admitted to it, but it was him), so I don‚Äôt want to be around him. This time, she completely caught me off guard and didn‚Äôt inform me that he was staying there until I literally saw him at her house when I arrived. I couldn‚Äôt change my ticket, so I obliged to stay there. \n\nA friend orders a mobile phone and has it delivered to my aunt‚Äôs house. When it arrived, I tell my aunt i‚Äôm gonna give it to her other son, but she disagrees and wants me to give it to her, so I do as she says. \n\nBefore I leave, I ask her for the phone, she immediately goes to get it and she gives me a bag with a couple other things (phone cover, speakers) but the phone isn‚Äôt there. I tell her that the phone isn‚Äôt there. She starts freaking out and asks her deadbeat son. He starts insulting her and screaming at her, so she gives up. She asks me how much the phone cost and I look up the price and tell her that it‚Äôs 1000$. However, my friend bought it on sale for about 750$. \n\nAbout 3days before I leave, I ask her what she‚Äôs gonna do about the stolen phone; she literally tells me that it isn‚Äôt fair that she has to pay 1000$ when my friend paid less for it, so she‚Äôs gonna give me 700$ and I should just tell my friend what happened. I immediately get annoyed and tell her, in a very calm way I must say, that I‚Äôm not leaving the country without the phone and if I have to, I‚Äôll miss my flight. She gets mad at me and tells me that I shouldn‚Äôt talk to her like that (I never raised my voice ir anything), but she doesn‚Äôt just have 1000$ to spend on a phone.\n\nAfter a couple days, my cousin (the good kid), gave her 1000$ out of his money and I bought the phone. My cousin sided with me, but my aunt thinks I was an asshole to her son and I disrespected her for demanding payment, but I think anyone would‚Äôve done that. So, was I the asshole? \n\nTl;dr: aunt‚Äôs deadbeat son stole a new phone that wasn‚Äôt even mine and I demanded that I wasn‚Äôt leaving without having the phone back. \n\n",

      "description": "Currently having an arguement with a friend and I thought what better way to solve this than posting it on here. \n\nI am a teacher at a school for students with social/emotional disabilities. We have 20 yo students who will just barely make it out of high school. I told my friend that last year I suggested to a few students they could pursue being a garbage man.  My friend asked \"why would you do that. Tell them to get into STEM.\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't I tell kids making potentially $80k/year, retiring with benefits without going to college is an option?\" \nMy thinking is this, at least in my school, I know which kids are already destined for STEM, They like science technology and math, they aren't at my school because they aren't academically studious. I'm not telling those kids not to go after their dreams. I'm talking about the kid that absolutely won't make it through 4 years of college.as sad as that may sound, it's a fact. They can't concentrate, they don't do homework, they have a plethora of social and emotional disabilities that inhibit their potential. I like to think I try to give that student hope by helping them understand there are careers out there that don't require you to go to college. My friend sees it differently.\n\n\"Anyone can get into STEM at any age\". \n\"Maybe students should have been told to get into STEM when they were in high school.\" \nHis reasoning is for higher pay ceilings, because of aspiration. \"How can you tell kids not to have aspirations\". He says you can get into any entry level IT position without college. And the point is to build a skill set to leverage and build upon. Which I get and understand. But to me, not everyone has that drive to be something or be a millionaire. A lot of my kids literally live everyday with a survival mentality. \n\n\"As a teacher, isn't your job to get these children to want to learn?\" He says my job isn't to enable that mentality to be complacent.  And by me telling my students to become garbage men, that's exactly what I am doing. \n\nI have a hard enough time as it is trying to get them to listen to me. They're high school students, they know way more than me (sarcasm), but that's how they really think. \n\nMy friend says an IT helpdesk person makes $30k but they have a clear path to potentially make hundreds of thousands in their lifetime. And a garbage man doesn't have that path. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for not helping these kids see what they can potentially be? According to my friend, my telling even 1 student that it's ok to be a garbage man is too many. \n\n",

      "description": "So, a few weeks before Christmas, my Mother asks me to make a Christmas list for my relatives. I didn't want my relatives to pay a lotta money on me, so I put a few cheap things I kinda wanted but was too lazy to buy. Come Christmas, I get everything except two things. No big deal, I was happy and respectful, and we had a nice Christmas. One of those things that I didn't get was a phone button thing that helps you grip your phone, and I kinda wanted it. So I go to my local target and get one on sale for a few bucks. Nothing wrong, right?\n\nWell, my relatives and I met again the day after the day after Christmas (27th). My aunt sees the grip and asks if I bought it. I tell her yes, she says cool. And everyone except her Hispanic maid Maraina (I think that's how you spell it.) seemed fine with it. Little later, she comes up to me and tells my How \"rude\" it was to do that. I say \"what are you talking about?\" she went on a weird rant on how it was \"disrespectful\" buying it was. How much of a \"brat\" I was. And how it, in her opinion, seems like I gave the message that they couldn't \"satisfy\" me. I then told her exactly where she could shove her opinions and left. She then started screaming after me as I left about how \"bad\" I was. I told this to my aunt who later booted her. \n\nAITA in any way, shape, or form?",

      "description": "My dad's girlfriend moved in recently, and she brought her daughter. Neither are native speakers, and as the only person proficient in english, I have to help her with her assignments. It is not uncommon to spend 3 hours on half a sheet of math homework. Due to our economic situation, the mother is hardly home due to work, nor is my dad. I have to provide rules and such for this girl. She's hopelessly addicted to what technology we have, spending hours upon hours on YouTube (quite humorously complaining that she doesn't get enough time on the program, if i'm not home she will spend 10 hours straight on it, from 2 to 12 or later), and commonly deciding to watch YouTube instead of doing assignments. I have my own work to do, so I don't have the capability to always be aware of when she has assignments to do, I rely on her telling me about them. She much rather lie and spend all day goofing off, and then complain and cry when I try to keep her technology use in check. I have, as of late, tried to correct this behavior: an elementary school child should not be sleeping at 11/12 everyday, which is partly due to the fact she insists on sleeping with her mother's phone (although she claims to be using it as an alarm, the walls aren't thick honey, we can all hear the YouTube.) The main issue is that if she isn't distracted by technology 24/7 she cries and acts up, especially late at night. The mother rather rot her mind with technology than deal with her, and my dad could care less. So am i the asshole for removing her technology when I realize she's been using it excessively? Am I the asshole for essentially policing this child because no one else will? My dad tells me to stop worrying, or literally \"stop killing yourself over this kid\". But I feel that if something isn't done soon, her life is as good as forfeit , as I see this excessive usage leading quite nicely to poor outcomes in life. ",

First is, the only person who really makes conversation is his mom but she'll ask some courtesy questions and then she'll only really talk to my boyfriend. Second, my personality clashes with his mom's. While she is extremely feminine and social, I tend to be more of a tomboy and am usually more quiet, so we just don't get along that well. Third thing is, his family has a lot of money. Not filthy rich but definitely wealthy. Often times, she will be talking about spending money in a way that makes me super uncomfortable because she's pretty oblivious and judgy on how middle class people (like my family) live their lives.\n\nSummed up, I feel pretty uncomfortable when visiting/meeting up and try to avoid it as much as I can.\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "Here's some context into why i feel this way about my brother.\n\nI grew up with my father and step-mother who had custody of me and my older brother Kyle(fake name) my mother got to have us every other weekend.  I grew up loving my brother we spent countless hours playing D&amp;D and video games together.  When i was about 10 him 12 he got caught masturbating into my step-mothers underwear.  My father was furious so he got some licks but nothing very brutal.  Because of this my parents agreed to have us both have visit with a Psychiatrist.  I didn't understand any of it at the time i grew up with a fair share of medical issues so i was in and out of the hospital so i just went with the flow.  Kyle had a temper when we fought often over small petty things like video game deaths bad rolls he would get very physical so it often came to blows but we would resolve it our self's . About a year after the first incident with my step-mother underwear he got caught doing it again.  Once again he got some licks but this time my father kicked him out of the  house and had him live with our grandmother.  Because of my parents jobs i too went to live with my grandmother about a year later.   once we started high school he started dating a girl online and in doing so basically stopped doing anything with me at all.  I stayed pretty quiet  about it but it upset me a lot, so one time at our mother's  we got into a little argument and i called him some names that i really can't remember and brought up how is girlfriend is making him a shitty person,  he tackled me to the ground and held a screwdriver to my neck, my step  father and step-brother pulled him off of me,  from the look in his eyes to this day i think if they didn't pull him off he would have killed me.  we moved back into our father's when i was 15 him 17 both of us riding motorcycles to high school that my father had gotten for us.  I was still trying to have a relation ship with him i tried playing cards(MTG)  more D&amp;D, battle tech, but he was glued to his phone with his girlfriend.  So we lost any sort of a relationship.  During our high school time he was caught humping my pillow and it was the last straw for my father and me. He was kicked out of the house my father offered him the motorcycle title and keys before he left but he refused and told us to fuck off. About a week after his departure i was organizing my room, we shared a room, and found an unfamiliar journal. I noticed after the first page  it had a date and he was describing how his day went.  I flipped to the middle and found something really disturbing.  He was talking about his sexual fantasy's.  He wanted to tie his girlfriend to the bed and rape here, I'm paraphrasing it was very very detailed.  I showed this to my parents and they were equally disturbed.  I decided i was done with Kyle he made no attempt to respond to my text or spend any time after  school with me, the only thing he cared about was that girl.  My mother kept a relationship with him for a while until they fell off when he thought that she had given my grandparents his phone number when it was actually me, and i had told him this, but he didn't care.  He's dropped  all contact with anyone in his family.  I'm 24 now and the other day on the phone my mother brought up how she wanted to see him again and talk  and say she's sorry, to which i just responded uh huh, yeah i hear you.  Then she asked how i felt.  I told he i don't care about him.  To me he's gone from my life and that was his choice as much as mine  i made my efforts i forgave many of his wrongdoings but he wouldn't make any attempts for anyone but his girlfriend My mother was pretty taken about by this and asked me if i even cared about him to which i said no i despise him. She just resigned to that and said  that despite what he's done she'd forgive him and wants him back in his life, and i just said good luck with that, don't tell him where i live. \n\nAm i the ass hole here? i understand she's a mother and has a connection and she doesn't want to hear her son talk like that but i just want nothing to do with him and never want to speak with him.",

      "description": "I'm not even 100% sure what the specific apprenticeship was but it was vehical engineering related because he was talking about how he knows how to fix an engine and do X and Y.\n\nHe was frustrated, I think, that in applying for an apprenticeship he had to do an online test with a lot of written maths questions. He sent me one and I worked out the answer fairly quickly for him. He checked and double checked all his answers but I think it took him longer than the test expects so he was annoyed and probably anxious he wouldn't get the apprenticeship.\n\nHe was complaining maths has nothing to do with engineering and it was stupid to have to do a test on it.\nI disagreed, and said that maths probably has a lot of use and he got angry at me and decided to exit the phone call, now I feel bad. \n\nI'm worried I was a little insensitive. \n\nHe's got maths-dyslexia as well as normal-dyslexia so he probably found the test more difficult and I probably take for granted my own academic 'abilities' and come off snobby sometimes.\n\nI just thought that it's true, and if he really wants to get work in engineering he should brush up his cognative maths a bit. \nBut maybe I should've let him just vent his frustration. \n\nBit of a long one for a simple problem I guess, \nAITA? \n\nTl;dr bf annoyed that engineering apprenticeship had maths test, isn't good at maths, complained engineering is nothing to do with maths.

      "description": "I'm 23 and have been living in New York City for about 7 months with three of my best friends (all male) from college. All is great, right? It was until one of my roommates (let's call him Michael) recently asked us about having his girlfriend live with us this upcoming summer. She's still an undergrad but is going to be taking summer classes in the City. Michael broached the topic and mentioned that she'd pay for Wifi and electricity so that'd be fair since she'd be sleeping in his room with him. One of my other roommates and I thought that was a huge ask of it, especially considering we pay nearly $1900 in rent per person (so the $30 she'd be paying for utilities is nothing more than a drop in the bucket anyways.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's partially a money thing because I and my other roommate who oppose this don't think it's fair that we're cramming an extra person in our already tight, expensive apartment without her paying for barely anything. We obviously wouldn't make her split the rent evenly, but if she were to chip in that'd make things way more likely for us to get behind the idea. I get she'd be sleeping with her boyfriend but there's still common space, bathrooms, etc. But money aside, we thought this was an incredibly big (potentially unfair?) question to ask of us and when we voiced our concerns, he got SUPER defensive and said that we were greedy, rude people and that he wouldn't give a fuck if he were in our shoes. I really do like him and his girlfriend but I feel like I'm completely justified in this situation. He got so mad I almost just want to let him have his way because it's not worth losing a friend over something like this. Nevertheless, if you poll 10 people on the street, surely the majority would have qualms about this situation if they were in my shoes. Right?",

They also need to bring their dog and cat because the guy that was watching them in another town had to move to somewhere he couldn't take them. \n\nSo the final tally is me, my fiance, my friend R, her fiancee N, their intact male and female cats that have to be kept separated, their dog, plus our dog and seven cats that have to be kept in our bedroom because their dog is untrained and a moron.\n\nSince October all of the following has happened:\n\n-Found out I was pregnant\n\n-N came at me while I was 5 weeks pregnant because we got in a shouting match and I choked her out (because I'm an amateur mixed martial artist and jfc I'm not gonna fight someone while I'm pregnant)\n\n-Found out N has a misdemeanor warrant out of Texas for theft of service \n\n-Found out N also has a misdemeanor warrant out of Minnesota for violation of probation stemming from an assault charge at a bar\n\n-N and R broke our hallway closet door because of one of their arguments (which they will be paying for)\n\n-N and R fight CONSTANTLY, ranging from annoyed disagreements to screaming so loud I'm afraid the cops are going to be called \n\n-Their cats broke the living room blinds (which they will also be paying for)\n\n-Their female cat may be pregnant because for some reason they haven't spent the $20 at a low cost clinic to spay or neuter one of them\n\nI have no problem with R as she has not done anything to wrong us or annoy us. N is the root of all the issues. I feel bad that anything we inflict on N will come back to R but at the same time when you're a couple you're responsible for each other decisions and need to think about how your actions are going to affect more than just you.\n\nI told them by June when I reach 6 months they need to be out with absolutely no exceptions and that I don't give a damn what their situation is. \n\nAm I being too lenient or AITA?",

Also, this is my second post so please bear with me if I'm doing something wrong.  \nA little bit of context : I've been friends with my Alex for more than 15 years already, we're both 19.\n\nSo, two weeks ago he was in a relationship with a girl that is a little bit slow on the uptake.   \nThat relationship was really toxic btw, she loved him a lot, but he didn't reciprocate that love mainly because she kept disappointing him with lies.   \nHe always sent me screeshots of her asking \"What are you doing?\" while it is written that he is playing a game on Discord and he hated it, he always responded with \"What do you think I'm doing?\".  \nThe relationship also changed him, he became less patient and cynical, and ever since they broke up he kept this personality.  \n\n\nBack to my story :  \nLast friday I asked him what he was doing (he told me that he was going to his mom's house the day before), and he responded with his \"What do think i'm doing?\"(He usually doesn't talk like that).   \nAs I'm too lazy to describe everything here are the pictures of our discussion with translations : [https://imgur.com/a/bZtsiMQ](https://imgur.com/a/bZtsiMQ)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end I didn't even bother replying to him, I just went to sleep and I haven't talked to him since. \n\nAnd since then I've been thinking, what if it is my fault and I'm just an asshole who can't tolerate criticism?\n\nI know this may be petty but it is important to me, am I an asshole for being mad at my best friend and not wanting to talk to him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "During my first semester in October I used to travel every week from my home town to my dorm room every Tuesday. He had invited people and they apparently had a party up until 3AM and the surrounding dorm phoned the manager of all the pandemonium they were making. That was a on Monday, when I‚Äôm not there. So, I'm on the bus Tuesday morning and I get a call from the dorm administrator/governor to pack my shit and leave, because *we* ‚Äúhave risen the place to the sky‚Äù with our commotion. Long story short, I sorted that out but I don‚Äôt know how much they believed me. Either way, that was my first warning. Another one and I‚Äôm out. Great. \n\nAllow me to paint you a picture now.  You can call me a snowflake like I wouldn‚Äôt know, but I've been trying to move out since then. He comes home at 2 or 5AM every night piss drunk, vomits on the floor, disrupts my sleep by turning on the lights, browsing on his phone, listening to songs, never cleans, never wipes the floor, the smell just hits me every time I come from lectures, the dorm would be a disgusting mess if I didn't clean. The only table there is inside the room is filled with his food and I prefer not to have my notes and books smelly and stained from food. \n\n\nBut I. fucking. did. it. I am out. I don't have to live with him anymore and my new roommate is a gift from God himself.\n\n\nEconomically speaking I can't afford to live in anything besides a dorm so that's out of the question. I've even thought about just waking up at 5:30 in the morning and catching the first train so I can travel back and forth from city to city.\n\n",

This year, we take four competitors for each event, and the one that does the worst gets cut for our **serious** competition in March, which we travel for.  However, I got cut from my old event because my coach didn't want to take a team of four seniors to our competition. However, my friend, who is an underclassman, got into the event. I thought that this would be a quickly resolved issue, because my backup event's last slot was between her and me.  I talked to her about the fact I could help her get to our serious competition with my old event because I had experience and could coach her so I could be in the other event,  but she's still not willing to budge because she says she likes both. Tournament rules forbid any person from doing those two events together, because of scheduling issues.  \n\nI've expressed my concerns to some of my friends, and gotten mixed reactions.

      "description": "Wife and I went to see Aquaman last night. We went to a 10pm showing and decided to try out D-Box (moving seats) for the first time as well.\n\nSo 15 minutes into the movie after the trailers are finished a family of 4 walks in which consists of a boy no more than 10 and a girl the same age and what I can only assume is the grandmother and father.  Several times during the movie the boy was speaking out loud not even whispering, and getting overly excited about the action onscreen and the movement from the D-Box. I was distracted and getting irritated and could tell others around me were getting irritated as they were murmuring under their breath. People behind started to shhh and that prompted the parents to try and calm him down non chalantly. It didnt seem like they really cared or gave up trying to quiet him down. About half way through the movie I had enough, I can't hear what Kal Drogo is saying and I was really annoyed. I said out loud 'SHHHHHHHH' and that was enough for the flood gates to open as the father just looks at me and shoots me a look, and I continued to say  \"people paid to see this movie and your child is being loud and distracting\" the little boy then starts to cry and the family get up to leave. As they're walking out, the father looks back and leans over to my seat and says to me \" thanks asshole\" and walks down the down stairs and out the theatre. I felt pretty bad about it.\n\nTLDR: AITA for telling a family shhhhh after other people tried and then telling the father their child is being loud and distracting?\n",

      "title": "AITA for asking my neighbors to keep the volume down when they have family and friends over?",
      "description": "I know that this already seems like a fairly straightforward question, but I feel that there a few things that could skew the situation in either direction.\n\nFor context, I‚Äôm a senior college student swimming in the midst of finals right now. I‚Äôve admittedly been having a tough time with the amount of coursework I‚Äôve been keeping up with. I have three studios, two other classes, and an incomplete from last semester that I‚Äôve been working on concurrently. I think that situational stress, anxiety, and depression (I see a therapist so please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm trying to pull those diagnoses out my ass) are clouding my judgement, so I wanted to ask a wider audience about the situation.\n\nI live in an apartment complex. Several months ago the neighbors directly adjacent to us moved out after rent got hiked up. A new neighbor of course moved in, but I honestly cannot stand her and the family she has over constantly. \n\nIt seems that her and all of her adult friends/family smoke, so there is constantly somebody hacking up a lung immediately outside of my door, which I tolerate since that‚Äôs something technically out of their control. But, another consequence of them all being smokers is that they‚Äôre all constantly gathering right in front of our doors (their door is situated very close to mine) and having conversations that are typically so loud that I can clearly hear them through my door. They have also started bringing over young children who constantly yell and have tantrums. The noise happens most often from around 6:00 pm to 11:00/12:00 pm give or take a few hours.\n\nThere have been three separate occasions where I have asked this woman‚Äôs guests to quiet down. I think that it‚Äôs the fact that the people who are causing the noise don‚Äôt actually live here that irritates me. The latest occurrence was yesterday morning (9:30 am) when I was studying and having breakfast before classes. I was drinking coffee when somebody started pounding on their door (which of course, sounds like pounding on my door). The knocking was so loud and violent that it sounded like police having a drug bust. I opened my door, and a high school age girl was standing at their door, presumably a friend of the neighbors daughter. I opened the door, told her to stop, and closed it again to continue my breakfast.\n\nThat night when I came back from my classes, the neighbor had posted a note on her door with a fat red ‚Äòwarning‚Äô sign on the top. I unfortunately don‚Äôt have a picture, but the basic gist of the sign is that she‚Äôs old and sick (she‚Äôs maybe in her mid-forties to mid-fifties, but since she smokes it‚Äôs hard to tell) and that she has family over a lot because of that. She also wrote that curfew is at 10:00 pm, which makes me think she believes her and her family have the right to be as loud as they want until then. She ended the note saying that anybody who had an issue should go to management, which I‚Äôm tempted to do. The note irritates me because I had the courtesy of talking to her directly in person about the issue, and she retorted with a passive aggressive note that was pretty obviously directed towards me since I believe I‚Äôm the only one who has confronted her about the noise.\n\nI know that noise from neighbors is a part of living in an apartment situation, but I also believe that it‚Äôs their responsibility to be respectful neighbors which includes any family or friends that happen to be visiting as well. Noise from other people is a major stressor for me, and I have no way to escape from their noise as it carries as far as the bedroom at times. I didn‚Äôt think I was being particularly rude when asking her and her family/friends to quiet down (except in the last incident, I was definitely cranky), but her note on the door makes me feel like I may be wrong.\n\nTL;DR\nMy new-ish neighbors have their family and friends over constantly and they have no volume control (in my opinion). I asked them to keep the noise down, but was given an indirect note about how she had family visiting because she was sick and that curfew was at 10:00 pm and that I should take any issues I had with them to management.",

      "title": "AITA for hanging out in a video chat room, even though I'm married?",
      "description": "Throwaway because my reddit name is a bit similar to my chat name. Tldr in the end.\n\nWhen my husband and me started dating, we spent some time as LDR. I'm an introvert and just started living alone again and sometimes would go a few days without seeing another humans face. So I started to go into a video chat room, which had a loose purpose for dating. A little bit, but not really. It's more like a big friends group and dating doesn't really happen (which they make fun of themselves). Most of them have been in this room for  years and even met each other IRL, send each other birthday presents and such. It's really just a bunch of  introverts hanging out. Also, dating was never my intention. It was just really nice to have the window open while I'm at home doing my stuff and have some human interaction.\n\nI told my husband about it and he came online. Yeah, of course that's when only men were online (it's actually pretty much 50/50 M/F), including one or the other who tend to make dirty jokes. And yes, some people don't wear shirts. And my husband is a bit on the jealous side and thought I'm there to get guys attention, or at the very least, guys trying to flirt me (which never happened and I clearly and often state my relationship status). Also he had a problem with me camming up and showing my face. I told him girls are there, I'm not the only one and that he should come there again another time. He did, but he said the people there, no matter the gender, look like losers to him and I shouldn't hang out with people like that, who stay home all day. \n\nI told him my reasons to go there, but it made him feel bad, because it gave him the impression that he's not enough for me and that he can't properly care for my emotions, especially when he's gone and far away. He blamed himself for not calling me enough. I couldn't make him understand that it's not about calling him several times a day, but that I like to have the feeling of being part of a group, hang out, listen to peoples stories or whatever and basically just not be alone at home 24/7, which makes me really anxious and feeds my depression.\n\nAfter a bit back and forth, we agreed that it's fine to go there, though I compromised to not camming up. The whole issue was so dragging and dramatic that I simply stopped going there.\n\nNow I started missing those people actually because there were some girls I really got along with. So I started going back and also cammed up. I didn't tell my husband.\n\nI thought I just go there a bit and leave again but yeah... I'm hooked. I really like it, okay? So I want to tell my husband because that dragging feeling of anxiousness if he ever finds out is killing me.\n\nI know ITA for not telling him, but AITA for going there in the first place?\n\nTL;DR: I'm secretly going to a chat room with strangers from all over the world, but husband doesn't like it. I'm doing it anyways.",

She doesn't want to go alone and I'm pretty much the only one who could come along (finances, holiday dates, willingness to travel). Normally I'd jump up and say yes immediately because I usually struggle to find people to travel with as well, but for me the UAE are off limits.\n\nI'm a law student and I've become quite obsessed with laws (obviously lol), so even if a law is not enforced, if the punishment is too high I view it as if it were enforced very strictly, because \"not enforced\" just means you submit yourself to the  arbitrariness of the local authorities if you violate said law.\n\nNow I know that lots of people probably travel to the UAE together as unmarried couples, for business trips or whatever, but I will absolutely never enter a country that has the legal authority to arrest you for poppy seeds stuck on your shoes (actually happened to a Swiss guy) or that bases it's legal system on sharia law or similarly strict codes (e.g. China is a no-go-zone for me as well because of the VPN ban, I feel entitled to my privacy). I told my friend I would absolutely never go there with her (I wouldn't go alone either) and she got pissed because 1) I'm the only one who could and 2) I'm being overly cautious. She knows I'd go if it wasn't for the law. AITA for not going for these reasons?",

But I'm seeing more often people just spouting out depressing shit and not asking for any particular help, other than to just get attention. For example, every time I watch a show like The Voice, every other damn person is up on the camera and says something (with tears in their eyes) like \"My mother gave me up for adoption when I was young\" or \"My parents kicked me out for being gay.\" Obviously these are horrible things to happen, but do you really want the whole world to know about it? \n\nI'll maybe see a random comment on YouTube that says something like \"This reminds me of the time my dad died..\" and it has 10k up votes. Every time I see these I cringe. I can't help it, mainly because I think people just say these things, whether they are true or not, for attention. \n\nAm I the only one who thinks this?

      "description": "I sound like the asshole in the title, but let me elaborate. Let's call her Beth.\n\nBeth and I were closest friends for the last year or so, but have distanced apart because she has spent 95% of her attention on her boyfriend and 5% on me and other friends. Beth has seemed to, for some reason, grow clingy to her boyfriend and barely even talks to us anymore. Even her boyfriend is uncomfortable with it.\n\nI got accepted into a program where I would move to a different campus in our high school for next year, and since Beth didn't seem to care for me and my other friends got accepted, I decided to take the opportunity. Beth gave zero fucks. Until she found out her boyfriend would be moving countries next year (by his choice - who wouldn't take that opportunity?)\n\nWe had already distanced, but when we did talk, she told me how she wishes someone would prioritise her over opportunities, since she'll be lonely next year. I wanted to say the biggest fuck you because she never wanted to go out with us as friends, but accepted every opportunity possible with her boyfriend, always went to sit next to him during class and never put effort into our friendship in general.\n\nThis one particular time, I mentioned how I would miss a teacher, since I'd be moving campuses. This was after Beth found out her boyfriend was leaving, and she could only reply, \"Well maybe you shouldn't go\". She also tried to guilt trip her boyfriend into not moving overseas (\"If you loved me you would stay\")\n\nBut then again, what if I'm doing this out of pettiness? I'm planning to completely cut ties with her next year, since we won't see each other much and she's put next to no effort into our friendship, but SUDDENLY wants me to stay on the same campus as her, since she'll be lonely if I don't. Can I just move on from this? Am I the asshole for ditching her ass completely? I'm taking the campus opportunity regardless, but would I be the asshole for cutting ties?\n\ntl;dr: close friend has put little to no effort into our relationship since she got with her boyfriend, gave no shits when I said I'd be moving campuses, suddenly gave a shit when she found out her boyfriend was voluntarily moving overseas, and has now tried to subtly guilt trip us both into staying with her. It's bullshit and it pisses me off, but am I the asshole for wanting to cut ties with her too?",

      "description": "TLDR: Friend lied to our friend group for years. I eventually call her out on Facebook, it causes relationship issues for her.\n\nI was in a friendship for over 8 years with a person. We were very close, but she was very manipulative and a huge liar. She made up things on the spot, even faking two suicide attempts to me and me alone (because if you asked her family-that she lived with-they had no clue what you were talking about). Some lies were minor, but as I stated before, some went too far. When we got in a fight, she‚Äôd message me pretending to be other people (her friends, boyfriends, etc.) to make me feel bad. Looking back, I wish I saved some of our conversations because they‚Äôre probably pure Quit Your Bullshit subreddit material. \n\nA lot of her lies surrounded her family. Now, I‚Äôm aware that a lot of this is he said/she said, but I had evidence that she was lying about being a victim of abuse. As one myself, I take this very, very seriously and it was clear she just wanted attention. Most of these ‚Äúinjuries‚Äù would appear after either I myself got injured/was going through something or another one of our friends did and most of the time, she couldn‚Äôt even prove they existed. She lost a lot of our mutual friends due to lies and drama. I became the only friend she had left from that time and she cut off her entire family after they called her out on BS.\n\nShe treated me like crap for a long time, then got a new boyfriend and pretty much dropped me. We‚Äôd only talk occasionally and when we did, it was all about her. Eventually, I told her I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. She was still treating me like crap and I deserved better. She took it surprisingly well, but looking back, I think she just wanted to appear like the bigger person.\n\nWe still remained Facebook friends, though never talked or communicated. However, I can still see the stuff she posts. A few weeks ago, she made a long post about the abuse she suffered. She was getting sympathy and a lot of people that weren‚Äôt close to her back then were saying stuff like ‚ÄúI had no idea!‚Äù\n\nI got a text about it from another friend and I made a comment, basically calling her out for all her lies. One big one was that she claimed to have not drank in x amount of years, but we‚Äôve only been not speaking for a year now and I know she was drinking before then. I called out some other things that she had told me that didn‚Äôt add up to the post she was claiming as well. I told her that she needs to stop finding new people to lie to and that she takes away from real abuse victims, and that she needs to get real help.\n\nShe deleted my comment and messaged me saying that I had no right. I told her that everyone was tired of her lies. She had so many problems with people and that the common denominator was herself. She blocked me after that. Some of our friends agree with me, others say it wasn‚Äôt my place and that it‚Äôs caused some problems with her and her current boyfriend. Was I an asshole here?",

      "description": "So my brother in law, who is 21, recently picked up his girlfriend and took her away from her home when she turned 18. For the sake of the post, let's call him Jake and her Bella.  \n\nBella was in a supposedly bad situation at home, in which she lived under the rule of her evil stepmother who took all of her kids money. So...\n\nJake's been waiting for her to turn 18, which occurred yesterday. Today, he picked her up. She left a note for her stepmom, and pretty much there is no turning back. Her step mom freaked out and sent a bunch of mean texts to him and Bella. \n\nNow she is living in my in-laws house (mother and father in law) and my Jake also lives there, with multiple other siblings. The family is very religious, and does not want the two living in the home together, in fear that Satan will tempt them to \"do the dirty\" before marriage. \n\nSo now, Jake is asking to couch surfing at my house as well as his other brothers house. His other brother is older, married, and has a 3 year old child and a 1 month old baby. He also works nights. \n\nMy wife asked if we would let him stay on our couch. I said No. Plain and simple. Here's my reasoning:\n\nJake didn't think this plan out at all. Bella didn't stand up for herself in regards to working full time for a year (she finished highschool early) and not saving a penny for herself. \nJake has been mindlessly spending all of his work money and tax return money on guns and ammo and McChickens. \n\nSo now that there is a problem he created, he is expecting us to be the solution. I enjoy my home. I enjoy my personal privacy with my wife. I have a high stress job and Jake is also a taxing person to be around. I love him and he is family, but overall, I'm saying \"No\" because \n\n1. I don't want him living on my couch\n2. I want him to fix his own problems because I also got married at a very young age and got zero help from anyone in the family, even though we all live pretty close to each other. \n\nAm I being an asshole? Should I help him and just soften my heart? I'm of the mindset that it wouldn't be helping him. It would be enabling his irresponsible behavior and lack of planning a pretty major life choice (for himself and Bella)...",

      "description": "Some background: I(21F) met (let‚Äôs call him Sean(24M) online when I was pretty young. Let‚Äôs say I was 13 years old, he was 16. We were internet friends or whatever because he lived a few hours away, but in the same state. Eventually when I was a little older (I was 15, he was 18) he came to visit me and we ‚Äúdated‚Äù for a few months. He came to see me once a month for about 4 months in a row. I didn‚Äôt drive as of yet and I was clearly a minor so I never was able to visit him during this time. He broke up with me because I was always super jealous of the stuff he would do with his friends. He was old enough to drive, and go to clubs, and had some freedom while I was a sophomore in high school living with her mother, so I was very clingy. \n\nA few years later, at this point I‚Äôm 18 and he‚Äôs 21, he pops back up into my life. He wants to see me again, he‚Äôs telling me he loves me. At this time I have a very good job, I‚Äôm an adult now, and I have my own car so I offer to come see him. He randomly disappears and stops replying, I‚Äôm pretty sure at this point he blocked me. This really hurt because we have so many years of history. That whole spat lasted (maybe) 2 weeks.\n\nNow to the most recent turn of events. I am 20, he‚Äôs 23. I wanted closure. I thought about him pretty often. I do some googling and find an old email address for him, and I write him. He tells me that this is the best thing that‚Äôs happened to him all year, he missed me so much. I take a few weeks off of work and go to see him. This is the most ‚Äúreal‚Äù us dating has ever been. I saw him 2 times a month for days at a time. I would always drive to him, because he had his own house. Each time I‚Äôd see him he‚Äôd get me BLACKOUT drunk. To the point I‚Äôd wake up naked and not remember if I had sex at all or how we got into this room of the house. It started to really bother me and I voiced to him that I felt like I never saw him sober. He of course never stopped drinking.\n\nAnother issue we had was that any girl he would see who was moderately attractive, he would feel the need to tell me. ‚ÄúI find her attractive.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know, Sean, she‚Äôs a pretty girl.‚Äù I really don‚Äôt need to know. (PRO TIP to guys, don‚Äôt do that. No matter how chill your girlfriend seems, she doesn‚Äôt need to be worried that you have a crush on the Publix cashier)\n\nDuring this period of time he borrows 300 dollars from me for a TV, telling me he‚Äôs going to pay me back when he gets paid next week. 10 months into our relationship I still hadn‚Äôt seen a dime of it. So naturally, I start to ask. He calls me a ‚Äúloan shark‚Äù and says I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to struggle. I tried to compromise with him. I asked for 50 dollars a paycheck, and he said yes, then never pulled through. I at one point got so desperate for him to come see me that I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay for a hotel and if you drive here and take some time off work we‚Äôll call it even‚Äù he passed on that offer as well.\n\nI started to evaluate the relationship and eventually came to the conclusion of ‚Äúfuck this asshole.‚Äù He obviously doesn‚Äôt respect me or my hard earned money, to ‚Äúborrow‚Äù that large of an amount and not pay it back to someone he‚Äôs known for (at this point 7 years,) to have sex with me when I‚Äôm blackout drunk, and to at NO point come to see me, and when I am with him he‚Äôs constantly saying how attractive other women are. So I just stopped talking to him. I cut my losses with the TV and said I‚Äôm better off. Ghosted the dude completely. \n\nRecently my conscious has been telling me I should‚Äôve said something, and given him an explanation. I know I am an asshole but I‚Äôve gotta ask anyway, AITA?",

      "description": "So this might sound a little complicated and I think I am the asshole here but just stick with me for a moment here. Last night I had a lengthy discussion about a guy my best friend was interested in. We can call her Sabrina. She talked to me about a lot of revealing things and that they went out together. However, it was *technically* not called a date (he did pay for her and he did give her chocolates). But I *assumed* they both knew they were into each other. This is apparently not the case but I will get into this later. Fast forward to lunch (yes, I am in High School) and they guy she was interested in sits down with me. We will call him Jerry. He is with another friend who is also friends with Sabrina. Now, I DID bring up the relationship to Jerry and asked how it was going. Just guy stuff. He asked how I knew and I told him that Sabrina told me. This was my first mistake. We talked about some stuff and I gave him my advice on her (he didn‚Äôt know her as well as I do). Fast forward to like an hour or so later. Sabrina starts freaking out on me that I shouldn‚Äôt have talked to him about anything and I broke her trust forever. I‚Äôm obviously confused but I had to go home and I would handle it later. Now I asked Jerry if he said anything about our conversation to Sabrina. He says no and I do trust that answer. The only other person to know could be the other friend who came into lunch with him. He‚Äôs the rat (I *assume*). She basically said that she didn‚Äôt want him to know that she knew that he liked her. Sounds pretty stupid right? They went out together right? Well while it is stupid, I‚Äôm pretty sure that I may have accidentally said something to him that Sabrina didn‚Äôt want me to tell Jerry. For example, that she knows that he likes her. AITA and was it bad for me to assume that Sabrina would not care if I talked to Jerry about it? Keep in mind that Sabrina brings up that just by telling Jerry that she talked to me about it it broke her trust and also that she didn‚Äôt specifically tell me I couldn‚Äôt talk to him about it.",

      "description": "I'm a freshman in college, and I've known my girlfriend and her family since we were little kids. We both come from super conservative families, so when we first started to like each other we knew that going out was a big no-no. \n\nWe started texting about 3 years ago, and we've gotten to know each other pretty well. We only see each other in church and stuff like that a few days a week, and we would always talk about how we wanted to be together, only us two. But we knew we had to wait a while for that to happen.\n\nFast forward to September of this year, in her high school schedule she has basically an hour of free time where she can do whatever she wants for lunch. My school is 10 min away so naturally, we were very excited at the prospect of finally having a chance to go out without our parents knowing. We have fun, go to eat, walk in parks, all of the cliche relationship things that we've wanted to do for years. She's the perfect girl for me.\n\nI don't go out with her every day, two times a week she goes out with a friend. Her friend is nice and funny, it doesn't bother me that they hang out. Sometimes, though, my girlfriend says that she can't go out on days that we've agreed we're going to meet because she's going to be with her friend. Also, earlier in the year we would also somtimes skip class to have more time with each other, but we stopped because she didn't want to miss any more classes and she felt bad about it, and I agree with that. However, she repeatedly skips school with her friend even after she told me she doesn't want to skip school anymore. I don't even find out about it unless I see it on social media, she doesn't tell me. \n\nI've tried talking to her about it, but she says it's not a big deal and not something worth getting mad or annoyed over. And sometimes I think she's right, our relationship is pretty perfect in spite of our circumstances, and maybe I'm the asshole for getting mad at this. But sometimes still, whenver she cancels or skips with her friend, it makes me feel unimportant.\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend and I finally go out after years of knowing each other, I get mad when she cancels on me or skips school with her friend instead of me.\n",

      "description": " As mentioned in the title I feel undervalued at work. The person I sit next to was in my new-hire training class and we started out at the same amount. Through continuing here I have taken the next level of training and received a 2% increase for it. She did not take the next level of training.\n\nThrough the course of events she lost her voice and hasn't improved in months (work at a call center). She's since been reassigned to stuffing letters and mailing things out. She doesn't abide by the same B.S. metrics that I have to and yet still makes the same amount of dollars as when she started. I have to service members and their claims while she sits there, listening to music, watching Netflix, and stuffing letters.\n\nAITA for feeling undervalued for doing a literal shit-ton more work for 25 cents more on the hour?",

We had an amazing dinner and he got me an amazing present that shows how well he knows me. \n\nValentines comes along and I bring him lunch and hang out a bit before heading to my test. After i finished, he texted me and asked me if I wanted to join him at Qdoba. I said sure and headed straight over, figuring that it would just be us. \n\nI get there and he mentions that B will be joining us. Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, N is an amazing dude. He‚Äôs smart and funny. It‚Äôs not him I have a problem with. When he and my bf get in the same room together, though, both of them get lost in their own world. For that reason, when I know it‚Äôs gonna be just N, me and my bf I usually don‚Äôt come. \n\nMy bf didn‚Äôt tell me he was coming, and sure enough, the entire night I say maybe 3 sentences because that‚Äôs all that I can add to the convo.\n\nSo, WIBTA for getting a bit pissed at him? \n\nTLDR: BF invited a friend to qdoba on valentines without telling me and then ignored me all night long.

He then calls me a baby, covering up the allegations he made by saying they were all lies (Since his girlfriend is friends with my sister, I asked my sister about this. Turns out she actually is very spoiled and stuck-up) and saying that he loves her, despite the fact that 1. It's been three months and 2. It's a high school relationship. Most of these barely last.\n\nI mean, I never really had much good relationship experience, so I understand that I don't know what he thinks with his relationship or what he's going through.

It‚Äôs more of a career then a job, but I‚Äôm not sure this is what I want to do with my life. My boss knows this isn‚Äôt for everyone and he hinted that he knows that this might not be for me, and that I should make a choice in the next few months, and he also knows I struggle with some of the processes and procedures (so if I don‚Äôt get better, I‚Äôm gone anyways). This job pays very well, and I know some of my old class mates  are jealous, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs not satisfying, and I don‚Äôt think I could do this the rest of my life. So AITA for not appreciating this job? I know this isn‚Äôt a typical AITA but I honestly feel like one and want to know if it‚Äôs justified ",

      "description": "I powerlift competitively(relatively new at it). A few weeks ago, I began taking tips (that I didn‚Äôt ask for) from some older guys at the gym. These guys are strong and I definitely believe they know their stuff. However, the old school of powerlifting and the new school of powerlifting have a few different opinions I‚Äôve found to be basically unanimous. The new school believes more in recovery and science based periodization (basically how you schedule your training to increase strength) , while the old school generally just believes in hammering the weights basically any time you can. I told one of the guys I didn‚Äôt believe in that and he basically won‚Äôt talk to me any more. To make a long story short, we were benching (for me) very heavy every 6 days or so, and one day I basically could feel that something was gonna go wrong. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to do things his way any more and that I was ‚Äúshot‚Äù. That night at work I subluxated my shoulder, an injury commonly accredited to overuse.  The other guy, I had him look at my meet (competition) preparations to see if anything looked good or needed improving, etc. I just wanted him to give me an opinion on it- instead of that, he wrote out 14 weeks of programming for me that I absolutely did not ask for. When I (very respectfully) declined to work his way,  he got upset and wrote a long ass post on Facebook about ‚Äúkids that don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about‚Äù and how he will now watch me fail. He never mentioned my name, but it was very clearly aimed at me. I even offered to pay him for the time he took out of his life for the programming I didn‚Äôt ask for, because I understand that it was a very nice thing to do and he did not have to do it, even though I didn‚Äôt ask him to. He, too, no longer speaks to me. So , am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "We're both quite young and we've been together for about 10 months now. We both used to watch a lot of anime few years ago but don't really anymore. My bf still has a thing for anime girls though and for the first 4 months i didn't really care. Then i started taking birthcontrol and it made me mad over every little thing or cry and hate myself (i've had self esteem issues for a long time now) all the time. So one time we were watching a tv series and i made a comment about how one of the girls had a nice ass (it was totally normal for me to say things like that before) and he agreed which caused me to have a breakdown pretty much out of nowhere.\n\nI told him that him watching porn makes me feel really bad about myself as i know i'll never look nor act like the girls you see there and it makes me feel like im not enough for him etc. He PROMISED (i didn't ask him to nor manipulated him into saying it) he'd stop watching anything sexual to get himself off. I was happy about it as i don't watch porn myself as i think it's unhealthy.\n\nHe first broke his promise a week after he made it and told me about it. I was disappointed but we all make mistakes so i didn't think much of it. He then broke it again about 1.5 months by watching ,,es rappelt im karton's AMV\" which he claimed was \"only for the song\". (Yea sure why didnt you just watch the music video then?i'm not that dumb) He didn't tell me he broke his promise again, i found out when we were watching wallpapers on Steam and he said \"oh it's from -said song-\". And then he broke it again about 2months after by watching another AMV which he also didn't tell me about. I found out when he had left his youtube open and i searched for the same song and saw that he had watched an AMV of it.\n\n\nHe also introduced me to 4chan which eventually made me hate if not all then most men. He's still on 4chan but he says he's \"only on /wsg\" but i know how easy it is to switch boards there. :|\n\n\nI just feel a bit betrayed and i can't really trust his promises anymore after he broke his for 3 times (that i know about). Again, i never said he couldn't watch it or anything, he promised me.\n\n\nI now told him i'm okay with him watching it (i dont really know if it's fully true yet, but i am loosening up again about it) because he sometimes makes me feel like i FORBIDED it and i don't want to be mad about him breaking his promise over and over again. I don't even really care that he watched those things, i just feel angry that he broke his promise atleast 3 times.\n\nSo AITA for feeling angry with him?",

      "description": "My partners grandma is Eastern European, very old fashioned, casually racist and believes the world is evil. Everyone is the enemy, especially me. She badgers my partner a lot, always picking on his hair, his weight, his health and his career. She thinks I over/under feed my partner and don‚Äôt look after him (I‚Äôm 20f he‚Äôs 24m) and has thought I‚Äôm only with him to use him as my work slave since he cooks and cleans most of the time ( he‚Äôs studying while I work and study) \n\nHe can‚Äôt stand her, and always stands up for me when she calls and starts the long list of complaints about me and him. For years now I‚Äôve agreed, she‚Äôs kinda an asshole BUT \n\nWe recently fell on hard times and we both struggle asking for help, she must of heard about it and now she‚Äôs helping us so much and I can‚Äôt thank her enough. Suddenly I‚Äôm seeing a different side to her and I‚Äôve begun sticking up for her which annoys my partner a fair bit, I‚Äôll give you some examples where her actions speak louder than her words. \n\n-I love dragon fruit, I‚Äôve mentioned this once in a previous conversation YEARS AGO, all of a sudden she has a bag of groceries for us with her famous potato salad and 2 dragon fruit, they‚Äôre so expensive and my partner hates them so they must have been for me? \n\n- my partner can‚Äôt afford a hair cut, we went for lunch, she paid without us noticing and then asked my partner to take her to the book store, the whole way she went on about how much weight he lost and how I‚Äôm always too busy, but next door to the bookshop was a lovely barber and she had an appointment for him and paid for it. \n\n-She bought us socks and jocks, this big bag arrived one day with more potato salad (bless) and heaps of male underwear and socks, but there were a couple packets of very feminine socks, perfect size with extra padding, these socks are very expensive and PERFECT for my job, I have no idea how she knew? \n\n-she never ever mentions these gifts, and continues her list of complaints about us (always the same ones, I‚Äôve kinda just ignored them) as if nothing ever happened. I should mention my family would never and has never offered to help my partner and I in any way. My mother has never given me anything without making me feel guilty and holding it as ransom to drop my life and tend to her. She never asks for anything in return, no help or more time together,\n\nSo reddit, my partner still ignores her calls (she calls 4+ times a week) and see‚Äôs these gifts as undermining his independence and invading his privacy.  I see where he‚Äôs coming from but I think there‚Äôs more to this women then she shows us, these presents are more thoughtful than most I have ever received? AITA for thinking her actions speak louder than her words? IMBFTA for ignoring her calls and being less grateful for her help? Or ESH? \n\n",

No response. Just showing that they read it. They wouldn't directly address me either when we were with friends .\n\nAfter 6+ mos they started responding again. \n\nI tried to forgive them for it.  They never said what was going on. But I tried to forgive. \n\nI found that they were more selfish than before. Self centered. It became hard to talk to them. They'd disregard what I'd say. They were a lot more toxic. \n\nI was having anxiety attacks every time they messaged me a meme (which was basically all they did anymore anyways) because I just couldn't handle the person they turned into, or my own feelings regarding how I was treated before. How can you trust someone who abandoned you without even saying *I'm struggling and need some spsce*\n\nThey deactivated their account for awhile and I felt so free. I had no attacks. I was able to breathe again. Then they came back. And I knew what I should do just for my own mental health at least. \n\nI had some very supportive friends help me figure out what I was going to do. And they agreed with my decision. \n\nSo I decided to block this person. Didn't say a word. Have been blissfully free of them for a couple months (they're just noticing now. I know this because they started messaging mutual contacts. If it gets out of hand I will step in, which has made me so anxious i can't sleep. I wouldn't put it past them to try to manipulate me.

      "description": "Semi-throwaway acct.\n\nSo basically, my sister has MS (Multiple Sclerosis). It‚Äôs a degenerative auto-immune disease that worsens little by little over time.\n\nI‚Äôll try to make this a simple as possible\n\nI grew up in another country, my memories of growing up were basically I was a happy kid in a problematic family. My father used to beat my mom and he used to beat us. He was super abusive mentally and physically. All I remember growing up was fights and shit.\n\nWe‚Äôve been American citizens basically since we were idk how old, technically we‚Äôre third generation because my grandma lived and died here (America) and my parents did lived here as well before they had me, but my mom didn‚Äôt like it so we moved back home. That was kind of something that wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen, but it did, and so I grew up back home and moved here as a kid, US citizenship and all.\n\nAnyway, my sister.\n\nShe was diagnosed when she was around 19, probably around 2008. At around the same time, she was pregnant and had my niece in 2010, in April. Of course it was kind of unplanned, and my dad scared the fuck out the father because he was 19. Basically he never wanted to and my father never gave him a chance to be a parent to my niece, want or not.\n\nWe moved to America when I was around 12, July 2010, seeking the most top of the line healthcare and seeking to protect my niece from her father ( his family was powerful in politics, we were afraid she‚Äôd be taken away from us)\n\nIt was a very stressful time for me as I had a horrible time fitting in and adjusting to America. I was bullied a lot and developed depression and a lot of self-hatred(which I‚Äôm still struggling with today)\n\nMy sister is perfectly, uhh... sentient? Conscious? Her disease affects her muscles, eyesight memory and she‚Äôs a little slow when she talks.But she‚Äôs OK compared to a lot of more aggressive MS cases. She can walk around the house with a walker, hold\nconversations normally, everything. Obviously she was never able to make it to college or anything.. \n\nLet it be known that I absolutely HATE the fact that my sister is sick. If it was a possibility, I‚Äôd trade my health or even my life just so she could be OK.\n\nAround 2014, a few years after making it to America, my parents got divorced (glad because my dad is an asshole). However, I always felt like I had to go through all of this semi-alone. My mom was always of course tending to my sister and niece. Brother was away because he was sick of it all. I was suicidal for a while and under a lot of emotional turmoil kind of coming to terms with my abusive childhood and moving countries.\n\nTo this day, even though we live in the same house, I feel like I hardly have a relationship with my mom. It feels like the only time we ever talk is when we get into arguments (Im chill so rarely) I‚Äôve kinda developed a ‚Äúas long as you dont mess with me Im OK‚Äù mentality with all of them.\n\nMy sister has a nurse come in to tend to her Mon through Friday, 6 hours a day. My mom works and she never takes care of herself, she never has any fun. She neglects herself, and even my stepdad as well. She‚Äôs always too tired/drained to the point where they can‚Äôt spend time together. It sucks and bums my stepdad out.\n\nWhenever I suggest she spends *too* much time with my sister and niece, she throws a huge tantrum about it, saying I‚Äôm basically a selfish asshole and that if I‚Äôd like for my sister to live in a 24/7 facility just so I can be happy. I don‚Äôt want that, what I‚Äôm suggesting is that if she could just balance her time a *little* better, it‚Äôs be great for all of us.\n\n\nOf course not, but I‚Äôm getting older and soon I‚Äôll be out of college and probably out of the house, and I can‚Äôt help but feel as if I was robbed of my mom. I find myself getting resentful towards my sister, and even though I want to get closer, I feel so estranged from her that I don‚Äôt even try anymore. I have a solid support system with my friends.\n\nMy niece is 8, which she *does* need a lot of attention, she‚Äôs going into the 4th grade. But she doesn‚Äôt do what she‚Äôs supposed to either and that stresses *my* mom out. \n\nShe hardly ever inquires about my stuff, either school or work, or even my depression.I hate that. We only live once and I never really got go enjoy any of my two parents, my dad bc he was a dick and my mom because she was too good a mother.\n\nSometimes I still feel like a child, I turned 20 recently. I still *need* a parent, I don‚Äôt feel ready yet. I told a pastor recently and to make a log story short he just said I need to grow a pair be a man and stop crying about it, because she needs me.\n\n\nWhich, I know, he‚Äôs probably right and I *do* feel like a selfish piece of shit, but... I miss my mom.\n\nTL;DR: Mom takes care of sick sibling and her 8 year old daughter, am semi-grown man and feel like I never will have a close relationship with her.",

      "description": "Okay let's start this off with there are 4 main people involved in this situation all of which I am friends with and a lecturer. I should also add my personality is rather sexual however I know the limits. \n\nMy 3 best mates ether have boyfriends or girlfriends. Now me being the good friend likes to make jokes to them at times. Things like \"persons name, get your dick out of her etc\".\n\nNone off my friends have an issue with this at all and will happily do the same back to me. We all know it's a joke and therefore take it that way. (I have even checked this with them after this incident)\n\nNow to the AITA bit, this week a lecturer here's me say one of these jokes. She also happens to be a very strong feminist. She pulls me aside and starts to talk to me about how inappropriate it is and degrading to their relationship. \n\nLater that day I get home only to have my mum wanting to know exactly what I said. Apparently this teacher is saying I am causing strain on this persons relationship.\n\nThe lecturer has not spoken to the people involved other than me and they have all confirmed to me after this incident that they do not mind at all.\n\nI now have to be in a stress workshop as my college thinks this is the reason as why I made the joke.\n\nAITA when all my friends are okay with these jokes and so are the people they are in a relationship with.\n\nWIBTA if I said to the teacher that I am not going to this stress workshop as it is a waste of time and a bunch of bs?\n\nEdit: We are all 17 and 18.",

      "description": "I live with my partner and and another couple that I was friends with prior to living together. I would consider the girl to be my best friend. \n\nFor the most part, everything is fine. However, the biggest issue that I have is when they have sex, my best friend is ridiculously loud. Like, over the top loud and sometimes I don't even think it's real based on how it sounds. They also play really loud music, which just adds to the noise instead of drowning it. The way that our house is set up, there are two rooms between ours and a hallway. The rooms really are not that close together. I can still hear it from my room.\n\nI have talked to her about it a few times, but she never really takes it seriously. It bothers me a lot because it often wakes me up or prevents me from going back to sleep. Sometimes it happens in the middle of the day, too. I avoid going to the kitchen or bathroom when I can hear them because I hate hearing it. I have trauma surrounding sex and my friend knows that. On the rare occasion I do feel comfortable talking to her about sex, instead of her feeling pride in my choice to confide in her, she asks \"why is it okay when you do it but not when I do?\" Which leads to me feeling guilty and pushing myself deeper into a hole of never sharing.\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for being annoyed by paramount and potential faux meaning? Or should I just keep it to myself? \n\nBonus: AITA for getting annoyed that she plays some of my favorite songs while having sex as well?\n\nOh yeah, Happy Valentine's Day ;)",

They asked which shops I want to go to so I told them and my mum was like \"and you're not inviting me?!\" So I reiterated my reasons for why I want to go alone.\nThey then peer pressured me into allowing my mum to come so she ended up tagging along. We got to the first shop and I had all my things and was ready to go and pay but she still wanted to do the typical 'look at everything and ponder for an hour' so I started to get slightly annoyed and it probably showed by my face. She said \"Oh I see you preferred to go alone and you're annoyed\" I said yes and reiterated my reasons. So then we left the shop and she said she's going home but I could tell she's really upset. We went our separate ways and I was a bit sad that I made her upset but ultimately she ruined my alone time which I was looking forward to for the past couple of weeks. ",

      "description": "Hi, so my friend and I went out for a girls' hangout day. I don't drive so my friend picked me up with her car. It went alright the entire day. I'd like to believe we had fun until the drive back home. Since my friend's car has a bluetooth feature, I asked if I can connect my phone to play some songs from my Spotify. At first, my friend was like \"Heck yeah! Of course!\" So we played a bunch of songs and sang along together.\n\n\nIt was when this one song that we both liked started playing. My friend said that there's a cover of this song that she also likes. So I searched and played the song for her. Well, it wasn't a good cover, at least for me. So when the song ended, I told her that it wasn't a good cover and preferred the original instead. My friend said, \"Oh okay\" and sorta laughed.\n\n\nI didn't think much of it until after about 3-4 songs since I played the cover song, I noticed she was quiet and wasn't singing along as much as she was in the beginning. So I asked her what's wrong. She at first said nothing, that she's just a  little tired. But I could tell that something was wrong so I told her that we have like another hour and a half drive back to the city and if something was bothering her, she should say it now since I didn't want an awkward drive.\n\n\nSo she said that my comment of me not liking the cover song bothered her. That it's okay for me not liking it cause we have our own music taste but the fact that I voiced it and said that I liked the original better ruined the song for her. I told her that I was just being honest. But she said that I still sounded rude? I don' get it at all. Anyway, we dropped the subject and she allowed me to continue playing songs from my Spotify but never suggested any songs since then. \n\nIt's been three days since the incident and I'm just curious whether I was TA here. \n\n\n\n\n",

After about 35 minutes she looks up from her phone and says that I should make the brownies.\n\nLook I get it, we‚Äôre talking about brownies here. The thing that frustrated me though is that she said she would do it. I trusted my long standing brownie craving fix to her and she put it off until finally telling me to do it myself. I told her it frustrated me and that I didn‚Äôt think it was fair. I would have just done right when we walked in, \n\nShe doesn‚Äôt even like brownies, nor did she want any. So I can see why this probably felt like a chore. After expressing that I thought it was mean she got up and started making them and I put down my phone and helped.

I met one guy on it, for privacy I'll call him A. He's autistic and makes things on Rec Room just like me, we quickly bonded and I joined his clan, I helped him make rooms and vice versa. We added eachother on playstation and we created a group chat with clanmates on playstation. One day I was mucking about changing the group photo and name for the memes with the other people in the chat. A and some others were doing something in a party, occasionally he would tell them something through the group chat. The group eventually got a message saying for someone to stop something. I continued thinking he was talking to others. After a while he tells me to stop and I comply.\n\nEventually a full blown argument between a clan member (B) and A occurred about something in minecraft they were playing. A left the group in a fury saying we waste his time by destroying stuff that he builds in minecraft (I never have joined them on Minecraft). After I spent an hour of my day comforting B.\n\nA day later I change the group icon and name.\n\nFast forward one week.\nI get a message on discord saying I had been kicked from the clan discord (that I pretty much did most of the setup for), no reason was given.\nI message A asking what the kick was for.\nThis fucker tells me it was for the constant changing of the group name and photo when he was annoyed (I had no idea if he was annoyed or not until the argument) and ends the paragraph tirade with a \"Case. Closed.\". \n\nThis happened last night and I am still confused about it, so that begs the question, AITAH?\n",

I took them up on their offer, and sent my bag on its way. \n\nWhen I got on the plane, I put my backpack in the overhead bin so I would have leg room under the seat.

I reply that it's mine, and when he asks me to put it under the seat, I tell him sorry, no, I'd like to have the leg room. I tell him to feel free to stuff it in between his carry-on and another, but I'd rather not put it under the seat. He grumbles, finds a spot for his bag a few seats back, and gives me a glare as he takes his seat. \n\nI know it's not as exciting as other posts on here, but it left me wondering.

      "description": "Alright, so for context I met this friend almost two years ago, and we're very close. We even dated for a short stint, but decided to remain friends. However, this friend has depression. I am one of those people who will talk to you until 4 AM if you're in a bad place. But we have some few days long periods where we don't really text each other at all. Maybe one of us will break the monotony and say 'Hi' or something, but all my friend really talks about is how much they hate themselves or art. \n    \nTonight, they said Hi to me. I responded with 'Oh hey, you're still alive.' They respond with 'surprisingly,' and then follow up with 'The longer I live, the longer I suffer.' I know they're just trying to joke around, but the self deprication gets annoying. This is basically the only talking point besides the aforementioned art interests. Even when in person, they don't have much to say beyond slights at their expense. \n    \nWell, they got mad at me tonight because esch conversation eventually devolves into me giving life advice and them responding with something in the vein of 'Yeah, I know.' I kind of went blunt with it and told them that it seems like their only character trait is hating themselves. I know they're in a rough place, and now I know they don't like having these deep convos, but at the same time it's really hard to differentiate a joke and a cry for help with that specific person. \n\nAm I the one at fault for these conversations getting deep, or should they try and minimize the amount of 'I want to die' jokes? I went here because I do love and cherish this friend, and I don't want to seem like a dick just because I'm worried for them. If I didn't explain very well, I'll be reading the comments and replying.",

      "description": "Hey guys! This may be long so I'm the asshole for that and I'm sorry.\n\nWhen I go christmas shopping for anyone, I'd like to think I put a lot of thought and love into what I get for someone based on what I know about them, as most people do.\n\nLast year for Christmas, I had gotten my fiance several sweaters, Rayban sunglasses, pair of Vans, wallet and bluetooth speaker for his laptop, things I know he wanted as:\n\n-He complained he didnt have nice sweaters to wear and that his were old with holes.\n-He always talked about Rayban and how he loved a particular style and the fit.\n-He had one pair of Vans(only brand he wears) and he used them for both work(hospital) and regular outings, which he ruined with bleach. \n-His wallet had seen better days with it ripping and what not from normal wear and tear.\n-He always watches old movies on his laptop and I noticed he struggled hearing them(he is also partially deaf on one side as well)\n\nHe loved his gifts from what he said, and gave me my gift: an envelope and a pair of Minnie Mouse ears.\n\nInside the envelope, there was a letter he made on Word, which said he was going to take me to Disneyworld in late spring, and that we would stay at a Disney resort, and etc. \n\nNow I'm not really a Disney person like him, as I had told him for many years, I prefer Island Adventure or Universal Studios, etc. But I love the gift as the fact that it meant it would be us spending time together as we haven't done that for some time. (I work and go to school, he works full time doing overnight shifts at hospital so sleeps during the day)\n\nHe said he was going to pay for everything, but I offered to pay for our food while we are there at least. All he had to do was talk to his boss about requesting the days off to go and booking hotel and flights when the dates were drawing near. According to him, he had asked them before and they approved of it verbally, but told him to remind them 2 months before the trip. \n\nFast forward to March 2018, I had found out(I kinda knew, as did my fiance before the holidays) that I won a vacation through my employment for performance. I did tell my fiance during the holiday that if he planned on us going to Disney, there was a chance I'd be winning a vacation with a plus one for around the same time he wanted to go to Disney. He stated he had anticipated that and he had asked his boss for time off for both vacations during the holiday and they said yes, but again to remind them two months before anything so they can put it in writing.\n\nThey denied his request, and informed him he could only choose one. He chose the free vacation through my work(Did I also mention they pay for literally everything, from hotel to food? He did not have to spend a dime on the trip). \n\nHe never apologized for it, and has never made an attempt to make up for it. Not even during the summer when we were both free for 2 whole weeks. He never offered to rescheduled the vacation he planned or given an alternative gift like  pair of socks or a romantic dinner and movie.\n\nLiterally nothing but a pair of Minnie Mouse Ears and broken promise. I felt so unappreciated and unloved after putting so much effort into his gifts, and again, I know it's the thought that counts. I never brought it up and tried to let it go.\n\nBut I felt like after he was denied his trip, he never gave it a second thought ever again until I brought it up tonight while we were Christmas shopping. He kept saying he didn't want to talk about it because it makes him feel bad and he doesn't want us to argue.\n\nI ended up bawling my eyes out as I felt he was trying to ignore what happened and dropped him off home while I went Christmas shopping for him and my family, teary eye and all. I felt guilty for bringing it up and fighting over it, but I also felt unappreciated, looked over and petty.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry this being long, but am I the asshole for feeling this way?",

      "description": "Here's what happened, I have a young Toddler who uses the restroom on his own and sometimes he makes a mess and as his parent when he makes a mess I realize it's my job to clean it up and not be defensive when people point it out, particularly since he regularly uses my room mates bathroom since it's closer to the living room, this can lead to a bit of confrontation in my interactions with my room mates and I DO fully understand how it can be frustrating dealing with his mishaps. (Mind you my room mate has Aspergers and likes his things very particular and I completely understand that and am accepting of it as well)\n\n\nIn this particular situation I however do not feel like I was being unreasonable and would like a third party point of view, I also realize how silly this situation is and recognize my own childishness on the matter.\n\nI had to work yesterday between the hours of 11:30 and 5:00. My son, whom I left with my girlfriend was only home for an hour and a half between the time I left at 11:07 and 9:00 at night an hour and a half after I left his grandparents picked him up and spent the day with him.\n\nAt 10:50 as I was heading out the door my son finished his breakfast and went to wash his hands, which he was done with by the time I actually left the house.\n\nI returned home after work and after picking up my son, watched a nature documentary and fell asleep on the couch with my son and woke up at 12:00am my room mate who had left comes home and asks since I was awake if I wanted to play Red Dead on the PS4 with him and I agreed since I was off the next day.\n\nThis is where it got silly.\n\nMy room mate went to use the restroom, and when he returned he stated that the faucet was oily so it must have been my son who did it with soap. Now, I realize that some parents get very defensive in these types of situations but I also realize that he's a Toddler and it's possible that he did do it.So I was not in the slightest offended by this, However we have another room mate and other folks that had come over. So, I stated I did not think this time it was him because he left shortly after I did and it was 12:30 at night and he hadn't used the restroom since we got home (he stated that an hour and a half is not shortly, I'm curious about other peoples interpretation of this too) but he then said it was possible he went to the bathroom again between the time I left and the time his grandparents picked him up.\n\nI agree that this is a possibility and he could have, however It's rare that my son has to use the restroom within such a short time frame. So, I told him I don't think it was, and his response was \"Well who else could it have been?\"  I told him it was possibly our other room mate, he said it was kinda weird that I was being defensive about it (I wasn't being \"defensive\" in an offended sense but I WAS defending him because the time frames didn't make sense to me but I wasn't irritated in any way) anyways to me it felt less like an argument and more like a conversation where I was trying to explain myself and my viewpoint as to why it didn't add up that it was him, I also felt like between 1:00 PM and 12:00am other people had used the restroom since and it seemed way more probable that someone within an 11hour time frame did it than an hour and a half time frame earlier in the day, which I would also feel like the residue over that 11 hour time frame from any soap would have possibly came off. ( I don't know, I'm not am expert on how soap residue lingers after it has dried up) now I want to explain that verbally I have a hard time piecing together my viewpoint sometimes and so it takes awhile to get to the point. This frustrated my room mate because he tossed my controller down and then hit the chair he was sitting in with his fist, stating that he didn't want to argue that I do this all the time and try to argue about dumb stuff and stormed off to his room a little excessively angry.\n\nThis is where I overstepped my boundaries a little because he tossed my stuff down really rudely, cut me off and then stormed off so I got a bit irritated and told him there was no reason to get butthurt we weren't even really arguing (which obviously made things worse I could have worded it better) He told me he wasn't butthurt and to quit insulting him but that it was such a petty thing that I was trying argue about that it made him mad (still no excuse imo to handle it how he did) \n\nHe then returned to the seat and began instantly continuing the conversation he just got upset about, so I responded doing the same and we were right back at square one and this continued until he got REALLY pissed off and snapped the bowl of the papsan chain he was sitting in, that I had bought so I was pretty upset at this point we continued to argue in circles until we both went to bed.\n\nHere's what I need to know, I AM admittedly an argumentative person however I recognize this and try to ensure I don't make decisions based on emotion. This situation was just one of many I have had with this particular room mate and every time we get into a situation like this he will make/or state his opinion and then storm off so I can't respond,  and then when this upsets me because I feel like I don't have the right to rebuttal he totes it as me trying to be argumentative, that if I just left him alone we would discuss it later so I'm being immature.\n\nI do not however feel this is true, I feel like it's a self defense mechanism that he uses when his emotional threshold for conflict has been met and he can no longer entertain the conversation. We both struggle with a semi-elitist mentality and both are a bit of assholes but I struggle to understand why me and him regularly lock horns on the pointless semantics of situations I never run into this with anyone else and honestly wonder if I'm being a dick for feeling this way, or if because of his Aspergers these social situations are just over stimulating in a negative way.\n\nReddit, please am I the asshole who just wants to argue? I understand that sometimes it's better to agree to disagree but is it okay to say that immediately after you fully state your opinion therefore locking down the opposing views ability to defend themselves? \n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Pretext - In college I had a friend group which occasionally involved a gender neutral person and an ace / trans. Statistically the percentage of non-cis non-hetero people in the group was pretty high but I didn't notice, or did I really bother to find out the specifics of each persons situation. Just didn't seem super important to know just to hang out with them in a group you know? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway fast forward, towards the end of college and out of college, and occasionally these people come up in conversation. When speaking about them my friends use pronouns such as \"they\" to refer to them, and they try to make it look organic but I can tell the flow of their speech is a little off for the sake of accommodating a person not even involved in the conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally don't use \"they\". It's not that I find their situations to be illegitimate or anything, that part I couldn't care less about. It just seems cumbersome to have to remember to alter my speech patterns for this one specific circumstance to avoid being accidentally offensive or something. I understand \"they\" can be used both as a plural and singular, but at least the way I speak I only use it as a singular referring to someone I don't really know, or speaking to someone about someone they don't know (see how I used they there talking about this hypothetical person that you don't know?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know, it's a nuanced thing and I understand it can work, but it's awkward to pause mid-sentence and change he or she to they just to seem super PC. It almost feels like virtue signaling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGetting around it I just use the persons name. To make up an example, the name Robin is pretty unisexual, so instead of saying \"I was speaking to them and they said they were coming to the party this weekend\" I would just say \"Hey, I found out Robin is coming to the party this weekend\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt pops up in my mind more as \"Robin said s/he was coming to the party this weekend\" but if I say that I'd have to switch to \"Robin said they were coming to the party this weekend\" and then whoever I'm talking to is like oh really who is Robin bringing and you gotta be like no just Robin, Robin goes by they and it's this whole thing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I maybe I'm not an asshole, just a bit lazy but could use some input",

My dad is always at home because he works from there and I can't just ask him to leave just so we can have sex confortably.\n\nThe same applies to my gf's house with the extra difficulty that she lives and hour and a half away from my home, and we only can have sex during the morning because at the afternoon we both have to go to university. It's not easy nor possible to do it in her house, she doesn't even have the keys for her house.\n\nThe only valid option is my mom's house because during the morning the house is empty and we both can enjoy ourselves confortably without annoying anyone, but she once said she didn't want my brother and I to have sex in her house (she didn't gave any reason, she doens't want to, period). \n\nShe still doesn't know we already have sex there, we also sneak into her house (I'm allowed to enter when I'm living in my dad's house, I have keys) to do the job and then we let everything clean like it was before we entered.\n\nMy gf and I can't have sex that often, maybe twice or three times per month, once per week if we are pretty lucky, so we have to plan the day we will do it in advance. We don't really have any other alternative for now and I'd say sex is a pretty important part in our relationship.\n\nAITA?",

She was also terminally ill and asked me to come see her at the hospital last tuesday. We had never met before so I wasn't sure, but I felt bad for her so I did. We then talked for a couple hours and then she told me she probably would be dead by the end of the weak. We then just sat in silence for another hour or so and then she asked me if i could kiss her cause she wanted to know what it feels like. I felt like she deserved it so I said sure. When I came home later my bf asked how it was and I told him everything and he got really mad at me and accused me of cheating. I was confused cause I thought it'd be fine considering everything. He then broke up with me. He told our friends and they all agreed with him that I'm a cheating asshole, so that's why I'm where.\n\nher: 20f, bf: 27m, me: 25nb born f\n\nMy english sucks and I suck at writing in general, but I hope I managed to bring my point across.",

      "description": "   So my friend was getting her hair done from a hairstylist, (she does her business at her house) Since she didn't want to be alone she asked me to come over. Me and my sister came and went inside. About 3 minutes later she starts asking me if I was from Africa. I was like...\"yeah why?\" \n\nThen she starts a lecture about how I was suppose to greet her since it's a common courtesy in Africa. At this point it gets very awkward...because she looked angry and thought I was rude for not greeting her when I came in. Which I would admit...I was in the wrong, but the fact that she had to point it out made everything really uncomfortable for me, and she kept looking at me from before and I didn't know why..i guess it was because she was waiting for me to say \"hello\" or something and so when I didn't...she felt like she had to point it out. \n\nNormally in my culture, if I was the one at home, I was suppose to greet the guest that CAME to my house. I don't know why she couldn't just greet me and welcomed me to her house instead...",

      "description": "So there's this girl that I used to date and after we broke up we were still friends for awhile. The thing is I really always felt like she ever really cared about me or really anyone else she knows. She is also someone who struggles with anxiety and depression but she uses it to get her way sometimes which always pissed me off. The other day she was telling me about how she was feeling heartbroken because she asked a guy out and he turned her down. I told her maybe she should just stay single for awhile because she just got out of a relationship. After this she just went off on me. Here's what she said o me \"I'm so done with you, you never help all you ever do is say something stupid why the fuck do you think I never talk to you and fucking broke up with you\" and normally this would make me feel pretty bad but at this point I was really fed up with her so here was my response \"I know exactly why and I honestly don't even care anymore. I tried helping you but you don't want to be helped so I gave up on you because you're such a sad sack. I can't help someone who can't help themselves. You just want to sit a stew in your own self, why do you think I didn't fight it when you asked to just be friends? Because I was so fed up with your shit. You don't want to change. Your perfectly content to sit and be miserable so people will pity you. Why do think no one wants you around anymore? Because you only care about yourself and I cant believe it took me this long to realize.\" She didn't respond and she hasn't been at school for two days now(We're Juniors in HS).

      "description": "I've been getting closer with this person this year (let's call her V),  and while we've had some happy memories, there's a lot of incidents that make me wonder if this friendship should be ended.\n(Please don't judge her too harshly, we're in middle school and she's a good person. I wrote this more to question our personal friendship, not to drag her as a person.)\n\nShe's affectionate with loads of other people, not just physically, but nice to them and always happy to see them. With me, however, she's curt and I feel like I can't make any mistakes around her or she'll act annoyed and act like I'm a burden. \n\nI also feel like she doesn't act like we're friends unless the situation we're in puts me at a disadvantage. My \"friends\" play a \"game\" in which they like to steal my drink (sparkling ice) under the premise of it being \"bad for me\". And while I enjoy the attention I sometimes get while I try to get my drink back, that's the only time I feel like I'm a part of my friend group. Today, they presented me with an ultimatum: get my drink back today and they stop stealing it, but I lose the little attention I would have gained from the game. I know that to most people it seems obvious to accept my drink and end the teasing, but I'm worried that that would mean that I just lose any opportunities of being included in stuff with the group.\n\nI'm rarely the center of attention in the group, and I'm often rarely even included in the conversation, which is why I'm worried about accepting their offer. I also know that if I tried to distance myself from her, our friends would definitely pick her over me. They don't dislike me, they just prefer her.\n\nWe've had a couple of fights this year but nothing major, but I feel like we've just been tense and distant for a while. For example, I'd initiate texts asking how her weekend was, or things like that, and she'd just leave me on read for no reason. She also refused to let me follow her on Instagram and doesn't follow me back, so it stings when she's out there leaving sweet comments on my friend's posts when she won't even return my texts.\n\nShe also seems really hesitant for just the two of us to hang out and doesn't seem to want to hang out in group things with me. I'm not even sure if she's trying to do this, but I'm curious if it'd be more beneficial to me if I just ended the friendship. I don't want to do that unless I really have to, as my current friendship with her is just slightly tense but mostly quiet. \n\nPlease remember that we're middle schoolers and that my friend isn't necessarily a bad person, so it wouldn't help to post insults about her in the comments. I posted this asking for advice on my current friend situation. ",

      "description": "I am 30, my friend \"Amy\" is 29. We have pretty much been best friends since we were in first grade. As adults we haven't hung out too terribly often because of work and life and such but we've always kept in touch, always interacting on facebook and usually hanging out once a month or so. \n\nThe last two years we have gotten way closer because I moved back to my hometown. She disclosed to me that she has BPD, which I did research on to try and understand her better. I knew she had some mental health issues before, I just didn't know what and she didn't start actively trying to help herself with it until recently I assume. \n\nEither way, I know that people with BPD often have their \"favorite\" person, or people. She says I am one of her favorite people. Which means she holds me to a pretty high esteem and listens to what I have to say. The things I say/do have more of an impact on her than other people. \n\nI was originally flattered. It felt good knowing that I could be there for her and stuff and help her through things and what I say could actually help her.\n\nBut I recently got married to someone Amy's not very fond of and we are moving to another country because of his job. Since she found out, I noticed she kind of stopped talking to me as much and I know that's probably because she wants to get used to me not being around as much. I've sort of touched on this topic with her but she always just says she doesn't have a problem with my husband and she's happy that I'm happy. But the way she words things and the way she brings things up when we hang out pretty much shows me otherwise. \n\nAITA for being mad at Amy for being upset with me over this? I know she can't help feeling this way because of her BPD but I also just feel like she's making it all about her feelings. Should I, instead, be trying to help her through this by making more of an effort to hang out and stuff before I leave in a few months? It makes me sad when we see each other because she just brings up the fact that I won't be here for her 30th birthday a million times. It's easier to just kind of taper things off I guess..",

      "description": "My really good guy friend was in a relationship and got cheated on and dumped by his girlfriend. I was one of the few people he talked to about it. Two weeks after having discovered his ex was cheating, he found out I had feelings for him, by reading a blog post I'd written about having  a crush on someone and pushing me about who it was about, till he finally asked if it was about him. \n\nHe told me that given the mindset he was in, he couldn't treat me the way I deserved to be treated, but he still cared a lot about me. He told me never to cry because it felt really wrong to me when I cried, and that he admired me and my strength ( owing to having had a tough past). Anyway we stayed friends,  and I even met up with him when I visited his city, and everything felt normal. \n\nHowever, he slowly ceased communication and began to get distant. He seemed really depressed and went a day or two without replying to my messages. When I asked him about it, he said he meant to call, because he knew I'd be upset, but he got busy. Then he told me it was okay to hate himself because he hated himself too.\n\nI felt bad, and ended up doing little things to cheer him up, like giving him a handmade card for his birthday, sending him pictures of food he liked etc. Recently he told me there's more to him than food and we could talk about other things as well. I feel thrown. For one, I keep trying to reach out, and now the content of the conversation I'm making is being criticised. How can I make good conversation when I  don't even know if I can expect a  reply?\n\nIf he hadn't been a relatively good friend, I'd have walked by now. If he hasn't just been hurt, I'd not have been this patient. However is it's been 4 months now and this dancing on eggshells is exhausting. Am I the asshole for wanting to subject him to an honest conversation about whether we are even friends still, given he may be a bit depressed?\n\nAlso, the conversation can take place over text, or in person in another 2-3 weeks when I visit his city, where I'm uncertain we will even meet at this point.

      "description": "I've been friends with her for half my life (Friend A) There was actually three of us that were really good friends. Then one of them (Friend B) slept with my significant other (you can check out my past post.... it was a mess). \n\nI dumped the friend that slept with my husband. And everyone else associated with her. But that other good friend? Friend A, she was innocent in all of it. And she said she was done with Friend B. B was changing and was acting out a lot. Friend A didn't mention it to me, because she didnt want me to feel caught in the middle of them. I thought we were on the same page when it came to cutting Friend B out of our lives. \n\nNow, Friend A doesn't reach out to me (not that I have either, I'll admit). She said she keeps it cordial with Friend B because they have mutual friends. Well, now it seems like more than that. They take those cringey, cute photos together at bars like they are back to being best friends. I even mentioned to Friend A that I felt like we were going to fade away and no longer be friends. Friend A said she has to be nice to Friend B and that she'd never expect me to hang out with that other girl. We would make time for one another when I visted in December. But then we haven't talked since that conversation took place.\n\nShe had asked in November when I'd be in town. I told her, so she could take off work. I arrived back in my hometown. I didn't text her. She didn't text me. And the week we had talked about getting together, she was out at the bars with Friend B. \n\nAnd today I see that my \"friend\" tagged the Friend B in a post saying they should go to another event in town. \n\nAm I wrong if I feel like Friend A never really was a friend? Or at least not a good one. If the roles were reversed, I would never speak to Friend B ever again. I wouldn't care if we had mutual friends still. I'd ignore Friend B. I don't think that's being a bitch. I think it's pretty reasonable to think I'm not going to associate with someone who has hurt a good friend. \n\nAm I crazy here? Part of me wants to write Friend A and be like wtf is this? Are we just done?? Are you choosing her over me just because I live out of state now and you're lonely? \n\nMy life has been a mess this last year, and I have fucking no one anymore. I'm just pissed and confused. So, am I in the wrong here for expecting her to drop Friend B after she said she was done with her?? Is it odd for her to change her mind?",

      "description": "I missed Monday, which is the day they announced a special schedule for the next two days (Yesterday, Today). I walked in an hour late to my first class of the day today since I didn't know better and thought the schedule was the usual, and my teacher deadpan said \"You're an hour late.\" I handed him my pass, and in passing, said \"I didn't get an e-mail\" because this is my first year here, and my old school did everything by email, including announcements where I'd know about these things. \n\nI was honestly not aware, and I simply said that I didn't know. I tried to be apologetic. He then proceeded to tell me to exit the class and talk to him outside. \n\nHe said he hated how I was retorting (I honestly just wanted to provide some explanation) and that he was upset that I was an hour late (I came on a late start day schedule, we effectively start an hour late) and some other stuff that I can't begin to remember. He was mad. I just stopped listening, at this point he was just ranting and raving, but I remember him saying for me to get back inside and try again. I just passed him silently, I'd already given him my tardy slip. \n\nIt was just me that was late that day. He claimed he showed the class the funky schedule for the week. I wasn't there that day (Monday) and when I conferred with other teachers, they said there wasn't even advisory (the time he claimed he showed the class). \n\nThe reason I'm unsure if I'm a lesser human being is because I passed by the Conduct Principal and said basically the same thing:\n\n\"Hey, u/Small1324, you're late.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I didn't get an e-mail.\"\n\n\"I know you weren't here Monday. Have a nice day.\"\n\nIf I hadn't tried this on someone else, and walked in and said that, sure, I'd be a jerk, I don't know why, but the first reaction I got saying that wasn't great so that ought to tell me not to do it again. But I said this in good faith, not with malicious intent, and the Conduct Principal, the one I've had most run-ins (mostly for being tardy 1-2 minutes every other morning) just said to have a nice day. \n\nI feel like this sudden anger was statistically unexpected.¬π There's no way I'd have predicted that kind or anger.¬≤\n\nSo am I a garbage human being¬≥ for not knowing the schedule and choosing to explain myself instead of shut up?\n\n----------------------\n\n1: As you can see, I like logic more than my dictionary. Sometimes I really want to shut up, forever, and watch instead of talk. I'm not good at words, and maybe word choice was the breaking point. \n\n2: This teacher is noted by many of my peers to be \"kind of bad\" and \"not worth reasoning with\". I've seen him with a short fuse and call someone out who was drawing in class while he was lecturing (I think you should only call someone out if they're distracting others. An individual's grade belongs to them). \n\n3: avoiding swear words because someone at the school might be watching my every move. There's a team of Sherrifs' deputies that literally just sit at their desks and watch internet content that comes out of us. Lots of strict internet rules I've encountered before, but I'm able to be expelled, and almost the age where I can be charged with crime.\n\nEpilogue: I've talked to two other teachers and a senior, both say I'm in the clear (I'm in a similar standing with them, I'm just \"a\" student, not a disrupter, not incredibly bright even though I'm apparently \"gifted\"). One of the teachers said some teachers might not be accepting of what appears to be a retort, although she also said that this doesn't sound like it. The other teacher was willing to go to that teacher and talk about it. \n\nThe senior student realised the core issue for me, I think. The issue was the way I said it. I said \"I didn't\" instead of \"Sorry for not knowing\". I mean, it's not like I didn't try to apologize, I guess it's just the wrong kind of words came out of my mouth. Not that I'd know, again, not the greatest with words. I'm glad he gave me some good advice as well, check the calendar when school intersects a holiday. \n\nI tried to get this tardy excused but the person at the desk essentially said I had to be more vigilant about checking the calendar. \n\nSo again, the question. Am I less human for deciding to say something?\n\n-------------------------\n\n**TL;DR**: I gave an explanation as to why I'm an hour late, and my teacher pulled me out of class almost immediately and angrily ranted about me \"retorting\" when I walked in and said so. I'd have accepted my A status then, but I said this to the Conduct Principal as well while walking to that class and he just said to have a nice day, no anger. \n\nAgain, I'm not excusing myself. I'm explaining. I'm not trying to gain an air of self righteousness. I'm here to see if me saying something makes me less human. \n\n--------------------------\n\nHopefully you guys will have a better Thanksgiving than me. I get to debate myself about this incident with one of my teachers. ",

Obviously not any, but if I specify a haircut I dismply dislike/am not attracted to (like dreadlocks), or one that is not cultulary appropiate (like well, a skinhead-style)?\n\n* Tatoos/Piercings. Same as before, not attracted to.\n\n* Gender reassignment/transitioning? One more extreme one, but I'm still curious.\n\nAgain, all of those if they have been discussed before,  and again, not expecting that those will not be done, I only want to know if they are an acceptable reason for a breakup, and if not, what I should do if I'm not attracted to my partner anymore.\n\nLet the judging begin!",

We speak about everything and we tell each other everything.\nWe only see each other at night (around 21.30h) when we arrive home after a long day. It's the moment when we talk about our day and have some time for us. \nSo, last night I arrived at home by 21h and I prepared dinner. About 21.30h he texts me to say he'll be late arriving home. I say OK and then to watch TV waiting for him. Around 22.30h he texts me again to day I should have dinner since he'll be late. I ask him what time is it late and he responds around 1am. So, I tell him OK, is it everything OK? No answer to this... \nSo, I had dinner and not long after I went to sleep. \nThis morning I woke up next to him, but I don't know when he arrived nor where he has. He didn't reply.\nThis is not normal for us, since if we usually go out or something, we tell each other where we are, with friends, with family, at the gym... Whatever. This is the first time he does this. Arriving late without saying anything.\nI am a little upset with him for this, but I don't if I am overreacting. Should I confront him tonight?

      "description": "A more accurate title would be: Am I The Homophobe. So here‚Äôs my situation; \n\nI‚Äôm an indie film Writer/Director, based in Australia. Myself and my crew have recently completed a short film, and have just launched our festival run. For this film, I was the Writer as well as Co-Director (important). It‚Äôs also worth note that our crew is full of very close friends, and there was no negativity or tension on-set.\n\nFor context, I‚Äôm a straight male. My Co-Director is female, and currently in a serious relationship with a woman. My Producer (male) is gay, and engaged to his partner. And my Assistant Director identifies as a lesbian. The four of us have the say on where the film is entered, festival wise.\n\nWithin the crew of roughly 20 people, I‚Äôd estimate that 6ish people openly identify as LGBTQ+. Like I said above, I‚Äôm the only person in one of the executive roles that is straight. \n\nThere‚Äôs a particular festival that caught the other threes eyes when we were shortlisting. The festival is specifically for LGBTQ+ films or filmmakers. One of the entry rules is that your film must have some kind of LGBTQ+ themes/context OR you as a filmmaker must identify as LGBTQ+. Our film has absolutely nothing in it relating to the LGBTQ+ community, and this fact is something that all four of us agree on.\n\nSo the only way we‚Äôd be accepted, is if the key people identify as LGBTQ+. The problem is I don‚Äôt. Now the other three are fairly keen on the idea of entering the festival, but my concern would be that I‚Äôd either be assumed by the festival organisers/audience/media to be LGBTQ+ or that I‚Äôd be excluded from receiving awards, based on my sexuality. If my Co-Director were to win awards for OUR role in the film, and I wasn‚Äôt eligible, I feel like that‚Äôs somewhat discriminatory. Obviously this doesn‚Äôt sit well with me.\n\nSo AITA for opposing entering the festival? Should I support something that I can‚Äôt really be apart of?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I like playing tennis. I'm far from the best players, but I love the sport. Dad did, too. He'd get involved in my matches, taking videos of me and whatnot, you know, standard dad stuff. Except for that right after every loss, when I was most devastated, he'd list out, very bluntly, all the things I did wrong and tell me to get better. Every time I lost, I tell him to hold off, and he doesn't. This eventually results in a talk where he promises not to and still repeats his offenses the next time. I've been through this for more than a year, now, and the same thing still happens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, one day after practice (not even a match), he starts doing the usual thing, and I say \"Yeah, I know\" in a sort of disagreeable tone (I don't even know what it was; all I know is it felt neutral for me and was objectively not confrontational). He heats up, saying \"what is wrong with you? I'm just trying to help and look at how you treat me!\" I say that he's doing fine, I'm not feeling in such a good mood, just we can get home and discuss this. He says ok. Halfway through the car ride, he yells, \"you think you're so good and tennis? Look at how trash your forehand is! I'm trying to help you and you treat me like garbage!\" I muster all the patience and sweetness I have left and again just tell him to talk about this when we get home. Close to home, he says, \"You know what? I should just leave you at home to do nothing all day! You're useless!\" I'm really upset now, and I break. \"I'M A FAILURE, ALRIGHT?! I'm SORRY!\" He responds with \"FUCK YOU! GET OUT OF THE CAR!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was it. If I had any fear of the man, it disappeared right then and there. I had had enough of him using me as a punching bag, treating me like an array of numbers. All these years, I was like a pressure cooker, slowly building up pressure on the inside while appearing fine on the outside, and that day I exploded. I had had enough of him. I grabbed a racket (in case he tried to approach me), walked out, and screamed \"I HATE YOU!\" at the top of my lungs. A minute goes by, he tries to approach me and says, \"Are you done? Get back in the car!\" I run off, screaming \"FUCK OFF! I FUCKING HATE YOU!\" He repeatedly called me, trying to get me to come back. Every time, I'd answer with swears at the top of my lungs. I never knew I was capable of such foul words. I was the quiet kid who never swore in school, and now here I was, saying stuff like \"I hope you die homeless and alone, \" \"you only care about the money in your bank account, \" \"you do not deserve to be a father, go drink your problems off\" you know, every horrible insult I could think of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran two towns over to a Dunkin' Donuts, called my mom, and had her drive me back home while my dad stayed in the basement to avoid contact.",

      "description": "  \n\n‚ÄòEy Reddit, recently some events from my past have started creeping in my mind, making me feel massive regret and just feel like a general asshole. So, I guess the general idea is to just get it all out and hear from others what they think. \n\nSo about a year ago now, I had a best mate. For context, we‚Äôre both blokes in our early twenties.  We knew each other from school and hung out each day, whether it was spending the day gaming or going to the gym, but it was a great time either way and we supported each other through a lot. They were the closest I‚Äôd ever been to someone which meant a lot to me since I had trouble maintaining close relationships in the past. \n\nDespite the positive aspects of the friendship, life in general was still rough and I was struggling with major depression. We ended up having a few fights spread across the months and my mate had his own things he was dealing with as well. In the end, we always reconciled and tried to learn from whatever happened. We were both apart of a bigger friendship group, but honestly the I felt distant to most of them and looking back at it, the whole group was probably a toxic environment for me. I could go into why if anyone feels it‚Äôs necessary, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs particularly relevant? I guess in relation to my close mate, they weren‚Äôt happy with the choice I made. Regardless I tried to move away from this group to focus on my own physical and mental health, but I stayed in contact with my mate since despite any fights or difficulties, I do think they were a positive impact on my life. \n\nThis all accumulates to why I‚Äôm making this post. At this point, I was a bit of a loner and my depression was really bad. The day before, my Dad was hospitalized after a stroke and I had asked my mate to hang out and keep my mind off things. They declined not saying why, so I was pretty gutted. I can‚Äôt remember exactly what I said as a response, but it was a general statement that wasn‚Äôt noteworthy and they responded with a simple: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Due to my mood and recent events (although I recognize that it‚Äôs not fair to blame my mood for my actions and I do need to take responsibility for what I say), I responded with: ‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not fine.‚Äù\n\nThis ended up sparking fight as my mate went on a rant about how I was being aggressive, and they didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me. At first, I did try to be reasonable and apologize for what I said (as I do agree it was aggressive), but eventually I just got caught up in the emotion and tried to defend myself which ended up getting me blocked. My mind went full panic and I tried calling them. My mindset here was: My mate meant a lot to me, they were the only close mate I had and I was afraid to lose anymore since my Dad was in bad shape in the hospital. I tried calling them but they just ignored me once or twice before picking up a third and I explained I wanted to talk in person, but they responded with they don‚Äôt want to talk to me ever again. I said I‚Äôd really like to come over and apologized for offending them but they just said ‚ÄòNo‚Äô and hung up. \n\nAfter that, I just went over to my mates house anyway. Thinking about it honestly turns me red from embarrassment since it‚Äôs pathetic, but I really wanted to reconcile or at least talk in person to try make amends. I knocked on the door and they were fuming, telling me to understandably fuck off, of which I just did and went home depressed. We weren‚Äôt in contact for awhile then, but afterwards we awkwardly came across each other at the gym. They were still pissed and said I trespassed by coming over and I did apologize, but the relationship was pretty much dead by that point so nothing either of us said could do anything to help the situation. But yeah‚Ä¶ overall I still feel like absolute shit when I think about the situation and I kinda hope loading it off‚Äôll help. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "\nBack in January my partner asked if I wanted to stay with him and his family at a hotel for about 4 nights for a family wedding. I told him at the time I wouldn‚Äôt know what my schedule would be like, so don‚Äôt book for me. It would be 4 weeknights, and I‚Äôve just started my post grad and am on the job hunt, so I‚Äôm trying to keep myself available. \n\n\nAbout 2 days ago he tells me his parents have booked the hotel for 6 people (parents, my partner and I and his brother + brother‚Äôs girlfriend) and asked if I wanted to come. I have 3 pieces of assessment due over those 4 days, so I told him I wouldn‚Äôt be able to come even if I wanted to.  The next day we got into a big fight about it, since his parents already booked for me and he‚Äôs upset that I don‚Äôt want to do this with his family/I‚Äôm not making the effort for him. We‚Äôve had similar arguments before regarding my commitment to his family/events. He‚Äôs very extroverted and has a lot of family that he wants me to meet and be as close to as he is, but I‚Äôm extremely introverted and my family consists of my parents and my 1 uncle I see about 4 times a year, so, although I've been trying my best, it‚Äôs been a huge change for me. In addition to this, he knows I hate weddings and I really have nothing in common with his family. I can‚Äôt help but feel as though unless I‚Äôm attending every single event, AND being happy about it, it‚Äôs not enough. (FWIW I‚Äôm always polite and friendly with his family, and I'm good friends with his brother.)\n\n\nI ended up venting about it to my parents, and my mother told me that being anti-social and admitting that I don‚Äôt get along with his family would ruin our relationship and that I wasn‚Äôt making enough of an effort. When I asked her if I should lie and say ‚ÄúI wish I could go‚Äù she said yes. \n\n\nI‚Äôve had some time to reflect on the situation, and I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm just being immature for not wanting to go to this event, and if maybe I should just suck it up because that‚Äôs how relationships work. I don‚Äôt want to lie to my partner about my wants and needs and the kicker is: I wasn‚Äôt even invited to the wedding. Neither was his brother‚Äôs gf. His parents just hoped that we could show up under the pretence that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre already here‚Äù. \n\n\nI‚Äôve been told I can be unempathetic and cold before, and I thought I'd worked on that, but I'm worried that I'm too dumb to see what I've done wrong, so I really need some sort of outside perspective. I never really thought our difference in social needs/family would have such an impact on our relationship, but it seems to really be grating on him. I‚Äôve made no requirements for him to get to know my family, so it feels like a double standard, but his family is clearly very important to him, so I can see how that‚Äôs a false equivalence. AITA? \n",

For context, we're shopping in the grocery store with my friend and the way the lines work in the basket lane is that there are 2 cashiers that has 1 major line and people will pick either of the cashier to form another mini line of 3 people where you will have to wait. \n\nIt was about 1 PM, I was hungry as fuck, just got out of school and stressed out. Haven't eaten anything besides breakfast. We go to the line and I was waiting about 10 minutes before someone stopped moving while being in front of the single long line. There was nobody going to the other cashier so I decided to look at the other people and they seem like they didn't give a fuck about holding 20 or more people who have now gathered while they where just standing there waiting for the single cashier to be empty. By this point, I was probably 5th or 4th in line (I don't remember) so I decided to go to the cashier and pay for our stuff. \n\nThe people in front of me didn't like this and some dude yelled \"EXCUSE ME THERE'S A LINE HERE\" So I yelled back \" I KNOW, YOU AREN'T MOVING SO I DECIDED TO MOVE BY MYSELF\" after that, I let the dude who was in front to go ahead of me, thinking that they didn't see the other cashier that was open. But he politely declined and smiled. And the dude that yelled said \" I WANT TO BUT THIS GUY IS IN FRONT OF ME\" I have no idea what this dude is on about and why he's so angry about a grocery line where I was 5th in line.

I thought she meant that she would be in the driving to there and I would be in the returning to the home drive.

So after awhile of arguing she proposed that I can be on the drive back if I won‚Äôt listen to music with my ear phones.

I said I don‚Äôt give a crap about the rule because she acted like an asshole and immature because it doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm on my earphones because its mine and this is stupid.

      "description": "Long post. I apologize in advance.\n\nBackstory: This entire dilemma is a trivial first world issue but I cant seem to shake off how upset I am. I am in a friend group of about 4 couples (8 of us total) but only 6 of us are involved in this situation. This friend group likes to go to music festivals. We generally go to the same music fests together with the exception of two (Coachella and EDC).\n\nAlso, since there are many players at work here, couples and acronyms to avoid confusion are below:\n- GF (girlfriend) and I\n\n- BF (best friend. Not to be confused with boyfriend for the sake of this post)\n\nBFGF (My best friends girlfriend)\n\nX (3rd male in couple) and Y (3rd female in couple)\n\n\nLet me be clear that I am also very close to X and Y, so they are not just acquaintances. Also note that my GF and I are the Coachella supporters and XY are the EDC supporters. Finally, X enjoys EDC enough to belittle Coachella with phrases like ‚ÄúF- Coachella‚Äù at any oppurtunity. This doesn‚Äôt hurt my feelings in any way but it is important to note for later.\n\nLast year 2018, XY informed us that they will be going to EDC and invited us. GF and I and BF and BFGF all said no as we did not have the funds to do so. A few weeks pass by and it turns out my GF spontaneously received a way to get Coachella Tix via friend who agreed to let us pay in installments. BF and BFGF told us that they couldn‚Äôt come w us because of money but shortly after, they bought tix to go to EDC w XY. All of us had an amazing experience at our separate festivals but BF and BFGF came back and mentioned that it was fun but XY brought along some guests with uninvited baggage (drug use, vomitting, mass crowd in a cramped hotel, etc) Also important for later. They did also mention that they felt they would probably have had a better time if the 8 in our friend group only went. Coachella 2019 monthly installment tickets came out after Coachella 2018 was over, and my GF and I along with BFGF started the process to pay for tickets. By Dec 2018 all 3 of our tickets were paid off. In multiple moments last year (some intoxicated, others completely sober) BF and I had conversations where he mentioned that he was going to come with me to Coachella since he went to EDC with XY and he really wanted to go with us. BFGF would occasionally make joking comments that if the lineup wasn‚Äôt good she would sell her tickets but my BF would always say ‚Äúshes going to go. Ill make her go‚Äù. In those conversations, Ive also mentioned that I would go to EDC 2019 with them for the hell of it and because if I was going to go it would be with them anyway (to emphasize my willingness to go I will mention that my gf will be on a cruise and I'd be a 5th wheel)\n\nThis year 2019, the Coachella lineup was announced, and the artists involved did not impress BF or BFGF (due to their dislike of headliners and not knowing the smaller artists and groups). BFGF had already had her ticket paid for with the monthly installments but my BF had not. He would have to buy a ticket out of pocket. BFGF informed us that she was thinking about selling her ticket but nothing was decided. BFGF told us this plan in our group text with the others. X mentioned that BF and BFGF should just go with him and Y to Peru when they travel overseas within the next few months instead of going to Coachella. Both my BF and BFGF ‚Äúliked‚Äù this text (again, I know this is trivial first world problems) and this gave me the strong impression that they would rather go to Peru with XY instead of Coachella with my GF and I but I never was told a ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù. My GF and I car camp at Coachella and need to decide who is coming in specific cars so I ask my BF if he was planning on still going to Coachella or if his gf leaned him towards the ‚Äúnot going‚Äù direction. Despite the text conversations, I was expecting something along the lines of a ‚Äúhell yeah I'm going‚Äù based on the knowledge of our verbal agreements. But instead I received a ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really want to go in the first place‚Äù he also mentioned that he is willing to try it another year when there are artists he wants to see. This just left me feeling abandoned because it seems like a repeat of last year and I suspect they will go to EDC like last year as well. My first argument is that GF and I go to shows that BF and BFGF invite us to (most are shows in which we don‚Äôt know the dj) so why cant they do the same for us for Coachella, similar to how I would go to EDC? Granted, the tickets for the smaller events we go to throughout the year are never more than $40 but the amount that my GF and I have gone to has added up to an amount fairly high so having them compare these smaller events to Coachella is irrelevant. My second argument is that my BF and BFGF will go to just about anything that XY inform them of (Biggest event being EDC). In fact, 90% of the time, XYs secondary group will come along (the ones that brought along various baggage at EDC) and will affect the night a bit but BF and BFGF still insist on going wherever XY go despite this. Also when we do go and see a show, BF, BFGF and XY will stick w one another, take pictures and videos, hug each other and my GF and I are left feeling like the odd couple out of our friend group.\n\nI 100% understand that it is their money and they can do with it as they please. I also know that they can do whatever they want or don‚Äôt want to do with whomever they want. I have no right to dictate how they spend anything but Im feeling as though spending has less to do with it and the couple they decide to do a task and spend with is more the deciding factor. Knowing past history, my BF and BFGF will likely decide to actually go to EDC or Peru w XY, instead of Coachlla w my GF and I. I also understand that this sounds like I am being jealous that my BF is going to go anywhere that X goes (and yes, if I must admit, I am) but I am also equally upset at my BFGF for saying no as well, and she is obviously not my BF.\n\nNow, to avoid seeing negative phrases or talks that will further upset me (like F- Coachella or ‚Äúthe lineup is trash‚Äù both of which were said in our group texts while I remained quiet), Ive deleted all social media apps that have me involved with my friend group and have silenced our group text on my phone. I just don‚Äôt want anyone to rain on my parade with those comments now that I was gut punched by my BF and BFGF, and to be honest I really love Coachella and don't need it thrashed on. Final important note is that my gf, bf and bfgf all work together and I have been giving them the cold shoulder ever since I received the ‚ÄúI never really wanted to go‚Äù text. This music festival event was the cherry on top. It is usually like trying to pull teeth to get my BF to go somewhere (snowboarding, winter vacation, go to the bar or restaurants with our other friends, etc). However, the usual trend is that if he invites me somewhere (money involved or not) I am always willing to go. I haven‚Äôt ignored them in an effort to change their minds and have them decide to go to Coachella. I just want to distance myself from people whom I felt would do anything with me just for the sake of having fun. People whom have stated they would go with me to such events, raised my hopes, and then given me reasons to believe I am in a one way friendship, cast out for other people. I will say hi and respond to anything they say to me, but nothing more than that. Is distancing myself from them for a bit and giving them the cold shoulder because I feel like I‚Äôm in a one way friendship and because I grow weary of the inconsistencies bad? AITA?\n\nSorry, I know grammar and syntax are terrible but I'm quite tired.\n\n",

      "description": "So my sophomore year, I was face timing with my best friend from 7th grade. Long story short, our families both moved and so she ended up going to college in the south and I ended up going to college in the north but we stayed in touch by visiting each other every year and FaceTime, phone calls, etc.\n\nSo one day when we were facetiming, I told her, let's call her Sarah, about my weekend where I babysat my two friends who did acid, and my other friend who did and edible and just got super drunk. They wanted to go to a few places around town so I was the DD and babysat, mostly the two on acid. \n\nSo at this point, she asks me if I had ever done it and I said yes, I had earlier in the summer around my birthday and that I had done Molly about twice my freshman year.  She didn't say anything at the time and we continued talking until we didn't have anything else to talk about.\n\nThen about a few days later, she wants to talk and calls me when I'm available. At this time, she basically gives me an intervention about the drugs I'm using and how it's too much and I dont want to end up like my biological mom who was/ is alcoholic ( Im adopted). She then tells me she talked to her brother about it and he said that I needed to stop since these were hard drugs. She talked to her roommate, who has seen my snap stories but has never met me, and she says that it seems like I'm partying all the time. I'm clearly upset at this time, I've done it three times in about a year and a half/ two years but I'm still getting good grades/on the Dean's list, working two jobs, and doing quite well ( at least I think so). Plus the drugs I've done, I've gotten from trusted friends who have had tried  and tested it themselves and I take smaller amounts/ watch myself. I drink every now and then ( generally work on the weekends at one job) , but I always watch myself as I'm not comfortable getting black out drunk or anywhere near that level. \n\nI ended hanging up the call since my sister ( current roommate at the time) needed help unloading her car. I told her we could talk later and we didn't cause she could tell I was upset that she was throwing this at me but she said that she was concerned about me. I said that's fine and left it.\n\nAt this point, I talked to my friends and they all said that she was basically the asshole and hypocritical as she binge drinks all the time, tells me stories of her being black out drunk, used to being vodka in a water bottle to high school and making other risky decisions.\n\nI haven't talked to her since except for a happy birthday and I kinda miss her but was I the asshole? Cause if I decide to try to patch things up, I don't know if I should apologize. \n\n",

      "description": "This is my first post if I apologize if I don‚Äôt do this exactly right.\n\nMy husband and his uncle ( who is going through a rough divorce, that‚Äôs the reason for the trip) planned a trip to a concert about 4.5 hours away. The concert happens the day after my husband is on shift (24/48 shift work) and he is notorious for falling asleep if he sits down for more than 5 minutes after a shift day, so I was concerned about him driving 4.5 hours by himself the day after a shift. He‚Äôs never fallen asleep driving before, but long trips after work aren‚Äôt the norm. I offered to drive him, get a separate room at the hotel and do my own thing, then drive home the next day. \n\nInitially he said he‚Äôd have to ask his uncle about it, then just changed the subject when I brought it up, so I figured he didn‚Äôt want me to go for whatever reason, or his uncle didn‚Äôt, and let it go. Then his mom found out the trip was the day after a shift and she suggested I go, which he acted the same way about. \n\nSo the week before the trip, he starts saying that he doesn‚Äôt want to go, wishes he could cancel, doesn‚Äôt want to be away from us ( we have two kids under three, and he‚Äôs on shift for 48 hrs the day after he gets back). I again offered to drive so he could rest on the way, and also because we used to take road trips and have a blast before the kids. He said he‚Äôd check with his uncle. I dropped it. His mom called me on Wednesday and brought it up again. I told her I wasn‚Äôt going, it‚Äôs their thing, and she said that she talked to his uncle and he was fine with it. I didn‚Äôt mention this to him, but it kinda (nah, a lot) hurt my feelings. Like I didn‚Äôt want to go to the concert or hang out with them even, honestly after being with kids all day every day I would be perfectly happy to take a shower without someone yelling mom and then paint my nails. But then I also think I basically invited myself along on their trip, whether I was trying to be an interloper or not. \n\nSo, AITA? ",

I said that I would if I didn't have work at those dates, and we agreed upon it.\n\nFlash forward to about a week ago on Wednesday. The mom's text read \"confirming if you could stay from Friday to Wednesday\", I misread it as Monday, and said yes, everything was fine.\n\nHer husband came over from Jersey yesterday and stopped at the house to clean out the fish tank and other stuff around the house, then drove up to where the rest of the family was. He asked if I was sleeping over Tuesday and said I couldn't because I have school and work. He said \"no big deal, I'll get the neighbors to do it.\"\n\nSo about an hour ago I get a text from the mom and the mom said \"we confirmed it for Wednesday. Can you at least sleep over after coming home? Because otherwise I'll have to cancel my daughter's birthday vacation\"\n\nI responded that I was sorry that I misread everything and that if the neighbors can't I'm willing to sleep over after school and work, but the neighbors doing the next two days would make my life a lot easier.\n\nAm I in the wrong? Am I a flaky asshole?",

Also, I'm asking for your opinions on this, hence why I made this post--so I'll take it with at least a grain of salt. :) There are also some exceptions such as in dance class when the instructors or a dancer far more advanced than I is helping me improve by offering pointers.",

I responded by asking her if she was trying to transfer out of our school. It has been over 24 hours and she hasn't responded yet.

      "description": " I (28f) have been with my boyfriend (27m) for 2 years, we have lived together pretty much the whole time and actually have a really awesome relationship. He has a daughter who just turned 7, and she is incredible and the best kid ever but her mom has her the majority of the time about an hour away from where my bf and I live, so we are lucky if we even get her on the weekend. My mom has stage 4 NSC lung cancer. My boyfriend has been incredible through this whole thing, which has been quick and painful as hell and I am very fortunate for him. My mom and his daughter have spent some time together, but shes young and not around much and isn't exactly close to her in a way she is with his grandmother, who also has stage 4 cancer and is only suspected to live a short amount of time as well (she was legally my boyfriends guardian, so shes basically his mom).\n\nAnyways, I need to know if I am being to sensitive in this whole thing, seeing how my mood isn't totally stable atm. We are in the process of finalizing her will and all those fun things, and my boyfriend mentions to me the other day \" You know \\*daughter\\* would probably get some good practice for \\*bfs gma\\* funeral WHEN she goes to your moms.\" Now I had been under the impression she would not be coming, it's nothing personal at all, I love that little girl very much but her and my mom weren't close, she really doesn't understand how serious everything is because shes not around all that much and quite frankly I believe that if she doesn't have to be there, she shouldn't be, why get her all upset and scared if its not necessary. My boyfriend thinks that even though that may be the case, he's afraid of how she will react when she does actually have to go to a funeral for his grandmother, who is very close with her, and wants to be able to give her a \"trial run\" so to speak, so she isn't as scared when her time comes. He ended up taking it personally that I didn't want her there, and I took it personally that he considered my moms funeral just a teaching experience. We have apologized to each other made up and whatnot, but he still wants her to come. \n\nI understand why he wants her to come, I am very worried how she will handle his grandma passing, but I don't feel like my moms funeral, where I will be a mess, is the time or place to teach her a life lesson. And a bad as it may sound, I don't want him to be focused on her while I'm breaking down, I want him to myself which sounds harsh but for just one day, I think its okay to want your SO support you. If she was actually close to her and would be affected by it, I of course would want her to come...IDK, am I in the wrong about all of this?",

      "description": "For some background I‚Äôm 20M and the fake ‚Äúfriends‚Äù I‚Äôm referring to are M19-20. So we all graduated high school together and I didn‚Äôt really start befriending and hanging out with these guys until the beginning of senior year. \n\nTo note before I started befriending them. I had (and still do) have another group of friends who I‚Äôve known and been close with since we were all young. But that group of friends for me after graduation we all went to various universities across the US.\n\nSo with that I started to branch out and befriend these other guys (now fake friends) during our senior year in high school because we were all thinking (and currently do) go to the same university. And everything was good, typical stuff you expect from a group of guys this age. Such as just giving each other shit and messing with one another but all in good fun and everyone‚Äôs enjoying themselves. \n\nWell fast forward approximately 1.5 / 2 years to this most recent summer. My other 3 good friends, M19-21 (they are the other part of this group with the 3/4 fake friends) who also go to the same college. So we usually text in our group chat asking who wants to get dinner, hang out for the night, or play games on our PCs, typical stuff. And they‚Äôd always respond with excuses or they‚Äôd just not even give us an answer. So it‚Äôd just be my 3 good friends and myself doing whatever. \n\nAs well as at some point during this summer (we all have gaming computers) so we use discord to commute, they made a new channels and chats for just the 3/4 of the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to use so they could ignore us and not interact with us. This is really where they seemed to start to isolate themselves and grow apart from us. \n\nSo we kept trying to get them to hang out and play games but after trying for several months. And them not even giving my one good friend the time of day for his 21st birthday party we just kinda gave up with them. \n\nWell now it‚Äôs November and this literally happened this evening. So the ‚Äùfriends‚Äù were having a bonfire and since they are all under 21, they invited my real friend, who is 21, over to fire and got him to buy them alcohol.   **according to them he didn‚Äôt have to bring drinks, but I was told they wanted alcohol so that‚Äôs why they invited him over**\n\nSo with what I knew at the time, I was messaging my friend saying things like ‚Äúhey man the whole situation sounds like your getting used because they wanted drinks.‚Äù  And ‚Äúdid they only invite you so you they could drink?‚Äù Stuff like that cause to me and another good friend it really sounded like he was being used. And also they have never really been a good friend to me so I don‚Äôt think too highly of them.  \n\nWell at some point and somehow those ‚Äùfriends‚Äù found out what I was saying about them and asked me in our group chat ‚Äúwhy are you so upset and telling him to be careful.‚Äù So I flat out said y‚Äôall are fake friends and using him for his alcohol. Proceeding to rant about how they have never tried to be my friend, they‚Äôd never initiate hanging out or shit like that. They never asked how life was and how I was doing. Like stuff you do with people you care about and care for.\n\nAnd according to them they aren‚Äôt fake, I‚Äôm just an insecure asshole who was never a good friend and that I was just jealous I wasn‚Äôt invited to hang out but I was already playing games with my other friend?? Then they proceeding to start bringing up pretty personal stuff and being dicks about the things I told them out of trust a while ago (stuff from when I was in a LDR and the issues and feelings I had from that relationship) and then proceeded to say I had a shit life. \n\nSo that pushed me over the edge and made my blood boil for sure. So for one of them I said something along the lines of ‚Äúhave fun marrying and impregnating your girlfriend who couldn‚Äôt even graduate high school on time and living that shit life.‚Äù  Called another one out and said something like ‚Äúno car, gets driven to college everyday, no job, no motivation, shit life..‚Äù Then I just generally said something along the lines of idc what you all think or say about me. You‚Äôll never know how my side of the story is and what I‚Äôve been through recently (this fall has been pretty rough for me)  but I‚Äôm not going to waste my time on those who don‚Äôt care about me. \n\ntl/dr: good friend of mine was invited to bonfire by ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù I messaged him telling him to be careful he‚Äôs not getting used cause they are fake. Those ‚Äúfriends‚Äù asked what my problem was in group chat. Starting getting personal, I called them all fake and got personal back. \n\n\n",

My sister came to me today and said that she thinks i dont participate in arrangements enough. She said that its is always here or my other sister who orders and pays for stuff like cakes and such for events around our parents. I didnt argue with here about that, because they always have arranged stuff like this, and i kind of become a \"middel man\". I drive and get the cake, pick up my sisters, or get items they need, and if it is not paid for i just pay for it, no questions asked. But i told her that, even though i dont take inititativ in arrangements by buying the cakes, or order them or other items, i help as much as i can in other areas. Neither of my sisters drive anywhere, whenever something is needed, i drive, and that also means i maintain the car that alle 3 of us use. Pay the gas, maintenance and other necessitis. I always thought that my contribution by beeing this \"middel man\" was more then enough.\n\nSo i am wondring am i in the wrong here? Am i the Asshole for always letting my sisters the initiativ in arrangmentes and order things and then just fill the gaps?",

      "description": "Back in summer 2018, I introduced one of my classmates to my best friend. To make it easier for you to follow, let‚Äôs refer to my classmate as P and my best friend as U. \n\n After weeks of getting to know each other, they dated. At first, I was genuinely happy for them, because at the time they seemed to be a well-assorted couple. So I was surprised when they broke up just after a month. Why? She told me that P was overwhelmed with jealousy, and their conversations were boring and cheesy. Furthermore, he was a bigheaded hypocrite who expects U to change to his liking, but takes no notice of her pet peeves about him. But the last straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back, was when P insisted on kissing U. Literally one month into the relationship and he wanted to have a kiss, which would be the first kiss for both of them. U wasn‚Äôt prepared for that and she quickly terminated the relationship.\n\nNonetheless, P gave U a lot of affection. As a consequence, U constantly told me how she missed P after the breakup, which I found ironic and also unbearable. They came back three months after. P gave U his Facebook password, which I found weird because he does that in every relationship, and because U refused to do so. Things were all good at first, I would say.\n\nBut later on, red flags appeared. Whereas U kept her relationship private and only shared it with a couple of friends, P made a huge announcement to the class, and to be honest I was a bit annoyed at how boastful he was. U actually wasn‚Äôt in the same class as P and I, so she asked me to keep an eye on him. I did so. He talked to other girls? I reported to her. He used his phone in class? I informed her. U kept me updated about their relationship too and apparently P was still as irritating. His jealousy was getting out of control. He was jealous of ME, because I talked to U a lot. He was also jealous of U‚Äôs friends, who were GIRLS. It was as if P was considering U as HIS possession, like really HIS. \n\nLife usually gives you lemon. In this case it had given me the sourest lemon it has. I don‚Äôt know how, but P got U to give him her Facebook password, and therefore had access to U and I‚Äôs messages. He was completely intimidated by what I told U about him, obviously ignored what U complained to me and went on to trash-talk me, which I discovered through U. His jealousy of me got worse and worse, he started asking his friends between their boyfriend/girlfriend and their best friend, who would they choose. He even thought that U cheated on him with me, which was very ridiculous given that I‚Äôm gay. I haven‚Äôt come out yet, but when I do I‚Äôll surely mock him a little bit. I remember one time U went to school with her hair tied up (she usually doesn‚Äôt), and she told me P was jealous of THAT. He said to her ‚ÄúOnly I should see what you are up to babe.‚Äù LMAO the most absurd thing I‚Äôve ever heard. This is my favorite thing to bring up whenever I talk shit about him (yeah I‚Äôm petty too)\n\nU had to create an another Facebook account, using a fake name so her stupid boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt find out, so she could talk to me. I didn‚Äôt want to text her original account anymore, as P surely would check up on me all the time. This was probably the most depressed I have ever been. P was very popular in class, and starting beef with him like me was a surefire way to receive hate and fake friends. On the contrary, U was back to being head over heels in love with P. Sometimes I really hate how carefree she was, because after all the one suffering the most was still me. Small fights happened here and there, but that was nothing. In fact, she already fucking kissed him. I was indescribably pissed off and disappointed when I found out. I felt like I was losing my last friend. And yet she bragged about kissing him for days, how inconsiderate of her to have brought out the asshole inside of me. \n\nI started to seize every opportunity, to jump in on every single fight they had, to encourage her to break up, to tell her that he‚Äôs no good for her. I actually managed to make the second breakup happen. That didn‚Äôt even last for a fucking day. They came back in a day and he even changed his profile picture to her. And that‚Äôs when I gave up. I decided there‚Äôs no point trying to ruin this relationship I wasn‚Äôt supposed to care so much. Let he be a burden to her and let her heart guide her to whatever she considers happiness. \n\nWhat happened after that ? She broke up with him for real. I was absolutely taken aback. I didn‚Äôt even have to do anything. She just broke up with him because he was a dick, and he deserved it. And the best part, she got over him. She is single now, and while I have gotten an arch enemy, I‚Äôm happier than ever.\n\n\nTL;DR : My best friend‚Äôs boyfriend is an asshole for me and I tried everything to get her to break up with him, thinking it would be better for the both of us\n\nSo why do I post it here ? I feel like I‚Äôm to blame for too. Remember when U asked me to keep an eye on him ? I actually had already hated him at that point, thanks to U‚Äôs description of his shitty personality. My ‚Äúreports‚Äù were more like trash-talks, given how derogatory they were. If I had been less biased towards U, I don‚Äôt think P and I will be enemies like we are now. Moreover, I feel like I should have done something to prevent the first comeback. If they had never come back, things wouldn‚Äôt have been so bittersweet and I wouldn‚Äôt have lost a friend.\n\nHonestly, I look forward to lots of YTA and opinions opposed to my subjective view about P. What do you think ? Am I the asshole in this ?\n",

      "description": "This happened about a month ago and we are still best friends but I want a second opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in high school and I liked this one girl since about a month and a half before this incident happened. We were really good friends and I developed a crush on her. My best friend, at the time had a girlfriend so I really didn't know that he would do this. But, I never did build up the confidence to ask her out or whatever as I have self-esteem issues and whatnot. I told my best friend that I really liked this girl and he was sort of my wingman as she was a mutual friend of ours. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was really close with this girl and we talked every night about really personal stuff and I felt a connection between the two of us. But, about 2 days before my best friend and her started dating she just stopped talking to me. At this point my friend knew that I liked her but he was always flirting with her during their off hour at school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I get I was not really doing anything about it and I never really asked her out and I get that but he started dating her and his excuse was that they liked each other and it just happened. I think that is a poor excuse but whatever. I found out that evening when his ex is just like \"Did you know that your best friend and the girl you like are dating?\" (I am friends with his ex and I said that I liked this girl to her). This hit me with disbelief as I couldn't think he would do something behind my back like that. I just didn't talk to him that night even when he was spamming my phone with messages saying he wanted to work it out. But I just waited until the next day as I knew I would fuck shit up real fast if I talked to him angrily.  To this day he gets annoyed whenever I give him the slightest bit of shit about the situation even though I don't really care anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I liked this girl and my best friend knew about it and he went and started dating her without really giving me any sign that he would.",

      "description": "Wait, before you make a decision, please hear me out. It is not as bad as it sounds, or at least I do not mean it to seem so.\n\nS- Sister of my boyfriend.\nB- Boyfriend\nPA- Parents of the boyfriend and sister\nWe have been together for nearly 3 years\n\nMy boyfriend‚Äôs sister (S) recently got married, and moved away to another state. It‚Äôs only a 4-6 hour drive from where my boyfriend‚Äôs parents (PA) currently lives, but they take almost every other weekend to go visit the married couple. I understand that family is important, but I find this a bit excessive. The first few times, S had asked for them to come up. She had not found a job yet and was lonely, as her husband was busy most of the days. So the PA obliged them, and went up with my boyfriend (B).\n\nThis repeated many times, even after S had found a job. The most recent visit, I decided to ask B about the frequency of the visits, and if it was S asking them to come up, or if it was the PA. The last few times it was the PA‚Äôs decision, and B really seems to enjoy the city that S and her husband live in. It seems very nice, but I have never gone, I am only going off of what he has shared with me.\n\nI was beginning to get mad, as our dates had been postponed for a few weeks (life was getting in the way, college, personal affairs, and the frequent trips), so I asked about it, which I believe offended him. He gets defensive pretty easily, so I tip-toe around certain subjects. I don‚Äôt get to spend time with him very often, as we are living separately.\n\nMe: They got married, and moved away. How come you guys keep visiting them?\nB:  [Insert City] Is a really nice place, so I take every chance I can to go.\nMe: Well, if I ever got married, I would want to have some form of privacy, y‚Äôknow? Plus, we haven‚Äôt had a date in so long...\nB: Excuse me for thinking Family is important.\n(This took place a few weeks ago. The family has decided not go back until next weekend)\n\nI didn‚Äôt say anything after the spat, and have since just kept it to myself. I hope this made some form of sense, I‚Äôve just been really hesitant about this.\n\nTLDR; AITA for wanting to see my boyfriend a bit more often than I already do/as much as he visits his family?",

      "description": "        Long story short: I (20 at the time) started seeing two guys (27 and 23). After getting to know them, but not wanting to get into another exclusive relationship with anyone after the disaster that was my previous relationship, I made it clear I had zero intentions of getting into another exclusive relationship. Through this journey I also begin to identify with a polyamorous mindset. And that a lot of the ideas I previously had about relationships already closely align with those of polyamory. \n\n        I also let them know that there‚Äôs another guy in my life early on into both of my relationships. They both were very understanding at the beginning, the 27 year old understand how young I was and that I just wanted to enjoy life and said he wouldn‚Äôt try and pressure me into something I didn‚Äôt want. The 23 year old also saying something along those lines and that he was happy with the way we were.\n\n        After 6 months of the happiness, love, and mutual respect that I received from both of them, the 27 y/o starts to change. He meets a new girl that he‚Äôs thinking he wants to start dating. Instead of breaking things off with me he keeps hanging out with me. But reduces me essentially to a side hoe status but still claims he hasn‚Äôt changed and still wants me in his life, and that I‚Äôm the one that has started asking for more attention just because he has another girl in his life. The amount I see him was reduced to once a week because he blocks out weekends for her, and even when he was over he would be texting her the whole time. He also starts double booking on me and her so opts to cancel on me. He even starts telling me stories of when they have sex. \n\n     I get upset at him for not respecting me or my feelings he essentially says that I deserve it for the months of pain I put him through because I was also with another guy. That being said though the 6 months I treated both of them with the utmost respect, was transparent with them, and gave them as much of my love as I could. I split my time and my effort equally as to not make the other feel like he was being disregarded. At this time we break up, and I go through what feels like the worst heartbreak of my life. I can‚Äôt help but think this is all my fault when I feel like all I‚Äôve done is love both of them to the best of my ability. They knew what they were getting into and they still chose to stay. Both of them at the end also admit that they were secretly hoping I would change my mind and date them exclusively. Which isn‚Äôt fair to hold against some for staying true to their values.\n\n          There‚Äôs a lot that hasn‚Äôt been mentioned in this post that I feel is relevant, but I didn‚Äôt want to make the post too long.\n\nAITA for getting in a relationship with these two men even though they were looking for exclusive relationships but agreed that my arrangement was ok? Do I deserve to get my heartbroken for trying to love both of them?",

      "description": "Throwaway account FYI.\n\nI think I should give some of the story about my relationship prior to this event. I am 17M and she is 18F\n\nI was driving my sister home from her Boyfriend's house and was in the area of her home. She texted me and asked if she could call me to talk, and I said that I was near her and had time to kill so I'd just come to her. We had been in a relationship for about a year and a half at this point. When I arrived she told me that she needed a break to be alone and figure out herself (she hadn't been single for more than 6 months since she turned 14.) I said I understood, and we both said that we loved each other and I left her house and went home. Every time I picked up my phone I'd be sad because I didn't have a text from her or a call or anything from her. \n\nFast forward a week or so of tears and heartbreak, my parents are out of town for the weekend. My Older brother is old enough to buy alcohol so I asked him to get me some, and I have a friend who deals the devil's lettuce so I picked up a joint to try it. At this point, I've still really upset over her and devastated, and I decided that I wanted to try some things and just think about our relationship and see if I can wrap my head around it all. \n\nAt 2pm, I smoke the joint and was high and thinking for a good 6+ hours (I haven't smoke in a long time so I had a really low tolerance). We had been talking on and off the past few days before hand so I texted her to let her know that I was experimenting so someone knew (in case I did something stupid and died or something). She just replied with \"Okay\" and we had a casual conversation and that was it. I had like 3 beers, played some games with friends and went to bed at like 1 am or something.\n\nThe next day, I decided it was time to try to drink some more beer and think some more to again, see if I can wrap my head around it. It was after my 4th or 5th beer (tall boys, 5.9% alc/v) that I was starting to get drunk and she texted me. I again, let her know that I was drinking for the same reason I did when I smoked this time instead of \"Ok\" I receive \"Be kind to your body\" which I thought nothing of it. We talked casually again and I continued drinking till my words got a little hard to type. At that point, she said she wasn't comfortable talking to me while I was drunk, and to text her in the morning. I said \"Ok\" and went to bed. I forgot to text her the next morning cause I was drunk. \n\nA few days later, I get a text that says \"Are you alive?\" to which I replied \"Yeah, why?\". She then went on a little rant about how I had never wanted to experiment with drugs or alcohol while we were dating and it was not like me to want to now (despite me saying I wanted to a couple of times). I tried to explain that it was really not her fault and that I just wanted to think while not being hindered my Anxiety issues (Clinically diagnosed Anxiety, Depression and self destructive behavior). She didn't understand this fully and was still pissed at me. \n\nAt the end of the day, this experiment helped me figure out the issues that caused this all, and what flaws I had as well as seeing her flaws more or less unhindered by love. We are talking more now, and I think this event has helped her realize some stuff about herself (the fact that in the relationship, it was mostly about her. She rarely listened to what I wanted, or felt and she finally saw that.) \n\nShe is still upset about this and I'm not sure if it was wrong of me to do this. I left out a bunch of other personal stuff to limit how much this can be identified to me. So AITA reddit?",

      "description": "5 1/2 years ago I moved by myself across the country. My whole family is still back in my home state. I come from a big family, lots of cousins and we were all very close growing up. Since then things have changed. We all still love each other, but my visits home are short and few. \n\nSix months ago I got married at a courthouse. I love my husband very much and it was a quick engagement and I guess you could use the word \"eloped\"\n\nMy mother was understandably shocked and a little upset when I first told her. We're very close and I usually tell her everything. \n\nShe now wants this summer to throw us a wedding celebration with my whole family when we come visit. She wants a band and to have it catered, and my whole family there, the whole deal. I do not want that at all. My family has very traditional expensive weddings. While I respect that and have enjoyed every one that I've attended and been in, that is not my style at all. I'm not one of those ppl that wanted a big party, I just wanted to marry my husband because I love him. I dont need a party to prove that.\n\nMy mother really wants this and tbh, the whole thing would make me super uncomfortable. I dont know these extended family members any more and I'm sure they couldn't care less weather I'm married or not. Like I said, my visits are short and not often and I would prefer to spend my time with the people I love and not partying with people i dont know any more. I'd rather hang out with my parents and brother and grandparents.\n\nMy husband is indifferent, he said he'd be happy either way. \n\nThis whole party is for my mom, and shes told me that. If she wants a party just throw a BBQ or something. I should also point out that I am her only daughter. My brother is planning on having a traditional wedding though, so it's not like she'll miss out on both her children's wedding. \n\nI'm in need of some outside perspective, reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "All right, I'll set the scene a bit. The TL;DR at the bottom will explain the whole thing like you were a coworker, otherwise enjoy the rare embellishment of my very ordinary life as an introverted nerd; this all happened in like 15 minutes..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a cold, wet morning in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's an October morning like any October morning. I parked my fuel efficient SUV at 6:55am at the trolley (subway/train) stop. I take the 7:20am trolley although I am there in time to take the 7:10am trolley, it gives me time to talk to the guy who takes my money, he's a cool dude, names Bob, has a dog named Cocoa. I'm chain smoking Pall Mall red's, the usual. Downing my first of two pre-8:00am energy drinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe chilled air I am breathing out creates a white acrobatic cloud that mixes with noxious clouds of tobacco fumes. Livin' the dream....but what's this? A shriek over yonder? The energy drink kicks in and my temporary Wolverine senses detect a senior citizen under arrest! Immediately I bound over to assist. I throw my cigarette aside and after a hop, a skip, and then a jump I arrive at the baby boomers side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI assess the situation with the tenacity of Sherlock Holmes.   \n\n\nThere's an old lady. She's on the ground. Her nose is bleeding. There's a knocked down side.  \n\n\nThink brain, think! What has happened to the person that time forgot, this poor soul! And then I muster the courage to my first thoughts. I say \"How's it going?\"  \n\n\nThis titan of times past looks up, fresh blood streaming down from her nose and with the propensity of a New Yorker and the grace of a Pittsburgher she softly mutters, \"I tripped over that fucking post like a jagoff.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI look over to analyse this fallen post. It says \"handicapped only\". She might be...now, I thought to myself. I look dejectedly down. I wondered distantly if Pittsburgh supported human euthanasia. But alas those questions would have to wait; the real help has arrived.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBob, everyone's favorite trolley dude, comes running over with some paper towels. He offers them to this fallen soldier of American labor. Never experiencing something like this Bob runs back to call his boss to let them know what happened and then call an ambulance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came to find out this elder woman's name was Brenda, a sixty four year old accounting assistant at a bank. She asks me to call her husband, she doesn't have a cell phone. I take out my phone, I have unlimited minutes, this is my moment to shine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe tells me the number and says Richard will pick up. I don't know about this. Someone with the name of Richard could go anyone. He could be a really cool dude with a mustache or he could be a prick with a mustache. At the moment I hear a voice on the other end, it was him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was Richard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hello, this is Richard.\" Jack pot. We've found him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Morning Richard, my name's Redditthroaway553. I have your wife...here with me.\" Why did you stutter? He think's you've kidnapped Brenda. Stop fucking up. \"She fell at the trolley and her nose is bleeding. She's okay and her with me.\"  \n\n\n\"Oh no, is she okay?\" I breathe a sigh of relief. He turned out to be Richard, the cool dude with the mustache. My superhero energy drink senses kick back in the gear, I hear sirens. The underpaid hero's are on their way! But Richard still needs a status update.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I think so, she wants to talk to you. There is an ambulance coming, I can hear them now. One second.\" I hand the phone to Brenda her bloody fingerprints leaving a temporary impression on my phone, but a permanent one in my heart. I stay by Brenda's side until the ambulance arrives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's safe, for now. The EMT's clean my phone off for me and I make my way back to the trolley. I look at Bob with the stare of a boy who has, no a MAN who has done a good service to his community. Bob stares right back at me, as he fills out his paperwork. \"Y'ain't gotta pay today Paul. 'preciate your help.\" I nod and walk up the stairs to the platform. My work here was done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days later a man with a cool mustache named Richard called me and left a voicemail. He thanked me for helping his wife and wanted to talk to me if he could. I didn't return his call, I don't need a reward Richard, I'm just glad Brenda's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was last year. Today I got a text from a Susan, an attorney. Apparently Brenda sued the transit authority people for leaving a busted handicapped sign lay on the ground in the dark. She won, but they haven't paid. The attorney wants to know if I would answer some questions. I really don't want to. Not for any other reason than I don't really care about the situation. Would I be the asshole if I didn't return the call?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - I saw an old lady fall and get hurt and she sued the public works people. They didn't pay and her attorney wants me to answer questions a year later. Would I be the asshole if I didn't call her back?",

      "description": "Please bare with me, this is a very long story.\n\nSo, for the sake of keeping things less confusing, there are 4 people involved in this, these are their fake names I will be using for this post. \n\n- Myself, and I will be writing in the first person.\n- Arthur, a friend I met my first year of college.\n- Brandon, a friend who I met at the same time as Arthur and ended up being my roommate.\n- Xylophone, a person who eventually moved in with us.\n\n\nNow, for the story leading up to my Blowup.\n\n- 1.) Arthur and Brandon and Myself met our freshman year of college, and spent pretty much all of our time as a group. We were definitely ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù. \n\n- 2.) We lived together for 2 years, and at the start of that 3rd year the random roommate dropped out of college.\n\nAnd this is when XYLOPHONE enters.\n\n- 1.) XYLOPHONE takes the random guy‚Äôs spot at our apartment. ALL 4 of us decide to sign up for a vacation, a week long cruise ship, at the end of our 3rd year, which is when shit went bad. \n\n- 3.) On top of this, our relationship was beginning to become strained as XYLOPHONE and I began to get in constant fights over meaningless things like chores.\n\n-4.) THE BIG PROBLEM arose when Arthur and I drunkenly had sex one night, where he asked me to penetrate him. (I‚Äôm gay, he‚Äôs ostensibly straight, we had sex a few months before the cruise.) This was consensual start to finish.\n\n- 5.) Arthur begins to feel extremely awkward from then on, refusing to be in the same room with me or even talking to me. \n\nNow, we finally get to the vacation. TLDR - Everybody spends time with Arthur or a hookup, and I‚Äôm left alone for most of the cruise. The vacation ends, and it‚Äôs my job to drive everyone back to our college. It‚Äôs about an 8 hour drive.\n\nOn the drive there, I‚Äôm silent and visibly pissed off , and about hour 2 into the drive someone makes a rude comment, I proceed to start yelling. Let me be clear, I never mentioned the sexual encounter Arthur and I had, but lots of cruel shit was said. Arthur screamed at me and we were all silent after.\n\nOne Friday morning, I get a call from our apartment‚Äôs leasing office (we had moved off campus when XYLOPHONE joined us) and apparently Xylophone and Brandon were both attempting to break our shared lease. They refused to pay any more rent and were moving out THAT DAY. My family hires an attorney, and the two of them move out but are forced by Small Claims court to pay their shares of the rent even if they aren‚Äôt living there.\n\nI spent the year living alone in that apartment, and to this day I have not spoken to any of the three. Brandon dropped out of college for unrelated reasons, and moved away anyways. \n\nAITA for taking out my anger on them and ruining our friend group? I keep dwelling on this every now and then and it sucks. I‚Äôd really love an outside opinion.\n\n**TL;DR** - We are all friends in college, we all start smoking weed an unhealthy amount, I have sex with one of those friends while fucked up, we all fight. \n\n",

      "description": "I have a friend who I have been friends with since late elementary school who we'll call A. A was a part of a larger friend group who I hung out with almost every day, but once middle school rolled around, our group was put in jeopardy. I was a year older than the others, including A, so it was pretty hard to keep regular contact while going to different schools, as much as we tried. Add on some drama between the others (which I didn't get any details of), and the group was dissolved.\n\n\nNow we're in high school. I'm a sophomore, they're freshmen. We keep to ourselves for the most part, but A and I have kept up to date with each other. He invites me to his house every couple of months.\n\n\nBut the thing is, I don't want to hang out anymore. It's not because he's younger than me. It's not that I think he's not \"cool\". It's just that we've drifted apart. Whenever I go to hang out with him, it feels like I just end up entertaining him rather than having fun myself. It feels like we have nothing to talk about, and whenever we do talk, it's like we're shooting things past each other, giving plain responses, like \"Oh, okay, cool.\" Our conversations get more and more awkward each time we have them. Whenever he invites anyone else along with me, I find myself talking to them more.\n\n\nHe's asked me to help him start a YouTube channel. I've told him I can't do because I have a l have a lot of work to do and I don't have time for it, which to be fair is not wrong, but it's definitely not the only reason. \n\n\nHe calls me sometimes to invite me places. These past few times, I've let it ring out. I know that's an asshole move, but I just don't know what to tell him anymore.\n\n\nI've gone to his birthday parties for the past few years. I'm not the only one who comes, he has friends that share his interests a lot more than I do. I will continue to go to them, because I still care about him and I want to support him, but it gets harder to get him a gift with each passing year.\n\n\nSo that's pretty much it. Am I the asshole? What can I do if I am?",

I would ask her out to drink coffee before class, and I just felt like she was comfortable with me. But I doubted that I had a chance with her for some unknown reason. Then comes this other girl, girl B, who clearly shows interest in me. She didn‚Äôt mind to show her affections publicly, and would straight up tell me she liked me. I, on the other hand was still caught up thinking about the first girl, and how it hurt that my feelings were ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù not going to be reciprocated. And so, I gave this second girl a shot. I tried reciprocating. I tried dating her. We never got to a point where we were officially dating, but we knew what was up. But I got disturbed by the fact that we had fights almost every conversation we have, and we weren‚Äôt even officially dating. I was getting tired. Fast forward a couple of months, and I was able to be alone with girl A. I jokingly asked her if she liked me, since I thought ‚ÄúYeah well, fuck it. I‚Äôll just tell her. She‚Äôd probably say no, and I‚Äôll go on with my life.‚Äù Well, I was wrong. She said yes. And after that, my feelings for her came back. I hated myself for not telling her in the first place, and relied on girl B because I felt unwanted. And so, I broke it off with girl B and I have started to pursue girl A. \n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR: I liked someone in the first place, and when she didn‚Äôt seem to reciprocate, I dated someone who showed interest, but the relationship was toxic.

I understand the winter months are hard, and I have been going through some heavy shit that may be difficult for others to wrap their heads around and support me through. I don't hold it against anyone that they couldn't be around me or even really talk to me. But. I decided to move back home knowing I will get the support I need. I announced on Facebook to avoid both being a bother and putting any personal stress on people and to also avoid missing someone important in telling them directly. Well these two friends did not take it well. I have been 'friend dumped' by one of them in a very polite way which is fine, it was clear that she did not necessarily want a friendship with me so I saw it coming. The other has just decided to completely cut me out. Before if I sent her a message here or there to check in she would respond, but now she has put me on 'mute' and ignored me for a week. This friend has done this many times in the past, actually anytime I make a decision that she is not pleased with (even if it doesn't affect her in ANY way) I don't hear from her for weeks and then one day she'll just pick back up and talk to me like nothing happened. I'm pretty frustrated with this friend but I also understand how important it is to set boundaries with people and believe this is her way of setting them. AITA Reddit?",

I‚Äôm not the kind of guy that can go and tell people (specially close friends) and tell them that I no longer want to do something with them because I want to do it with someone else. So WIBTA if I choose to go with another person and break the promise to him, or should I straight lie to him and say that I won‚Äôt be able to go to the beach because I had complications and try to stay as lay-low as possible?\n\n#tl;dr: I promised one of my friends that already went on a trip with me not long ago to go again, but best friend wanted to go for a long time so I want to go with best friend and i want to lie to other friend because i don‚Äôt know how to tell him\n\n",

She's a wonderful person, and she would text me a \"hello\" every day for a few weeks after I graduated and I would respond with short conversation, and then she'd stop texting me for the better part of a year, and repeat the \"hello\" again every day for a few weeks.\n\nShe recently started messaging me again after about 10 months of silence, and I was in class so I did not respond. So she called me, which I let go to voicemail. I didn't respond after class either because of some stuff I had to get done and not thinking to reply.\n\nShe called me every morning around 7 am for a few days straight, and I blocked her after a few days because I'm decently busy and when I do reply she does not converse much. Also, being woken up at 7am a few days straight put me in a sour mood toward the calls.\n\nI also haven't seen her in person since I graduated. AITA for blocking her now?",

      "title": "AITA for getting upset about GF smoking in bedroom and needing the tv on to fall asleep? -Long Post-",
      "description": "*Sorry for an formatting issues, I‚Äôm on mobile!\n\nA little backstory. When we first started dating, I (27M) would visit her (29F) at her apartment and never commented on anything because it was her place and I felt as if she is entitled to do whatever she wants in her place. After coming over more frequently and spending more time there, spending the night and such, I did ask if she would mind smoking (cigarettes) next to the window and not on the bed because the smell of cigarettes would stick to my clothes and I am not a cigarette smoker. I thought this was fair and she seemed more than fine with it and actually said she felt bad. So time goes on and eventually it goes from her smoking at the window, to the end of the bed (near the window), to back to smoking in the bed again. I feel conflicted because I don‚Äôt live here, I‚Äôm in her domain, and I feel like I‚Äôm trying to control what she does in her place and I don‚Äôt like being that person. (Oh and she smokes roughly 3/4 of a pack a day.) So I just started leaving whatever I was wearing the next day outside the room, and it was working for me. \n\nAround the same time I also mentioned that I never had a tv in my room growing up and I felt like she has it on too much. She will leave the tv on all day and night (in the bedroom) and I asked if on every other night or so, can we sleep with the tv off, because it‚Äôs a big transition for me and interrupting my sleep and leaves me feeling like I didn‚Äôt sleep well. She said she needs background noise to be able to fall asleep, and I said I respect that, and I said (as a way to compromise) I have a white noise app on my phone, maybe you can look through that and find something you like and we can sleep to that. We tried it that night but it didn‚Äôt work for her. So we agreed to every other night we will rotate, not ideal, but I still wasn‚Äôt sleeping over every night so I was fine with it. \n\nFast forward to me staying over pretty consistently, I tell her, I feel like initially you agreed to do these things for me, but now we are back where we started where you‚Äôre constantly smoking on the bed, and always leave the tv on. And again she apologized and said I was right, but she was just so used to living this way, that sometimes she forgets how much it bothers me. Which I completely understand, if you‚Äôve lived this way for so long, changing is hard and can‚Äôt happen overnight and I‚Äôm trying to be understanding and considerate. But at the same time I feel like I‚Äôm seeing a little initial effort, but then she just reverts straight back to how she was before. And now there are times if I say something she‚Äôll get visibly annoyed because I know she just wants to smoke her cigarettes in peace in the comfort of her room. \n\nSo now I am officially moved in and am on the lease, and I told her, I really would appreciate if you could start smoking outside because of how strong the smell is and now I have all my stuff in the room. And she agreed half heartedly but she immediately made a comment saying, ugh I just wish we didn‚Äôt live on the third floor. Which I get it, it would be annoying to have to go up and down several times a day, especially if you‚Äôre so used to just smoking in your room. But I just think it‚Äôs inconsiderate constantly smoking next to a non smoker. And to be fair I do smoke weed, maybe like 2-5 times a month, not very often, but something casual, and she smokes weed and cigarettes everyday religiously. So maybe I am being hypocritical because when and if I do smoke I‚Äôll smoke weed in the room with her, but it‚Äôll honestly be like 3 pulls because it‚Äôs so infrequent I don‚Äôt need much. \n\nBut I just feel like she‚Äôs getting annoyed with me and I know she thinks I‚Äôm nagging her about it, and to be honest I think she thinks I‚Äôm an asshole for it. I was honest and upfront about how I felt, but now I feel like it‚Äôs causing tension between us. I also think it‚Äôs partly because she wants to stop these bad habits and she‚Äôs getting mad at herself for being addicted to it.\n\nAm I being an asshole? Am I being too controlling? Am I trying to change too much and should I just accept that this is the person she is? Or should I try and compromise more and find another alternative?\n\nThanks for reading and be well everyone!",

Tl;dr at the end.\n\nMy (31/M) girlfriend (32/F) got a new cat from the shelter last Friday having had hers put down about 3mths ago and losing her dog about 3wks ago.\n\nShe makes a habit of picking the LEAST desirable, worst tempered pets available as part of a personal crusade to help the \"less fortunate\" (Noble enough intentions, but ultimately to the demise of others since they can't ALL be saved, regardless).\n\nAnyway, I work nights pretty often in my line of work and it has been a busy time of year for us both so we hadn't seen eachother since for almost a week which is a long time for us.\n\nShe came over last night and we had a good, pretty normal night.\n\nWhile she was over, she asked what time I was working tomorrow (from time of posting) because she didn't want to stay over last night for the sake of her new cat but somehow her staying over tonight would be completely different.\n\nNot a cat guy, maybe it would have been?\n\nAnyway, today we're messaging throughout the day as usual. Until she went silent for no clear reason. Figured she must have been busy so I finished what I had to do and went to a bar near both her work and my house.\n\nShe finishes at 4:30pm (teacher) and I was there at 3:30pm just nursing a couple of quiet ones hoping she'd come too (a common thing for us to do when she finishes, my roster permitting). I sent a couple of messages in between and she eventually replied at 5:52pm saying she was at a local friends place.\n\n\"No worries\", I thought. I said she was welcome to come over anytime and stay the night if she likes. I have to leave early but she already knows she's welcome to stay as long as she likes.\n\nAnyway, to the crux of my issue, I got a reply at 6:25 saying \"I still need to go home and see Baron babe, I'm sorry. I would if I could but I refuse to be a shit fur mum.\"\n\nI replied with : \"Last I heard you were wondering if I was working at all tomorrow with the intention of staying tonight.\nThat's why I even considered asking.\nAll good though.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking that her asking if I was busy tomorrow so she could stay tonight instead of last night (because of a cat), and then backing out of tonight when I said again that was ok to stay over, is a bit shitty?\n\nTl;dr\nGF can't stay over because new cat. Asks if tommorw is ok. \nIt is.\nReaffirm that with little reply throughout the day (not normal for us).\nGet told hours later she MUST go home because new cat.\nDon't see the GF at all as intended.",

      "description": "First post on this sub, on mobile.\n\nFor a bit of backstory, my parents are both conservative Christians, and raised me the same way. My dad is infamous for his temper, and he tends to project his frustrations onto my mom and I - though I should also mention that it is never physical.\n\nOver the past couple of years I've started devoting myself to Draconic Wicca, and it came from the realization that there were things in my life that couldn't be explained in any other way. I started my collection from just a few gems and a wand that I liked, and soon I had around $300 worth of items for my practice.\n\nWhen I moved out of my apartment at the end of May last year, I made sure to have my items set aside in a separate bin so that I could store them in my room, away from my parents. I didn't really have anywhere else to place them at the time, as I started driving for Uber not too long after moving back with them.\n\nMy initial surprised came from noticing that my bin seemed a lot lighter when I went to gather my study books, and upon looking inside, I found that the only items remaining in the bin were my crystals, candles, and incense sticks. Everything else was missing.\n\nAt first I was mad, but I let it slide for a bit before confronting my parents about it. I found out my dad had thrown them all away, without even asking me first about them or even suggesting a compromise. Just pitched them all because \"Jesus wouldn't want those things in the house\" and that I was \"possessed by demons,\" meaning that I couldn't tell right from wrong.\n\nUpon finding out, a couple months later, that I had gotten an infinity dragon tattoo on my forearm, he sat me down and went into a tirade that culminated with him telling me point blank that I'm \"a Satanist, worshipping the devil,\" and that I'm \"doomed to burn in hell\" for turning away from Christianity.\n\nI didn't have the heart to tell him that it was because I saw Christians like him treat people who didn't \"follow God's will\" with absolute content and condemnation, that actually started my leaving the Christian faith.\n\nI no longer really talk to him about a lot of my more sensitive issues, and if I need something from him, I'll try to go through my mom, since she knows how to explain things to him.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong - I love him dearly and appreciate all he's done for me, but AITA for wanting to limit contact with him?",

      "description": "For reference, I have a common name, and my e-mail address is \\[firstname\\].\\[lastname\\]@\\[domain\\].com. The person in this story shares the same first and last name as me\n\nSo about a year ago, I got an e-mail congratulating me (by my full name) on my new car purchase. Opened it, and it all looked pretty legit. Thinking it was some kind of ad, rather than just calling the number in the e-mail I googled the dealer where I supposedly bought a car. My heart dropped when I found out it was legit. I called the dealership immediately, and after about 45 minutes on the phone, confirming that I supposedly bought a car, explaining the situation and giving the first digit of the last 4 of my social to make sure it wasn't identity theft (which it wasn't) I let it go and had them delete my e-mail from their database.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks later, I'm still getting e-mails from random places where someone was using my e-mail to sign up for. These e-mails contain the name, address,school, bank, phone number, etc. of this person. I've had my identity stolen before, so whenever I got an e-mail about something important like a bank I'd have to call the institution to make sure it wasn't my social security number on record. I call the person.\n\nMe: \"Hello, is this \\[name\\] who drives a \\[car\\] at \\[address\\]?\"\n\nHim: \"This is him.\"\n\nMe: \"And I see you go to \\[college\\] and bank with \\[bank\\], correct?\"\n\nHim: \"... Yes? Who am I speaking to?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm \\[name\\]. You've used my e-mail to sign up for everything I've listed. I'd really appreciate it if you stopped.\" \n\nHim: \"I just put down a generic e-mail freak, I didn't want the spam. Don't ever call me again you fucking asshole\" \\*click\\*\n\nHe seemed pretty shook and angry and understandably so. I mean, if someone called me and had all that information about me I'd be pretty creeped out as well. Figured him realizing exactly how much information he was having sent to a complete stranger would be a wake up call.\n\nWithin a few weeks I was getting 10+ spam e-mails a day from all sorts of websites. Most of them were easy to just unsubscribe to, none were alarming, and he didn't continue re-subscribing... But about 4 months ago it started getting sketchy again, and I was getting confirmation e-mails for for items/services adding up to tens of thousands of dollars. I had to check that these were just this guy being lazy again and not an actual threat. Again, it was just this guy... But I was tired of it.\n\nSo I got on craigslist. Went over to the free stuff section and posted multiple items (Chairs, desks, a basketball hoop, etc.) all with this guys phone number and address. Put on there to \"swing by any time, day or night, just knock loudly\" and \"If I don't answer, call me\" with the excuse \"I was in the basement and often had headphones on\". The posts weren't up for long, only about a day each before getting flagged and taken down... Haven't got another suspicious/spam e-mail since. Did I go too far?",

This was at least one month before we had the talk, so why the wait? Why didn't she tell me that she had told him?

      "description": "I rarely post on reddit at all, but I think this is the maddest I've ever been in my life and I need to vent.\n\nSo, my family is kind of messed up. By that I mean, mental illness and drug/alcohol addiction runs in my family. Recently my cousin was arrested for selling drugs. My cousin is 28, he's incredibly mentally ill, and addicted to some kind of anti-anxiety pill. He dealt to a police officer and was caught. None of my family wants to bail him out, I think this is understandable, he's gotten into trouble on too many occasions and we've decided that jail time could teach him a lesson. Not only that, but being watched over is probably the best thing for him as he is mentally ill and has had suicidal tendencies in the past.\n\nBut  my mom said some pretty uncalled for things about his daughter. She said that if the daughter was never born my cousin and the rest of the family would be better off, that she was an accident anyways. She said that my cousin was too young to have her when he did and that since he's so ill, he has no right to have children. She SAID that she wished the child was never born.\n\nI understand that the daughter isn't gonna have a great childhood, I get that she put a bit of stress on our family when she was first born (my cousin was 19 or 20 when she was born), but that does not mean her existence is any less valuable. It's not her fault that her father did any of this, she shouldn't be blamed for it. I love that child more than anyone. Even if she was an accident that child was the best fucking thing that ever happened to my cousin. I genuinely believe that the only reason why my cousin hasn't killed himself yet is because of her. I'm literally shaking with rage.\n\nSo obviously, when my mom says all this stuff, I get mad. So I say something along the lines of, \"Don't talk about Daughter like that, she's not the reason Cousin did any of this. He's an adult, he made his own decisions, now he'll suffer the consequences.\" She responds with something like, \"Oh, you're just a kid. You don't know as much as you think, stop acting all high and mighty. If Cousin was never born he'd be under less stress and probably wouldn't have his addiction.\" I didn't even know how to respond so I just walked off. She didn't really try to engage me after this, she just called after me and told my I was overreacting and being insensitive towards my cousin. I don't even want to be around her right now.\n\nI feel that she's being so inconsiderate, like, dose she not fathom that my cousin's actions are going to affect the child?? My father was an alcoholic for several years and landed himself in prison for drunk driving with my brother in the car. He was bailed out, but it still had such a great affect on me that I can't look my father the same way to this day. My cousin is not going to be bailed out. How the hell are we supposed to just tell this CHILD her father is in prison and she won't be able to see him for several years, AND IT JUST NOT HAVE AN EFFECT OF HER?! This is a crime against the child more than anything. She'll have to accept that her father is the type of person that they warn you not to talk to in school. That's terrible.\n\nNot only that but my cousin had a dog before he landed himself in prison. After he went it was left with his unstable girlfriend, who in the past has expressed her hate for the dog and even hit it. My family told her to take him to a no-kill shelter since none of us can take him. Which I don't understand. NONE of us trust this woman. She's stolen hundred  of dollars from us in the past, and manipulated my cousin into a worse mental state. I'm deathly afraid that this dog is just going to be abandoned somewhere, I wouldn't put it past this god awful woman. I don't understand why none of us can take the dog somewhere instead of that woman. My family literally lives down the road from an animal shelter, are we  just to fucking lazy to make sure this living thing won't be left to die or abused because of other people's shitty decisions?  When I asked my mom why nothing was being done, she said I was too young to dictate anything, and I shouldn't be mad at our family because obviously we're going through a hard time.\n\nSo am I in the wrong for feeling this way? Am I an asshole because I'm unwilling to blame a child for my cousins crappy life choices? Am I overreacting?\n\nThe more I think about it I'm not sure if I was pressing my mom too much or expecting too much out of my family, so I'd appreciate some opinions. \n\nI'm sorry if this post is badly written or hard to follow, I'm having a hard time thinking straight. \n\nTL;DR\\~ After my cousin is put in jail, my mom blames his child for his addiction and calls her a mistake. I get mad about this and tell her not to speak of the daughter that way, apparently I'm overreacting and being inconsiderate. My family leaves his dog with an unstable/abusive woman and I'm also mad about that. ",

MY apartment is definitely better, we both agree on that. We are in Russia, so spacing is weird anyway, but basically his room is also the living room. I have my own room. He has told me that sometimes his sister, who he lives with, asks him to leave so that her friends can come over. That's some context.\n\nSO he is out of the country atm and we are texting and he comes back in a few days. Out of nowhere he asked \"So can I come over on saturday?\". For some reason I really don't like how he asked this. First of all, I am a private person, and rarely let people into my space as it is, generally because it feels intrusive. But to me, it sounded like he was inviting himself over. My mom always said that you pretty much have to wait for people to offer their space before you can plan to go there. The phrasing of the question makes me feel like he is just expecting to come over. The thing is, I also have a roommate, but she is old enough to be my aunt, and I feel weird about having guys over, even if she says she doesn't care.\n\nAm I overreacting? I haven't answered yet, and I feel like I should let this go, but I also don't want to be talked to like this.",

After I graduated, I joined the group chat for coaches.  Fast forward a year, it's week 3 of build season and I notice the github account I set up for the team has zero activity on it.  I message the coaches asking if they need the password or help using github, and get a response stating they haven't even started programming yet.  I respond saying they should really get started and that they're behind where we were last season, which I considered a bad position.\n\nA couple days later the head coach calls me and proceeds to chew me out, saying I can't decide whats best for the team, I'm not there, I can't help that much (I'm in college a 3hr drive away), I need to let them handle it on their own, etc.\n\nI just nod and play along because at this point I don't give a shit, if he wants to crash the team into a brick wall I certainly can't stop him.\n\nMonths later I met one of the other coaches, he basically said he agreed with me &amp; that the team had some... issues occur between the coaches.

Now that day rolls around and something comes up. I‚Äôm not unreasonable, shit happens. That said, shit doesn‚Äôt happen 8 scheduled days in a row (literal). So it‚Äôs now been 6 months since I‚Äôve seen him.\n\nNow this wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal except I‚Äôm moving states in 6 months and am genuinely concerned that our friendship will die then which would hurt. It would also be at the beginning of a medical school journey so I‚Äôm not looking to add sadness to that stress.\n\nI‚Äôve brought this issue up to him on numerous occasions. He said  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd leave State.‚Äù And this conversation occurred about 2 months ago with no changes made.\n\nI also feel like a fucking idiot every time we agree to hang. I block of the entire day and then kinda dip down into a sad emotional place when the plans get cancelled.\n\nWIBTA for not investing my time/effort into our friendship? \n\nSome additional info - I get that people grow apart and friendships change. But he has made numerous comments about wanting to be best men in one another‚Äôs weddings. So I‚Äôm also confused on how both of these realities exist and this adds to my anxiety about the current state of things.",

As a part of the program we go on a 3 week international trip around the time of spring break. This year we went to Ukraine to be a part of local college ministry's American week. Turns out Ukrainians love Americas and for a lot of University students it's their dream to move to America. As a part of this American week we were meeting with Ukrainians from the Universities one on one to talk about their lives, our lives and eventually tell them about our faith (because we're in a ministry program, it's what we do). The local Ukranian ministry had these cool ways to share what we believed by putting simple symbols on a bracelet for us to wear, so during the one on ones when we got to the point of sharing our faith we could just use the bracelet. We could just point at the symbols and associate it with a bit of our faith. When I would get to that point I would take the bracelet off show them the symbols and give my whole speil about what I believe. Then, because I had learned that Ukrainians love to give and receive gifts, I would offer my bracelet to the person I was meeting. Usually they would be super excited because I was giving them MY bracelet right off my wrist. After our meeting though, I would fish another bracelet out of my pocket and do it all again. When I told one of my peers what I was doing, he went off on me, telling me I'm lying to people and being extremely immoral by making people believe that the bracelet has more value to me than it actually does. Am I in the wrong?",

      "description": "TLDR at bottom\n\nSome backstory: \n\nI (23M) live on the edge of my college town in a 2bd/1ba apartment with my dog. The rent is cheap at $630/month including water and none of the stupid pet rent stuff. While rent is cheap and the area I am living in is not the best in the city, the apartment is not rundown (nice hardwood floors, lots of natural light, the top floor) and the management company has been making improvements all year and are very responsive to maintenance requests.\n\nI got a roommate this year because I was looking to save some money to travel during the summer. Through the grapevine, I was able to entice someone (22F) to live with me. We get along fine and there is no drama between us, but our personalities and living standards clash on occasion. \n\nThe biggest frustration is that she wants a dog. She has never had one of her own, but she doesn‚Äôt even lift a finger to take care of mine (not that I expect her to), but there have been multiple instances where I asked her to let him out or to feed him to come home to an apartment smelling like poop and an ashamed dog. BACKSTORY DONE:\n\nThe issue:\n\nWe were looking for new places to live next year and found one that is closer to campus, more expensive, lower quality, and more expensive. To me, not a great trade off to where we are living now. We tour the apartment and a few days later, I get an email saying that I‚Äôve been listed as a roommate and need to sign the lease (starting 8/1/19). Surprised by this, I contact her and we talk about, I agree to live with her. I sign the lease,  it have yet to pay the deposits (pet and security). We talk about it some more and she says that she is planning to adopt a dog next year as a house warming gift. There is no additional pet deposit fee and she is refusing to split it with me.\n\nI am very frustrated by this. And am planning on telling her to find a new roommate to take over my portion of the lease at the new apartment and I‚Äôll just stay put by renewing my lease. I am also considering not paying the deposits, therefore making the lease null after five days, but that would mean I have to live with her for another year or longer.\n\nTLDR: roommate strongarms me into signing lease and then tells me that she is adopting a dog after I signed. WIBTA if I tell her to find someone to take over my portion of the rent with over 7mo before move in?",

He had no respect for other people‚Äôs things(he would leave trash and messes in someone else house or car or any place in general) he also was a huge liar in my opinion and I didn‚Äôt like that he lied so much and made others look like a bad guy in a situation that they weren‚Äôt.\n\n I didn‚Äôt mind him at first but then all these things started to show up after he got comfortable with everyone. He was also a very mopey and manipulative person too which bothered me too. John also used his depression to get attention from people which I think is a really messed up thing to do because using something like that for attention isn‚Äôt right. But back to the main thing. AITA in this situation?",

      "description": " This was last year, I was 14 at the time and this was the first relationship either of us had.\n\nBackground: me and my ex (let's call her \"M\") were in the same class in 8th grade, she was very shy and socially awkward and I was pretty much her only male friend, There were pretty big hints that M had a crush on me, and I also had a crush on her, but eventually forced myself to get over her because I was afraid that if we would end up dating I'd stop liking her (hint: that's EXACTLY what happened).\n\nHalf a year went by and M asks me out via a mutual friend, I rejected her because of the reasons I mentioned her and we barely talked for the rest of the year. Fast forward a few months to the start of 9th grade, me and M talk about the rejection and decide we should go back to how it was, it all goes well for a week, cue the AITA.\n\nI eventually develop feelings for M, and after about a day of thinking about it, I ask her out. It all goes well at first, but after 3 weeks or so I start to doubt if I liked her as much and she liked me, I think about it but don't do anything about it yet, a week later and it's our 1 month anniversary, I,  being the unoriginal guy that I am, ask my best friend for an idea for a gift, she tells me to draw a heart but instead of lines, it's all the reasons I love M, I think about it and wake up super early the day before to make the gift, I give it to her and she absolutely loved it, and it all goes well, for about a couple of hours. \n\nMe and my best friend were talking and the conversation drifted to me and M, and after a couple of minutes I realized that I was correct in doubting my feelings, and so I decide to break up with her the next day, not wanting her to be in a relationship with a guy who doesn't return the same feelings. \n\nNow, normally, this would be a normal thing to do, if it weren't for the fact that I gave her a gift to show my love for her, the day before breaking up with her because I don't have any feelings for her anymore, which lead to all of her friends hating me.\n\nAs for me, I think I was totally the asshole in this situation, but what about you, strangers of reddit,  do you think I was an asshole?",

I think this is a great idea i'll get to show her my room and stuff but she says it'll be awkward. It wasn't a no but I was feeling pretty mad at it and i asked her what she meant by awkward and she said \"well i've never been there and there might not be enough things to do and stuff\" and my mom got upset too she was talking to me about it and she said \"I don't get it, why can you come over and have fun but the moment you mention even slightly coming over to YOUR house she doesn't even have to think to say no?\" of course my mom was exaggerating but i kinda felt the same way. My mom lives in an apartment building, she owns a hair shop and is going to get a house soon but for now the salon and her kids are her priorities right now. Am i an asshole for being upset? ",

      "description": "this was a few months ago btw. im 17 and I went to the park to play some B-ball with my cousins. This one little kid who is my mom's friend's son was there and i hate him. He's very, extremely annoying, rude, and disrespectful. I'm 5 years older than him (He's 12), he would shove me and act very aggressive to me. Anyways, I was just shooting the ball and stuff. He got the ball and shot it, okay. Then i grabbed the ball and shot it as well. he got mad that I grabbed the ball (its not even his, its one of my cousin's) after he shot it and i got the rebound. We were all just taking the ball off the rebound and shooting it as we please, atleast until this kid came in, acting like he owns the place. he started shoving me and slapping my thigh (thats how tall he is lmao). I didn't do anything because I didn't care much, but then this is where i lost it. He jumped up, grabbed my newly bought ralph lauren hat, threw it on the ground and kicked it. I got so mad, i turned around and slapped the little kid. I didn't slap him too hard, but he started bawling. He was crying (kinda sounded fake) i felt like he was really exaggerating/overreacting. I didn't beat him up or anything, just slapped him. I checked if he was bleeding, to be sure that he was okay, and the kid was completely fine, not so much as a bruise. but he was still crying. sounded a bit fake too.  I just ignored his crying and went up, dusted my hat off, and left to go to tell his parents what happened. They started blaming me and yelling at me. Although i felt what i did was a little too much, I feel like they really need to teach that kid how to treat others. He doesn't respect anyone. I remember he hit his grandmother because she told him to get off the PS4. Needless to say, I haven't seen that kid since. but i hope he grows up and finds out how to be civil and respectful, or else he'll learn the hard way again from someone who doesn't take too much shit.

She lost her phones charger, her phone was battery low. So she was waiting for my charger, it was already in my phone. When my phone became full, she took my charger and went to her room but I don't know if she forgot or not but her whattsapp wasn't logged out.\n\nAfter some time, I started doing some work on my laptop, I opened WhatsApp too and I got massages from her friends on my laptop. She was using her phone. My eyes fell on them saying ''we got 1.5k'', I started reading and reading. They literally talked about all the things they did.\n\nThey didn't say who he was.\n\nWhat I understood from them is:\n\n\\- that he hit on one of them, she hit back on him and they started talking. She started making him believe that she is shy and innocent.\n\n\\-Her friends which are my sister and the 3rd friend started to act as if they are helping ''lover s'' to be together. they promised him to help them have a sexual relationship. They are 3 friends, all girls.\n\n\\-They told him that she is poor, that she lives far away from the school and have to travel almost 2 hours everyday. They planned a night and he even gave them an address. They told him that it will cost a lot, that she doesn't feel pretty and have no clothes, that she lives far away etc and needs money.\n\n\\-They asked for 3k but they got only one 1,.5k from him, they didn't go to him, so they didn't get the other 1.5k.\n\nThey told each other to delete everything just in case, they deleted all their massages. It was deleted from my laptop too.\n\nUNBELIEVABLE. I am shocked at how much those 14 year old kids can lie and deceive.\n\nWhat kind of an idiot falls for that for god sake?\n\nI am her older brother and her legal guardian btw.

He talked about how excited his dad was to be a grandpa and how we need to trust him to take care of our little one.

He kicked me again so I pushed him and kicked him too. Then I leg-sweeped him very fast and he fell on his back. He wasn't injured but he was sad and sat alone near the window.

      "description": "   There‚Äôs a girl who I‚Äôve like for months, let‚Äôs call her A. I hang out with her almost 24/7 and I have never liked anyone more. Despite this, she didn‚Äôt feel the same way.\n\n   Weeks go by and I continue to hang with A l, I enjoy every second of it but everything I drop her off I‚Äôm hurt that we can‚Äôt be more. She knows I‚Äôm in pain and we decide to take a break from each other (no texting/communication whatsoever) when I take a 4 day school trip.\n\n   On this trip is a girl who has had a crush on me for a few weeks now, we‚Äôll call her B. On the trip I hung out with B almost the whole time, not only did we hang but I kissed her, we cuddled, etc. \n   \n   She says she wants to be in a relationship with me and I said yes. After we got back from the trip (A has not talked to me yet) I get home and I think about the whole weekend. During the trip I had pushed many thoughts away, I wanted to like B but my heart was still stuck on A, the amount that I liked A was so immense. When B and I did all the things I said like cuddle, kiss, etc. I had been pushing away thoughts of A and I didn‚Äôt think that was going to lead to a healthy relationship and that I was going to hurt her down the road because I still liked another girl\n(Btw B knew I had feelings for A)\n\n   I decided the best thing to do would be to break up with B, this is what I said:\n‚ÄúThis relationship started because I wanted A out of my head, I wanted to be done with her. Even if she doesn‚Äôt have feelings for me, the feelings I have for her are so strong I just can‚Äôt handle being with anybody until my feelings for her are gone. I don‚Äôt want to lead you on lying to myself and you that I don‚Äôt like A. I want to break this off now before I hurt you in the future even more than I have now. You are an amazing girl, your smart, cute, funny, and (inside joke). Please don‚Äôt change, your a great person and I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm doing this to you. I‚Äôd love to go back to where we were before this weekend but I don‚Äôt know if we can. Hate me if u want, I just don‚Äôt want to hurt u more down the road‚Äù\n\n   A few hours after this A texts me that our break made her like me.  She said she thought about me all the time and those thoughts led to her thinking of me in a romantic way. (Just a side note, she had no idea about B so she did not decide to like me after I got into a relationship with another girl) We quickly get into a relationship. I‚Äôm happy, happier then I have ever been. But I have this thought in the back of my head that I treated B like shit.\n\n   \n",

      "description": "As always, it's much more in depth than the title suggests.\n\nAt the end of June my partner and I plan on going travelling for 6 months, and because of this we're trying to save every penny we can.\n\nAt the same time, my mum who is financially struggling and lives in rented accommodation has a spare room. I told her a few weeks ago that my partner and I would move in for the last 3 months before we go so that we can save more and it will help her out.\n\nHowever, this is where the issue is. I think that I was too hasty in telling her that we would move in which undoubtedly made her feel more at ease financially.\n\nNow that the time is drawing nearer, I'm apprehensive about making the move for 3 months.\n\nThe pros are;\n- It would allow us to save an extra ¬£1200 between us, which is enough to extend our travels by at least a month.\n- It would help my mum out financially and give her some company\n\nThe cons are;\n- The loss of independence\n- It would be an extra hour worth of travel to and from work everyday for me\n- my girlfriend currently walks to work and instead would have to get a half hour bus each way\n- I'm a terrible insomniac and my mum's flat is next to a busy road. This seems inconsequential to somebody who sleeps fine\n- We have previously lived with my mum, but moved out as it was fairly intense\n\nI'm struggling with the right thing to do.\nMore money vs. Easy journey to work\nHelp my mum out vs. Lose dearly held independen\n\nI've been in a really tight spot mentally and physically with being chronically ill for the last three years, which is finally getting better. The issue is, i don't want to sacrafice my positive mental health by looking at brake lights for an extra hour a day and end up miserable again.\n\nSo, AITA for saying yes to moving in with her and then wanting t go back on my word?\n",

      "description": "So I have this friend who I'll call F and I consider her my best friend, not because of her personality, but because I talk to her the most. (I'm a girl by the way.)  But I know she has better friends than me. (I don't really care.) There are many of AITA moments I have with her, too many, so maybe I'll write about them separately later. \n\nWe go to the same class. I definitely wouldn't call her dumb, but I'm still smarter than her, so I help her a lot when it comes to school. But I'm very lazy and I usually don't do my homeworks nor do I learn for exams except on breaks. (r/ImVerySmart) She's definitely not a nerd, but she still does more  for school than I do. So she is the more diligent one. And she always refers to herself as such, calling me the lazy one. And I always laugh and agree. \n\nShe often asks me to help her with her assignments though I haven't even done mine yet and I end up doing litteraly all of it most of the time. Same goes with group projects. She even a better grade than me a few times, just because I put more effort to her work than to mine. Though she still thinks she has lots to offer me in return, but I never ask her for anything. \n\nNow, from the other side. I always help her without a second thought. I never complain about anything. I say it's fun for me to do those even though it's not true. I somehow expect her to read my mind and hear me saying \"Stop, I won't say no, but this is not what friends do. I'm mad at you for not realizing that yourself.\"\n\nAITA for thinking that? \n\nAlso, everytime she gets a better grade than me, she says \"Wow, I'm better than you.\" And she might mean it like a compliment, but it seriously drives me crazy.

I realized that I wasn't super attracted to her anymore, and I wasnt enjoying being around her as much. It got to the point where I was questioning it so much, I decided to break it off.\n\nI decided to let her friend know about what I was going to do, and ask her to be there for my girlfriend after the breakup. I still care about her, and I want her to have a friend and be taken care of. This was a mistake, as she immediately texted her, no warning to me. That caused the cliche passing period drama that you see in bad netflix movies.\n\nI finish the day out, a little confused and pretty upset. I get the chance to talk with her, and we seem to agree that we dont want bad blood here at all. I wanted to be friends still, in hopes that we could still have a healthy, friendly, relationship. She said that wasnt going to be possible, at least not for a while. Fair enough, I'm not the one being dumped. We gave eachother our well wishes, and went home.\n\nEver since, a lot of people that I thought I was cool with have been giving me the cold shoulder and stink eye. I figured a few are just par for the course, but its honestly pretty upsetting, given that I was trying my best not to hurt her. That being said, it seemed like she wasnt expecting what i did. \n\nAm I an asshole for breaking up with her for something like physical attraction?

At first, Jane tried to force her views onto me by 'casually' buying me campaign merch and books about her ideology, plus trying to get me to go to protests and the like. She gave up on me as a lost cause (I'm a centrist, mostly err liberal on social issues and slightly conservative on economic issues), and turned to my sister Cynthia. Since Cynthia is 9 and my dad doesn't really care about politics, she doesn't really know much about it. But Jane did the same thing she tried with me: brought Cynthia to protests, and brought her campaign/political slogan clothes and merch. Since she's 9, Cynthia lapped it up. She also went further, since Cynthia and my dad are both Catholic (I'm an athiest myself). My dad never forced religion on Cynthia and she was kind of drawn to it herself. Recently, Jane has been telling Cynthia her religion is false, how atheism is obvious, etc. I don't really like Jane forcing her views onto Cynthia, so I told Jane so, but she got mad and said she was 'just teaching morals'. I think that's bullshit. Morals are stuff like 'don't be mean to other people', not 'here's what politics you support and what religion you should be'.\n\nAm I in the wrong here? Or is she?",

      "description": "Background to this tale:\n\nBoth myself and my girlfriend are bisexual and in our mid twenties and we've been dating four four months. Her last relationship wasn't great as she was with a manipulative serial cheater.\n\nSo I've always pushed for transparency in our relationship, and have told her several times that I don't care if she flirts with women, so when a guy that we both know gets flirty with me I naturally flirted back but gave her pretty much a live feed of the flirting. \n\nTo this she responded with teasing like \"he's adorable, do you have a cruuuuush on him?\" I was like \"yeah, I guess a little one.\" \n\nSo as the night goes on and the flirting gets more intense, but I'm always careful to say that everything is \"if I get my girlfriends permission\" to him. \n\nSo long story short she has work early, I'm not tired, so she goes to bed, and Im up and trying to find a way to not be so awake. So having been flirted with all night coupled with the knowledge that sexual relief always makes me sleepy, I decide to get one out and go to sleep. \n\nShe then decides to check on me and gets incredibly upset, saying she views that as cheating, and that she wasn't comfortable with the fact that I was flirting with him despite being playful and teasing me about it earlier. \n\nIt's also relevant to note that she and I did the whole flirting both self-touching song and dance in not one but two of her previous relationships.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here or is her anxiety from her last relationship making her unreasonable?",

      "description": "Recently (about a year now), I realized he chews with his mouth open very noisily. It got on my nerves and at dinner, my mom noticed me stressed out and tells my dad to close his mouth, which he does. This happens almost every dinner now, where he just ends up saying, \"sorry i wasn't thinking\". Even after he's done eating, he makes this smacking sound like he's relishing the taste, similar to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLP9mbCuhJc), but much slower. My mom, sis, and I have expressed our disgust at his table manner, yet it never changes.\n\nWhat really ticked me off though was a week ago. Again, he's chewing with his mouth open, and when my mom tells him to close it, he retorts saying, \"how do you expect me to eat food, melting it\"?! From then on, I started eating in my room much to my mom's protest, saying it's still the few times we get to be together as family.\n\nAITA for wanting to stay away? I know the saying \"you can't teach old dogs new tricks\" and it's a hard habit to change, and the fact that he does manual labor and comes home tired doesn't help, but I still despise it.",

      "description": "Heyo. So a long time ago, my parents divorced. I got to go with mom, while my dad didnt even get visitation after failing to appear in court. Dad never phoned, Dad never sent gifts, and even though I moved around a lot with mom, I kept in touch with Dad's side of the family and he still never made any effort to talk.\n\nFast forward to me in my late teens, I finally talk to him in a tearful \"reunion\". He's sick with diabetes and he's slowly losing his eyesight. Our talk is short lived as he immediately starts talking trash on my mother's side of the family. I decide to not spend much more time with him.\n\nFast forward to me being a young adult, 23-ish, and I've completely grown to resent him. He's sick and dying a slow death, completely blind and having to do at home dyalisis.\n\nI was struggling with finding a job and unfortunately hit my safety net, being forced to live with my dad's side of the family. Now I'm expected to help care for a man who never made an effort to look like he cared for me. He jokes about how I'm respectable because I'm not a \"flamboyant gay\", I'm just a \"regular gay\".\n\nNormally, I'd call this cut and dry, but, my dad's side of the family still obviously cares for him, especially my Grandfather. I understand the prospect of outliving your offspring is heartbreaking... but when my grandfather asks me to think of my dad, I feel too hurt by his absence in my childhood to even consider it. \n\nI'll help do a thing for my Dad occasionally, like driving around and being an errand runner, but I make sure I air my disdain for it every time. I know for a fact that I can get very petty about this. My grandpa chides me for not keeping an open heart, but I feel like I've already tried to open up once and all my Dad did was starting spitting venom.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I'll openly mock my Dad to his face, and my last contact with him I called him a shitbag and told him he's a useless deadbeat who is getting his karmic justice. He called me smelly.\n\nMy grandpa is hurt that my Dad and I cannot get along anymore, but it was my belief that we never really got along at any point in our lives.\n\nSo I'm mostly worried about my grandpa in regards to this question, but, AITA?",

      "description": "My house is basically testosterone central, and I‚Äôm the only person not ruled by it.  \nEver since our oldest son started puberty 3-4 years ago, every minor misbehavior has been blown completely out of proportion by my husband. He also can‚Äôt have just get after the child, punish him, and move on....he needles and provokes by repeating himself when commenting about what the child did wrong. It almost seems like he‚Äôs trying to get a child, that is ruled by his hormones, to attempt something physical. He also likes to try to ‚Äúhave conversations‚Äù about the misbehavior without me...if I‚Äôm not home, fine, but we‚Äôre supposed to be a team at this parenting thing.\nThe child is not innocent by any means, he has a severe lack of impulse control and is quick with his emotions. He has all of they typical teenage boy angst, and likes to think he‚Äôs intimidating and/or tough, and will raise his voice and attempt to get in your face if you call him out.\nTonight, it was a charging cord. Husband says kid traded out the good one for his broken one, child denies this happened. Child says he didn‚Äôt, husband gets loud (not quite yelling, but definitely raised voice) accusing child. Child continues to deny, husband threatens to take away and/or destroy his electronics. Child gets defensive and loud in return. I yell at them to knock it off.\nHusband comes back downstairs and sits down, telling me his side of the story, and getting short with me because I told him he was over reacting. So I call the child to the living room and ask his side. He gets defensive and is glaring at his dad the whole time.\nI snap. I‚Äôm tired of the almost daily pissing contest. This is the second time this week that I‚Äôve snapped. Tuesday found me screaming at both of them because the child lied about something and the husband blew it out of proportion. Tonight the stupid charging cord...I informed them both that the bull needed to stop, and that I was tired of the testosterone fueled stupidity. The final words of my speech were ‚Äúyou two need to quit fighting for alpha position, this is not a ‚Äòwhose dick is bigger‚Äô contest. If Tuesday‚Äôs little ‚Äòdiscussion‚Äô wasn‚Äôt clear, I‚ÄôM THE FUCKING ALPHA AND I HAVE THE BIGGEST DICK! CONTEST FUCKING OVER!‚Äù  \nNow my husband isn‚Äôt speaking to me...he didn‚Äôt say a word to me in the three hours between my snap and going to bed. Didn‚Äôt even have our youngest tell me good night before he took him up to bed.  I assume I bruised his ego, but my mental health is hanging by a very frayed thread.\nAm I the asshole for calling them out on their shit?\n\n\nTL;DR- Husband and teenage son fight over stupid shit because husband takes everything too far. I snapped and yelled that I was the alpha with the biggest dick, and that they needed to stop being assholes. Now husband isn‚Äôt speaking to me.",

I know nothing in the sink (except some of the silverware) is mine on account of me being sick all last week and eating exclusively in my room. I had been leaving the dishes in my room until I got together the energy to wash them and would do so.\n\nEarlier today, one of my roommates came and asked me if I could help out and do a chunk of the dishes because supposedly the other people in the house have (sink still looks just as full as it has all week). I told him no and that any dishes that are mine are either currently in my room and that I would do them when I had more time tomorrow.\n\nThis led into an argument where he said that everyone has been saying the same thing, that none of the dishes are theirs, and that it's probably a combination of all of us forgetting/any dishes our guests end up making.\n\nMe: Explained what I said above and how I knew without a doubt that the only things were mine were in my room and that I haven't had any guests over since this started so that didn't really apply to me.\n\nHim: Even if that is true, which not everyone can be right about the dishes not being theirs, you should just do your fair share of it to help keep the house clean.\n\nMe: I've done my part to try and clean the house before. I gave example of last month when I cleaned the entire kitchen (dishes,counters,floors, stove, oven, cupboards, etc) and no one else really helped, even when I asked, and the kitchen was a mess again within a week so why should I do dishes now that I know aren't mine. \n\nHim: That was month ago, everyone else is doing their share now and you're not.\n\nThings fizzled out here cause neither of us really had anything new to say so I just went to my room to do homework.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad about the situation and I don't like to keep bad feelings between the roomies but I feel like I'm in the right...

It seems to work for us but sometimes I do wish he was there to experience things with me. \n\nIn our entire 7 years together the only thing I can think of that we have ever done socially was ONCE we went out for breakfast in the very beginning of our relationship and ONCE we went to the movies 4 years ago (I begged him to go and he didn't enjoy himself). \n\nWe live in a small town that gets bad winter weather with not much to do. My bf just got 3 weeks off of work and we have just been sitting around the house - Im starting to get bored. Our little town also just got its very own movie theatre! I really want to go and am really pressuring him and begging him to go but he doesn't want too. \n\nMy constant nagging to go to the movies is starting to piss him off but I am starting to feel pissed off myself. I told him we could go to a daytime show during the week so that it is bound to be quiet.

Expect, last night I got an email from housing saying she removed me as her roommate. I was devastated, but thought oh maybe it was an accident. When I asked her why she just said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we should live together next year.‚Äù\n\nNow I‚Äôm out a roommate and I feel horrible. I feel like it‚Äôs all my fault and that I‚Äôm a bitch. One of the reasons I think she doesn‚Äôt want to live with me is because she was trying to figure out if a person could swim through cheese. I told her no and tried to go back to studying. However she wouldn‚Äôt be quiet, then brought our other friend over to talk about it. I did get angry telling her that this was stupid, her logic didn‚Äôt make sense, she won‚Äôt figure it out and to stop since I was trying to study.\n\nAll I keep thinking about is all the shitty things I could have done, I‚Äôm a blunt person and I don‚Äôt put up with bullshit or slacking. I don‚Äôt know I feel like the asshole so I probably am.",

Of course, I‚Äôm working, so we can‚Äôt do much besides talk on my 10 minute break. He has finals this time of year, I work fulltime, and have small school things at a community college. I know we‚Äôre both busy, but I‚Äôm beginning to feel tension just on my end. \n\nIt‚Äôs making me resent our roommates too. We both have 3 roommates, which makes it impossible to talk or do anything alone. Let alone be intimate. It feels like we never have sex anymore. I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I have to entertain both his and my roommates or tiptoe around them instead of actually enjoying time with my significant other. \n\nI feel distant and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being irrational. I‚Äôve told him I feel this way and he says it ‚Äúmakes him sad‚Äù. I don‚Äôt mean to make him sad but at the same time I need to feel like a priority and that dates with me matter. It was our one year anniversary last week and we didn‚Äôt do anything for it. I saw him when he came into my work, that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs making me feel like distancing myself, but I still love him. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "Hi. I know that this may seem like a post fishing for likes, but I'm genuinely unsure who is in the wrong here and I'd like to get other people's opinions.\n\nMy mother and I don't have the most stable relationship; it's been getting better over the years but she's still more of a child than I am which makes everything very difficult. As I've gotten older I've gotten more independent in some areas, and less in others, but I used to assume that mother knew best in everything, and, because of this, I have difficulty knowing whether or not I'm in the wrong when it comes to her, or anyone in general.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, I didn't clean my room properly. I am going to do it again, obviously, to clean it properly, but my mother is being spiteful and is angry at me for everything, for no reason. I have been struggling in school for a while, and I finally found a teacher that I like. She's a lot like me, very helpful, kind, and I'm happy to finally have a teacher that I can get along with. After a 30 minute phone call (I do long distance education), I told this to my mother.\n\nHer response was that of dismissive anger. She asked me what the teacher did for me to make me like her, since I can apparently only like people if they do something for me. I was angry about this, but bit my tongue, and decided to walk off after giving her what she wanted. She then proceeded to tell me that she was not impressed with me, not giving me a reason, and refused to continue conversation after that. I told her I was disappointed with the way she handled it, to which she responded \"I really don't care.\"\n\nNow, obviously, I'm probably not the asshole here, but am I in the wrong? I didn't clean my room properly, but is that really justifiable for this kind of treatment?\n",

      "description": "Ok, the title might seem a bit odd, but I couldn't phrase it any other way.\n*For context, we are both females*\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for about a year, and I really love her. I am infatuated with her, she is my everything. I don't think that I am that way to her, though. I tell her alot about how I think she is beautiful, how I love her, all that relationship stuff, but she is alot different. She kinda treats me like a mutual aquaintance, and by that I mean she doesn't tell me she loves me unless I say it first. I get it if you don't like flirting, I don't either, but I don't think you need to be super flirtatious to tell someone that you love them and care about them. Back in July 2018, we got into a heated argument because I asked her if she could atleast try to be more loving to me. She told me that she couldn't because of 3 reasons:\n-she's just not a romantic person\n-her zodiac sign doesn't allow it\n-she's not able to because she's too awkward.\n\nAfter that, we would fight about it alot. I would tell her that it felt like she didn't love me, and she would say, \"I do, But I'm just am too awkward\". One day, I got really deppressed about it and broke up with her because I felt like she was leading me on. About a week later we got back together because I didn't feel complete without her.\nAfter that, she got really weird about it. \nSomewhere in December, she told me she was asexual, and I was okay with it (being asexual myself). After she told me this, she started using it as an exuse as to why she wouldn't be romantic. Now we've gotten to this point. She has somehow friendzoned me even though we are in a romantic relationship. She posts on her instagram about her celebrity crushes and stuff, and I wouldn't mind that if it weren't for the fact where she clearly stated many times on her instagram that she wants to marry these celebrities, and is pretty much in love with them. I feel really alone in this relationship, like she really could care less about me. I've tried everything and have done everything I could to express that I love her (even though I naturally am a very silent, introverted person).\nAm I asking too much from her, or is she doing something wrong?\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My fiance and I live together with her two children from a previous marriage. I bought a house for us to live in. I get an extra bit of tax return because I get to claim the interest on the house. She pays roughly 70 percent of what I pay towards the mortgage meaning she pays less than I do. I calculated this based off our incomes. I bought this house. I paid the down payment. I paid for all the inspection costs, tests, etc when I bought the house. The house is in my name. I am taking all the financial risks. When something breaks, I fix it and I pay for it. I pay for over half the bills and I pay half for groceries. Keep in mind that I am one of four people living in this house. I don't mind the arrangement, but when it comes to tax time she seems to think that it's unfair that I get to claim the interest on the house on my taxes and get a little extra in my refund. My perspective is that I took the financial risk. She is paying 900 a month for 3 bedrooms in a 3000 squarefoot house that is only 10 years old. An apartment would cost her at least 1500 and it would probably be shitty. When we rented together I didn't ask for some of her tax refund because she gets to claim two children as dependents. Because I don't think I'm entitled to it even though I'm really paying half of what she pays to have them. Half the bills, half the groceries, I pick up the check all the time when we go out. Now you might be thinking what about clothing for the kids? Health insurance? all that! Well her ex pays for all of that. My perspective is that I have been paying 25 percent in taxes for years because I don't have kids and I didn't get married. Now I'm getting a little more back and I'm the one taking all the risk and she isn't entitled to it. She isn't the home owner. She can walk away anytime and leave me with the mortgage. I have also told her that in the event things don't work out between us I will sell the house after we both locate new places and that I would be willing to split any profits with her after I get my down payment back and all the money I spent on materials building the deck and fixing random stuff. I also explained that there wont be profits after realtor fees, closing costs, etc. So am I the asshole for thinking she isn't entitled to any of my tax refund? I pay for half her kids shit and the kids are only at her exes every other weekend and I'm not getting to claim any dependents and I don't think I should get to. It just seems like a logical argument to me. If you get half of my deposit because of X do I get half of yours then because of Y?",

I found a playlist of his favorite videos once and I'm mad at myself for even trying to find that but I can't get it out of my head.. like does he always think about that when we have sex, or what?

      "description": "So I've never really gotten along with my father, although I do try but he has attitude problems sometimes, or at least it seems like it. So for context this will sound like normal teen age behavior but as an example My father will come into my room without warning and tell me that he needs my help for a little bit, I respond okay slightly aggravated. Now I don't mind helping him I love my dad it's just that he never gives me any warning before hand, something like saying that he'll need my help later in the day, he just says I need your help. The only thing is you expect it to be something little like 10 minutes to help him sure easy not a problem. But what happens is every time it turns into hours helping him. Like I said I don't mind helping him but im a senior in high school so I have stuff I need to do to but by the time I get done helping him the time I set aside to do my work is gone so I get upset. So even if im doing something on my computer for work or maybe I might even have company over he'll still have me help him regardless witch is why I get upset, Or other times he might get mad at something unrelated and take it out on me or someone else vocally. To my father's side he argues that he has to beg me when ever he need my help with something, or that I never do anything to help him, the reason he uses the word beg is because of the way ill respond witch might just be an aggrivated ok or scoff. Him being upset over attitude I can understand but when ever he asks for help I may get upset and give him a little attitude but I've always helped him.That's about it sorry for the rant and possible spelling errors on mobile and first time posting to this thread. So AITA for being upset with my father or Is my father for not controlling his temper? I'd be happy to answer any questions on the topic for context if needed.",

I assumed that I wouldn't have to call after that and then I got a text from her saying I better call her. \n\nMe and my friend figured it was just an old text to help remind me ( which it wasn't ) and I didn't think to much on it. \n\nThe next morning I woke up and realized it was past the time for me to go home and when I got to the driveway carrying my sleeping bag breathing heavily and shaking in panic my sister was there with a taxi to pick me up. That's when it all goes down hill because as soon as I came in my mom was foaming at the mouth telling me how I disrespected her and how I was a b#$@ f{`. Cu;3 ( many swears later ) pice of horse $hi# and I should be living with my drunk dad and end up like a bum. Many middle fingers later she finally calmed down... In a hospital...

      "description": "Throwaway account because even though I blocked him on Reddit, he can still view my post. \n\nThis started about 4 days ago when I made an on r/MakeNewFriendsHere in attempt to, ya know, make new friends. About 20 minutes after making the said post about 4 people PMed me. After a few minutes of talking to people, it narrowed down to two people. I'll refer to them as Girl and Boy. \n\nGirl was really shy, and the conversation was really slow. We had nothing in common and stopped talking after about a days. \n\nBoy and I were having an okay conversation so we continued talking. I don't really know how PM's work so we switched to discord. After an hour of texting, Boy asks me if we can exchange photos (of our faces). \n\nI got really nervous and didn't like that idea. For past friends I have made, I didn't show my face until after several months of talking, and he wanted it in the first day of talking? I took about two minutes to answer with a measly \"Uh\". Boy understood and we moved onto a different topic. \n\nAt this point I was second guessing if I was okay with making online friends through Reddit (or even at all), I was getting really anxious and I should have stopped there. I didn't, and we talked the next day, and he again asked for a photo. I was hesitant, but I said yes and gave Boy my Instagram. \n\nIt is private, so I allow Boy to follow me, and then shortly after removing him as a follower. He doesn't respond for 6 minutes, so I started freaking out thinking Boy was talking screenshots (doubt it). Boy then sends me a picture of himself, and I make up a weak excuse to go offline and end the conversation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then block him on everything that I had contact with him on it and changed my username for almost everything (profile pictures as well). I feel bad, and think I was over exaggerating. I shouldn't be on that sub if I am just going to ghost people. I feel like an asshole, and I'm getting off that sub. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I the asshole, or was I staying safe?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "(Throwaway for privacy purposes)\n\nLast semester, I was having a rough time emotionally, mainly due to stress and sleep deprivation.  Towards the end of the semester, I started making some really strange and irrational decisions that I can‚Äôt really explain looking back.  The biggest of these was confessing to my friend Heather that I have feelings for her.  I do genuinely like Heather and get along with her really well, and I am attracted to her, but I overinflated the degree of attraction quite a bit in hindsight.  She was flattered, and admitted having feelings for me too, but suggested we not pursue anything since she was going to study abroad the next semester.  I agreed with her, and things seemed to fade out amicably.  Since we‚Äôre both part of the same tight group of friends, we kept this a secret from most of our friends in an attempt to avoid making things awkward.\n\nNow, this semester, she‚Äôs abroad.  We made an effort to keep in touch towards the beginning of the semester, but I sleep odd hours, so I generally go to sleep when she wakes up, and get out of classes towards the end of her day.  Over time, we stopped talking all that much.\n\nSeparately, my emotional state sort of stabilized, and I decided I wanted to start dating again.  I‚Äôve been on several dates with different people at school, and I‚Äôve been having a great time about it.  Initially, I tried to hide these dates from my friends as well, since I generally value privacy and didn‚Äôt want everyone to know.  However, I did eventually let it slip to some of my friends that I was seeing a new person, Casey.  I didn‚Äôt think much of this at the time.\n\nI heard recently that Heather had been crying a lot abroad, and the friends she‚Äôs abroad with haven‚Äôt been talking to me as much.  I realized that maybe she found out I was seeing other people and felt like I‚Äôd ghosted her or cut her out.  We were never officially together, and specifically decided not to date, but I‚Äôm afraid she might still feel like I‚Äôm betraying her in some way.  AITA?",

      "description": "So for some background information: I have a dog, a short haired german pointer. He's the sweetest, but kind of hyperactive around other dogs. And that plus being really really strong doesn't make my life easy. Our family loves him so much, he s part of it. Especially my mom who spends most of the time with him because we re busy with school, uni or work. \nAnyway, two days ago my brother wanted to go for a walk with him but somehow lost his collar and couldn't attach the leash to anything. He also somehow improvised and before he left me and my mom told him hundreds of times that he will break it or run if he'll see other dogs.\nOf course, because of his stubbornness, he decided to ignore us.\nAfter one hour he came back desperate, balling his eyes out. We couldn't understand a word because he was crying and screaming at the same time. Told us that our dog run away and because he's black and fast, my brother couldn't keep up or see him.\nMe and my dad went to search for him, while my brother and my mom called our neighbors to see if he stopped at their house (they re very friendly and kind to him).\nCouldn't find him so we came back home just to see my mom screaming at my brother. After maybe 10 min of screaming, I got sick of it and told her to stop. Nothing. Again, nothing. I started yelling at her because she was about to hit him and say the same shit over and over again, hurting her lungs at how loud she was.\nI never yell at my mom, never. She was shocked, honestly I think she gave me a murderous look after she left. But when a person loves a dog as much you do, the worst thing you can do is to blame them. Believe me, he did fucking hate himself after that.\nBut my doggo came back, with some rope around his neck, a sign that someone tried to take him. Sorry, not with this bull. My mom is really mad at me but I don't feel the need to apologize. \nAm I the asshole here?  ",

Lately we've been considering getting back together but I keep backing out because I don't want to get hurt again. \n\nSo today, I had one of those really bad days where you just go home, shove a pillow in your face, and cry. I talked to my mom briefly about it and decided to just cry the rest out. This friend of mine had been sending me multiple messages to get my attention since I wasn't responding. I said \"I'm just not good rn\". Obviously, this is ambiguous and my friend was very right for asking what was wrong. But I told him that I already talked about it with someone, I don't feel like talking, and I'll tell him later. He kept pushing and saying to tell him what's wrong and that I don't normally act like this. (obviously, I don't normally have really shitty days). \n\nI kept politely declining for some time (I just counted 9 times I declined without being insulting but the last few had some attitude). This is when I finally was just do stressed and upset I couldn't take him spamming me over and over asking after I told him no. So I swore at him, asked if he could read, said he's an idiot, told him to fuck off, telling him that we'll talk later but if he keeps being pushy I'll block him (I did on one app because he kept calling and asking on that one too), that he's genuinely annoying me by asking repeatedly, telling him that he's driving me crazy, and saying that the only way I can get it through to him is apparently by being rude. (This is everything I said, I went back and checked each message). \n\nNow, he's saying that I was being rude because he cares for me and was worried, but I did say I would tell him later just not at that moment.\n\n So, am I the asshole for blowing up on him while he was worried about me?

Now, I know that it isn't fair to judge someone based on a few things that I've heard from others, but I can't help but think that she's a bad influence. She drinks, she smokes weed, juuls, and my bf only ends up doing the same when she's there at a party (she brings it). She hooks up with people a lot (not relevant ik), and also smacks my bf's butt a lot in school (apparently she only does this to him too??). I've been kinda iffy about her, but whatever its his life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, a few days ago, during my bf's midterms, he told me about how she took pictures of a really long test that the teacher was going to let finish the next day in class, and sent it to him and another friend. I was kinda mad, and decided that this was the last straw, and that I really disliked Sarah, since I personally really really dislike people who cheat. I just think its really ethically wrong to do. Also, although my bf told me this is the first time she's done anything like this, usually cheaters don't start cheating with taking photos (kinda need guts to do that), so she's probably cheated like this before (just an assumption though).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater, he told me that he was hanging out with some friends later in the week, which included Sarah. I was still mad, and told him that I really didn't like him hanging out with someone who's such a bad influence. He agreed that she wasn't the best person, but told me that he was still going. I didn't tell him explicitly not to go, but did make clear that I would be pretty upset if he did (its tomorrow hasn't happened yet). AITA For not wanting him to hang out with this girl?",

      "title": "AITA For Calling My Friend Out For Being Rude To Me For No Reason?",
      "description": "Last year, me and my best friend of a few years (who i will call James) drifted apart significantly. I wasn't particularly upset at all once I noticed; this had happened several times previously with other friends, and I understand that it is natural. A new person (who I will call Amy) joined our friend group. I introduced my friends to her -- if that is of any importance --  and James became closer to Katie (keep in mind that their are no romantic feelings between us, except that he told me he liked me in the beginning of our friendship, and asked me out. I said no. James says he has gotten over it). \n\nAlthough he became closer to her than he was with me, I am now closer to her than James is. She admits this fact, and she is one to be brutally honest about those types of things, so I'm taking her word for it. Amy has (without getting too deep into it) several types of mental disorders, including anxiety and depression. She also has suffering physical health, as she has an iron deficiency and frequent knee pains despite our young age. She is constantly self-deprecating, as most of our friend group is. \n\nJames is over-protective of Amy. If she ever makes any doubtful comment about herself, James will spends minutes ranting about how she shouldn't put herself down and how wonderful she is. Sometimes he shows signs of aggression in tone of voice when he rants. IMO, it is fairly creepy, and Amy shares this sentiment. I do not know if the strong feelings James has towards Amy are romantic (though I know a relationship between them would be imps James has been unnecessarily rude and hateful towards me the past few months. He has made comments about my appearence, my personality, and other aspects of my life I am not comfortable sharing. He later claimed these remarks as jokes, but I am firm that in the context and the way he said them that they were fully intended. James knows that I am moderately insecure, and yet he still does this. \n\nFor example, our friend group has weekly get-togethers where we can hang out and just discuss things. At a recent one, another one of our friends seemed upset. All of us told her that if she wants to talk about what had made her upset, she can, but she doesn't have to. When James told her this, he said, \"You can talk to all of us about anything, except [my name], because she'll just joke about it.\" He said this in a completely serious tone of voice, and even some of the other's (including the friend he was talking to) looked at him in awe, also surprised he said something like that. Throughout the remainder of the day, he constantly shit on me for seemingly no reason. The fact that someone who I was once very close with -- and someone who knew my insecurities in detail -- would talk about me in that way was devestating. I was upset for the rest of the week, though I tried not to show it around my friends. \n\nNow on to the potential asshole-ry: Amy threw a party a few days after Christmas. When she invited me, I immediately asked if James was coming. She told me that he might, but he wasn't sure, and I told her that I most likely wouldn't come if James went, because of how he had been acting. My mental health had been suffering, and my self-confidence was at an all time low. She said she understood, but that she needed me to be at the party for mental support, as she is not used to having to interact with so many people. She offered to talk to James and tell him that somebody might not be coming to the party because of his behaviour in the past weeks. I accepted, as long as she didn't say my name, which I admit is a bit cowardly. \n\nThe next day, James texted the group chat and said basically that Amy had told him what she told me she would say, and that he had been talking to his therapist about how he was acting. I don't know if I believe him about that or not, based on that it doesn't really seem he's making an effort to stop, and it also seems he enjoys putting me down. I replied and said I don't have to suffer just because he didn't have his shit together, and just because we weren't best friends anymore doesn't mean he can insult me constantly.\n\nI feel insanely guilty about this. I feel as though it wasn't my place to comment on his state of mind, and I also feel guilty for not believing him about his therapist. James never replied to my message, but several of our friends replied and said fighting would just break us apart. I agree with that statement.\n\nIn case any of you were wondering, James did end up going to the party. I went despite this fact, and we kind of ignored each other the entire time. Am I the asshole for saying the things I did? Sorry for the short novel length of the post, I had a lot of information to give.\n\nTL;DR: My friend had been very rude to me lately, I said I wouldn't go to a party if he was there because of it, my other friend told him, he says something about his therapist and I say I don't have to suffer because he doesn't have his shit together. Am I the asshole?\n\n",

The first few times I've written it off as poor planning from me. Maybe I accidentally forgot that day. Then it got to the point where it happened more frequently. And I started to double-check the numbers eventually I asked to see the break room cameras to try to figure it out.  Once I was allowed to see I figured out it was a female coworker doing it. Usually she's really kind and considerate. But when I confronted her about it privately she denied it, and when  i told her I saw it on the cameras she got really rude. Would a asshole if tomorrow at work I made a announcement that I'd no longer be doing that because she is being inconsiderate ? I should mention it's her day off tomorrow. ",

People also know I'm a bit paranoid about getting sick, but for good reason because I seem to catch colds really easily.\n\nEarly this week my roommate started coughing and sneezing a lot, and being really haphazard about it just sneezing everywhere, so I kept asking him if he thinks he's getting sick because if he does think so that I'll go stay with my parents so I definitely don't get sick. He kept saying no no it's just allergies yadda yadda, but then two days ago it was completely clear he was sick, so I asked him \"So you're clearly sick\" and he said yes and that he didn't want to worry me. I didn't make a big deal, even though I was very pissed, I just left a couple hours later and now I'm at my parents.\n\nWouldn't you know it, now I'm sick.\n\nWe're pretty close friends/roommates, so I feel like I should tell him... Something. That I don't want to make a big deal about it but he got me sick and it's really frustrating, and in the future just be up front with me if he's sick. And stop using the paper towels in the kitchen to blow his nose. If I don't tell him I'm sick, he might never realise he fucked me over because I'm staying at my parents this week... Because I'm sick.\n\nI don't know if this is creating unnecessary drama/makes me an asshole, but it's a big deal to me and I'm very upset he lied to me and got me sick when I would have been a lot more careful if he had been up front.\n\nFor the record, it's definitely him who got me sick because I've barely left the house this week, I've just been scrambling to prepare.",

      "description": "Sorry, but this one is a little bit long. I was gonna wait and post this in r/pettyrevenge but my co-worker told me it would be a dick move to do what I'm wanting to do, but I don't think it is.\n\nI work for Big Corporation (wouldn't be hard to find out but not gonna name it) as a lowly sales associate. I've worked for the Company for 3.5 years, been in MANY different positions, and I'm ready to move up the ladder. I've spent the last 2 years training for a specific position, which just opened up. I put in for the position, but so did 12 other people.\n\nNow, when I say I've been training for this position, I mean there are days where I run my side of the store basically by myself at least one day a week. I can run the fish counter, the paint counter, the automotive counter, the sporting goods counter (which is my position. Also, I've already been background checked and trained in selling guns and hunting/fishing licenses, so they would save money on the background check for someone else), the GM pickup counter, everything electronics (including cell phone activation), photo lab, fabrics, etc. I can even do a lot of things in grocery, including the bakery, deli, and produce, and even online grocery pickup. \n\nNow, I knew I would need a leg up on a few people who might could get on the same level as me as far as being trained because these positions don't open up very often. So, I got trained on all the powered lifting equipment. Scissor lift, walkie stacker, electric pallet jack, and the forklift. A lot of people are trained on these however, so I took it one step further and got trained to be a trainer on all the PLE equipment.\n\nThere are three important things to note here.\n1) There is no pay raise of any kind for being trained on these equipment or for being a trainer\n2) You cannot operate the equipment if you don't have your license badge attached to your safety vest (and if I can't operate the equipment, I can't train people)\n3) There are only two trainers in the store right now: me and a guy so just got promoted to AM and is leaving in 2 weeks.\n\nSo, it's been two weeks since the position opened up. I haven't been interviewed and everyone else has. I've made sure I was in the correct files to be interviewed. Personnel and two other AM's have told me and even showed me I was in the file to be interviewed. Rumor is, they're giving it to a guy who has worked for the Company for only 5 months. No one can stand the guy, but he is buddy buddy with all the management, including the one in charge of hiring for this position.\n\nI'm furious that I wasn't even considered for this job. I'm furious that this ass hat might be my boss. Mostly I'm angry I didn't even get to try for this job everyone knew I wound be gunning for. So I want to get my petty revenge. So here's the plan. When the other guy who is trained leaves, I'm going to \"lose\" my license badge (I'm gonna cut that shit up into a thousand pieces in the shredder) so no more people can get trained. This will cause management to have to either go to another store and become trainers themselves, or bring in someone from another store to write me a new badge or train someone else to be a trainer.\n\nTLDR; would I be the asshole for causing my company time and money by getting my petty revenge for not being considered for a promotion I've worked my ass off for?

      "description": "In my company we have an inofficial teamleader who really, really has anger problems. She did go to a therapists about that multiple times in her life. While we were used to her being unfair and bitchy, about 1,5years ago she started to just make up lies and literally SCREAM us down over them... while they were straight up never true in the first place..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout half a year into this, we got a new coworker. She was a good friend of the owner and was originally only intended to jump in for an oversized project, but now she decided to stay. This new coworker asked us about if the teamleader would always go mad like that. We had a few discussions over that..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow about 3 months have passed already, noone really knew what to do. Then i had a project with said teamleader. She would literally ask me to things that were physically IMPOSSIBLE and when i said \"i'm sorry,i'm confused. i can either do this, or that-but both won't work..\" she would curse at me all the time, screaming at me to \"just freaking do it\" and run off without ever giving me an answer as to what the hell she meant. e.g.: She wanted me to insert a Picture onto a page, without cutting or deforming it, but wanted it to be heights x and width z - but these just didn't match the proportions of the picture. \n\nNow: New coworker and eldest designer (remember!!: she's the teamleaders bestie) and settled on ED talking to her about it since she was her friend. But she always kept pushing the talk farer and farer away, the project i did wasn't going anywhere, but i was being screamed at for not bending time and space multiple times a day.. At one point even so i again had been told ED would talk to the teamleader next week, i just couldn't take it any longer and kind of exploded and sent Screenshots of a) when i used her heights without cutting or stretching so width didn match, and b) the other way around. i signed the short email off with \"and if we could be discussing things like these in a normal tone of voice, i would be really glad about that. sincerely ..\" i know i was supposed to hold myself down but i kind of snapped and sent that mail faster than i could realise what. i. had. just. done. ....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow long story a bit shorter: Coworkers to this day are pissed at me cause ED was supposed to talk to her and i had NO RIGHT to say something like that. i was yelled at and called \"naughty\" (WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!!) by ED at first. and since then, everyone is kind of shutting me out. i have never been good with people, but i really feel shitty and dude i know i should have been silent but were you taking all of this?! and yes okay sorry i tried to defend myself and yes the \"and if we could be discussing things like these in a normal tone of voice, i would be really glad about that. sincerely ..\" was pretty f\\*cking obvious but what the heck was i supposed to do about the project failing?!...",

      "description": "  Hello reddit. This is gonna be a VERY long story but I feel like I should give you as much detail as possible so I can get a fair judgement.  I hope you can bear with me and my rant as I want you to see both points of view involved in this situation. \n\n First off, I am no angel and I'm aware of it. This all started  basically a few months ago because I tried to hide a text conversation between a former coworker and I. Basically she and I called each other babe and said I love you a lot. She was basically my manager for a while and we would mostly talk about me filling in shifts every now and then when I could. I didn't really mean anything since pretty much everyone in that line of work talks to each other like that (I used to work in bars and clubs for a long time, then I went part time until I finally quit). \n\n  I know I should have been honest with her but I  wasn't sure how she would react since we had already had an incident  where I let her know my ex had drunk-texted me the night before. My mistake there was to reply \"I hope you're doing ok\" out of politeness, then delete that conversation as soon as I woke up since I realized I had already moved on, I was happy, and I didn't want to have contact with her anymore. We ended it \"in good terms and didn't feel like a nasty reply or ignoring it was necessary. Well, my girlfriend ( let's call her Chelsea) found this extremely suspicious and got mad at me for deleting the conversation before she could see it and said that she didn't know what  had I  replied and what if she was trying to get me back? She didn't let the matter go until I blocked My ex's number right in front of her. Which I must say it was unnecessary since I know for sure I'd never go back to my ex but I saw where she was coming from so I agreed to do it. \n\n  Back to the main story. Chelsea and I were hanging out one weekend.  I picked her up from her house and while she was getting ready, my clever ass decided to go through unopened texts just cause I hate to see the little icons on the app. One of those texts being from my former manager ( let's call her Jessica) about taking another shift. Before I  could finish, Chelsea came out so I just put my phone in my pocket and we got into my car. We were meeting friends and they had sent us an address so when I went to check my phone for it, first thing that popped out was that conversation between Jessica and I. I tried to hide it by getting out of that convo and kinda pulling my phone towards me hoping she didn't see anything (stupid, I know). She didn't say anything at the time but the whole time we were with our friends she was kinda quiet.  She stayed over at my place that night but late the next day she just got up and said she was leaving when we were waking up from a nap. She looked really upset but didn't want to talk about it. We didn't talk until the next day. And in the mean time I had the great idea of deleting that conversation, in fear that she saw it and read too much into something meaningless. So, you can imagine how that went. When she finally told me that she was upset because I tried to hide my phone from her. I tried to deny it at first l, but I had no choice to  confess. Apparently what triggered her the most was a \"üòâ\" that she saw. I tried to explain to her that that was jus a reply to Jessica who told me she had become a gym trainer and asked me if I knew anybody who wanted to be trained.  I said \"I'll ask around. I got youüòâ.\" Chelsea, of course didn't believe me. We fought for about a week straight. And at the end she asked me to delete my ex's , Jessica's and any other girl that I \"talked to like that before\" of my phone. I knew I had broken her trust and I needed to gain it back, so I, once again agreed.  \n \n During the weeks after that incident, she became even more jealous than what she was before. We were mostly good but every now and then she'd plant hypothetical scenarios, ask me questions, and get mad if she didn't like my answer. \"Oh you're gonna go visit your hometown for a week? What would you do if you run into your high school girlfriend? What do you mean you would say hi?! What if she tried to greet you with a hug? Wtf do you mean you would do the same?! Idgaf if you don't wanna be impolite! You said she has tried to add you on FB! There's a reason why you didn't accept!!!\" She would also get mad if she called me and I didn't answer, even when I called back right away ( I put my phone on silence for work and sometimes forgot to turn it back up at home and leave it around the house somewhere on accident). This one time I tried driving for a certain ride share app company. She called me when I had customers in the car so I ignored the call, then, she called three more times and I started thinking  it was an emergency. So I called her back (customers still in my car) just for her to ask me \"are you working? Do you have people in your car?\" After I said yes to both she just hung up and I got a text from her that read something like \"THEN WHY THE FUCK DID YOU ANSWER THIS TIME BUT NOT THE LAST THREE? HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND! \" That was basically her cancelling our plans for later that night. And for the rest of the weekend. This other time she was at my house. We were watching a movie in the  living room and my mom was there with us. Everything was cool until I got a phone call from on of my close friends (a guy). She could clearly see his name displayed on the phone screen, she knows him and knows where really close. I picked up the phone, walked away from the living room and we had a brief conversation. She looked upset when I came back. When I  sat down she whispered \"why do you feel like you need to walk away when you talk to your friend? Do you have plans today? I  did not. It was a Saturday night and I wanted to try my luck with this ride share gig on a weekend night, which I had already told her. I also tried to explain that I was embarrassed by the way my friend and I talk to each other (calling each other hoe, bitch, and pretty much every name on the book playfully) and I didn't want my mom to listen to that. Of course she didn't believe me and we fought again. I can list a couple other examples but I think you get the point. \n\n I usually try to stay calm and keep my cool when explaining stuff to her, but sometimes I'm not in the mood for BS, which brings me to a few weeks ago, a couple days before Christmas. It was a weekend day and I decided to go to  a couple stores to get las minute gifts (including a small one for her even though we agreed not to get each other anything for economic reasons but I wanted to make her feel special) I was running a bunch of errands. She knew I hadn't worked that day so we were texting back and forth. I even remember I was the last one to text before everything went to shit. I had came back home and was in the shower when I got a call from her. I called her back as soon as I got out. She didn't reply. I texted her \"Sorry baby. I was in the shower \" I got an \"ok\" I had bought a small replacement part for my car, so I went outside again to try and replace it. After I got done. I called her back as I was giving it a test drive to see if it worked.  She picked up with an attitude. She was upset because I had been taking too long to text back all day. I got bothered and I said \"if you don't wanna talk to me, I won't fucking make you.\" She then texted me saying \"you said you were home. You were in a car lol. I'm going to your house right now.\" Which to me sounded like she was trying to catch me in a lie so I got even more pissed off. I told her \"I'll be waiting\" then I called my friends and told them to pick me up. Long story short. She showed up. I wasn't there. She called crying saying I was a piece of shit. And we didn't spend Christmas together. \n \n   We later talked, and this was the first time I yelled during the whole conversation. I told her how I felt. I told her I fucking hated her jealousy, her short temper and her shitty attitude.  I told her I was tired of basically being told I'm a total piece of shit  when I make a simple mistake. I told her I never cheated on her because I loved her, but I  was not willing to stay with her if she kept making huge deals out small little things. I told her I  felt unappreciated because I'm always there when she truly needs me. But the second I take a little longer than usual to text back or I miss a call, I get shitted on because \"I don't pay attention to her\". I also told her that if we were to make it, she had to work on that shitty attitude and on that short temper. I told her yeah, sometimes I went days without talking to her but it was only because she had made me so mad that I'd rather cool of  first cause I didn't want to say anything I didn't mean. She agreed and we tried it again. \n\n  About a week  ago I got a text from her \"have you been going to the gym with other girls?\" I'm like \"WTF? No!\" She said \"No what?!!!\" She wasn't happy until I answered her in a complete sentence \"No, I have not been going to the gym with another girl\" and added \"where the fuck do you get that from?\" Apparently this friend of her brother (who she lives with) came by to their house to chill with him and he INSINUATED that he had seen me at the gym and she ASSUMED that I had been there with someone else by the way he had said it. This guy used to have a crush on Chelsea and he even told me so himself.  Even her brother told her not to listen to him, but what did she do? She fucking listened to the fucker and called me to interrogate me about it. She wasn't satisfied and she told me to give her time to think. I called her brother right away since I new the guy was still with him and asked to speak to him. He took everything back and even went as far as to say he never mentioned anything to her. She apologiz",

      "description": "Sorry for the Wall of text but there‚Äôs a lot of detail to this story so let‚Äôs start off at the beginning.\n\nMy girlfriend(21) and I(26) have hit a rough patch in our relationship after dating for two years and it‚Äôs about sex. We haven‚Äôt had sex for the past 6 weeks and it‚Äôs really started to build up sexual frustration inside of me. She knows that this bothers me but doesn‚Äôt have sex just because she‚Äôs a little tired(even when she wants it as well). This happens all of the time and it‚Äôs usually me who initiates sex because she‚Äôs never been the aggressive type to start it. This really bothers me because I feel like I have to force myself into her just to get her into the mood but she reassures me that this is how she likes it. I feel uncomfortable with this because I don‚Äôt ever want to cross the line and go to far.\n\nAnother thing to add is that we don‚Äôt get very much alone time to begin with because she still lives with her family due to her culture(she‚Äôs from Mexico) so the time we can sleep together in the same bed is super limited with no one being there. Even when the stars align and we have the night to ourselves she still pulls the ‚Äútired‚Äù card even knowing it may be a long while before we get a chance like this again. So today I got mad at her for not having sex even when she said she was in the mood but just a little tired. We ended up getting into a huge fight about it because it doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs physically attracted to me anymore because the passion and all the small things we use to do to show interest are just gone. She doesn‚Äôt text me cute and sexy things anymore, she doesn‚Äôt grab my butt or whisper things into my ear anymore. It just all randomly stopped. I told her that I‚Äôm like any other human and want to be physically showed that she still thinks I‚Äôm attractive(she ensures me that she still finds me attentive) and then she yells at me telling me that I don‚Äôt respect her feelings because she didn‚Äôt want to have sex because she was a little tired (even though she‚Äôs having the urges to have sex with me). She then tells me that everyone would be disgusted with me for even having his conversation and that I‚Äôm an asshole for even talking about this topic. I‚Äôve respected everything that her culture and family have thrown my way from not being able to spend the night over at her place until we get married, she‚Äôs not allowed to spend the night at my place but somethings says she‚Äôs spending the night at friends to sleep over. Even then a lot of the time we don‚Äôt have sex. I try my hardest to except her way of life but when I bring up the sex topic she doesn‚Äôt understand that it‚Äôs incredibly important to me not only physically but emotionally as well. I want to be showed that I‚Äôm still attractive to someone else. She puts me as this pervert who should be ashamed of myself if anyone knew that we have this fight. \n\nAlso she has expressed that sex isn‚Äôt the most important thing to her in a relationship since the very beginning (it‚Äôs not for me either but it is important) but she‚Äôs always loved it and was happy to do it frequent for the first year and a half of our relationship.\n\nReddit, AITA?",

      "description": "For some backstory, of a very close relationship with a girl I cared very much about ended a month ago (call her M). It wasn't romantic or sexual, and I never felt like it needed to go in that direction. We we're very honest about our feelings and ideals, and our main goal was to be honest and straight up with each other. That honesty was what gave her the courage to tell me that she realsied that she just didn't want to have any close relationship with anyone at the moment(she has dealt with a lot of emotional about in the past, which caused her to lose her sense of self and her own independence), and I wholeheartedly respect that, even though it hurt me horribly. It still hurts me a month later, and I get anxiety attacks whenever she appears in my head, which is a lot. That's a whole entire story which I really don't want to talk about, so I'd appreciate it if people would not pry in the comments regarding specific details about our friendship. Of course you're still free to ask questions, but try keeping them broad and impersonal.\n\nRecently I've been trying to find a way to move on from that and get out of this depressive state I'm in now. I've been trying to be more social (I basically isolated myself after the friendship ended) and tried becoming a more extroverted and bubbly person, like I used to be. A week ago I decided to hit up a friend I had a few years ago in order to reconnect (I'll call her S) . We were fairly close back then, but I have changed a lot since. I was unsure about how things would turn out. While talking and hanging out with S was enjoyable and felt natural, I found that I would feel very drained and very stressed afterwards. Eventually, I decided it wasn't the healthiest for me to start making friends just yet, and it would be unfair to S if I forced myself to continue being friends with her. I told her yesterday that I didn't want to start any type of friendship just yet, and that I needed to come to terms with what happened to M first. S was clearly very sad about it, and It was clear that she didn't understand my reasoning.\n\nI'm generally a very independent guy, and I understand my emotional and mental limits when it comes to relationships, and I don't feel bad when I say I'm not emotionally available to someone. I'm confused to why S doesn't understand that, and I'm afraid that I unintentionally hurt her due to my emotional unavailability. Perhaps my honesty caused more harm than help.\n\nShould I have been more vocal beforehand? Should I be dealing with the ended friendship with M differently? I'm happy to answer questions and concerns in the comments.",

      "description": "So, sorry for the second post so soon. I haven't ever actually participated in this sub and didn't think about it until the events of my first post here.\n\nA few months back, I was sitting in the living room and made some joke about my brother needing to push the buttons harder to win the game he was playing. He's 10 and gets very upset very easily, and started being a little brat about it, telling me I'm dumb and that's not how it works, telling me to go away and that he's not bad at the game. I'm not replying, just laughing. It was some stupid banjo kazooie on the Xbox 360, and it was a really easy bit.  \nSo anyways, my dad turns around from his computer and asks what the problem is and my brother says I'm being a jerk. My dad takes his word for it and says \"stop being an asshole\" and I replied with \"I'm not, he's being a dick.\" And that's where my dad lost his shit.\n\nYou see, my dad has a god complex. I got grounded once for proving him wrong on State laws concerning legal drinking age, I showed him the .gov site and gave him the RCW number and everything. I got grounded for \"not leaving it alone.\" And this is no different. He thinks he's the only person in the house that is allowed to say anything bad.  \nSo he tells me \"go to your room and don't call your brother a dick.\" To which I tell him \"if you're gonna call me an asshole, I'm gonna call him a dick. It's only fair.\" And I refuse to go to my room.  \nI think at this point I should mention that I'm chilling in a recliner next to a glass display case with my mom's dolls in it. He tells me to go to my room again, and I say no. He grabs me by the leg and tries dragging me out of the chair and I stay put. He rips the leg of my pants pulling on me.  \nHe decides the next logical solution is to tackle me, so he does. He dives head first at me, still in the chair, and lands in my lap, hitting his head on the wall. He gets up and grabs me by the shirt, breaking my metal necklace i got from my girlfriend and tearing the collar of my work shirt.  \nHe gets me standing and I stay static. He drags me to my door. I'm not fighting back, but I'm not complying.  \nHe realized my bedroom door was shut, and if he let me go to open it I would just sit back down in the living room, and so instead he throws me against the door, cracking the wood.\n\nThis was my breaking point. He's broken my necklace, torn my entire outfit, and now he's fucked up the bedroom door that he made me paint in the first place.\n\n So I swing at him. I hit him in the jaw. I swing at him again, hit him in the cheek, and again, hit him in the eye then I wrapped my arm around his throat and started choking him until he was on the floor. He screamed \"I can't breathe.\" And I shouted back \"that's the point dumbass\" and eventually, my mom crying and begging me, I let go of him. He went upstairs and she followed. She came into my room a few minutes later begging me to just listen to my dad.\n\nI know this situation could have been avoided, but I felt, I'm 17, I'm nearly an adult, and he still treats me like I'm 12. I wasn't going to fight back but I broke. He's spent my entire life beating be. He used to spank me with his leather belt full of holes, or a switch. Then at about 13 he progressed to slapping me until my nose bled, and even once held me down punching me in the face, because I stood up while we were arguing and he took it as a threat. My mom was in the background of that one and said \"don't punch, slap. We don't need bruises.\" Occasionally she would try to defend me but he always threatened to put her through a wall.\n\nThe aftermath was that i had a bruise on the back of my head, he had a black eye and cut eyebrow, and his top dentures (he has a partial) had cut about a centimeter into his gums. He hasn't tried to pick a fight with me since, except for one time and I told him not to embarrass himself again.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for wailing on him? I know I should have just gone to my room, but with the way that things progressed, I personally feel i handled it well, but my mom acts like I'm a horrible person for it. I don't feel bad for what I did. He had it coming. I'm just curious. ",

      "title": "AITA if I get a little upset every time my best friend and his girlfriend hang out with me?",
      "description": "I‚Äôll call them Gina and Tyler. I love my best friend Tyler and his girlfriend Gina, both are very dear friends to me. I met her first in middle school and she was my first best friend and then Tyler once they got together in high school. I hang out with Gina almost everyday at college and I love hanging out with her, she was my whole world at one point in time. I don‚Äôt really see my best friend as he lives very far away, but we get along great and cherish the time we get together. \nNow the problem is whenever we all hang out together. Not just with me but also as a group with other friends. Since my Tyler lives far away he only gets to see Gina a couple of times a month,  BUT she also stays over at his place (he rents a studio apartment) for a week or more at a time, maybe once a month or every other. The longest she stayed was a month which was during summer break. So they have plenty of time to hang out and be with each other and be all lovey dovey before Gina and I have classes. So when we hang out together I really want it to be a group thing. But it always ends up becoming a them thing. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm not against them doing couple things like a kiss or hugging when we all hang out it‚Äôs just that they do it a lot. Every single time they always end up being lovey dovey and do PDA although Gina doesn‚Äôt really like that. Because she knows I‚Äôm uncomfortable with them being lovey dovey so  much so she tries to not do it. But Tyler says he can‚Äôt help himself. He says they they get so little time together that he wants every moment they spend together to be, well, together. Like last time we went bowling, and it was them and some of my siblings and me. And we were having a good time but then they started getting lovey dovey, like cuddling excessively, lovey talk, kissing, etc. It made the whole group feel a little uncomfortable, everyone was kind of glancing around awkwardly not knowing what to do. And I went outside to get some air with my other siblings and they stayed inside to cuddle and do whatever else. It‚Äôs like every time we all hang out it‚Äôs an excuse for them to take it as a date for themselves. Again I‚Äôm not against the occasional kiss or hug or whatever but when it gets to the point that it makes other people uncomfortable that‚Äôs where I draw the line. So that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt really like hanging out when they‚Äôre together, I love hanging out with them both separately but together is just too much. They do this with other friends too and I‚Äôm getting tired of it. So am I the asshole? Should I just get over it and let them be? I just don‚Äôt know what to think anymore.\n",

      "description": "So myself (21M as of the past weekend) and girlfriend (18F) have been together for 2.5 years. We have a really understanding relationship in the sense that we have the occasional 3 way (4 in total). We have agreed that it will never involve another guy just girls because im not comfortable having some other guy inside her, and she completely understood.\n\nLately, over the past 2-3 months she has rarely been hanging out with me and just going out with her two \"girlfriends\" which are both gay and i have had 0 issues with it, except for the fact it seems she always puts them before me... always hanging out with them 4+ days a week and with hers and mine work schedule we can only see eachother for a max of 2ish hours a day durring the week and instead of seeing me she leaves to see them. With that being said we have had barely any sexual interactions between the two of us, maybe twice every week for the past couple months she has hung out with them (this is odd because we used to have sex almost daily).\n\nKeep in mind I have told her I dont mind her kissing other girls when im not around as long as I am informed she is going to do so.\n\nThis last weekend I went to Vegas for my 21st birthday. We have had sex one time in the last 2 weeks and she never seems interested in kissing me at all, i almost have to beg just to makeout... the day i leave she invites her one gay friend over, which is not uncommon she comes over frequently, however they end up making out all night and cover eachother in hickeys, but just 2 hours before (when i left) she wouldnt even make out with me so im sure how you could see that would upset me a little bit. I voiced my oppinion and told her no more girls, i wasnt mad just it was wrong to pick someone else over me. She agreed.\n\nThe following day she goes to a party and makes out with the other one. So of course i was quite upset at that point seeing as how i leave town and shes all over these girls. So again i tell her NO MORE ANYTHING with girls, our whole \"swinger\" type phase is over and i just want the 2 of us. She agrees and says thats okay.\n\nFast forward to the next day, the day i come home. Her car breaks down and she needs her friend to drive her to work (the first one, ive also never liked this one since i have met her but put up with it for the sake of their friendship). I told her i was not comfortable since everything that has happend. She tells me i need to trust her she wont do anything. So i give in and say okay, she goes and hangs out for 2 hours then goes to work.\n\nI come home that night and we had been arguing a decent amount all weekend and had a good discussion about it and i was starting to feel better. We then go to sleep but i had a weird feeling so i decide to check her phone while she sleeps... something I have never done. I go through her messages with the first one to find out she has pictures of her grabbing my girlfriends ass and when she \"hungout\" before work she actually went to her house to cuddle... that broke me. completely. I went into friends #2 messages to see they have been flirting constantly while i have been gone. Calling her cute nicknames, things i dont even get called.\n\nAfter reading what i did i decide to wake her up to discuss my feelings. Tears in my eyes and shaking i wake her up and tell her that im disgusted in what she did considering she told me to trust her and i gave in to have that broken. I then inform her that i do not want her to have any contact with friend #1 anymore as i never liked her in the first place and they have destroyed my trust. Of course this didnt go over well. She starts getting mad and saying its my fault because i made her upset all weekend and she needed to feel happy again and cuddling her made her happy. I inform her of how i dont care and its either myself or her friend and she needs to cut off all contact and seeing her.\n\nThe next day she tells her friend everything ive said and she says her goodbyes. However since then (2 days) she has been constantly asking me when she can see her again.\n\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend hooksup with freinds after telling me to trust her and i tell her no more hanging out with her.\n\nAm i the asshole? Because according to both \"her friends\" and my girlfriend i am.",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last time I voted was 2008. The reason I voted was because Obama is black. I‚Äôm not trying to be edgy or anything. I literally voted for the president of the United States because I thought it would be cool to be around for the first black president. I didn‚Äôt understand his policies, his plan, or anything like that. I knew two things about him. He is a Democrat and he‚Äôs black. \n\nAfter the election, I kind of felt like an idiot for voting the way I did despite not knowing anything about him. The next time I had the opportunity, I really tried to look at both sides of the issues and think about the repercussions. The thing is, there are good arguments for everything.  I can understand why people want to be pro-choice and why people want to be pro-life. I understated that black lives matter. I also think blue lives matter. I think gun control is important but I also think people have the right to form their own armies if they want. \n\nHonestly, I‚Äôm so damn middle of the road, I don‚Äôt know how to feel about anything. At this point, I don‚Äôt want to make decisions. I don‚Äôt feel qualified to. Really, I just want whoever is in charge to tell me what to do and I‚Äôll do it. I want the leaders to worry about the big picture while I chug along with the small picture stuff. \n\nSo I haven‚Äôt voted since 2008. During the most recent election, my family got super mad at me for not voting. It wasn‚Äôt just one political camp either. Both sides. My brother, the staunch conservative, my mother, the dyed-in-the-wool liberal, they both tell me I‚Äôm an asshole for not voting. They point out people died for me to vote. They point out because I‚Äôm a veteran, voting should be extra important for me. But to me, it‚Äôs not. \n\nBut I feel like any vote I added to the pool would be nothing more than me going ‚Äúheads or tails‚Äù and picking at random. I think that kind of vote thins the legitimacy of the pool. Like my crappy, uninformed vote makes my mom‚Äôs or my bro‚Äôs informed vote matter less. \n\nAITA for not exercising a right people fought and died to give me, even though I feel like my opinion doesn‚Äôt matter because I don‚Äôt know what it is?

      "description": "There will be a TL;DR at the end.\n\nThe background: I was in the Marines and decided it wasn't for me, about 2 years prior to me getting out my wife and I talked about what career field I should go into. We decided I should try and be a Veterinarian since I love animals and love helping people. Since then I have been working tirelessly towards this goal and applied for the Fall 2019 semester for Vet school and have my interview there this upcoming Sunday.\n\nThe problem: The issue is I no longer am sure of my decision. I cannot help but think I should be pursuing medical school instead. I love animals, don't get me wrong, but human life is more valuable than animal life. I cannot help but feel like I am selling myself short by becoming a Veterinarian. I feel like it is more important to heal people rather than animals. I feel like being a person doctor would give me a greater sense of purpose and self-accomplishment. I understand the schooling for both is hard and competitive but I am confident I could do either (yeah I know r/iamverysmart). \n\nMy wife thinks I should pursue Vet school still because going to Medical school would require at least an additional 2 years onto schooling, not to include the longer residencies that are required to be a human doctor. We agreed to wait until I was in my career to try and have kids, it's just not financially possible while I am going to school. Having kids is super important to her and so I can understand why she wants me to complete school as soon as possible and begin my career but I just feel like I am selling myself short and could help so many more people being a human doctor.\n\nYour Verdict: So would I be the asshole if I decided to abandon my Veterinary school plans and begin pursuing medical school instead even though my wife and I agreed I would be a Vet. This would prolong our plans on having kids by at least 4 extra years, (I would be in my mid-late thirties after medical school). This decision affects both of us greatly, our time, money, stress, and lifestyle will all be greatly impacted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My wife and I both decided I would become a veterinarian. After working so hard and even having an interview at a Vet school I feel as though I am not living up to my full potential. I think I could become a human doctor and go to medical school, this would give me more satisfaction and purpose but my wife and I decided not to have kids until I was in my career (having kids is the most important thing to her). Would I be the asshole if I decided to add on at least 4 more years of schooling and residency to become a human doctor? ",

      "title": "AITA for not feeling bad that my father was in a car accident?",
      "description": "So today I received a call from my mom that my father had been in a car accident. My mom and father have been divorced since I was about 6 or 7, currently 26. My mom remarried when I was 8, then we moved to a different state. My father also moved to a different state so I would only see him every other summer, sometimes during Christmas break back when I was in school. So suffice to say he's been in my life but not as a major role model.\n\nSo bringing this up to speed recently I attended my cousin's wedding this passed summer, which was also the same weekend as my father's 50th birthday. Pretty much our entire family showed up back in our home state, minus my father. Which he gave a very poor excuse for not showing up and the whole family was disappointed, even his own mother was furious since it's his sister's daughter. We all worked had to plan a surprise for him only to find out 48 hrs before the wedding he wouldn't be there. Bare in mind the wedding date was announced a full year before actually happening, plenty of time to prep for this trip.\n\nHe is now trying to invite my sister and I to his wedding to a woman who he only met within the last 8 months. My sister wants no part in this due to the fact that the past 2 years worth of birthdays/Christmas for my niece and nephew, they didn't receive anything from our father, not even a phone call. She called him out on this after finding out he didn't go for the wedding, which she couldn't make it just due to financial issues, and his excuse was \"a phone works both ways\", so she's expected to call him  on their birthday to talk to him? It has been 3 years since he last called me, I called him out on this and the wedding/his own birthday. He promised we would talk more, still nothing, not even a text.\n\nTo further the issue why I don't feel as bad is he is marrying the same woman who, while my sister was calling him out for not keeping contact with his own grandchildren, decided to take the phone from our father and tell her that if she was our mother she would have slapped my sister on the mouth for talking to our father like that. She is only 5 years older than my sister, and has not even met either of us yet. He seems more concerned with her children than his own flesh and blood. This is why I won't be attending his wedding.\n\nI still care about him, he is my father and I wouldn't want to see him hurt, but I just don't feel as bad as I think I should for him getting in a car accident. Does this make me an asshole?",

      "description": " Me, my girlfriend, my friend, and his wife had dinner at a restaurant.The bill came up to 150$ (incl. tip). I had a 200$ bill so my friend said I should pay, take the change and he'll give me his part of the bill.\n\nHe calculated 60$ and gave me the money, I didn't think much of it until recently, when I thought about what we've ordered:\n\nAll of our dishes cost pretty much the same, we've all had a glass of wine, but they've also ordered coffee and dessert, meaning that there's no way that I should have paid more than them (150-60=90).\n\nI called him up and told him \"hey it's rather silly but I think we've miscalculated the bill\" and proceeded with the explanation. He summed it up with \"I've probably didn't include the tip..It's probably around 10$ so I'll give it to you when we see each other, have to go\".\n\nIt's not 10$. It's 30$...The same day we had to talk again about some work-related stuff. I told him \"hey listen about the bill...I think it's mo...\" he cuts me and says \"are you still on it?? I told you I'll pay you back\". I told him it's Ok but it's more than 10$.\n\nHe said \"No way. Ok, let's calculate it if you're so worried...(opens online menu)\" -- I told him \"I'm not worried. I just found it strange that you guys ordered more and I'm the one who ended up paying more\".\n\nSo we've calculated it, and I was correct. My bill came up to 63$ incl. tip...he said \"I don't know how it happened. The extras we've ordered cost nothing...ok I'll give you 30$\" in a rather condescending voice.\n\nI felt like a big douche so I said \"Don't give me money. Coffee and donuts are on you next time\". Even though I'm pretty sure he'll \"forget\" about it.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

We were having a big argument about something that I don't even remember anymore. She had a piece of paper (I think from our son's school), and I asked to see it, but she said that she wanted to read it to me instead of having me see it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe held it up in the air away from me. She's in a wheelchair, so I could reach it. I tried to, but she kept pulling out of my reach. I grabbed the wrist that held it, and pulled the paper away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I grabbed it, I grabbed it firmly so she couldn't pull it away. She told me later that it had hurt, and I was shocked. I already knew that any kind of physical restraint was bad, but pain made it worse. There was no bruising.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was shocked at my own actions, and cried and apologized, and promised to never do it again. It's been a year, and I haven't. I've done therapy for anger problems in that time, on my own initiative, and started attending a church to get my life in order. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone says that a man that touches you once will do it again.

      "description": "Wall-o-text here. But don't worry, Tl:Dr at bottom.\n\nSo last night I come in the front door from work and I immediately smell dog poop. My wife is sitting on the floor spraying febreeze on the rug.(she had already cleaned up the poop) I take a couple steps and feel something squish. Apparently she stepped in the poop when she came in and track some of it while going to get paper towels. So I stop and take off my shoes and start walking to the bathroom to rinse them off in the tub. A couple steps later I step in more poop this time with bear feet. It was in the shape of the wifes footprint so it was another track. I let out a Low key \"WTF\" and hop to the bathroom. ( I did it in a way that was supposed to convey that I wasn't saying wtf to her, just the situation)\n\nAfter washing my feet and shoes I come back out to see if I can help. It's mostly done now my wife is getting the last of it. I thank her for cleaning up. I had brought home dinner so I started setting that up so she could eat when she finished. \n\nSo we're sitting down eating dinner in front of the TV when the other dog jumps up on the couch next to me. All the sudden I get another wave of poop smell in my face. I realize that this dog has also stepped in the poop and had it stuck between her toes and was now rubbing on the couch and me. Not the dogs fault they don't know any better. But I command her off the couch and get up to take her to the tub. At this point I'm pretty pissed. \n\nMy wife said something along the lines of, \"Wtf is wrong with you?\". I'm thinking that maybe she thinks I'm mad at her. I tell her \"I'm not mad at you it's just the situation, there's like poop everywhere\"\n\nShe responds \"so what, it's just poop, its funny\". \nThis kind of startles me. \"It's not funny it's disgusting I don't want to be covered in poop\" I reiterate that I don't think it's her fault I'm not trying to blame her. \n\nFrom there it devolves into an argument about how I get irrationally angry over little stuff. This part is true. If I'm working on a project and hit a roadblock I will get angry. I don't take it out on her or anything but I will sometimes swear at the thing I'm working on. There was one time that she brought up where I went full primal scream on the Margaritaville machine. Again though I was in a different room screaming at the machine not her. still dumb to scream at the machine but who does it hurt?\n\n She says that my anger is a trigger for her that makes her angry.  I think that this situation justified getting angry and I should be allowed to express that anger. I got over the poop thing pretty quickly but we continue to argue because I was upset at how angry she got at me.  I mean she was so furious that I was kind of uneasy like she was going to hit me or throw something. which has only ever happened when she gets like super saiyan angry. I didn't think anything I did was that bad to warrant it this time. \n\n\nTl:Dr disagreement about whether or not poop is funny and if someone is justified in getting angry for stepping in poop multiple times.",

      "title": "AITA for not repaying back gifted money when I said once that I would? (long post with TL;DR)",
      "description": "So this a story about my (M25) ex-gf (F22-23). \n\nTL;DR at the end\n\nAdditional context can be found in my post history \n\nLong story short, I went out with a local girl from my area for around 5 months, one of which I was away on several conference trips. I'm a busy PhD student in their final year of study (known as the write-up year) and she works part-time in a bank as an assistant. We had a lot in common and met over Tinder. There was an incredible spark between us, until the day we started to officially date. That's when things got tricky and she changed quite a lot. \n\nWith my trips away, she started to become very insecure and upset at how busy I was; how I was neglecting her and treating her as a part-time girlfriend (you can read up about this in my post history), despite originally being proud of my achievements and professional trajectory. \n\nIn the middle of one of my trips, we got into a horrible argument that lasted a few hours, and ended with her offering me ¬£70 to enjoy my trip and treat myself. At first I declined, as this amount seemed way too high for the gesture and for the fact we had just had an argument. She insisted and put it into my account anyway. I obliged and took myself to dinner and to see a performance with a live orchestra. Having spent most of the day at the conference and the evening busy, I went straight to bed and sent her a few messages before we said goodnight. As usual, this was not enough. She was only really happy if we had 'proper' conversations that lasted more than an hour. \n\nIt turns out that she was very not okay with that fact that I didn't update her enough after treating myself. We had another phone call the following day and I was accused of being ignorant, ungrateful, disrespectful and negligent. I apologised after some hesitation at first, because I thought that I had a legitimate reason to not want to have long calls at the end of the day, as I was genuinely exhausted and in a hostel. I had to be out of bed in the common area if we wanted to talk. This argument eventually concluded with us both regretting sending and receiving the money. The original idea had been tainted. I offered her the ¬£70 back but she refused; just acknowledged that I had ruined her gift. Two weeks later it was my birthday and she gifted me ¬£20, followed by another present \n\nFast forward a month, and things are very rocky. Arguments are more than frequent, and the relationship is awkward and miserable. She starts to notice I don't say \"I love you\" back to her anymore and that we weren't as intimate. I was checking out emotionally. During this stage, my friends and colleagues say that I went through a stage of emotional abuse. Her (aggressive) demands for my attention had become that frequent, that I was finding myself not working or making progress with my PhD because she was constantly making me choose between her or my thesis. I chose her more often than I should have because I don't deal well with violence and especially shouting. If we spent too much time not talking, texting, or meeting up, she would go on endless rants. Life was easier if I just followed. I no longer had the emotional energy to stand up for myself because it never got me anywhere. We broke up shortly after. I told her after an argument that I didn't love her anymore. I didn't bring up the fact that I felt emotionally abused. I just wanted to be out of her life, and her out of mine.\n\nReaders may be wondering why I'm making this thread. Well, a few weeks before I left for my trips, I was going to be paid by the University I am doing research for, in order to fund these trips. The payment was due in July but for a series of unfortunate administrative problems was postponed until September. My ex-gf offered me some money to borrow so I didn't starve, and having set up a payment plan, I accepted. I borrowed ¬£300 for her in June with the idea that I would pay her straight back in July when the payment came through. When we found out that the payment would be delayed until September, she said it was okay. Annoyed, but okay with it. \n\nWe broke up shortly after my birthday in late August, and I had taken a Leave of Absence from the PhD because I didn't have a routine and wasn't mentally there to make good progress. The breakup, while necessary, was just too much. Adding to this, my money was very low as a result of the delayed payment. I had been expecting and planned out the rest of the year's budget with this money in mind. I got a part-time job and tried to make things okay in any way I could, but I still owed my gf the ¬£300. \n\nSo, I send an email to the funders and ask for a confirmation of when this money will be coming in. It turns out that because I took the Leave of Absence, I am no longer eligible for the grant money and I had to wait until I was officially back from Leave. Had I have known this, I wouldn't have taken the LoA until I had received the payment. I had no money and a part-time job that paid a month in arrears. Things weren't good, and I still owed my ex the ¬£300. \n\nSo, now I send my ex a message saying that the payment would be now delayed until January/February when I came back from Leave. She knew I was going to take one, as she saw how stressed out I was. She just never thought or knew that she was a big contributor in all of this. This was my business and I didn't want her to feel bad, I guess. She took the news about the delayed payment quite well. She was angry at first, but I sent her the confirmation emails and all official correspondence. I offered to pay her in monthly, but smaller, instalments, but she rejected this idea and preferred I pay her in a lump sum. I mentioned that my current financial situation wouldn't allow me to be able to do that until I had received my grant in Jan/Feb of the following year. If dates are unclear, this would be around 6-7 months after her loaning me the money. At this point I have to admit that she's been not only kind enough to lend me this money, but also patient enough to wait for me to pay it back several months after we had originally agreed. \n\nWell, two months after we broke up. She got in touch with me randomly and demanded I give her back the ¬£90 of gifted money, in addition to the previously agreed ¬£300. To avoid another argument, I agreed. I said that I wasn't comfortable with the fact that she was essentially asking back money that was previously gifted. She said that it was only fair due to how soon after giving me the money we broke up. We ended the conversation and I didn't hear from her until the other day. \n\nShe again messages me out of the blue and aggressively asks for her money back (the ¬£300). I say that I'd pay her the money in Jan/Feb as we had agreed. Again, she is angry and we argue. She says that I said that she'd have the money back in January, and since it was the 11th of January, I should have it by now. I forwarded her the confirmation of payment emails and said that I was unable to offer the full amount until I was paid. I reminded her that she rejected a payment in instalments, but she was fixed on the idea that she should have it now. I understand her point of view. At this point she has no faith that she is getting the money. It has been postponed twice and now I'm her ex. It's not a situation either of us wants to be in. \n\nWe argue some more and she tells me that I shouldn't have seen the payment date as the last deadline, and that I had other avenues to pay her back, like sell my motorbike, ask for family loans, or take one of those emergency payday loans. She argues that I have a personal responsibility to pay her back, and she has waited long enough. I declined all of these as said that paying her back wasn't a priority of mine since we had an agreement that I would pay her the day I got the grant money, and would pay her off in one lump sump. She wants to know the exact date I would pay her, so I email my funders and ask for an updated date as I am desperately in need of this money myself. The office gets back to me and confirms that I will have the payment on the 5th of February. I immediately send this to her, and she calls me. \n\nShe shouts down the phone screaming that the situation is unacceptable, followed by a chain of insults. I don't reciprocate. I never do. She also finds that annoying. I hate conflict. Right there and then I offer her to pay half of the owed amount, so that she knew that I was at least taking this seriously. She agrees and we call it a day. I pay her half of the amount owed. \n\n20 minutes later I receive a text from an unknown number (turns out to be her older sister) saying that if I don't pay back the full amount (i.e. the ¬£90) she would be calling the police for theft and they would be contacting my university to make a complaint about my character. \n\nI didn't reply and contacted my supervisors immediately. I sent a message to my ex telling her to forget about the ¬£90 as I had no legal obligation to repay her as it was gifted, and that is she was not happy with that, that I will deduct the entire ¬£90 from a ¬£120 phone bill to her number while I was in New Zealand (that she didn't know about and wasn't going to know about it either).   \n\n\nI sent her a final message saying that I would no longer be accepting any form of communication from her and her family, and that she would get the last payment on the 5th of February (not the ¬£90). We haven't spoken since.   \n\n\nSo, reddit, IATA for: \n\n\\- Saying I'd give my ex-gf back ¬£90 in gifts that she had given me during the relationship, and then taking that offer back when I was threatened with her sister going to the police and defaming me professionally\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "description": "Background: I‚Äôm (21F) and a college student that‚Äôs currently on winter break. I haven‚Äôt seen my family since the beginning of last semester which was about a few months ago. My girlfriend (26F) graduated college two semesters ago and is now working. We‚Äôve been together for about 10 months. \n\nSo my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt really have any friends that remained in our city after they graduated and her mom just moved into another state for a new job. She was devastated that her mom moved away because they have an unusually close relationship and she doesn‚Äôt have any other family or friends that‚Äôs she‚Äôs close to. Shes told me before that she doesn‚Äôt have really anybody except for me that‚Äôs keeping her in the city. This holiday she was unable to visit her mother because of her job and spent it alone because she didn‚Äôt have anyone in our college town. (I live about 6 hours away) the thing is that she doesn‚Äôt really like Christmas because of some bad memories/experiences associated with the holiday. \n\nI feel a bit guilty about not getting the chance to spend our first Christmas together. I wanted to make new memories for her to have instead of those negatives ones she has now. But there wasn‚Äôt anything I could do as I was too far away to drive up and visit and was with my family that I haven‚Äôt seen for months. It made me sad to know that she was going to be alone for the holiday. \n\nThe one holiday that she does like to celebrate is New Years Eve because I think that symbolizes new beginnings for her. I think she‚Äôs really looking forward to spending it with me, but I don‚Äôt know if I want to go? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do want to see her and I don‚Äôt want her to be alone anymore. I want to be with her. However, this is probably the only time I‚Äôll be able to see my family until the next semester. I miss them and want to be able to spend more time with them. I also have a grandfather that‚Äôs been diagnosed with cancer and I want to be  able to spend as much time with him as possible. \n\nI still have about two weeks left before my break is over and NYE is a couple days away, which means I‚Äôll have about a week alone up in my apartment if I do choose to go up early. There‚Äôs really nothing to do up there as none of my roommates will be back until the 7th of January. I feel like that would be wasted time as I could spend that with family. I don‚Äôt have a car so I can‚Äôt drive back and forth... and the 6 hour drive would be killer as well. \n\nMy GF sent me a message the other day basically saying, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about spending NYE with me, I won‚Äôt be expecting you to spend a holiday with me unless you say something.‚Äù That put me into a difficult spot. Of course I want to spend them with her, but I also want to spend the little time I do get to have with my family. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do, I have today to decide if I want to go or not because she has work off tomorrow and could pick me up early...\n\nAITA for being this indecisive about spending NYE with my girlfriend that I love?",

      "description": "Bit of context, my Ex broke up with me 3 months ago due to us being unsatisfied with our lives and unable to achieve the level of happiness we need. I brought up the fact I was unsatisfied with our relationship one evening, which gave my ex the queue to pull the plug on us without giving me a chance to negotiate our needs or trying new things. I was stubborn, but accepted her decision that this was what she needed to heal and be happy. We're living together and it's been hard to go day to day, but I'm doing my best to maintain what little of a relationship we have by dropping her off to work, walking her dog, and helping with errands. \n\nRecently, we were playing video games and I saw a notification pop up on her phone from a guy friend. I didn't think anything of it until she got really shifty and cleared the notification as soon as she saw it. She proceeded to tell me it was her friend that helped us move in several months ago, and that they were going to go to SF for a volunteer clean up. I knew about her plans for the weekend, but she neglected to tell me about this mystery man. Now i know she isn't obligated to tell me who she was going with, but it made me suspicious at the least. Then, she asked me what are some things to do in SF, which hit me pretty hard cause our first date was in Golden Gate Park, we've taken multiple trips to fisherman's wharf, and I was dying to take her to Lands End during our relationship but she blew it off. \n\nI told her no, i don't know anything to do in SF. I was emotional and frustrated when all this unraveled, so i waited the following day to ask her what her relationship was with this man. I asked her very bluntly \"what is your relationship with him?\" And she dodged my question every time. I flat out told her that i think she's infatuated with this guy and she's making an active effort to hide it from me. She avoided that point too, so now I'm convinced. Now any time this issue arises, she breaks out into tears and I'm assumed to play the sympathy role. \n\n\nI know that were broken up and she has no obligation towards me, but her actions went against the reason why she broke up with me. I really cared for her, but she's really pushing my patience and I'm just about ready to bail out of her life. WIBTA for moving out and leaving her with the rent?",

Also I do like meat so like having it occasionally.\n\nI never really talk about it with anyone but recently being vegan/vegetarian came up in converstion with a few friends and I told them that I'm generally vegetarian and they got pretty annoyed that I had never told them about it. I just didn't want them to have to not go to a specific restaurant or anything when they're with me just because I choose to be awkward about what I eat. They said it's not a big deal since most places have vegetarian options but still I don't want to annoy anyone and don't think it should really matter to them how I eat, especially when I do my best to have no effect on how they eat.\n\nAITA?",

In the past we have done Thanksgiving dinner with them on a different day. This year my wife wanted to host Thanksgiving dinner and we invited my in-laws and my mom as well.¬†\n\nUnfortunately my mom decided to host Thanksgiving dinner at her house still. When I reached out to my aunts and cousins to let them know my plans and tell them they are welcome at my house, they shamed me and told me I was jerk and my grandparents would be ashamed of me. I was nearly in tears at work from their responses. I tried to explain that my wife's parents and brothers are important too, and they didn't understand because I won't be at my mom's for Thanksgiving.\n\nI should mention that my dad passed away a few years ago, and my sister moved away leaving my mom living alone. I now live about 10 minutes away from my mom with my wife and 1year old. 2 of my cousins will be driving about 2 hours with kids to my mom's. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n",

      "description": "\n\nPlease note I wrote this on a hurry and english is not my mother language, hence the crappy grammar. \nWell her we go:\nLets call her F. She is older than me I think by 6 or 7 years, im 17.\n\nSo this started because she insulted and physically tried to assault my mother. \nA couple of years ago my mother's brother, F's father, died by heart attack. F's relationship with her father was not good, she demanded stuff like she deserved them and treated her father (also my uncle) in a very unsentimental manner. \nThe night before the funeral my mother had to travel to the city where the burial was going to take place. She had to sleep at my deceased Uncle's house, since she had nowhere to stay. \nF and her sister D were also spending the night at the same house. They were having a hard time. I wouldn't blame them, because they were at grief. However when my mother showed up they threw an attitude at her, they strarted throwing things at her and insulting her for showing up. The words they used to insult my mother are not in my knowledge, nevertheless I know they got physical. \nMy anger when I found out they attempted such actions on my mother (who at the time was around 56yo) and nobody was there to defend her, was staggering. F and her younger sister 'D' insulted my mother and tried to hit her by throwing objects at her, such as: cups, shoes, and other small blunt objects. My mom did thankfully find somewhere else to stay. To avoid such conflicts with D and F. \n\n\nNowadays F is living with her boyfriend in italy,  she posts pic's on her insta about the places she visits, and the food she eats etc etc. \nYesterday I saw one of her pics from her story, I decided I would send her something and I typed 'coglione' for fun, since I was told it meant 'testicles' in Italian. (this was because the foto that she took was from Food that looked like bull testicles) \nI thought she was just going to reply something like \"lmao lol\" or \"haha' whatever. But she went ahead and took it personal, she started asking me If I knew what the word meant.\n\n I told her: 'it means balls right?'\n \nShe said: 'no, it means stupid, you should check a dictionary if you are going to say such words in other languages' \n\nI thought, \" jeez it was just a comment why is she taking it so serious? \"\n\nI told her, well italian is not that hard to understand (since spanish is my mother language) and 'coglione' really sounds like 'cojones' in spanish, which stands for testicles.\n\n I did own my mistake and said I did not know that. I told her I was told (by people who know italian) it meant 'balls'. \n She later said: 'I speak perfect italian, you don't.'\n\n  Yes its true, I did not say otherwise, but I do know she has a braggy attitude and an arrogant way of acting. \nSo I told her: 'well italian is not that hard to learn, compared to German (a language im fluent in) italian is way easier for me' (since spanish speaking etc.) I was not trying to brag, I just wanted to tell her I could learn too. \nShe later did not respond, but I felt guilty for somehow insulting her someway. I really did not try to insult her, although in the past I did think about confronting her for insulting my mother that night.\nI feel a pinch of guilt  on me and I wanted an opinion on the matter. \n\n\nIm sorry for the long post, be honest AITA?

      "description": "For context, I get incredibly anxious doing anything presentation related. This isn't a secret.\n\nSo that puts me, my bf five minutes from doing our presentation. I was super stressed out about it, and my bf knew full well about that. Then he makes a comment about the music I picked didn't really match up well with certain parts of the presentation. When its clearly too late to change it. I stress out majorly because he's 100% right and I honestly felt like I was gonna throw up. I tough it up and we do it, class ends shortly after. \n\nI don't remember the exact comment but basically my response was \"I don't know why you have to bring it up when its too late\", and an argument happens. This happens in front of our friend(She'll come in later).\n\nTo sum it up, my argument was that he has done this before, it really stresses me out, and I don't know why he does it when he knows it does. His argument was that he hadn't thought about it until then and about the times he's pointed it out(before its too late) and I don't change anything. At the end I basically told him to stop giving his opinion on our partnered work last minute and walked off before he could reply.\n\nWithin 30 minutes we had apologized and made up, no hard feelings. \n\nBut that's were our friend came in. She heard it all and later that day sent me several texts telling me I had been a bitch, I was being controlling/manipulative by telling him that, I shouldn't have stormed off, shouldn't have brought up past stuff, etc etc. Basically calling me an asshole for bringing it up and because of the things I said. \n\nAnd even though my bf and I made up, I can't get over her opinion on it. I knew that I probably should have handled it better, but I didn't think I was really the asshole in the situation and all the stuff she said.   \nSo reddit, AMIT?\n\nTLDR: BF told me an opinion on a partnered presentation five minutes before we went, stressed me out majorly. We argued, I told him to stop giving his opinion last minute. We made up with no hard feelings, but friend later said I was the asshole. Am I?",

      "description": "This is a really complicated situation but i'll break it down the best I can\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my sister is a high-school senor who has dreams of being a model. My parents have put a lot of time and money into helping her achieve this since she entered into high school. Coached, classes, makeup, etc. Here's the issue though, my sister is not model materiel. When I say this I mean it in the nicest way possible. She's not an artistic person and can't design or do makeup. Along with this she's pretty \"normal\" looking and pretty much doesn't stand out at all and is not the kind of girl who would survive in a cut throat industry like modeling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not the only one who thinks this either. 3 coaches have dropped her because she just doesn't have what it takes to survive in this industry. My parents refuse to tell her why they dropped her but I know for a fact her last coach pretty much begged my parents to not let her enter into this industry. And I quote, \"She will not survive and will be eaten alive\".  \nDespite all of this my parents still think that she can do it. To be fair to them, their only doing this because they love her. She has her heart set on this and I think it would break them if they hurt her telling her she can't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, my sister is graduation in this spring and wants to go to modeling school in the fall. My parents are trying to save every penny to send her despite the fact that me and her prior coach have both disagreed. I've really tried to be nice about this up until this point. Supporting her despite my opposing view, that was until last week. Last Friday my family was informed my sister all but confirmed to get a full ride in scholarships if she chooses to go to college. She's always excelled in academics, she got a 34 on the ACT and has a perfect gpa. As someone who is paying for college I think this is honestly a life changing opportunity for her. But, she's planning on turning them down and going to modeling school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I heard this I was furious. I told my parents they need to tell her now what her coaches said but they refuse. Citing that she can \"chase her dream\". Well, I don't think she should be chasing a dream off a cliff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, last night I sat her down and told her the truth. I showed her the comments her past teachers made including the letter from her last coach. I also told her that she just \"wasn't right\" for this industry and told her my opinions very bluntly. I may have gone a bit too hard during this I will be honest, but I don't think this is a matter to be taken lightly. This did not go well. My sister freaked out and pretty much yelled at me for \"calling her ugly\" and ranted about how I'm awful before running off in tears. I haven't seen her since and my parents have asked me to stay away from her for now. From hat my dad told me though she's an emotional wreck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad about this honestly. But, I feel it was justified and needed. I would rather she learns this now than latter while she has an opportunity given to her like this. And honestly, if she hates me her whole life but can live it i'm fine with that.",

Everyone knows everyone else's dog and whatnot. \n\nI am one of the only houses on the block that doesn't have a dog. My neighbours in every direction have dogs, and 2 of them just let their dogs run around unattended all day to do whatever they want. \n\nEvery single time I mow grass, I have to stop to pick up several piles of shit. I got tired of it, and now I just drop the piles in front of the driveways of people who I know let their dogs run around. When confronted, they say \"my dog would never do that.\" \n\nAm I the asshole for not believing them? It's BS that the house with no dog has the most dog shit in the yard.",

      "description": "First time posting here. Im not entirely sure if this belongs here. (please tell if it does not).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago i was obsessed with models of planes and boats. I was just a beginner when my birthday arrived. On that birthday i recieved a large model boat to construct. I was ecstatic. I sat down a week after my birthday and started to build the model. It was way out of my skill level so i gave up. The model was really expensive btw. It was something around 4 000kr (400$).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after this my mother started bugging me to finish the set. This kept going on for a few weeks and i started feeling pretty bad for finishing the model. After a while this feeling started to turn into spite so i completely ingored the model.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother then confronted me when she saw i had not worked on the model. The conversation went along about like this: (paraphrasing a bit)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom: Why havent you finished the model?\n\nMe: Well its a bit advanced for me.\n\nMom: Your cousins paid good money for that model!\n\nMe: I know but i cant finish it even if i tried!\n\nMom: How do you know that?\n\n(there is a rating on the box of the model for diffuculty 1 - 5. This boat was a 5. Up until this point i had only done 1 and 2.)\n\nMe: There is a diffuculty rating on the box right here scaling 1 - 5. This is a 5!\n\nMom: Does that stop you from trying?\n\nMe: I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never did go back to finish it. I feel like i wasted my cousins time and money to get it for me. So am i the asshole for not finishing the model and essentially wasting my cousins money? The boat the model is based on is called AIDA. Kinda funny huh?",

I've already confirmed back to [much closer] generation. (More links about how the Cherokee don't give an F what your bloodline is, and how the US has no say in who gets to be Cherokee, so they uphold the Cherokee denial of citizenship).\n\nThem: They were rejected bc they didn't have the proper [Cherokee registry] connection [recorded a hundred years after she was supposed to have left the tribe].\n\nMe: I'm trying to confirm [X]'s parents, \"whoever they may be, and their parents, whoever they may be.

She asked me to help her fix it and as I was attempting her ex sent her a message on instagram. I guess on christmas he messaged her saying merry christmas or something and she said it back. Then this morning he was basically saying how he needs her and misses her. She told me that she wasn't going to respond then blocked him infront of me and told me that I could take her instagram login if I wanted it. I said no because I trusted her not to message him again. Well turns out she was msging him all day, which she admitted when I confronted her about it over video chat. (this was before I looked through her phone) She started crying on video so I asked if I could come over and she said yes. We started talking about it a little while after I got here and she showed me the messages she wanted me to see. Basically apologized said she doesn't know why she would msg him yada yada.I went to the bathroom came down and she was asleep. I snooped through her phone, I know I shouldn't have and honestly at this point it doesn't matter cause I don't think I can ever trust her again. But she straight up talked to her ex all day and lied to me about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- Girlfriend started talking to her ex over dm's, lied to me about talking to him all day, and I basically think its over between us because she made me lose her trust in her.",

Everything seemed cool the day of the move, but the couple of weeks leading up to it had felt off between us. The day I was leaving I realized I didn't have anywhere to put my mini fridge until I unpacked some things. He offered to bring it to me in a couple of days and I accepted. \n\nIt ended up pouring rain on the day he'd originally said he'd bring it over. He never showed, and neither of us talked about it. I was fine with that because honestly, who wants to move shit in the rain?\n\nI asked him a few days later if he could bring it on the weekend. He said he was going to work overtime, so he couldn't. I said okay, no problem, planning to go get it myself. Then my hip was absolutely killing me for the next couple of days, so I asked if he'd reconsider because I wouldn't be able to move it myself. I offered him cash for his trouble. No reply. I tried calling once about 6 hours later. Ignored.\n\nI ended up asking my new roommate if she was willing to come help instead. I hadn't wanted to because she's repeatedly told me she's not strong and hates moving, but she agreed. While there, my friend saw me and didn't really acknowledge me.\n\nI called him when I got home but again, no answer. So I sent a text asking if something was wrong between us. Still nothing. Haven't reached out since because I don't want to nag. But did I push it too far already? Could I have offended him by asking if he'd reconsider?",

      "description": "So here's the scenario. There's a couple of spots available next to my workplace where me and my colleagues park. This morning, when I arrived there was a cab parked with the driver inside the vehicle.  \nI don't have a rear camera, so its difficult for me to reverse park, and there was a vehicle behind me. I honked a couple of times (one honk didn't work for him) and indicated for him to move his vehicle forward, as it was completely clear ahead of him and it would make things easier for me.  \nHe moved a little bit, but not as much as I would have liked. I tried a couple of times to park, now I'll admit that my reverse parking prowess is not up to mark and if I were a better driver I should have been able to park within the provided space, but I wasn't able to. So I honked again, but he did not budge. So I got out of my car and asked him to move the vehicle. He retorted that there was more than enough space for me to park the vehicle and that I was bad at parking (true :( ). So I got back inside and somehow managed to park with extreme difficulty. At this point, I was so angry, that after parking I told him off, something along the lines of \"I was in difficulty, you saw that, you could have moved the vehicle forward but you did not, that is completely egoistic in your part\" (not the best choice of words I meant selfish). He kept insisting that I was a bad parker. Anyway, now that my anger is somewhat abated, I have a sinking feeling that I might have overreacted, so AITA?  \nHere's an [image](https://imgur.com/a/aUZnXOM) of the space available to me after he moved his vehicle, as you can see he was right.

      "description": "My girlfriend (19F) and I (21M) have been together for around 5 months now. We go to the same college and live &lt;10 minutes by car from one other, so we have many opportunities to stay at each other's houses and go on dates.\n\nMy girlfriend has a strict no drinking and driving policy, and I understand where she is coming from with this. I would never even THINK about driving drunk. However, my girlfriend becomes uncomfortable if I want to have a single beer even if it's an hour or so before we leave my place/wherever we're at on a date. She makes it very clear she's not comfortable with it, giving me questioning glances and saying things like \"aren't you going to drive?\" Ect.\n\nNow I get it. Many of you are probably thinking I'm the asshole here for making my girlfriend a passenger with me after I've drank. However, I'm a 6' tall guy and I weigh about 200 lbs on a good day. Especially if I have food in my stomach, one beer over the course of an hour is barely going to make a dent in my BAC. We like to go to a lot of concerts and whatnot and I suffer from some mild social anxiety, so a beer can really make a night out for me much more enjoyable. It's not even worth it though when I have to deal with the subsequent guilt trip when I absolutely feel that I am in the right. The government has decided that if someone's BAC is under 0.08, they are not at a level of impairment that makes them a danger on the road. I have explained this to her several times, and it only further frustrates me that her arguments aren't based on facts or logic, but rather on feelings. \n\nTo top it all off, I am the one who drives us pretty much everywhere, and I can't even remember the last time she offered to drive us some place. What's the verdict guys, AITA here?",

This weekend there is going to be a hockey game, my city‚Äôs police station vs the fire station, and one of the firefighters asked if I would be able to help with minor activities such as concessions, auctions, etc. as a fundraiser for gear since ours is old and falling apart. However, my mom is coming to visit me for the whole weekend and she wants to be with me the whole day from 6am to 9pm. I asked her if she would like to come to the hockey game, but she‚Äôll only go if I‚Äôm not going to help with the ‚Äúminor activities.‚Äù I just want to know if I‚Äôm in the wrong for not wanting to spend time with my mom and help with my fire station. \nAlso, the next time I see my mom will be in June, thanks for any advise.",

      "description": "I know the title may be too harsh for the situation, and I only mean it to some extent. They‚Äôre my family and I‚Äôll always love and support them when and if I can. Hear me out though. \n\nFor the past 4 years my mom has been a single mother. I‚Äôve been helping raise and basically be a second parent to my younger half sisters (their dad isn‚Äôt in the picture) since I was 14. Our circumstances and situation are a whole other story, I‚Äôve made my peace and have learned to grow from it.\n\nLong story short, as of now my mom depends on me to do drop offs and pick ups from school, and take care of them until she gets home from work, and also babysit all day over the weekend, mind you, all this while I‚Äôm a full time student. Like I said, we‚Äôve made it work, the situation doesn‚Äôt bother me.\n\nHowever, for the past 4 years my 2 sisters, mom and I have been living in a small studio-like apartment. Recently I‚Äôve began getting a steady flow of income and have presented the idea of moving into a bigger apartment to my mom. I‚Äôve been tired of living in this cramped space since we moved in, and I‚Äôm ready to get out with or without my mom. Financially, we‚Äôre okay to move out. But because of a lot of reasons, we need a co-signer to be able to move into a new apartment. I‚Äôve been trying to find one, asking friends and family if they could help, while my mom just kinda gave up on the whole idea once she found out getting approved would be kind of difficult due to our lack of credit and housing history. \n\nAt this point, I‚Äôm considering just renting a room somewhere else on my own. Of course this would mean working more hours and with me being a full time student already, I would have no time to babysit or help out with my sisters. My mom can‚Äôt afford a babysitter, and it‚Äôs Been difficult for her to get approved for low income daycares and after school programs. \n\nThe only reason I haven‚Äôt moved on my own yet is because 1) I wanted my mom and sisters to be in a more comfortable living situation, and 2) I still wanted to help my mom take care of the kids. At this point though, my mom no longer plans to move and I‚Äôm going insane with this lack of space and privacy. \n\nWibta if I just moved out on my own knowing that that would mean leaving my mom having to struggle more than she already is?

I get a text from my parents telling me to come home right away, given the fact I had just arrived at my destination I was a little upset and asked for what reason. One of my friends had left an empty bag of weed just out in the open in my movie room. I know my friend has extremely strict parents, so I told them it was my bag to help him out of trouble. They‚Äôre really pissed at me. I‚Äôve lost access to the basement and my car. \n\nMy friend is a little shady sometimes, I can tell he lies about some things. So just as a test, I messaged him saying that he left a bag of weed in my movie theater... no reply.\n\nI wait a bit.  \n\nNow I say that my parents are pretty upset and will be contacting his parents for bringing that into their house.\n\nNo reply. \n\nOkay, I‚Äôll just wait a day.\n\nNo reply. \n\n\nI was pretty pissed off, and I went online and saw he was playing Fortnite, so obviously he isn‚Äôt busy and is choosing to ignore this situation. I decided to take this to the group chat and call him out for acting like a complete chump. As in reality no matter what he says he‚Äôs going to be just fine - I already took the blame. \n\nI already put myself through the process of saving this ‚Äúfriends‚Äù ass.

      "description": "My college roommate is very particular about almost everything, but I'm pretty easy-going so I usually go along with whatever she wants to do with our room.  She has noticed a particular odor in our room that, for whatever reason, I usually can't smell.  I believe that she smells something, I just can't.  \n\nThis smell has been bugging my roommate for awhile and we have tried opening the window and using essential oil diffusers to get the smell to go away.  In my opinion, those things have worked, but my roommate thinks that we need to start using plug-in air fresheners.  I told her that I really don't like plug-in air fresheners because they can be overwhelming,  which causes me to have headaches.\n\nSo naturally, she bought one anyway.  I said that we could try it out, but if I started getting headaches that we would have to stop using it.  After a few days I told her that it was too much for me and she got upset and claimed that \"it finally eradicated the smell\" for her.  She then told me that if I didn't like the one she got, I could buy a new one, with a different scent, but I didn't even want an air freshener in the first place.\n\nI don't want my roommate to live in a place that she thinks smells bad, but I also don't want to spend MY money on something that I don't even want.

      "description": "I'm a high school teacher.  The class in question is a college-level course.  A few days ago, I gave a brief lecture putting a bow on a topic we'd started the previous class, then assigned a short assignment.  My memory gets a little hazy here about what I said, but someone asked when it was due and I said something to the effect of \"Well, I hope you can get it done by the end of class.  It's only X problems.\"  \n\n\nEvery student but one finishes with time to spare.  With about 10 minutes left of class, suddenly that one student starts asking for help.  The kid, at this point,  even asks another student to take a picture of the lecture notes that are on the board because their phone has been taken away by their parents.  Another kid goes \"Or, you know, you could just write it down?\"  The first kid does not write anything down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of class, I gave everyone who finished credit and gave the kid who didn't a 0.  They had completed zero questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy class the next day, the kid has done the work, but is very upset that I have given them a zero.  I asked for an explanation for why the work hadn't gotten done in class, and there was no explanation beyond some stammering.  I gave lots of help while the other students were working.  The other students helped each other while they were working.  He chose not to work.   I stood by the zero.  Everyone else completed the work with no trouble.  I still do not understand why the kid was able to get the work done at home, but wasn't able to get it done in class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for giving the kid a zero, even though the deadline was unclear?  \n\n\nPS: Today, after more whining, I just gave in and gave the kid the points.  I've had to have parent conferences with this family before and it was clear that this wasn't going to stop.  I even told the kid \"If these 10 points will be the difference in you letter grade at the end of the term, I'll give them to you.\"  That wasn't good enough.  They wanted the points.  At this point in the term, I just don't have the energy to continue this fight.  ",

      "description": "My class needed a class tee-shirt design for this year and the chairmans were complaining about only getting 1 design submission so i decided to design 2, one themed space and one themed science.\n\nOriginally, i only wanted to design the space one because that was the theme for class decorations and i wanted it to match. The shirt colour was chosen to be turquoise by voting(online survey). \n\nBut people who didn't want a turquoise class shirt started saying there were people who voted more than once so we did another voting in class irl and the colour changed to maroon. I was kinda annoyed at this point because the design i had in mind(space) wouldn't match with the new colour. But i asked the vice-chairman what the second most voted for class theme was and it was science.\n\nTo make time to make the 2 designs, i had to push back my plans to go CNY shopping with my mum which later on affected my Social Studies grp project.\n\nWhen i submitted the 2 designs to the vice-chairman, he said the designs would be too expensive to print (limit : $16 per shirt) so he returned the designs to me. I wanted to tell him that the designs could be altered to suit the budget but the next lesson was starting so i didn't get to.\n\nAfter school, i decided to re-summit my designs to the chairman because i thought they would communicate with each other(other being vice-chairman) about the designs and i could explain about them later on but instead, the chairman posted an online survey containing my designs to the grp chat. I DMed him to inform him that there was a front design he didn't include. After a while, he DMed me asking if my design was rejected by the vice-chairman and i said yes because it was too expensive. I also told him he could just alter the designs to fit the budget.\n\nI know i was wrong for being pushy about my designs but i felt unappreciated for my efforts. I didn't even get a \"sorry we can't accept your designs. Thanks for designing though!\". The only reason i decided to design was to help them out because there was only one design and they were complaining.\n\nAm i the asshole? ",

      "description": "Me (33 Male) has been dating my girlfriend (34 Female) for 8 months. We were going through some tough times and have been seeing a counselor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week ago after a bit of an argument, she insisted on coming over to get some of her clothes. I was planning to leave to go to the gym, and told her not to come at the moment. She insisted upon it, I changed the combo to my garage keypad opener and put her items in a bin for her to pickup because I was planning to leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe came over and was obviously unhappy that I had changed my combo and effectively locked her out of my coming into my condo without me there. I offered to her to speak over the following days, which she refused to and then told me over the phone \"I don't feel like we are in a good relationship.\" I asked her several times if we could meet to talk, and she said she was busy etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen this last weekend, my friend tells me that he saw her on a dating app. I confronted her about it, and she has no shame and says, \"I told you I didn't feel like our relationship is going well.\" I told her that having issues with our relationship is different then signing up to a dating website while I am actively trying to work things out with you. I am so angry because I had been making an effort to work things out with her, and I really care about her. But I feel like I cannot talk to her after doing something like this. AITA for ignoring her? If I really care about her, should I talk to her ? ",

      "title": "WIBTA if I clean out everything from my roommates' fridge?",
      "description": "I live in a house with a dozen roommates. We have three full sized fridges for us to share. Since I have been here (about 6 months), the fridges have been completely dysfunctional. No rules, no set spaces. People just throw what they want in there, wherever there is space. Things are rotting in all three fridges. Half empty bottles of sauces clog the shelves. Empty pizza boxes. Honestly, it's embarrassing. \n\nI have no stake in the fridges; I decided early on to live out of my own minifridge which has suited me fine. The few of us who care keep trying to get people to clean out their stuff so we can establish rules, but it has been impossible to get people to move their stuff or label it. Some roommates we don't see for weeks on end too, so it's tough to coordinate. The end result has been dysfunctional fridges for months. \n\nI finally got fed up with it this week. I put a page-sized note on the fridge last Wednesday telling people to move their things out of the fridge by Saturday or it will be thrown out. I posted on our FB group saying the same thing. I talked to all the roommates I could warning them about it (maybe half). Most didn't even have anything in the fridge, all were happy that I was going to finally do something about it. \n\nThis is all well and good, but I talked to one of my roommates this evening. And he refuses to move his stuff. We got into a bit of an argument. I asked him to move whatever he had in there. He told me that he was busy and that he didn't want to. I asked him to at least show me what was his so I could stash it aside, but he refused again, this time saying that he wasn't exactly sure what was his. He got mad, saying that I didn't have his consent to  clean the fridge, and since I don't  have a stake in the fridge I should just leave it alone for them to deal with. He shut the door in my face. \n\nI was fuming at this point. Got a text later from our landlord telling me not to throw away any food. \n\nI'm pretty confused here. I don't have a stake in the fridges but I hate the mess on principle. Plus others in the House would appreciate it. So AITA here for wanting to clear out a fridge? \n\nI'm pretty sure I'm not, so then, WIBTA if I do it anyways? If I just fucking deep clean the fridge and throw everything away. I've been trying for months to get people to cooperate. I gave my roommates 3 days to do the simple task of moving their shit so I can do the hard work. I'm fed up and I just want a clean fridge and I don't see any other alternatives. If I leave it longer, people will start storing things in there again and I'll be back at square one. I'm doing them a favor!\n\nWhat should I do?",

A  friend of mine found out what today is so he wrote ‚ÄúHappy international Women‚Äôs day‚Äù on the board.\n\nSome kid (SK) thought it would be funny to erase the ‚Äúwo‚Äù from ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs‚Äù right after the sub confiscated the markers.\n\nI got pissy and walked up to the kid, got in his face, and told him that he was being rude and that dicks don‚Äôt get good careers and something like that. \n\nThe kid next to SK then started telling me off, saying that it‚Äôs just a joke and I‚Äôm the one being a bitch by getting in SKs face. I try to defend myself at first, saying that there‚Äôs an international men‚Äôs day (to which he replied that it only gets shut down by women‚Äôs rights activists, which to be fair, I‚Äôve seen happen), but back down and apologize because in the end, I was invading his personal space and probably being loud. I then proceeded to try to play it off as a joke because I was so embarrassed.\n\nLater, about an hour ago, my Speech/Debate Captain asked me about what happened. Turns out that SK told his brother, who told my captain who had to diffuse the situation for me. \n\nI ended up DMing SK a full apology, letting him know that i had a bad morning and that I didn‚Äôt mean to take it out on him. I also let him know that I will be more than prepared to celebrate and listen to the 38% of sexual assault victims and 77% of certain individuals who try to commit deathpacito (can‚Äôt say the S word on this subreddit) (men) on November 19th, actual International Men‚Äôs Day. \n\nSo Reddit,  Am I the Asshole?

      "description": "A little bit of context: this girl and I have now been broken up for about a week and some of it may have had to do with her mom not liking me. I'm 19 and in college and she's 18 and in her senior year of high school. We dated for about a year and we both interacted with each other's families often. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow onto the stories. There have been multiple times where her mom has offered to pay me/pay for me.\n\nThe first of these instances was I helped my girlfriend's sister and her husband move homes over the summer. It was  a really hot day, like scorching. I did a lot of the heavy lifting myself, considering I was almost double the size of everyone there. It was a long day, we started at 10 am and didn't stop until 4 pm, and for me that was a lot because   \nI have a bad shoulder from high school wrestling. Her mom decided to pay me, with her own money. Not an amalgamation of her sister, her brother in law, her mom, and her brother in law's parents. Just her. She wanted to give me $140 of her own money. I have a very strict moral code, and I refused to take it because I offered to help, they didn't ask me. I wanted to use it to get closer with her family and show them that I was serious and hard working. We went back and forth for a few minutes. Her mom ended up handing my girlfriend the money and she left it on my desk while I was in the shower because we were gonna go out for dinner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother instance is when her sister graduated from grad school and we went to a local restaurant to  celebrate. I was invited personally by her sister and mom, so we went and it was our time to order. This was kind of a fast food place with the food quality of a sit down place, so it was a little on the pricier side. She asked me what I wanted and I told her I didn't know yet, under the impression that I was paying for myself. It was her turn in line and she told me to order and I told her that I was fine and could pay for myself. We were holding up the line and her mom finally let go and let me order on my own. She seemed very upset with me for the rest of the night and my girlfriend told me that her mom didn't like what I did. I wanted to show that I was fiscally responsible and didn't need her to pay for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few other times we went out and I let her pay which killed me, but my girlfriend told me to let her pay or else there would be a problem. I always paid for my girlfriend whenever we went out or got food. We ordered a pizza while we were at her house and her mom saw and said \"Why didn't you guys tell me? I would have paid. You're in college you need every dollar.\" I had money saved from working full time over the summer and I have a campus job that pays decently. A $20 pizza wasn't going to leave a dent in my pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR my girlfriend's mom always insists on paying for me and I don't let her because I want to show that I'm responsible, which makes her upset with me.",

      "description": "BG: Dating 4 years, Plan to Propose soon. I have 6-year-old son, with full custody. We live together with my parents in NYC. We are looking to move at the end of the school year to NC, for housing and schools. I work as a Freelance Consultant.\n\nFor 8 months, my GF was unemployed. She was a CRM/Office Manager for a big fab company, but due to poor business she was let go, while still owed 2 checks.\n\nIn Dec, she started as a Hostess in Manhattan. Paycut of $30/hr to $10/hr. Morning commute is about 60mins, at night 90-120 mins, so I pick her up (45 mins both ways )If parents are home. Her default is Uber $45-$60.\n\nA couple of months later, the fab company has new ownership. She was rehired at a higher position w/ a raise + Back Pay. We were reserved but ecstatic she said she wanted to come back on a test basis for 2 pay cycles and then she would quit the hostess job.\n\nIt's April and she hasn‚Äôt quit. She works about 70+ hrs a week. She works from 9am-5pm as a Director then from 7pm-2am. She works every day, sleeps about 3/4 hours a night.\n\nMy reasons for wanting her to quit:\n\n\\- First, I think 2nd job is unnecessary. We don't pay rent and some utilities. Yes, we would like to move soon, but I think with our 2 incomes we should be focused on spending less not making more. Better financial habits. Right now we make about $6,000/mo living with my parents. I think we can live without the extra $1600.\n\n\\- Not worth it. At $15/hr + tips she makes about $400/week after taxes. Between the Gas, Uber trips, eating out more, Stress shopping, Me needing to commute All of these things eat away at the extra money being made. And those are just the monetary prices being paid. Let alone what it is doing to our relationship.\n\n\\- Her health. She says people work 70+ hr jobs all the time. I'm being too sensitive, treating her like she is fragile. These are 2 demanding jobs, the hostess one especially. She's developed a limp being on her feet all the time. She's just overall miserable, which affects any quality time that I try to spend with her.\n\n\\- This schedule isn't optimal for me and by her working so much I can't work that much. If she came home in the evening, I could log more hours. Which would allow me to contribute more.\n\nI am tired of this commute. 90 mins just to pick her up. I would gladly give her my car to drive between these jobs but she scared of driving\n\nFriends tell me she doesn't feel secure enough to leave the job just yet. I need to make her feel secure about the situation but idk what to do. I asked her is their a specific amount in mind before she quits if so I would like to contribute at this point, but she says just wants as much as possible before we move.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA here? Should I just STFU and keep doing my nightly commutes and be happy about it?\n\nTLDR: My GF kills herself being a hostess at night, we don't need the money.",

      "title": "AITA For finding it creepy that my gf best friend doesn't like to share almost anything of her life.",
      "description": "My girlfriends best friend, and partly also my friend, is a young adult, whom lives with her mom. Which I secretly envy just a tad bit. I've known her for over two years now, and to say our relationship has been rocky is an understatement. the reasoning are as follow.\n\n1. She does not like to share her past with people, which I understand, a lot of people don't like to do that. which is fine by me. The weird thing is, she likes to ask a lot of questions relating to my or my girlfriends past. sometimes she judges us for it, which in hindsight I find a bit odd. for example, you will tell her how you tried to fix an engine of a car, she will tell you that you did not do it properly, and that repair you applied was wrong, and then you ask her how she would know such a thing, and if she has any reference or experience with fixing cars? she tells you she has experience and then cuts off to silence. You ask her where and how she received this experience and knowledge. She then avoids the question and kinda denies she ever told you that answer. When I usually ask her why she behaves this certain way, the staple answer that I usually receive is as follow;\"I don't think people should judge other people on their past, and I don't think my past will benefit your knowledge at all.\" So basically it's been a narrow one way street of information for the past two years now. Which usually makes our get together pretty dry....and not in the funny way.\n\n2. She like to segregate her life a lot, you know those people who don't like to share what they do at work, or their private life? in most circumstances you would respect this persons wishes and talk about different subject to fill in the gap. In this case though, this girl likes to segregate everything, where it almost feels like an addiction. Work,family,friends,love-life. You name it she will hide it from you, or just plain deny that she has a relationship, just because she doesn't want to mingle her affairs together. You try to meet her boyfriend? she will use every excuse in the book to make you not see him, which gets weirder the longer they are together. You try to visit her house? forget about it, you try to talk with one of her friends (normal conversation) behind her back, she will get mad at you and throw a tantrum, and in some way force her friend to not talk to me anymore. Her boss is calling her? she will push you without any warning, and run away from you, just so her boss can't hear you on the phone, while you're looking flabbergasted at her. She tend to check her phone every  10-15 min, and then she will start talking with someone, and her body will be sitting in a way that's very asocial and basically hiding her screen from everyone, and when you ask her whom she talking to, she always replies with no one, and then leaves you hanging there for an approximate 5-10 minutes. As you can see this has not only been a headache for me, but also for my girlfriend, and her friends, and her mother. The mother has seen me a dozen times, and invited me to her house on multiple occasions, but whenever I as ask her about it, she doesn't want me to see her family or her house, and then proceeds to throws a tantrum.\n\n3. She doesn't like it, when I get close to her, or touch her in any way, shape or form. Now before you start drawing any card here, read this part well. I had a best friend in college who was from Finland, now if anyone knows the culture and custom of Finland, it is very normal and kinda necessary to be a non-touchy person if you want to get along with the citizens (at least to my understanding, I might be wrong.) I'm from a country where non verbal communication is a norm, so dealing with no touching in anyway was hard to learn at first but I got used to it, and to my surprise actually helped me with my inter-cultural communication skills. Now the reason why I took this story is to compare it to her case. She does not like to be touched in anyway by me specifically. She loves it when my girlfriend touches her for some reason. So I kind kinda reflect her actions with my past this way. I accepted her rules and needs, and respect her boundaries, just like I did with my friend. great no issue right?\nSee it wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the fact that every time I accidentally touch her, or when I accidentally look in the eyes she throws a tantrum, as if I deviled her sanctity. It's come to the point where I avoid anything that relates physically touching her as much as possible, and I avoid as much eye contact as possible. \n\nRecently I've started doing the same to her, I avoid talking about my past as much as possible. Whenever my friends throw a party or a get together, I don't invite her. and when I talk to her I avoid any non verbal communication that relates to touching her (If people are still confused with what I mean with touching, I mean a pat on her shoulder, or a handshake, or a normal hello, or goodbye hug, heck even a high five or a fist bump.) or looking her in the eyes. She has noticed this and is starting to frustrate her, and she feels 'neglected' for some reason. She is asking me to elaborate why I'm acting odd lately. But I've already kinda give up on negotiating a compromise, due to the fact that I've tried to negotiate in the past, but every time I tried to find a solution she would reply with an answer that's either very selfish, or just plain weird. So before I go have a talk with her I want to ask you guys AITA?",

      "description": "In our friend group, Brian and Lola (not their real names) have been dating for about two years. They're both nice people and they both seemingly really like each other. Then, one day, out of the blue, when we're all hanging out together at a local cafe, I see Brian on his phone and I ask \"What's up\", trying to make some casual conversation. He says \"Oh, I'm on Grindr\"-- and everyone else around us acts like that's the most natural thing. I'm kind of in shock because I was still under the impression that he was dating Lola. And that he was straight. So then I ask \"So... you're bi?\" (because, again, he'd been dating Lola), and he says \"Nah. I'm gay.\" The air kinda became tense. I realized everyone was waiting for my reaction, to see what i'd say about his confession. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to play it cool and made some joke about the dearth of good-looking date-able guys in our area or something, but inside I was growing mad. It would've made sense if Brian liked both men and women, and decided to hit up Grindr after breaking up with Lola... but if he ONLY liked guys, then doesn't that mean he intentionally wasted two years of Lola's romantic life? If he's 100% gay then he was never into Lola the way she was with him. He lead her on. Everyone else in my friend group, including Lola, is jumping to be accepting of Brian's \"coming out\" and is sweeping his old relationship under the table. No one even wants to discuss it. I realize its ultimately none of my business but I can't help but feel upset on the behalf of Lola. Just a few weeks ago, she would tell me how happy she was that she and Brian were both officially going to colleges within the same state so they didn't have to do the whole LDR thing. I also realize that Brian's behavior may have also been because we all went to a christian private school and that he may have only felt comfortable coming out on the cusp of graduation, but then why date anyone at all? Plenty of people didn't/don't have boyfriends/girlfriends. And why date Lola for two whole entire years? His parents aren't the judge-y type either. I just don't get it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't done anything really asshole-ish (yet) but I feel like an asshole for not being able to let this go when everyone else apparently has. I want to express myself but at the same time I don't want to make drama when it's clear that no one else wants it.",

      "description": "My gf and I are in a bad place at the moment. We've been fighting a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago it was particularly bad, and because of our fighting I had to last-minute cancel plans with the same friend twice in a week. My gf was with me when I cancelled, so we came up with legitimate sounding excuses as to why I had to cancel. He was understanding each time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next week, we had made plans again but another big fight started. This time, my gf wasn't with me, so I decided to be honest with my friend and tell him I had to cancel because of the fight that was starting. I was uncomfortable lying again. I called him and told him, and again he was understanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason I called was because she will often demand to see my messages to make sure that I'm not talking about her. She hates the idea of being talked about unfairly, which I can understand. I know it's wrong for her to demand this, but she goes by the logic of \"if you've got nothing to hide you would shot me\", and while I see how this is problematic, I usually don't have anything to hide and it will end the potential argument if I just show her. If she knew that I had been honest with my friend when cancelling, she would have EXPLODED.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day however, he messaged me and we had a conversation that went something along the lines of... him: \"hey man, how was it? you okay?\" me: \"yeah it was okay, we worked through it\" him: \"that's good, we can talk about it when we meet up if you need to\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours later, my gf asked me \"what did you tell him when you cancelled on him yesterday?\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was caught off-guard, and came up with an unconvincing lie. She demanded to see the texts. I protested, knowing that my conversation with him would start a big argument. She insisted. My phone was in the other room, so I got up to get it and while walking back quickly deleted the messages with my friend from earlier in the day. This took a little longer than it should have however, so my gf became suspicious. She became convinced that I had deleted messages (very observant of her, tbh), and after arguing about it for a long time I came clean. We had one of our biggest ever arguments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand you shouldn't lie to your partner. I also think I should be able to talk to my friends about issues I'm having in my relationship, without fear. I feel incredibly guilty for having lied, but genuinely think think that others might have done the same thing in my situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My last relationship had a lot of issues. Any small thing I would do would be enough to make her so mad she wouldn't speak to me for days, and I'm talking things like saying \"not bad\" after a workout instead of \"good job\" warranted the silence. There were absolutely times that I fucked up and she was right to be angry at me for, but I honestly feel like those were scarce as I generally just did my best to make her happy.\nEverything became annoying to her, eventually she only half-jokingly threatened to slap me when I was telling her how I was feeling down about a workout because she said I had no reason to feel down based on how I'd measured it. \nWinter break comes, and things are weird. She breaks down crying during runs and I try to be there for her and encourage her. She hung up on me when I said something like \"yeah today was rough and it didn't go well but it's in the past so just get back out there tomorrow and go harder.\" Apparently that was the wrong sentiment. One night, she tells me that she's not sure she wants to date anymore, and I told her to take her time to think about it and that I would support whatever decision she made. Every so often I ask her where she is on her decision, and she always says she hasn't made one. \nOne day, we were supposed to go to an art gallery and meet to leave at 9:30. I'm in class until 9:15, a fact she knew but forgot this morning. So at 9:00, she asks when we're supposed to meet, and when I didn't reply she got sassy about it and just started walking to my car. I apologized when I saw the texts, told her sorry I was in class and on my way. I freely admit to being annoyed and decided to be a little sassy back, saying \"You know class gets out at 9:15 right?\" and then I was over it. She wasn't, and that comment pushed her over; she said she had too much homework to come and asked me to drop her off at her dorm. When I pulled up, she sort of spat out the breakup words like a super fast word salad, jumped out of my car and ran inside before I could speak. \nI called a couple times then and later that night; no response. I sent her a good-bye text the next morning, saying that I still supported her decisions, and if it was because of anything I did that I was really sorry and if she needed anything just ask. She called back later that day.\nShe confirmed that it was the 9:15 comment that pushed her over the edge, and that she'd wanted to break up since the conversation over winter break. She'd been deliberately treating me terribly to try and get me to dump her, and she tried to rationalize the breakup method as giving me space to calm down (I think it was an impulse done in anger). \nI (calmly) told her I thought the way she'd handled things was immature and that she probably had some growing up to do. She started crying, saying we couldn't even be friends, hung up on me, and has now told all her friends I'm an asshole for saying mean things to her. \nTL;DR Messy breakup, AITA for saying she handled it badly?",

A couple of months ago while she was doing some final touches to the project at home, she messaged me saying the Bluetooth module was not working for her, but luckily she had one laying around her house anyway as it turned out. Fine, the Bluetooth module was working perfectly fine for me just a couple of days before that, but whatever, does not really matter. \n\nI asked her if she could return the Bluetooth module since she was not using it anymore, she said she would do so, but ended up never actually giving it back. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, we had to demonstrate our project and that was the end of it all. Over the past few months I have asked her multiple times if she could return the Bluetooth module since I need it for a personal project, she kept saying she would, but never did. \n\nI am starting to get a bit impatient and since we have finished the project, we are allowed to take back the parts we would like to keep (including the Bluetooth module). Would I be an asshole for taking the Bluetooth module even though it technically is not mine? It is not the same module (HC-06 (mine) vs HC-05 (hers)), but I was the one who paid 16 euros for the original module and I have asked her multiple times if I could have it back. \n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I took the Bluetooth module, even though it technically is not mine?",

      "description": "I am a 42 year old man dating a 21 year old woman. We've been together for two years. We have a fantastic functioning relationship and we plan on marrying this year, and she is already pregnant with twins.\n\nAs a little background, I am divorced, with five daughters from a previous marriage (24, 21, 21, 19, and 18) and another from an old affair (age 20). \n\nTo make a long story shirt, me and a woman in her mid-thirties were at the grocery store. We live in a small city so small talk isn't uncommon. Family life comes up, and I mention I'm planning on marrying soon. She inquires to know more, I tell her about my girlfriend, and joking about how young she was. She completely lost it. I personally don't know what was wrong with her - I think she was mentally ill. But she started crying and screaming, saying that \"she was just a child\" and nonsense like that. It was like she was having a nervous breakdown. I felt so embarrassed for her, she was obviously mentally unwell.\n\nI discussed this with one of my close friends and she did say it was \"sort of weird\" for me to be seeing a woman 20 years younger than I am - especially when I have three children older than her. I agree that is a little funny, three daughters older than their own stepmother, but nothing inherently weird or bad. We're both consenting, rational adults, and we're both happy with our relationship.\n\nSo, I wanted to get the consensus of the good old Internet here - am I the \"asshole\"?",

      "description": "Hi all,\n\nso I follow all kinds of different profiles in IG...2 or 3 of them being pages of random cute girls. I‚Äôm not thirsty, I don‚Äôt leave comments, I dont try to DM them. I‚Äôm very happy with my girlfriend and my romantic/sexual attention has always been on her....I find her incredibly attractive and don‚Äôt have eyes for anyone else. I don‚Äôt talk to or hang out with any girls IRL...in fact, I spend 95% of my evenings with my GF. Every now and then when I scroll through my IG feed I‚Äôll do the old ‚Äòscroll and like‚Äô and spend literally 2 seconds on any post. \n\nSo my GF is a jealous and slightly insecure person...I am, too...so I‚Äôm not complaining. But she‚Äôll do this thing where she will look at the pages I follow and if any of them are attractive girls I‚Äôve known or some random account she will follow them too...to pretty much keep tabs on me. She did this yesterday and found some random account I follow then looked through literally a dozen and half posts to finally find one from 6 days ago I liked. Then she texts me about it and tells me I hurt her...I apologize. Now she‚Äôs been giving me the cold shoulder for the past day and making me out to be like some shitty bf. I can understand if I was leaving creepy comments or talking to some girl or something...or if I shared it on social media but I literally just liked a photo of some random girl that I don‚Äôt know and moved on.  \n\nI feel frustrated because she purposely went seeking this out, for no reason, and then tells me how I hurt her. I apologized once but knowing her she wants me to prostrate myself and beg for forgiveness...and I don‚Äôt want to do that because I don‚Äôt think I did anything ‚Äòwrong‚Äô or broke her trust. AITA?

      "description": "So where do I begin. To keep it simple my fianc√©e's Maid of Honor has issues with anxiety and I understood this at the time. So, we're about a month away from the wedding in this story and we (me and my Fianc√©e) decide we want to take wedding party photos on the same day as the bachelorette/bachelor party since everyone will be together it seemed like a good time to do it. Well this stressed her out and she decided to drop out of the wedding because it was too much for her. Obviously we were upset that she did this especially so soon before the wedding but we were by no means mad at her. So we do what we have to do which is replace her spot as MoH with one of the bridesmaids, we did this within an hour of her telling us. Understandable right? I think so. Well a few hours later she said she wanted to be back in the wedding. My Fiancee and I decided it was best if she was out of the wedding.\n\nAt this point she was very upset that she wasn't going to be in the wedding party. She \"apologizes\" to us via text. This is word for word her apology...\n\nShe said \"Sorry for stress and the crying\" End of apology... this frustrated me because I don't see this as an apology my fianc√©e deserved a better apology IMO.\n\n She goes on and says  her mother is addicted to meth (which we knew of already) and that that is stressing her out and basically the way I see it she was throwing a full on pity party. I wish I could show the exact message she sent but I don't have a way of getting it atm. So I start talking to her girlfriend (who I was best friends with at the time) and I tell her that I think that apology she gave wasn't really an apology. We go back and forth for a while arguing and I end up saying the MoH was playing victim and was being incredibly selfish and inconsiderate. I'm being as honest as I can be here. I also called her crazy (Not to her but to her Gf) and I said her Gf was insane for taking her side. I was upset and shouldn't have said those things. I have apologized to them though. So my main thought her is Am I the asshole here or is she. \n\nIf there are any questions about anything I will gladly answer them. If anything doesn't make sense I will clarify if asked.

Naturally, I get some shitty customers, as well as plenty of fantastic customers. The problem is that I've noticed a pattern in what groups have been the biggest pains in my ass to deal with, at least as customers. And unfortunately that manages to settle into two specific groups: Hispanic families and east Asians. Hispanic families being the groups of at least three people at once, usually with at least one kid. First, there tends to be a language barrier that's difficult to get past, but I've learned to deal with that. *However*, these groups also tend to end up being picky on top of not knowing what they actually want (ordering one thing and then realizing they ordered wrong when I've finished the drink, even when I clarified what they meant when they ordered the drinks), showing up less that 30 minutes before close, not using normal manners like \"please\" and \"thank you,\" either tipping less than 50 cents or not tipping at all, giving me a $50 or $100 bill for an order under $10, and making an awful mess and either not cleaning up after themselves at all or half-assing their \"attempt\" to clean up. I realize that outside of a retail scenario these people are probably perfectly reasonable, but at work I'm starting to build a preemptive internal feeling of frustration when these demographics of people just walk into the store, before they've even approached the counter.\n\nAm I just being awful and racist, or am I just noticing an unfortunate pattern? There are also plenty of fantastic PoC customers and godawful white customers (for example, my favorite customers are black people because I literally almost never have any problems with any black customers), so I'm not sure if this is a bias or just a really awful coincidence.",

      "description": "^((obligatory disclaimer for using a throwaway account))  \n\n\nI was at a restaurant, one of my favourites, which has always been a little classy‚Äîi.e. it was one of those places with prices a bit above average, that you usually go to when you want to have a very good meal. I don't know if this detail is actually relevant (I think it is), but what I'm trying to say is that the place is not a trattoria, pub, those kind of place where people usually go to have fun and be loud.  \n\n\nWe were having a good time, enjoying our meals, like always. At a certain point, a big group of young men came and took a table. They **immediately** started being very loud, to the point that I couldn't even talk to my friends, or even concentrate to what I was eating.    \n\n\nIn my opinion, this ruined the mood of a good lunch, so I asked politely the waitress if she could tell those men to lower their voices a bit, because we couldn't even talk to each other.  \n\n\nShe answered that it is not her job to do such a thing and that, anyway, her boss would not like it if she did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that point, I just wanted to leave because I wasn't having a good time anymore; but I suck it up because my friends thought it wasn't really a big deal. I stayed the rest of the luch unconfortable for the situation.  \n\n\nI think that a group of people who go to a public place such has a restaurant must show some respect for the other people who are there, and that it is the restaurant's staff's job to make sure everyone is having a good time.  \n\n\nAm I an asshole for wanting everyone to be moderately quiet? Should I have addressed the situation in a better way?",

      "description": "My parents and I have a really good relationship. No issues, no big fights, and no resentment (which might change). The PROBLEM in our house is my younger sister.\n\nMy sister is 14 and a freshman, and I‚Äôm 16 and a senior. It is safe to say that we do not have a good relationship, considering all that is happening.\n\nHer friends are trash, smoke weed, vape, drink harder than college kids, and are have just awful personalities. She‚Äôs turned in to a nasty kid, and has an awful attitude towards my parents and I. She‚Äôs failing classes, skipping school, not doing her homework, taking my clothes, stealing my mother‚Äôs makeup, etc. Obviously, some discipline has had to come into play, which has mostly just been taking the form of taking her phone or not allowing her out on weekends, which makes me absolutely livid.\n\nMost recent case in point was this past Saturday. Sister currently has her phone taken away, but has her friend‚Äôs old phone instead, which I have mentioned to my parents. Parents confronted her about it (not actually taking it because she denies having it) and she assumed I told them about it. So, to retaliate, she tells my parents he has video of my friends chugging wine at a party I attended and that my boyfriend and I have had sex on multiple occasions.\n\na) the ‚Äúwine bottles‚Äù were bottles of fucking sparkling grape juice and b) the boyfriend and I have never had sex for specific reasons which my parents are aware of. At this point she‚Äôs blatantly lying in order to get me in trouble and I am absolutely pissed.\n\nMy parents and I sit down and have a conversation in response (basically reaffirming I didn‚Äôt do anything and she‚Äôs lying) and they tell me they‚Äôll talk to her about it. I leave to go to breakfast with my boyfriend, pretty satisfied with how everything turned out until she fucking showed up in the SAME restaurant to go get breakfast with her friends.\n\nI‚Äôm pissed. I was always punished relatively harshly when I acted out (e.g. getting a C on a test and getting my phone taken away for a month in 8th grade), yet she gets to do all this other shit to make me miserable and to try and throw me under the bus and she still gets to go out and have fun with her friends. My parents didn‚Äôt even TRY to talk to her.\n\nBasically, I want to tell my parents that they need to shape the fuck up because this is bullshit that she isn‚Äôt getting punished for anything. My grandmother says it isn‚Äôt my place to say anything and that my parents already have a lot on their plate, but this is so fucking frustrating. They don‚Äôt do anything to discipline her. Just this morning I told her to take of my sweater and my dad just told me ‚Äúleave it be.‚Äù Are you shitting me? Fuck no I‚Äôm not going to leave it be, that‚Äôs my shit!!\n\nSo, WIBTA if I called out my parents for their lack of discipline? I really don‚Äôt want to insult their parenting skills or anything, but this is too fucking much for me to handle.",

      "description": "This happened about 15 years ago. Me and a few classmates were on an overnight field trip to map a creek for a college geology class. There was a larger group of us but mainly it was me (guy), another dude, and a chick. We spent all day mapping the creek and after the day was over we all ate dinner and started drinking. The three of us snuck off and got baked like we always did. \n\nBedtime rolls around and we all start to head to our sleeping area. We all decided to sleep in the same cabin because we stay up later than everyone to party. About 10-15 min after lights out I hear some commotion in the bunk near me. I knew exactly what was going on because dude and chick had been flirting most of the day. There was giggling and loads of movement and this carried on for about 20 min. I guess they thought everyone was asleep. I finally knew where it all was leading and said in a clear voice, ‚ÄúCan you guys please keep it down?‚Äù At this point everything got quiet and no one said shit. \n\nThe next mornin I got that ‚Äúyou wrecked my chance‚Äù lecture from dude, but I was pretty indignant saying I didn‚Äôt want to hear them scrump. This is the point where i think I may be the asshole. I definitely didn‚Äôt want to hear dude and chick get busy anyway but I was also strongly attracted to the chick and was jealous it wasn‚Äôt me in her sleep in bag.",

      "description": "So my mom pierced my ears when I was about 5 or 6 months old. For the first 7 years of my life she made me wear studs in my ears non-stop. As soon as I had the choice I stopped wearing earrings because I wasn't much of a \"girly girl\" and I couldn't care less about putting little gems in my ear holes (I was a kid!).\n\n I haven't worn earrings in 5 years and the holes are still there. I've been told that because I had them in for so long as a child that they will never close over. They're always itchy, red or inflamed. Recently I came to the realization that my mom made this permanent body changing desicion without my consent. The idea of that really bothered me because she's always presented herself as a massive feminist and is very vocal about it. When I confronted her she made a whole list of excuses; \"I guess I vaccinated you without you consent too, huh?\" And \"I just wanted you to look cute in all your baby photos\" and \"I wanted to save you from the pain in the future\". Honestly at this point it was so far in the past that I don't have a right to be pissed. But I am! AITA?\n\n",

For the last few months I‚Äôve been kinda sick of coming up, because it‚Äôs a whole day thing.

I admit I‚Äôm lazy af and I‚Äôd flake sometimes. But if I don‚Äôt come up he gets mad. I don‚Äôt like being straight up with him anymore because he does get mad. He got really mad at me one time, when I made up an excuse not to come which is understandable. (Ik not being honest is wrong and he deserves to be mad about it) but I told him why I‚Äôm not honest and he says he never gets mad.

It releases my stress and tension from work and life. She agrees it was fun and we havent been on a strech like that for some time. I ask if she wants to day trip, go to her families bar for a couple drinks, or try something new we havent done before. We talked about a day trip to chicago, and catching a hockey game in 2 weeks when i have a a weekend off and im free. Shes happy about it, mentions she hasnt seen a hockey game in years, hasnt seen a Chicago area mall, it all sounds fun. \n\nSo i say, ok well i picked and planned it, so you gotta drive. She then brings up, the home team will be back in town at a later date, says she doesnt wanna drive to chicago i should, she hates highway driving, its not a fun idea anymore. Then she mentions we go out alot, we should wait for the local event so its special when we go out. So i say ok fine, im not doing all the leg work. Thats not what we agreed on. I say to blow off my stress or tension ill go shoot, or catch a movie. She comes back with, \"why would i do that alone, thats bullshit, how come she's not good enough to go all of a sudden\"? I remind her, she has mentioned it repeatedly she hates movie prices, and hates shooting. All wraps up with \"its fine, im not in the mood to argue, love you, night\". \n\nAm i the asshole for not wanting to plan, drive, budget, ect.. and do all the logistics? ",

      "description": "Ok, obviously needed context: my girlfriend and I were really good friends with this girl, whom for the sake of privacy I will call Karen. Anyways my girlfriend and Karen go way back and when she started dating me she spent less time with Karen and Karen and I ended up spending time together often whenever we saw each other and my girlfriend wasn‚Äôt there (for extra context, I saw her most at church and such and we both usually got there early) through the course of a few years Karen dated some guys, my best friend, an old friend of my girlfriend and I, and like three other dudes in the span of a year.  We usually made jokes about until at some point she was texting me on my sisters phone while i was with my girlfriend elsewhere and we had started messing with each other, she said something about me not paying attention in lesions and then I said that at least I could keep a partner for over a month and that apparently sent her over the line, she later tried to get me in trouble for stuff, stopped talking to me, and then just stopped interacting with me and my girlfriend since about September. Since then I have learned that she apparently had a wet dream about stealing me away from girlfriend and then told her how she did it and what happened after, tried to kiss my girlfriend to ‚Äúsee what it was like‚Äù and said some personal stuff to my sister. That, my friends is a shit ton of context and probably the first time I actually wrote this down at all\n\nAnyways, Karen just runs off whenever she sees me or hides behind her man of the week so whenever I see her with someone I know I‚Äôll say Hi to them and then she‚Äôll walk off, or not something I go out of my way to do but something I do nonetheless.  Am I the asshole for making her go away? I mean, I do it in a kinda spiteful way, but is it justified?",

      "description": "Okay so this is actually kind of a done deal, already a thing of the past at this point. My mind just like to drudge up the past when I'm bored so here I am dwelling on some random insignificant thing from my past lol\n\nNow onto the actual thing that happened...\n\nI was playing an online game and kind of bouncing around between different groups of people from day to day. I would typically play the game for about 8-12 hours out of the day unless I had something else going on that day, in which case I would cut my playtime short in order to take care of things IRL. In this particular case I had met this girl on the game and I was playing with her for (literally the second time ever so we didn't know each other well at all), along with 2 other people that I also didn't really know that well. So basically it was just a group of complete strangers playing with each other.\n\nThe confusing bit (for me) came when I had been on the game for about 3 hours and then I had to get off the game to take care of other things IRL. I told her and my 2 other friends that I had to get offline to take care of some things. Didn't think anything of it and nobody seemed to have any issues or anything which seemed normal to me.\n\nNext day (or maybe a couple days later, can't remember for sure) I am getting on the game and I have an open spot in my lobby and I see her online. I send her a message asking if she's interested in joining and I got a reply something like \"No, I'm busy right now. Even if I wasn't busy I would still tell you no though.\"\n\nI was really shocked and confused by her response. It sounded very clearly to me like I had upset her and I had no clue why, so I asked. She told me that I abandoned her with a bunch of complete strangers. I apologized to her at the time but I couldn't help feeling that *she* was an absolute stranger to me and vice versa. We weren't in the middle of a match when I left or anything either. She would have literally had to accept another invite from them and then hit a \"ready\" button to continue playing with them because the game didn't carry over your party after each match.\n\nSo my question here is, would you feel like you got ditched after playing with an online acquaintance for 3 hours before they had to get offline? AITA?",

      "description": "So today I had a lacrosse game against a school who a friend of mine who I haven‚Äôt seen in a few years attended. During this game there were players who STARTED but lacked the proper fundamentals and didn‚Äôt do anything to fix it. They didn‚Äôt even take the time to show up early before games and practices to hit the wall and work on their passing. These players crippled several possessions, either by missing open catches and passes, or by staying completely still acting as dead weight. This ended up in us being absolutely embarrassed because of our loss, which isn‚Äôt a look I want to have around a friend who I finally saw after a few years. \n\nUnrelated to the score of the game, our coach put in varsity players who were there to act as subs to supplement the low numbers of the JV squad. However they started and took over the play time for the JV team meaning less play time for the people who want to work their way to varsity and want to prove themselves such as me. Some of the varsity players also got extremely cocky because they were in a JV game and ended up causing turnovers because they tried to take on 3-4 people at the same time. \n\nThe whole situation pisses me off beyond belief, especially if the rest of our season plays out in a similar way.

      "description": "So I have 2 half sisters, both of which my family fell out of contact with, 1 (sister A) because she was an addict and stole from me and my family, I was 10 at the time (25 now) and the other because she was envious of my dad getting to spend time with us, because both sister A and B had a rough childhood, my dad had them both by time he was 22, also a half-brother but he's not important in this. So our families reconciled about 4 or 5 years later and I've never really had a real relationship with either of them. \n\nSister A, I could shoot the shit with and talk about smoking or whatever but never had a solid sibling relationship. Sister B I've never had much conversation with, but I do have strong relationships with my nieces, each of them have a daughter and I do feel bad about not talking to them but not so much my sisters.\n\nSo their mom got sick last week and was explained to me by my dad that she could be placed in hospice.  Today she passed and I called to give my condolences but my sister was pissed off and cussing me out, understandably I get it, her mom just died. The last piece is that we all live in the same small city, which is probably important in determining the final decision.\n\nNow I just need to know AITA for not calling originally when my dad told me about it.",

      "description": "So it's 10pm on a Friday night here in Australia. I've been at work all day and then hung out with friends at the beach and finally dinner and a couple of beers before walking in the door at 9:45. My girlfriend, who lives by herself, is in the city with her girlfriends having dinner and drinks. I text her asking how the night is going and we have a quick back and forth about our night and then she sends \"guess you're not going to pick me up\". After a few minutes of sitting here in my underwear I decide to get dressed, pack an overnight bag and txt her I'm on my way. As I'm walking to the car, my gf calls and is clearly tipsy and asks where I am. I tell her that I'm getting into the car and she must hear the annoyed tone in my voice and asks whats wrong. I tell her that I didn't appreciate the way in which she asked me for a ride. She doesn't understand. I say that it was a rude way of asking me to come pick her up and in the future would she just ask nicely. If I said no then it comes across as 'no I don't want to pick you up' and if its a yes then I'm fine with being taken for granted. I tell her that I'm always more than happy to help her with anything she needs be it a ride, moving, a favour, money, cooking, whatever, just don't ever make me feel like I'm taken for granted. So we get into a bit of a back and forth but I'm not interested by now as she's a bit drunk and not apologizing, just doing the \"I'm sorry if you feel that way\" and \"you missinterperated it\" talk. Long story short, I park the car and go home and she gets a tram home. So, am I the asshole here? I don't feel like one but I've never not picked someone up let alone my girlfriend even if we've had a fight.\n\n",

      "description": "A few days ago I had to travel to a conference for work. A day or two before that, I came down with a nasty chest cold that nearly laid me out completely. I had to decide whether to travel or not, and ultimately decided that I couldn't risk missing the conference since my job was paying for me to be there and my registration was nonrefundable. So, I went. Only to have my boyfriend call me a self-centered asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend claims that traveling while sick is one of the worst thing you can do. His reasoning is that I'd be potentially infecting multiple people, including some of the most vulnerable. He gave me a whole flowchart of infections, starting with the airport staff, people on the plane with me (including old people and children), hotel staff (including housekeeping staff, who probably don't get any paid time off), and food service staff anywhere I eat. He says that America's labor laws don't provide well enough for people making minimum wage to deal with infected people like me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I take his point that it sucks to get sick if you can't take time off, it seems ridiculous to quarantine myself because I have a cold. My argument was that people who work in the service industry (which I have in the past, btw) are exposed to all sorts of illnesses all the time. It's the nature of the job. And me not traveling doesn't fix our labor laws. It wasn't reasonable for me to lose out on the conference I was registered to go to, and possibly face consequences at work, just to be one fewer person with a cold in public spaces. Still, I can't help but picture some poor housekeeper who might potentially lose her job because I left used Kleenex in the hotel trash can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole for traveling while sick?",

      "description": "For context I am a lesbian, my girlfriend is half Japanese and my girlfriend and I have been together since beginning of high school in 2010. We live together and traveled for 3 hours to visit him qnd our other family for Thanksgiving. We don't see him often and he isn't the most awesome guy in the world but we have never had many problems. I do love him and try to be as nice as possible. He is super religious so you can already sort of see where this is going.\n\nWe did lunch at Golden Corral today. As you can imagine it was ridiculously busy. My girlfriend doesn't do well in packed places so she was pressed up against me in a small panic attack. I was holding her and quietly comforting her, rubbing her back and hugging her. My uncle sees this and in a disgusted voice tells us to stop the \"indecent PDA\". His face is contorted in a hideous look of disgust. I calmly tell him that she is having a minor panic attack due to her fear of large crowds and this is how she calms down. He \"harumphs\" and turns away, muttering something I didn't quite catch due to the noise level. I roll my eyes and continue comforting her.\n\nThe next incident occurred while getting my seat. He made snide remark about my choice of clothing (jeans, New Balance sneakers, a dull red shirt and zipper hoodie, black beanie) compared to his (he was dressed business casual). I asked why it matters because it's Golden Corral, not church. I admit I said it in not the nicest possible manner but I was still annoyed from before. He said it mattered because it's Thanksgiving and you need to dress up. I replied with \"whatever\".\n\nThen, when we went to get our food he intentionally bumped me aside to get his first, cut our positkons and would grab tongs and scoopers before we could. He harassed my girlfriend and sister on their food choices. He said my girlfriend \"could use meat on her bones\". She has always suffered an eating problem and just looked down in shame. I told him to knock it off and then things went from bad to worse.\n\nHe made a racist remark about her heritage and I told him to go fuck himself. He exploded at me and said I'm just a stupid child (I'm 22) who dropped out of college to chase an anorexic Jap lesbian and probably wouldn't be struggling to live if I had stayed in the church. I am not struggling by any means. I work two jobs, yes, but me, my sister and brother, and my girlfriend are happy and stable. I dropped out for completely unrelated reasons. \n\nI went apeshit. I had tried to put up with his shit for the sake of my family but I couldn't control myself anymore. I told him to go to hell, he doesn't know shit about me and my life. I called him a filthy sexist and racist. He called me petulant child and told me I would be the one in hell unless I repented of my \"gayness\". I demanded he apologize to my girlfriend for the awful things he said and he refused, claiming he would not apologize for the truth. My girlfriend ran outside in tears.\n\nI slapped him. I called him the most disgusting and hateful person I ever met then I left to go after her.\n\nMy family is saying I ruined Thanksgiving now.",

      "description": "Back in 2015, I was living in graduate housing with four roommates. \n\nIt was a two storey house; four lived upstairs (including me) while another lived downstairs. My room was adjacent to the 2nd floor's bathroom, which means I could hear everything that was going on inside it (very important). If someone is taking a piss, I would hear. And if he didn't operate the bathroom sink afterwards, I would know. Importantly, I can also tell &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; is using the bathroom, based on the sounds of their footsteps. I know all this not because I'm a creep but because the soundproofing is that poor.\n\nOne of my roommates (let's call him Bruce) and I were not exactly on the best of terms. For example, we had sporadic disagreements about the division of chores. Make no mistake, there was no real antagonism between us, at least not until the incident I'm about to tell you. \n\nOne day, as I came back from school, I saw Bruce drinking from a large carton of chocolate milk in the kitchen. I immediately groaned in my head as I will be shortly subject to half an hour of audible diarrhea as he is most definitely lactose intolerant. I know this, because as explained above, I hear everything. \n\nAfter going upstairs, I first stopped inside the bathroom before going to my room. I noted that there was no more toilet paper left. &lt;i&gt;Knowing that Bruce is certain to use the toilet imminently&lt;/i&gt;, I nevertheless chose &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to inform him about this shortage. Why? Because I bought and used my own rolls (remember, we couldn't agree on household responsibilities). That &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; toilet paper ran out was technically not my problem. It was their responsibility to ensure that their own toilet paper is consistently aplenty. I also didn't feel like talking to him. \n\nFast forward twenty minutes and my prophecy materialized. Bruce and all of his 6'4 frame stormed inside the bathroom. In the midst of his endeavor, I heard a loud \"Shit!,\" followed by more cursing. Bruce realized that something was missing... To this day, I still don't know exactly how he managed, but he did stay longer than usual and ran the faucet a &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; time. After he had left, my curiosity got the better of me, which led me to investigate what he did in the bathroom... \n\nTo my astonishment and very much disgust, I found shit stains all over the toilet seat. My gut reaction was to call him out, so that he can clean it. However, I abstained myself from doing so; I wanted to spare him the embarrassment derived from the fact that he cannot use the toilet properly. My logic was that he would soon find out the mess he had left, and would promptly clean it like any adult would do. That day never happened (at least not as soon as it should have). \n\nFor five days, his creation was allowed to fester in impunity. For five days, he did not use that bathroom. As for the rest of us on that floor, we used the bathroom downstairs and took our showers at the gym. Never once did I divulge the identity of the culprit, but I did hope, on a daily basis, that he would finally clean after himself. \n\nBy the fifth day, I couldn't take it anymore. The stains on the toilet seat have literally crystallized. I stormed in his room and bluntly ordered him to clean his mess. He denied it, claiming that I have no evidence that he did. When I told him how I deducted that it was indeed him, he turned red angry. We went back and forth for an hour, levying insults at each other. Obviously, that didn't solve anything. \n\nLater that night, while I was trying to sleep, he left a highly unsavory text in my phone about my mother. This further escalated our conflict, which almost led to a physical altercation between us. Another roommate was able to temporarily mediate our dispute, sending us both back into our room. \n\nFortunately, my lease was running out in three weeks or so. That being said, the following three weeks were quite awkward. We physically fought on more than one occasion and had to be held back by other roommates. The passive-aggressiveness was palpable. \n\nEventually, he did clean the toilet seat, but only because his girlfriend was coming over. \n\n------\n\nAnyways, I understand that I could have handled this situation much better. In fact, every time I recount this story to friends or family members, I get told that I could have been more diplomatic. I always reply that, while I could have been the bigger person and could have, at many points, diffused the conflict, I did not want to spare him of the consequences for acting so irresponsibly. \n\nI'll take the ESH but damn **** him.

      "description": "We currently live in New York, and we're both visiting my hometown in a suburb 40 min drive from San Francisco for our Thanksgiving week. Since my family always holds a big Thanksgiving dinner and since he's been wanting to visit San Francisco, I decided I should invite him over for the dinner while he travels the city for a couple days. He didn't feel comfortable staying with me and my family for the entire trip (very understandable), so he grabbed an Airbnb near the city instead except for the Thursday night before we leave on Friday morning. Since I invited him to see San Francisco with me, I will be staying with him in his Airbnb until Wednesday.   \nWhile I took Monday the 19th off, I am working remotely and will be in front of the computer for the 20th and 21st until Thanksgiving. I didn't take the two days off because I very recently had a week and half off for a self vacation to Asia. I wanted to get work done, and I thought it would be appropriate to work and get off early to be with boyfriend.   \n\n\nWe arrived on Monday night, drove around San Francisco night views, and had a very nice dinner at an Italian restaurant. Tuesday comes along, I'm working and he asks me to think of things to do while he grabs food / walking around the city by himself.   \n\n\nMy trips back to California is never really vacation, and I usually spend time relaxing in a comfortable space. I meet people I'm still in touch with, eat food and get drinks with them, but I have never felt the need to actively explore town, find nice restaurants and just explore a place I sort of grew up in(I say sort of because I grew up in a suburb nearby). While I do enjoy doing that, I'd rather relax and stay at home. Meanwhile because this is a new place for my boyfriend, he wishes to get out and see things. I explained that I will be working from home but that he should totally get out and see the city. I walked him through some cute spots and nice sceneries around San Francisco, where to get good views, things he's like, etc. I didn't want to hold him back from doing what he wants to do, so I told him to go ahead without me because he personally enjoys vacations by himself as well.   \n\n\nIt stresses me out that he's asking me to locate spots and things to do for him because I'm from near San Francisco. But the thing is that I left the area for an out of state college years back and I don't know the area like a true local. I only went into the city couple of times while growing up. He's upset because he feels he is almost wasting his time here because he doesn't know what to do, and that I should be more responsible for his time here because he's a guest since I invited him for my trip back home. Work has been extremely stressful lately, and I feel like I have family duties, boyfriend's needs, and work needs to tend to without caring for my stress.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole for being saying no to arranging his day plans?  \n\n\nTLDR: told my boyfriend to come to my hometown with me 3000 miles away from our home for Thanksgiving because he also mentioned he wanted to visit the city. I need to work and he's annoyed I'm not fully present with him during the trip\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I do forum role play but due to several bad experiences on some of these sites with my friend, who is the person in question I may end up being the asshole with, We've restarted work on it. It's slow going because I have job searching but She's teaching so I'm really the only one who can do the majority of the framework. \n\nThis is relevant because her role will be lore. Angels exist in this setting but until we decided to have certain demons be fallen angels with amnesia we were avoiding it. Demons are one thing but, even with an MIA creator and several dieties in the setting,  the angels would need to be connected in a way similar to a seer to the plot . \n\nIt made certain logical sense, therefore, to take on some archangels as half helping with the world half plot related. I commented how I was thinking about Raphael, who is one of my favorites, since she reminded me of a playby ( celebrity lookalike) that I connected to him and sort of outlined my idea for him.\n\nShe asked me why I wanted to play him then said,  \"If we're playing non-fallen as well to set up world building I'd prefer to play Raphael over any of the others.\" Citing cooler name after I mentioned he was one of my favorites. \n\nThen went into her version for him. I commented he was a favorite but had not repeated this before her comment when she asked about it. I also have played the Archangel Gabriel before for a different concept site.\n\nI commented her actions were really shitty when I just asked her what she thought of my character and the only reason I haven't hard noed her yet is because I know she thinks of these concepts in advance. Gets really excited too. \n\nAnd pros to it. Not only is she the lore master but I am playing Asmodeus as a Fallen angel and he had an incident with Raphael. So there could be interaction if she played him. My Gabe is generally well liked by her and with his role he makes a certain amount of sense while the angel of healing would be more in tune with the world.\n\nThe cons are she didn't ask but kind of laughed at the concept first because she had a psychologist/psychiatrist character. She said \"I prefer you...\" and just laid down this without really respecting my feelings on the matter. There are other archangels and I picked Raphael, not even wanting to play Gabe for this site, so she could have picked another. \n\nThe worst though is she presented it in a matter of course way, like of course I should be all for It, that after three hours of shovelling I got a little snippy with her. \n\nAm I the asshole if I just say No? Also feel free to comment I'm the asshole for getting a little annoyed with her, I plan to apologize for that part.",

      "description": "Hello Reddit. I live in London where we have this thing called LAMDA, which I believe stands for London Academy of Music and the Dramatic Arts, and they essentially give people lessons on, in my case, acting, leading up to a performance of a piece in a group, pair or solo. \n\nOur group of 6 (in which I am the lead role) are working on our grade 3 exam performance. Let me just establish that though this is a lower level exam, it is important as it allows us to pursue higher level exams which may lead to an easier time getting into certain universities when we are older.\n\nAnyway, we have been working on the piece for a term now, but on the first session back from the Christmas Holidays, only two of us showed up: Me and a girl I will call... Amy. It turns out that this term the other girls decided netball training was more important and that they would just not come along. Me and Amy leave the lesson prematurely as we can't really do any of the scenes. We discuss how it's really annoying that these girls who took on big roles are not commited, but Amy has gotten stuck with just a couple of lines. \n\nAnyway, I later see an email conversation between one of the girls and our teacher asking to change the time slot. That's right. Changing it to fit them when LAMDA was the commitment made first. So the next session, we spend half of our (fairly pricey) lesson discussing time slots and yet we can not agree on one. So, in a kinda angry tone, I say, \"me and Amy also wanted to do netball, but you need to get your priorities straight. You can't just take a break when you don't even know your lines yet\" then we all get in an argument about me being hypocritical because I don't want to change the time slot. Therefore we only got about 10/30 mins of our session.\n\nAITA for getting angry?",

She‚Äôs staying with him, quite a long way from me, but a much closer distance than UK-west coast USA so I was psyched to visit them and meet this bf who I‚Äôve heard a bit about but never met in person.\n\nShe‚Äôs only going to be in the UK for just over a week and her bf was concerned about them not getting enough couple time together, so I picked out a flight and then a train down to their city and the same back the next day, which meant I‚Äôd see her for less than 24 hours. She said that sounded great and I booked it, but even with student discounts and choosing all the cheapest options it cost me about ¬£110 in all. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll next be able to afford going to the US so I figured it was worth it.\n\nAbout two hours after I‚Äôve paid for all the travel, she messages me saying that her bf still thinks &lt;24 hours is still too much time, and asked if I‚Äôd be able to cancel. Because I‚Äôm a student, and therefore picked out the cheap options, my train will have a ¬£10 cancellation fee and the airline website says no refunds at all, though I am going to ring in the morning to try my luck. I‚Äôm not hopeful though, and I think I might be at least ¬£95 out of pocket for a failed trip. That‚Äôs easily a whole month‚Äôs worth of utility bills and food expenses for me, I was prepared to pay that much to see a good friend that I rarely get to spend time with, but I can‚Äôt go around dropping that on nothing.\n\nI‚Äôm going to ring the airline in the morning and check if I could get a refund for the ticket but if I that doesn‚Äôt work out, WIBTA for asking for her bf to pay me back?",

Not only was I annoyed that he got me a gift I had explicitly told him I had no interest in, I was now annoyed that he got ripped off and thought he should get his money back.\n\nI tried to not say anything about it as I was trying to be gracious but as I looked at it more and more, the idea that he paid so much money for this really started to get to me so finally I told him he got ripped off and should return it, get his money back, and we could go to dinner or see a show with it or something.\n\nHe refused, so now I just have this thing sitting in a box collecting dust.\n",

      "description": "This happened several years ago, but recent events have brought it back up.\n\nA little backstory: my parents got divorced when I was younger, after which I didnt see my dad much resulting in a bit of a distant relationship, which I think contributes to my feelings in this story. \n\nMy dad got a nice tax refund after buying his home and he told my sister and I he wanted to take us on a vacation. Eventually, he decided on going to Disneyland. The trip was planned for right after I graduated high school. My dad planned the destination and made all the arrangements.\n\nWe ended up stopping in Vegas to see my cousin, which is where things started going down hill for me. I wanted to see the Beetles Cirque do Soleil bad enough to offer to pay for my own ticket (for this one specific thing), explaining I had some money saved up. He took this as \"I got the rest of this trip for myself\". From then I was expected to pay for everything on my own including attractions, food, and chipping in for gas. \n\nThis kind of bothered me, but the worst ended up being Disneyland. I paid for the ridicously expensive ticket and we were there for maybe 4 hours (which was maybe 3 rides and a churro) and ended up leaving, though my dad said we'd go back the next day. I was super upset because this was the part of the trip I was looking forward to the most and it was so expensive and we left so quickly. The next day my dad and sister decided they wanted to go to SeaWorld (I hate fish) and my dad got very mad because I was upset about it and said I could go (and purchase my own ticket) or stay at the sketchy hotel by myself all day. \n\nWhat I had thought would be an amazing trip to bond with my dad became a pretty stressful time. I worried about all that money I hadnt planned on spending and felt pretty resentful.\n\nTo this day thinking about it still riles me up, but recently I started wonder if I was being an entitled teenager.

I live in a multi family apartment complex, and ask the building manager for help fixing it last night (we have s good report, he's very handy and has helped me on various other car projects.\n\nWe apoxy it back on and zip tie in place (ties go around the window), meaning I cant fully close the window. BM asks if I want to leave it in a spot in our complex instead of the street (my roommate leaves his broken down car in our spot so I have to always Street park). I ask if it's cool to take person X's spot, BM says it's fine for s temporary thing so it doesn't get broken into while the apoxy driee and that X never uses the spot much. I ask if I should move in the morning and BM suggests to leave it longer so apoxy can really seal before removing ties.\n\nFast forward to today, rain in forecast and I quickly have to cut the zips and roll up the window before leaving for bus to work. Leave the car not thinking it's an issue since BM told me it was fine. Get a call at work late afternoon saying person X is back, fuming, calling a truck to get my car towed. Wont listen to BM about situation. BM is pissed on the phone asking why I cut the ties this morning, that it could only be left there if it was in danger of being broken into with windows down, and that it's not his job to cover my ass. Try to explain about the rain and that he told me it was okay to leave it there for a bit, not having it, saying that what I did wasn't cool. \n\nRushing home now to try and talk to person X about this. Did I fuck up by not moving it this morning before rushing to work? AITA? \n\n",

After we started dating, I asked her if she wanted to go fo the dance, and she said yes. \n\nSo, Saturday was the dance. And fyi, I love dancing with people. So, of course, I asked Taylor if she wanted to dance. What I found out was that she didn't like dancing, and she said no. I was kind of bummed by this. One of my friends, let's call her Anna, also was at the dance. We used to date a while back, but now we're just friends. She asked if I wanted to dance, because apparently the guy she was with didn't like dancing either. So I said yes, because dancing and having fun is kinda the whole reason I came to the dance. But when the dance ended, Taylor was pissed at me for dancing with Anna and asked me why I took her to a dance just to dance with Anna. I pointed out I asked her if she wanted to go to the dance, and she said yes, so I assumed you wanted to go to a school dance to, well, dance. I told her I was planning to dance with her, and even asked her, but she said no.\n\nShe called me a dick for dancing with Anna and said I should hang out with her the whole night. I pointed out if she wanted to hang out, we could stay at home. I didn't get dressed up and pay $10 to just hang out. She just stormed off, and she hasn't texted or talked to me since.\n\nAm I in the wrong here?",

      "description": "A bit lengthy\n\n2 years ago I went to a different school thats at least 1hr30mins away. At first I didn't think much about it because I went to a seminar saying it was an IB school that helps students be more prepared for college than majority of students. I heard many great things about the school and my parents ultimately decided that I would take the exam so that the school would chooses who gets in or not. I got in somehow, that was a shocker. During the 1st month of school I noticed red flags going off. It prided itself in a good environment, first week 3 fights went off. Didn't mind because IB students and regular students were separated. During that first month my French teacher said that only 1/3 of the students would graduate with a IB diploma or be lucky enough to get a certificate of some sort, he said that with pride. Soon as I got back home and said that I would like to be taken out because it sounded like bullshit. They said to just ride it out and see what happens. Big mistake, during the school year my sleep schedule got messed up badly, I had to wake up at 4am to get ready and wake my parents up because I wake up earlier than them for them to go to work. I'd be sleeping and class hardly anytime to do my work, with more homework stacked on top so I had to do it at home which I get back by 4:30pm. I stopped caring because it was too much for me. I did enough to barely pass but got kicked out because I underperformed. Parents were really disappointed because they bragged about me going to this school.\nNow I'm in another regular  highschool and doing well and they brought the school up, I said hell no. I wanted to live a normal life and play games while maintaining a healthy school life and not be over burdened with work. They seemed disappointed again and told them to just let me be a teenager for a while before being an adult. All they want from me is just to study harder and not focus on other things, so I told them to be quiet because I didn't want to hear it, also because I'm playing games . They went on and told me to never talk to them like that, I knew better than to say shut up because they would have grounded my ass. Now I feel bad because I want to make my parents happy but at the same time not be miserable all my life working. They still keep bringing the subject of going to a more prestige school. AITA for not considering their opinion?",

TL:DR at the bottom. \n\nMe (20m) and my ex (20f) have been in a long distance relationship (both Europeans) for 8 months after having met on a dating app.\n\nWe recently met up in real life after I had gathered enough funds for a trip to her country. I went to my hotel with her right after landing to unpack my lgggage. She began to start foreplay and asked me to woo-hoo to which I agreed after asking her if she was sure. She mentioned multiple times online that she wanted to save herself for her true love and therefore I asked her once again if she was sure and okay with it. She was. \n\nDuring my stay I noticed she had lied about many things in her life, she lived in a different village, did not have many friends despite saying she's popular before and living wealthily whilst claiming to be poor amongst many more things. \n\nBecause of these and many other lies my love filter was removed and I started seeing another side of her. I told her I had to think about our future and ultimately decided I could not continue this relationship founded upon lies and her personality being so different in person compared to how she acts online and portraits herself.\n\nShe says I took advantage of her and some of my friends are siding with her as I had sex with her and now am dumping her just 3 weeks after. \n\nAITA for taking someone's virginity (and losing my own) to someone who I end up breaking up with shortly after?\n\nTL:DR broke up with my LDR girlfriend 3 weeks after meeting and taking her virginity because I feel her offline personality and lies were too big of an issue to continue our relationship.

None of us in the group have met before, so we introduced each other and exchanged phone numbers to keep in contact. We then split up work in to 3 sections so we could maximize efficiency on getting this paper done.\n\nThis particular group member, I'll call Bob, was working on the same section as I was so he messaged me for help. I sent him a link to one of my articles telling him to find articles related to this one. He seemed to be doing well after that and then I got another text from him. He was wondering how he should take notes. I told him I like to write paragraphs as notes, but point form works too. I also reminded him to cite his sources using the APA format to avoid plagiarism. He thanked me and I did not here from him until an hour later where he asked if he could paraphrase. I informed him that paraphrasing was fine.\n\nOur group met up the day before the project was due to put all the work together and make it sound smooth. Bob was in class during the time we were meeting up and we told him he could just send his notes and sources in by email. When we received his notes, we realized we had a huge problem in front of us; his notes were ALL paraphrases. To make matters worse, he only used the one source that I sent him as an example source that I was using. Our groups goal was for all of us to find 2 or more sources each so we would have enough. Since he used one I was using, we only had 8. Reading through his notes, I tried my best to fit it in my section, but his information was from some where else in the article I did not use.\n\nWhile I'm trying to fit his work in, my other group members are scrambling to find 2 sources. Thankfully, they found 2 and they worked on extracting information from that. At the end, we could not fit his work into the paper. We all stared at each other wondering what to do until I broke the silence saying we should just not include his work in the project. Everyone nodded in agreement but a group member asked if we should include his name in the project when we hand it in? Since Bob submitted work that was not usable with no new sources, we decided to remove him from the project.\n\nWe told him the after we were finished that he was not included in the paper. Bob was pissed off with us saying if we would have told him to get more work, he could of gotten more research done.\n\nHe had 5 days to research and write about his section and he did not do it fully.\n\nWe spent 5 hours in the library completing the paper where it was supposed to be 1 hour max.\n\nReddit\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Then, 4 years ago they broke up. A now lives in a city a couple hours away, while B and C still live in the same city as me.  At Thanksgiving dinner C got really drunk and tore into me about inviting A to things. \n\nIn particular he was referring to the fact A had come up for a wedding and crashed at my place. During that visit we made plans to go camping and invited B and C along with full disclosure A was going to be there. Because we all worked different hours we didn't arrive at the campsite together and shortly after A showed up, B got too awkward and left desite already drinking and us begging them to not drink and drive. \n\nBasically C said it is a personal attack against B that I still invite A to stuff and B takes it really hard then he has to comfort them and it's selfish of me to expect A and B to attend events together. Also, if B were to do something dangerous and get hurt (drinking and driving) due to being upset about it, that it would be my fault. \n\nI see where he is coming from but I have NEVER invited them to something without expressing the other has also been invited.

      "description": "For some context, almost every week I hang out with my best friend, we are both in a tight monetary situation atm but i care a bit less since I have a job and i'm not one to get anxious over money. When we hangout, i usually pay (food, drinks, weed, etc.) it ends up costing me around 30 to 40$ every time we chill.\n\nNow for what happened, The past week has been my spring break, so I've gone out more than I usually do, as well as hang out with my bf more than we do. I also helped him out with a money situation earlier this week, so I ended spending around 150$ with/for him. Couple days ago, our group of friends went to a bar. As i usually do, I told my friend I'd pay. We got to the bar and decided to buy a 60oz tequila (26$) and split it 3 ways (BF, other friend and me) I ended up paying 20$. When we received the tequila, my BF immediatly poured himself a glass and chugged it. The other person and I served ourselves. He then served himself another glass before chugging it and repeating the action another time. I got annoyed at that for 3 reasons.   \n1) I was mad at myself for even paying for a tequila when i knew it wasn't the best idea.  \n2) He didn't pay and drank the most out of us. \n\n3) After the third glass I made a comment like \"He's not paying yet he's chugging the drinks one after another\" and he dismissed it like it was nothing. \n\nMy friends parents live separated with \"A\" living pretty close to the designated drivers house and \"B\" living at a 30 min detour. He's currently at \"B\" so it was kind of a stretch to drive there and his phone was dead so he couldn't let his parent \"A\" know he was sleeping there. Normally he would've just slept at my house but the whole situation had me pretty upset and I didn't want him to sleep at my house. DD then dropped me off at my place and went the whole detour to drop him at \"B\".\n\n I feel like an asshole because it would've cost me nothing to \"shelter\" him for the night. I refused because I feel like I stretch myself a lot to back him (paying for stuff and I was a bit salty about the money that I just gave away without thinking) and i wanted him to deal with his own shit, but I think that by doing that I just made my friends deal with the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So my boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. He‚Äôs a very talented musician. He was in a band when we met. About a year into our relationship he joined a different band that‚Äôs much more involved. They‚Äôre moderately successful. They usually tour April-September ish. honestly, it depends on the festival season and a ton of other stuff. Also, I live in Virginia because of him. I moved here about 5 and a half years ago to help my brother and his wife out with their baby. They‚Äôre military and got transferred elsewhere about 2 years ago. My boyfriend and his family are the only family I have on this coast. ALSO I‚Äôm a flight attendant based in Boston so I travel a lot and don‚Äôt have a traditional work environment to make friends. I don‚Äôt really have any friends in Virginia. My boyfriend and his family are literally all I have here.\n\nSince college I‚Äôve always been a bit weird about my birthday. My birthday was always over spring break so I never really got to celebrate it. I can honestly recount every single birthday I‚Äôve had since I met my boyfriend. A few of them have been disappointing and we‚Äôve had issues with it before. He knows it‚Äôs important to me and the last few years he‚Äôs really tried to make it special.\n\nA couple weeks ago his band‚Äôs manager posted on their instagram that they were going to be playing at Savannah Stopover which is March 7th-8th. This was the first I‚Äôd heard of it and my birthday is the 5th. It‚Äôs at least a day‚Äôs drive down there so I asked him if he was going to be gone for my birthday. I just wanted to be prepared if he was. He said no he should be home, and that was the start of a couple weeks on the road so they probably wouldn‚Äôt be leaving until the 7th or the 6th at the very earliest. I asked him if he was sure and he said he was pretty sure. \n\nThis morning I brought it up again. He said he couldn‚Äôt imagine them leaving before the 6th and that he was pretty sure that was the start of the tour. I asked him point blank: ‚Äúare you *really* not sure or do you know you‚Äôre going to be gone for my birthday and you just want to say?‚Äù He said ‚Äúbabe, I‚Äôm telling you what I know.‚Äù \n\nI took that to heart and started planning my birthday this afternoon. I texted my best friend who lives in Boston (and is also a flight attendant) and asked her if she wanted to come visit for for my bday. She of course said yes. I said to her ‚Äúall I want for my birthday is to go to brunch and then day-drink and watch movies at home with you, boyfriend, and the kitties.‚Äù\n\nThe band has been recording some new songs about 30 min away from here. He left not long after our conversation. When he got home this evening this is the conversation we had:\n\n\nme: I invited *bff* to come down for my birthday, I hope that‚Äôs okay.\n\nbf: oooh about that. We have a show.\n\nme: excuse me? what? we just talked about this less than 12 hours ago.\n\nbf: yeah *band manager* reminded me today. we talked about it over email a few months ago and I totally forgot I said it was fine.\n\nme: what? you just said today you didn‚Äôt have any shows before savannah stopover. how did you not only forget this conversation but also forget that‚Äôs my birthday!?\n\nbf: sorry if was over email a few weeks ago and I just didn‚Äôt notice. \n\nme: seriously what the fuck I‚Äôve asked you about this multiple times over the last few weeks.\n\nbf: it wasn‚Äôt on purpose I didn‚Äôt even realize it was your birthday but even if I had I would have still said yes because it‚Äôs $1700 and we could use the money.\n\nI was speechless at that. He tried to hug me and I told him to go to bed and he went upstairs. I‚Äôm downstairs drinking wine and stewing. My feelings are really hurt. He‚Äôs come down once since and didn‚Äôt say too much but suggested I could come to the show on my birthday and tried to hug me. I pushed him off and told him to go to bed.\n\nThree years ago I went to New York for a show on my birthday and he didn‚Äôt tell anyone it was my birthday. It may as well have just been a regular day. I‚Äôm not trying to do that again. Not to mention the fact that we have cats now so if he‚Äôs gone and I go too then we have to get someone to take care of them. \n\n\nI don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I‚Äôm really upset and my feelings are really hurt. I realize this is definitely a first world problem but he knows how I feel about my birthday and could have done so many things differently to not make me feel so shitty. I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the asshole here but I want to make sure before I make a big thing of it. If I‚Äôm the asshole here I‚Äôll try to accept it and stop being upset at him. I know not everyone cares about their birthdays the way I do. \n\nVery interested in outside opinions. ",

      "description": "I was in a 1.5 year long relationship with this girl who I will call \"K\". During this time we got serious super quickly and talked about our future together and what not. \n\nOne day I walked into her house that she shared with her sister and I heard them talking about trying meth for the first time. I thought they were joking and I told them I would like some too. Apparently K's sister learned how to make meth and wants to start cooking it and selling it. I told her she is a moron for getting into that and I am leaving before I get implicated on their future crimes. K told me she is wanting to get into it too because money is tight and this seemed like an easy way to make a lot of money in a short amount of time.\n\n2 hours of arguing later, I told K that I can't be with a drug dealer. She called me closed minded and rude and threw me out.\n\n2 weeks later I walk out to my car and my tires are slashed with \"Fuck you cunt\" sprayed on my door. There is only 2 people I could think of who would do this, so I posted on Facebook, tagging them both, with a pic of my car saying, \"Thanks for the new decal cunts.\"\n\nEveryone in my comments started saying they are shocked they would do this and now people are saying \"I never liked her much anyway\" and have been de-friending her or posting anti-K stuff themselves.\n\nShe now blames me for turning everyone she knows against them and claims they had nothing to do with it.\n\nAm I the asshole for throwing them under the bus on an assumption?",

      "description": "The title is pretty tame but the truth is a lot more specific. 3 years ago I was dating someone for 6 years when she cheated on me and later went into surgery months later which changed her life.\n\nWe broke up but because of the love I had and the surgery I elected to try and be the bigger person and remain her friend and even try to mend the relationship. I went through depression and had anxiety for a few years because of what happened.\n\nShe insisted the guy she had met(cheated on me with) was an asshole, that it was a mistake and she had zero desire to ever see him again.\n\n\nFast forward a few years and I told her clearly I can't get over what happened so I won't be offended if she moved on with someone else, someone who can be there for her and all. That I'd even wait for her to find someone first because this isn't some scheme where I'm trying to hurt her feelings.\n\n\nMy only request as per the title was \"I will be your friend as long as you go with anyone but that guy. I'm not saying you can't go with him but if you do I don't want to talk to you because of the drama surrounding it.\"\n\n\nImmediately I was called an asshole and not a true friend. I was blasted by not only her but others for not being supportive. She claims that if she did go with him it would be because she hasn't been with anyone else besides me and him. She claimed as a friend I could not tell her who she could and could not date. I agree 10000% but that doesn't mean I have to be her friend in any circumstance...at least I don't think so.\n\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be involved in that?",

      "description": " I  purchased a pair of expensive wireless headphones for my dad as a gift. I got them from a large electronic chain store and got two-day shipping. They gave me the shipping information and the (third-party) delivery company's name. The day comes and I'm waiting for the package, except something comes up to where I wasn't home or with cell service and I ended up missing the delivery. I thought they would leave the package but it turns out that they need a signature. I start panicking because I'm leaving town in two days to go home and visit my parents. I'm looking on the delivery company's  website on how to get in touch with them. I try calling them and get no response. It's now around 6pm. I end up having to send an email/ fill out a concern/ question box on their website to tell them the situation. \n\nI then think that maybe the package got delivered back to one of the chain's stores in my city. I end up calling their broad help number and giving them the confirmation number and they tell me that \"Yes, they have the package.\" They then ask if I want it re-delivered back to me and I say \"Yes\". They redeliver it to me (with one day shipping) and send me new shipping info. About 30 minutes later, I get a call from the first delivery company and I explain the situation and they           \n (confused) say that they still have the package and that they can have one of their drivers drop it off after they finish their route. Confused and skeptical, but relieved, I say \"Yes!\" I finally get my package around 8:30 pm and it's the correct package. I'm happy but mentally exhausted from the day. I go online and try to cancel the other order but it says that it isn't processed yet and I can't. I'm thinking that since I signed for my package and that everything was done that maybe the other package would just be cancelled, but it wasn't. \n\nThe next morning I get a \"It shipped\" email and new shipping information for a different delivery company. Fast forward, I now have two expensive headphones (one I didn't pay for) that was shipped from Kentucky, not from one of the stores in my home city. I've asked friends and they say to keep it since a large electronic store probably wouldn't even care, but I kind of feel bad for keeping something I didn't pay for. So, WIBTA for keeping the headphones? ",

But there‚Äôs another shower he can use with the same face wash, a body soap he‚Äôs used before and is comfortable using, and he can grab his own shampoo since we use different ones. I feel as if he can take the other shower and not hurry me, but he refuses and gets mad at me. So, AITA?\n\nTl;dr: my brother doesn‚Äôt want to use another shower so he hurries me up. I don‚Äôt want him to be mad at me, but I feel as if he‚Äôs being unreasonable.",

      "description": "So I'm in my second year of college and for the entirety of the first semester, my roommate and I got along well (I'm in a double -- one room, two beds, about the size of a parking spot). I wouldn't say we're really friends but in general we're friendly with each other.   \n      \nHowever, as of late, he's honestly been REALLY pissing me off. The reason is because he's VERY often online gaming -- which I wouldn't mind -- but he's ALWAYS talking to his friends over voice chat. So my room is very rarely quiet. For context, I'd say he's on voice chat at least 3 hours a day, if not more (most I've seen is like 8). I have nothing against him or the games he plays or whatever but this behavior just REALLY pisses me off because it means my room is never quiet.         \n           \nObviously I can just put on headphones, but the room is small enough that I can still hear him if I don't blast the music (which I don't want to do for my ear's sake).    \n      \nThe other solution is of course just to go study somewhere else -- which is often what I end up doing. But this pisses me off because I have 2 extra monitors in my room which make me MUCH more productive; so whenever I have to leave my room for some quiet, I lose that extra productivity. He hasn't seemed to notice that I almost always leave when he gets online with his friend. I guess he doesn't notice that the I always take the trash out too, as he's never done it.         \n        \nIt just pisses me off. Honestly it makes me physically grind my teeth when I hear him start chatting with his friend, and once I think I punched my desk. I know that sounds like some stupid shit, I acknowledge that. But that's what happened.\n      \nTo his credit, in all other respects he is a perfectly fine roommate. Relatively clean, quiet (*when he's not gaming*), pretty personable. I honestly don't hate him I just hate this behavior.           \n     \nWhat should I do? I don't want to make my rooming situation any worse but honestly I think I'm gonna crack if I keep starting to work, only to find him starting to fucking talk again. I know it's his room too but I don't feel it's *that* unreasonable to want some fucking peace and quiet. It's not like I want him to not talk to his friends tho.     \n       \nTL;DR: My roommate and I get along just fine, but it has REALLY been pissing me off lately that he keeps chatting online with his friends because it means my room is seldom quiet. I don't know if I should ask him to cut it out b/c he has a right to room too; but at the same time I'm probably going to snap if it keeps happening.",

It was awesome!\" he replies \"I'd like it if Brie Larson wasn't in it\". \n\nSo I gathered myself a bit and replied \"I think this is something you should probably keep your opinion to yourself about for the time being seeing as i'm happy for having seen it and all\" and I get \"Ok\" back from him. \n\nThat night when I get home he's sullen and slamming doors, I ask my parents if he's okay, did something happen, and no one can figure out what's wrong so finally I ask him if he's okay and he tells me \"I'm just keeping my opinion to myself! If anyone wants to ask me anything, if anyone cares about MY opinion, they can ask from now on! I'm not gonna say nothing!\". \n\nAnd things further blew up after I told my Dad how the events unfolded and even showed him the texts and getting him involved made things worse because now my brother felt ganged up on. \n\nThe whole thing blew over but i'm left questioning my choices here because I really don't think what I said was that bad considering.

      "description": "So yesterday we got new carpet installed in our house. I have no problem with how they installed the carpet at all, but I got upset when I saw them moving my furniture back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will admit that I do not have high-quality furniture. Most of it is cheep plywood IKEA stuff, so you can't just drag it around, you have to lift it carefully or it will fall apart. To make matters worse I have made my bookcases more unstable by not adding the backing when I put them together because I like the look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen they were done, I saw them dragging my bookcases back- the whole thing was wobbling and banging into walls and several shelves fell down as this thing was yanked into place. When situating them in place, they also tried to argue with me about wedging some cardboard shims under the shelves to stabilize them more; they insisted they weren't needed and wouldn't do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen came my large reptile tank. I asked the guys if they would be more comfortable with me removing the snake from the tank before they move it as I realize some people are hinky about snakes. They declined, said it would be fine, and so I told them to just be careful. They pick it up, a guy on each side, and start SWAYING the whole tank back and forth. It was a mess, everything was displaced and my snake almost got crushed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also see that a small plastic night light has been snapped in half and thrown on the floor. Again, I understand that it's cheep and I guess I should have unplugged it, but I did not think it would be in their way and if it was, I would think they would have the sense to unplug it or at least TELL me they had broke it an apologize. Several tacks that I had pinning tapestries to my wall had been ripped out as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go downstairs and start ranting to my mom about how upset I am. I just had to get some stuff off my chest and didn't mean to make something of it, but I guess they could hear me. One guy thinks I told them to stop working, so he's yelling at the other guy to stop everything, the other guy thinks I'm looking for something I lost, and they're both yelling about each other being a \"fucking idiot.\" They also keep yelling at each other about what \"set her off.\" I'm not prudish when it comes to cursing, I curse a lot, but I think it is extremely inappropriate to curse when you're at work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents say I overreacted and that they were ONLY here to install the carpet; moving furniture is not really their job and I shouldn't expect them to be careful with it. I say that moving furniture IS part of the job and they should be more professional around clients. I get that my furniture is cheep, but I think if they'd just used a LITTLE care they would been fine. The \"set her off\" comment really bothered me too; after that they treated me like some kind of hysterical woman, but my dad says I'm too sensitive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this far, sorry for it getting so long!

We've had conversations but I wouldn't say we're friends or anything like that. \n\nAnyway, it turns out she just wants to be friends with him, or atleast that's what my brother told me. He said he tried but it was obvious she wasn't interested. Oh well.\n\nA few days later I find out by another co worker that she's actually into me (she even told her that she was frustrated that my brother talked to her instead of me) which is a huuuge surprise. I'm not too popular with the ladies if my username didn't make that obvious so I really want to jump at this chance but my brother isn't just a family member, he's one of my best friends and I wouldn't want to hurt him.

I've mentioned this issue once in a situational sense, he isn't aware it's an ongoing problem for me. \n\nMy fiance and I live together, and he works quite a bit more than i do. I do more housework than he does voluntarily, it's only fair. My issue is that he often does pretty much nothing at all on his days off. Sometimes that's fine, as there are weeks he only gets one day off and works doubles the other 6 days. I don't expect anything when that happens. \n\nI do have 3 day weekends, but every other weekend i have my son. On those days i don't do a lot of housework as I would much rather spend the time with my boy. (I still keep trash picked up and routine stuff like that.) On my off weekends i sometimes feel overwhelmed with everything there is to do. I also run a lot of the necessary errands, and I clean my dad's house on Sundays. \n\nI guess what I'm wondering is, would i be an asshole if I insisted my fiance do a little more around the house on his days off? Only on weeks he has 2 days off, and not a ton. Mostly just helping keep things picked up, keeping up with the kitchen better (we take turns with dishes), and policing his own mess a little better. I haven't said anything yet because he really is a wonderful partner and i want to keep things fair. If that means sucking it up and doing it all myself then so be it.",

At this point I was pretty annoyed because it was in front of the who class and I just said it's none of your fucking business why I'm taking this long.

My father has lost tons of money because of cons i told him were cons or because he left a wad in public. My siblings arent the brightest one cant even do anything right like simple math and she thinks shes than i am. But at her age i was excelling at everything i dont think its dyscalcula or a similar disorder. My other sibling im okay with except they are overweight and i dont rag on her for being so until she calls me names. (This ones 13 the other is 9) My father thinks i should get a job to support my self because im old enough to? Im seen as lazy because i dont do anything at home at alllllll like ... at all. I have a decent gpa composed of As and Bs and prefer to chill before college where i gotta kms getting this 4.0. I got a summer job that was lax and paid well he complained it wasnt a real one and he didnt let me spend the money earned at all even tho i was gonna save half. So tell me reddit am i the asshole for not liking them?",

      "description": "I'm at a bit of a wall at the moment, and I don't how to feel about this, I hate it. I want you guys to give me your opinion, because I can't give my own cuz I don't know what to think.\n\nBit of backstory. I met this person over the internet, and I've known/talked with her for almost 3 years now, and she really means alot to me. At one point, she was the only one I could openly talk to. This is the reason why I'm afraid I might lose her. \n\nTo the story. So I'm just late at night, playing some games and I see her online, and because no one else was online, I decided to ask her. She decline, said she was heading to bed. I thought nothing of it, but that was the last message she sent me for the next 9 days. I messaged her a couple of times in those days, but I never got an answer, not even to a simple \"Hey, how are you doing?\". I felt mortified, so I contacted her on other social medias, since discord was not working. I send her a message, asking why the ignoring and all that. All I wanted was a simple answer on 'why?', but she couldn't even give me that. 3 days go by and I get desperate. I send a message saying \"Soooo... that's it? Nothing, ever again?\" 24 hours go past, and I finally got a message. What it contained, broke my fucking heart. She hadn't answered to me because one of her relative had died and she had had a pretty horrible week. I hated myself in that very second I read that. I apologized to her so many times and and I felt SOOOO bad. Haven't heard from her for 3 weeks after that message. I'm feeling really depressed about this shit and I don't know what to do. \n\nI'm sorry that this might not be more like AITA but a clusterfuck of my emotions, but I didn't any other place to post this. Thank you &lt;3",

I tell my parents and they say they can pay for the flight.\n\nMy friend and I both worked out specific dates that work for us on our college breaks. We eventually nailed down a time. This is important because my friend has grandparents that are like family to me. We were going to drive 4 hours north of his house to see them at their lake house. They needed a specific time that we planned on going. \n\nAfter locking in the dates, I gave my parents the information to purchase the tickets. \n\nThis is where it gets juicy. Dad claims he never once committed to paying for the plane tickets. And that I‚Äôm going to have to pay for them myself. I‚Äôm a poor college student. I literally can‚Äôt. \n\nMom says she never said it either. Though they had said that they would only three weeks before. \n\nThey tell me that it was rash of me to pick dates, and that I‚Äôm selfish for assuming they will pay for it. They tell me to call my friend and tell him that I can‚Äôt go because some family issues just came up.\n\nI tell them that‚Äôs not going to happen. \n\nI said in text ‚ÄúYeah! I will call Jeff. And I‚Äôll tell him I can‚Äôt because my parents are backing out on promises they have made to me for years.‚Äù I then said that I would call Jeff‚Äôs parents.

Last year I went, had no friends there with me (that is important), and it was an overall incredibly depressing experience. The reason it‚Äôs important my friends didn‚Äôt go is because I asked them to go. For weeks. I bought a ticket, and my family ended up making me go anyway. Afterwards, my friends didn‚Äôt apologize until i explained and prompted them, and then they said I should have really forced them to buy tickets and reminded them more. \n\nBack in current time, it has come around yet again and one of my friends has really been rallying us to go. I wasn‚Äôt too interested in going in the first place, but I did say I would go because she seemed really excited. To prepare, I asked the guy I really liked to go as my date. Long story short for that, there was a massive misunderstanding and he has a girlfriend and I canceled it due to my intention of it being a legitimate date. However, that left me quite sad and dateless. \n\nI really made my mind up that there is no way in hell I‚Äôm going, and once I told my friends, they got quite angry about it. \n\nIt is definitely my fault for not telling them earlier or warning them. I also said it in a way that came off really aggressive and bitchy, and I‚Äôve apologized for both of those things at this point.  One of them got really guilt trippy over the whole thing because she doesn‚Äôt have a date and will probably be lonely (she‚Äôs very quiet and introverted). Even after knowing I won‚Äôt be attending, she has bought a ticket and continues to be a bit touchy about it. \n\nAITA for changing my mind, for the ways I‚Äôve tried to handle the situation, or for not wanting to go? \n\n ",

      "description": "Throwaway for... ya know \n\nSo a dog showed up a few weeks ago and we really didn‚Äôt think anything of it. People are always dropping dogs off in the country and they find a decent home with us. There are already 7 dogs here, all large mixed breed since we lost the pug to cancer a few years back. This ‚Äúnew dog‚Äù (hasn‚Äôt earned his name yet) is the sweetest pup ever. Probably 2-3 years old, solid white, moved into the house like he‚Äôd always lived here. He‚Äôs a bit on the smaller side but the other dogs treat him like he‚Äôs just as big as his personality. They love him, we love him, it‚Äôs been a determinably good time having him around.\n\nDown to the problem. \n\nWe heard recently from a neighbor that a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù had been in the area, we‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúS‚Äù for Suspicious. Now our family and friends are close with S and her mother ‚ÄúB‚Äù for bigmouth. \n\nS had come to visit B but had experienced car trouble along the trip and required B to pick her up. This is important later.\n\nSo the neighbor said S had visited at almost exactly the same time the dog appeared. And B knew from family connections that we had a number of wayward curs. It‚Äôs possible that B has informed S of our willingness to take in abandoned dogs. B had also talked to us a few times about S‚Äôs dogs, often mentioning neglect. But none of these things really came together until the neighbor mentioned S had been in the area when the dog showed up.\n\nWe talked to B and she acted almost overly surprised. We just mentioned that a dog had come up a few weeks back and she acted like she‚Äôd never heard of such a thing. So my thinking is, she picked up S and the dog, and knowingly dropped the dog off nearby. \n\nUnder this assumption, would we be the assholes if we told B that the dog had started a fight and been killed by the other, much larger dogs? Since B already knows the dog is here and happy, we worry S might try dropping off more dogs and we can‚Äôt feed and house all the dogs in the world. If both of them thought this sweet pup had met a horrible demise, they might not be so quick to just drop off dogs without even asking us if we‚Äôd care for them.\n\nWIBTA?",

      "description": "This happened about two nights ago. \n\nBasically some of my best friends and my girlfriend go to happy hour and we get a little tipsy. We‚Äôre catching up on what happened during the week and I asked if they had voted. One of my friends is a Republican but he doesn‚Äôt vote or really stay in the know with current politics at all. So when I bring voting up, naturally we all start getting into politics...\n\nFrom this point on I would like to clarify a few things. I‚Äôd like to call myself independent but definitely leaning left. Also, I‚Äôm a pretty blunt person or so I have been told. Furthermore, while in the midst of this convo I am probably over .08 and whatever small filter I had is gone. (Side Note: HopDoddy happy hour is actually the best happy hour in the US. 5 dollars for a margarita with a coronita bottle in it. I had 2.) \n\nSo to go on, I‚Äôm mildly drunk at this point and am just hating on the US govt entirely, but you know, it‚Äôs just so easy to bag on our current administration so I do that too. My friend who is Republican is actually agreeing with lots of the points that I am making. Nice. \n\nSo I ask him, ‚ÄúSo, right now you‚Äôd call yourself Republican?‚Äù He says, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I ask, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù\n\nHe goes on to tell me he just doesn‚Äôt like some of the lefts policies. He says he is very anti-abortion except in very severe circumstances.\nYada yada yada tells me the whole thing most Christians say on why they are Republican. Then he says he doesn‚Äôt like Affirmative Action. I say totally understandable there are some cons coming out of it that I too can see. Though, I question it furthermore. I think at this point we actually just start bickering about systematic racism while still somehow talking about Affirmative Action. (He believes there is no systematic racism at all, and that he could almost say that POC are starting to have a slight advantage, especially when talking about university applications.) I tell him okay the university thing is fair a critique. Then I go on about how POC get overlooked when it comes to jobs all the time still simply because of their name. Then I give him a hypothetical.\n\nI say, ‚ÄúImagine Steve and Sharkeisha apply for a job with both basically the same background and credentials, who do you think people would hire?‚Äù \nHe says, ‚ÄúWell logically, Id hire Steve because someone named Sharkeisha doesn‚Äôt seem like someone you can take seriously.‚Äù\nVery bluntly I tell him, ‚ÄúYou sound so racist right now. And that‚Äôs the reason Affirmative Action exists.‚Äù\n\nBasically everyone in our group goes quiet and he kinda laughs and says he‚Äôs getting a phone call and steps out of the restaurant for a few minutes. When he comes back I do not apologize, but I change the subject and we leave the restaurant and actually go back to his house and have a pretty good night after that.\n\nThinking about it now though I don‚Äôt feel good about what I said and am definitely feeling like a asshole. AITA?\n\nAlso on mobile so formatting is probably messed up.\n",

She still claims to be attracted to both men and women and therefore to me is bi. \n\nMy problem arises as she refuses to identify that way, saying she's gay - I normally wouldn't have a problem with this as you are who you are and identify how you identify, however since this she's been acting like I'm not bi because I'm in a hetro relasionship currently. It also doesn't help that her new girlfriend keeps making jokes about how my 'heterosexuality makes her feel sick' ie making the joke that most commonly people say that to people in homosexual relasionships. \n\nSo AITA for wanting her to for wanting her to not see being bi as a bad/lesser thing than being gay?",

He asked how far along are they with their meal, i said they're already eating. Then and there he decided to cut me and make the other server keep the table. Moments later the server who i considered a friend tells me angrily \"Thanks for making me close\". \n\nTried talking to him explaining basically the breakdown of what happened but he wasn't having any and is just mad at me and now is going all over the restaurant trying to badmouth me. Also overheard him saying how he wasn't gonna help me next time i ask for a favor and shit, which isn't a big deal, except he lives with 5/6 other servers who work there and it might affect my work relationships.\n\nWent home mad because if there's anything that gets my gear going it's when people question my work ethic.",

      "description": "I was on this subreddit for a game I like, here's a link to my post that made people upset: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/amrt2h/state\\_of\\_the\\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/amrt2h/state_of_the_game/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat happened, is that I haven't played the game in a while, mainly because it had an update that really screwed with my emersion, basically, it made various biomes that were usually, and righteously, (to me) exclusive to only spawn on planets that suit them, this means no snow-biomes on a volcanic planet, no lush oasis's on a post-apocalyptic ruin planet (also know as a scorch planet) now, I was thinking of hopping into this game again, but I wanted to know if the addition that made we lose interest was ever addressed or not, that was when I made the post you see above, the answer I got on this post was a very large, and long post of the entire change-log of the most recent update, of which I had already read, I thought that the person who had posted it was upset with me, because it seemed odd to me to post the ENTIRE change-log right there, instead of just typing up a response to my question, this was when I said, \"Woah...damn, how bored, or pissed off are you?\"\n\nTo which, the Subreddit Elder said, \"I'm not either. This is a question that's asked so often that I've had this exact thing on standby, formatting and all, for a while. It's trivial to add to it whenever there's an update, and just copy-and-paste it when someone asks about the state of the game.\"\n\nI had no problem with that. We both kept on having a peaceful conversation, and although we were disagreeing on the fact that the game feature that I didn't like was good or not, we weren't insulting each other or anything, everything felt good, until two other subreddit member said this, \"This is really how you respond when someone gives you an informative, comprehensive answer to your question? I know I'm not your mom, but seriously kid, get some manners.\"\n\n...I mean, we both had moved on from my original response, but this did make me feel bad.\n\n\"Also, nobody talks to (Name of Subreddit Elder) like that while we stand by. (Name of Subreddit Elder) has been here for us practically since the inception of this subreddit. Probably the most statistically helpful one on here.\"\n\nI decided to remove the name of the guy I apparently terribly disrespected just in case any if his friends are here to stand up for him in a bias way, if it helps my case at all, I did post an apology to these people, \n\n\"Uh, I meant no offence, I really thought that linking the entire change-log was due to repeatedly being asked this, and he was upset with me, I didn't know he was just giving me the change-log, I guess I shouldn't assume the worst of people all the time, I am very sorry.\"\n\nSo, what I want to know is, was I really acting that mean with context, or were they just acting a bit sensitive due to how much they respect this guy?",

      "description": "He will probably see this but anyway, my best friends girlfriend for a year and I started talking and became really good friends last fall. He and she were the absolutly closest friends I've ever had. I've been batteling with depression for the last couple of years and I always felt that they made it better. I always made sure they were okay with talking about such a heavy topic and tried to leave room for them to take breaks. I did not want to be a depressive burden. But they were often supportive even though I explicitly told them not to do anything if they don't feel like it. I apprechiated honesty over faked support.\n\nFast forward to last week when I tried meeting up with his girlfriend. She made excuses and I eventually called her out and asked if she didn't want to meet. She told me she was cutting off a lot of people and that it wasn't personal. She just needed a break. I thanked her for her honesty and respected that she wanted to be alone.\n\nLater that week she met up with another mutual friend, I asked about the cutting off and that it was hard to not take it personal when I seemed to be the only one she wanted to cut off. She told me she lied. She wanted to stop speaking with me, I started questioning if our whole friendship was built on lies. If she ever even liked me or just felt responsible to help my depression. A lot went through my head and I needed a break, I didn't wan't to think about this at all. I told my friend about it and how i'm cutting contact with him and his girlfriend to be able to focus on other things and not be anxious about my trust issues. I tried explaining and he told me to go to hell. I dont want to hurt either of them, I just feel like I need a break.",

      "description": "* So I live in shared housing with 5 other people while I study  at university and contract  renewal for next year is due. The landlord only requires 3 people to sign for the house to be secured for next year and I was not one of those people as I was unsure what my plans were for next year. \n* Anyway over the summer one of my friends got a girl pregnant and he plans to move back home to support the family. I really respect him for making the best of a 'bad' situation but at the same time it''s left the rest of us in a jam. \n* The house is now a person short and if he backs out at the last minute it could cost us all an extra ¬£600 a month which most of us simply cannot afford. \n* Now in my eyes he has signed the contact and is therefore liable to pay it however i believe he can contact the landlord and cancel the contract as we didn't all sign.\n* The part that makes me feel like an ass hole is that he is my friend and I want the best for him but by no fault out our own 4 of us are having to pay an extra ¬£600 we can't afford for his 'mistakes'. \n* I really want to support my friend but at the same time I feel like the financial burden should't fall on us. \n* So AITA for holding him to his commitment while he has a child due?",

      "description": "My gf and I are huge Game of Thrones fans. In the past we‚Äôve always watched the show together, invited over friends, I would provide the beer, and she would cook a bunch of food for everyone to eat since she loves cooking and trying new recipes.\n\nWe both always had weekends off so this was never an issue before. But since the last season she‚Äôs gotten a new job as a flight attendant - and she‚Äôs gone for sometimes up to 5 to 6 days at a time, which includes Sunday‚Äôs.\n\nToday we were discussing the upcoming new season and she said that I better wait to watch it with her when she‚Äôs out of town or she‚Äôll be mad at me. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt mind putting it off a day or two but if she happens to be out of town for a week I don‚Äôt know if I want to wait. It‚Äôs not just about the anticipation, I‚Äôm not that impatient. But I‚Äôd have to avoid social media (including reddit) because I don‚Äôt want to be spoiled before I see the episode. I talk to a lot of my friends about game of thrones too and I‚Äôve always watched it live so chances are they may assume I‚Äôve seen the episode and spoil it.\n\nShe was really upset by this especially because she is the one who originally got me into the show to begin with, and always saw it as our thing. Which is true but I also enjoy getting together with friends and viewing the episode, which in this case would only be an option if she is in town.\n\nI offered to watch it on FaceTime or Skype with her but she says she doesn‚Äôt want to miss out on the get togethers and she enjoys more than just the show but other aspects (cooking for people and drinking, which she doesn‚Äôt do ‚Äúon the job‚Äù).\n\nI told her that it‚Äôs selfish to expect not only me but all of our friends to hold off on watching the new episode until she gets back from her trips. She said it‚Äôs not ‚Äútrips‚Äù it‚Äôs work and if I were working she would wait for me to watch the episode together. And that she‚Äôs not dating our friends she‚Äôs dating me so they don‚Äôt have to wait but if I don‚Äôt wait for her I am being disrespectful. I told her she‚Äôs being over dramatic about this whole thing and now she is pissed.\n\nAm I the asshole here or is she being unreasonable?",

      "description": "I don't live in the USA, and I hid the actual numbers for privacy reasons.\n\nbackstory: we are foreigners who don't live in our home country. Brother and I used to live with our parents. We decided to move out because we were getting emotionally abused. Our situation wasn't the best, but we managed to find a place after a while, and we lived semi frugally pay check to pay check to be able to afford living by ourselves. Brother had furniture and we set the whole place up with all the needed appliances (Fridge, couches, TV, microwave...etc. All high end if that matters).\n\nSome months later I got a 25% raise, so I wanted to help my friend (Let's call him L) from my home country to come to the country I live in and find work. I paid for his visa, ticket and all expenses until he got up on his feet so he'd live with us and help with the rent and all. We expected L to find a job that pays around 75% of my salary (Expected salary for new graduates) but by a stroke of good luck he found a job that almost doubles my salary.\n\nAfter he got the job, we agreed that L and I would pay around 40% of the rent each, and my brother would pay around 20%. I calculated and kind of decided everything as L and my brother don't like to discuss money matters and they weren't very familiar with each other. I kind of made that choice because I didn't want to cause issues, and because the furniture is brother's so it makes sense for him to pay less.\n\nNow, L wants to help our other friend (Let's call him H) the same way. We were discussing how the rent distribution is gonna be, and they wanna split it evenly between the 4 of us. I gave it some more thought and I think it's unfair that we'd split the rent evenly between the 4 of us, when my brother and I were the ones that got the deal on the place, set it all up with furniture and appliances, and if not for my help he wouldn't have found a job or be able to help our other friend (I know it's an asshole thought, but I wanna be honest. Thought does come up often on my mind).\n\nRight now, I think that L and H paying 33% of rent each is fair. It even got me to rethink the original arrangement 3 of us had, and I think L paying around 50% of rent, instead of both of us paying the same amount, is fair too, all things considered. I deduced these prices by comparing our living space with similar ones in our city, and I don't think they will find any better offers, especially considering the readily available furniture and appliances. Excluding the peace of mind as our living space is a section of a villa, and not a room inside an apartment like most other living spaces are (We don't share same kitchen/Bathroom with other residents as apartment roommates would, and we have our own entrance). I should mention they can afford these rents with no issues, I used to pay more than the amount I suggest with less salary.  \n\n\nAITA for thinking about the whole thing this way?",

      "description": "I live in an apartment above a store. There's two doors from the street; one to get into the store one that goes to my apartment (unit 2). My door is clearly marked with \"unit 2\" and the street address on it, not 10 ft from the store entrance which is clearly a store. Several months ago when  I first moved in I got a package delivered from amazon's carrier to the store instead of my apartment. Once I realized that's where the missing package likely ended up I went down to the store and the store owner I'd never met was shockingly annoyed that he had to deal with handing me this box because he was far too busy in his completely empty store. Went off a rant about how it was not his job to keep track off my boxes and I better make sure this never happens again. Kept on rambling even as I was walking out. (Seriously can't believe how much of a dick he was about such a minor inconvenience if you can even call it that.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I called amazon's custom support told them that it had been delivered to the wrong door and we both confirmed that the delivery address was indeed unit 2 she told me they'd send a message to the carrier that it had been delivered to the wrong place and to make sure future delivery's were sent to the door marked unit 2. Additionally I added a delivery instruction \"make sure to deliver to the door marked unit 2 and not the store\". I received a couple future packages from UPS and FEDEX without any issue. When I was picking up one of the packages the driver even mentioned the note, saying it had been helpful so the drivers clearly do see them, though I can't see why it's not clear in the first place this doesn't seem like all that unusual of a scenario for a delivery man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday the status of my package sent via amazon's carrier changed to \"handed to resident\" when I, the only resident in my apartment, was not handed any package and there was none outside of my apartment. Assumingly it was handed to the store again. I called amazon custom support told them I never got the package that was supposedly handed to me in person and they just said \"maybe he scanned it and forgot to deliver it call back if you don't have it tomorrow.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClearly the amazon carrier is at fault here but AITA for not just getting my package? Besides just not wanted to deal with the store owner again I want to make sure this never happens again and if I get it from downstairs I'm sure next package will be dropped off there again. On the other hand there's also the chance, that seems pretty likely, no ones going to investigate the missing package and the same deliver guy will just drop off the replacement to the store again (plus it's obviously wasteful).",

      "description": "My ex and I get along incredibly well, he's actually one of my best friends. Let's call him Jon for now. We both support a band that some mutual acquaintances of ours play in and have gone to every single show together. Tonight the band is having a performance and he asked me if I was interested in going since it is so close after I get out of work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said I was iffy because I'm behind on a few projects for work and possibly had dinner plans, but I would update him the week of. On Wednesday, I told Jon I might go because I caught up pretty well and asked if he was going.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said yeah, but he invited his roommate. I was happy because the headcount for each band is really important for them being able to get booked and his roommate is a nice enough guy. Then he tells me he invited five or six other people and they are close friends of his.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Jon's friends are very nice people, I only saw them a handful of time while we were dating and they really liked me. But while they are kind they don't ever seem to respect that myself and my ex are not getting back together. They make commentary about us in a romantic way that makes me uncomfortable which my ex just brushes off as them busting his balls. I'm a socially anxious person already, so those kinds of things set me into full panic mode and I avoid accompanying Jon to outings with people that were close when we dated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I hear this and I kind of panic so I try to make myself sound flakey, but Jon picks up on this and asks if now I'm going to avoid going because his friends are going. I lie and say no, but he knows how I feel about them so he doesn't believe me. Through the phone I can hear him sigh kind of heavy and he says that he hates that I do this. Now Jon isn't the only person I do this to because of anxiety (curse my social butterfly friends), but he is definitely the one I do it the most to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot long after he hangs up on me with some excuse that his roommate got home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday I messaged him that I had a new project and I wasn't showing up. He replied that two of his friends, a really sweet couple, said that was too bad and that they miss me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad about not going because I know its an important show for the band, so I figured I can compromise by bringing a friend with me so I won't be left alone with Jon's group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut... it is going to be very obvious that I'm coming out with someone in order to avoid being with his friends and there is a 75% chance that he'll be upset. And the only person I can go with is a female friend of mine that Jon really doesn't like. (Kind of a central figure to me breaking up with him)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA to show up with her in order to avoid being alone with his friends?",

Quite a lot of those things escalated in the last couple weeks especially. As a result, I haven't been in the most cheerful mood; mostly just feeling really down/stressed. \n\nI admittedly can be bad about asking for help when I need it, but many of my friends have been very supportive of me recently, &amp; I sincerely appreciate it.  But it also weirdly makes me feel like I'm being an asshole for being around my friends when I just feel like a big buzz kill? It kind of makes me feel like an ass for having people extend such kindness to me when I don't think I'm a particularly pleasant person to be around atm &amp; I wouldn't want to lose any friendships because of it. I don't know if it would just be better to not be an annoyance to people until I can get myself together a bit more, if that makes sense. \n\nI'm not totally sure if this is the right place for this post, but many of the responses here seem to be insightful &amp; I just want to know if I'm being too in my head about this or if I'm being an asshole for subjecting the people I care about to my poor mood/attitude?",

After the event she meant to send a message to a friend but instead sent it to me that said I was a shitty date, which to be fair I was not the best date however I had previously expressed my disinterest in a relationship so things were quite awkward at the event.

      "description": "We are both 21 and in college. We dated our freshman year and broke up, but we're still friends. Not best friends, but we are in the same group and hang out pretty regularly. Ultimately we weren't compatible as a couple but our sex life was never the problem, or at least that's what I thought. We had lots of sex and she would frequently tell me that she came. Obviously she didn't say it like that, but I am trying to be brief and not too graphic.\n\nSo the other day me and her and a couple of our mutual friends are hanging out, and one other girl makes a comment about how she's never had an orgasm. My ex replies, \"Don't worry about it, I didn't have my first orgasm until this year.\" I was not trying to be graphic or anything in front of our friends, but this threw me for a loop so I was just like \"Uhhh that can't be right, remember?\" which she just replied to like \"Oh yeah, I thought for a long time that I was orgasming but then I found out I wasn't.\" And again we were hanging out with friends so I just dropped it. But thinking about it I am actually pretty annoyed, not to mention embarrassed both by her basically calling me out for never making her cum and for not being able to say anything back to her saying she *thought* she was coming, which just makes me look like an idiot.\n\nI am really annoyed and I kind of want to call her on it, but privately.

The scammer responds with some emoji spam before blocking him.

He agrees and after taking the payment in the form of a gift card, I send the code to my friend who was scammed and block the guy who ripped him off (that I just ripped off). \n\nSo where does this put me?

Reason for this being that she needs to do some training that would have involved her leaving her dog at pet hotel if I wasn't here. Since we left, I have been yelled at no less than a dozen times for a range of things including:\n\nChanging the route from one that wasn't even expressed to me as having been fully intended even though it added an extra hour to an already 20 hour drive being done over the course of 2 days.\n\nMissing telling her to turn in certain places when she was too busy yelling at someone on the phone to pay attention to what i was saying.\n\nMistakenly being honest with the apartment manager about when the packed and shipped possessions were going to be here when i was supposed to say nothing. The latter of which i was not informed about.\n\nWalking 10' away from a shopping cart which in fairness to her had a purse in it. (I did this more than once, I haven't had a SO in several years and had simply forgotten the rules of being in a store with a woman.)\n\nAttempting to explain that she can't do anything about the apartment not being 100% ready to move in upon her arrival and that if she's just patient management will get things done in the course of the next several weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give her side of the story she graduated with an MBA recently and since then she had been seeking work in her chosen field. She got an opportunity that agreed to pay approximately half of her moving expenses, which haven't been cheap by any means. She had to break a lease and pay a deposit on a new one, ship the vast majority of her belongings by mover which costed a bundle. She started a period while we were on the road which I'm sure didn't help anything. She's also just under a lot of pressure for this to work out, it took her a long time to do all this and she's already in very deep with all the expenses and if things don't work out she'll have a lot more problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm trying so hard to be as accommodating and pleasant as I can possibly be. I understand that she's under a lot of pressure and stressed out about things that have been going on.  I'm big on doing what I say, and I don't want to just leave her high and dry. However, it feels as if there should be a limit to the amount of abuse I'll just take. Am I the asshole for wanting to just walk ",

      "description": "A bit of backstory about me, since it's relevant to the story, but I'll try to keep it short.\nI was diagnosed with clinical depression (and anxiety) in highschool, after a few suicide attempts. At the end of my third year especially I reached a lowest, and I basically turned into a shut-in. I became easily irritable and waking up in the morning to go to school was a challenge. One day I just couldn't make it and my mom, who was under a lot of pressure because of my situation, didn't take it too well. She started yelling at me, throwing insults about my mental state, so I got so hurt that I stopped thinking straight: I jumped at her and wrapped my hands around her neck, trying to choke her. I came back to my senses a few seconds after and immediately let go. I won't use my mental illness as an excuse, what I did was deplorable and it's something that keeps haunting me even today. After that event, me and my mom together had a session with my (at the time) counselor. We talked a lot and I apologised profusely to her. Today we have a wonderful relationship and I feel incredibly lucky.\nAt this point you may wonder how all of this relates to my (4 years) older brother. Well, the thing is, he was actually present to that episode (and restrained me). Right after it happened he didn't say much, but one day he just came to me and started spouting a bunch of awful things to me, specifically regarding how much of a failure I am. He was fully aware of my suicidal attempts and depression, and attacked me right where it hurt the most. My mom told me that he did that because he couldn't forgive me for what I did, but I really can't understand why if me and my mom already went over it. After that, he said that he didn't want to talk to me anymore, so I went along with it. Right now I am trying to keep my distance from him as much as I can, hopefully cutting ties with him completely one day. I feel like he literally tried to instigate me to kill myself, and never even tried to fix that by talking about it. I honestly don't think I can forgive him, but I understand I did something terrible as well. So, I would like to know, AITA in all of this?",

His biggest fear , which he stated clearly to her numerous times, was that there might be somebody else and she repeatedly assured him that this was not the case.  Over a month passed, during which he nearly went out of his mind while she basically ghosted him, refusing to give him any clarity of whether they were over or not.  \nThis was a tough time for his closest friends as well because he confided in us and we were in full damage control mode trying to keep his spirits up.  She eventually got back to him and a week or two after they resumed regular dating she finally admitted that she had been seeing somebody else during that \"I need space\" period.  \n\nWe've now made it absolutely clear to him that she's not welcome in our homes or social functions and, while accepting of this at first, he's hinted a few times that this is placing strain on him.  The funny thing is that even in the good times when they first started seeing each other, she never so much as attempted to introduce her friendship circle to ours, so her social background is a mystery to us other than what information he has offered up. \nMeanwhile she continues to eat up almost every moment of his weekends and has him regularly taking her out to expensive restaurants for dinners and lunches while we battle to even get him to join us for a beer unless she's out of town.   \nI'm trying my best to be there for my buddy, but I honestly want nothing to do with her and neither do any of us. \n\ntl;dr - My close buddy's gf benched him, cheated on him, lied to him repeatedly and he still took her back. Now I don't want anything to do with her any more.  \n \nAITA?",

      "description": "Obligatory excuse the grammar and stuff, etc. Long post so tl;dr at the bottom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here's a bit of history first that's probably needed -\n\nI was in college away from home. I moved in with these two girls I sort of knew at the time, but they were still kind of new friends to me. It wasn't a great living situation, more like the \"I'll fake conversion until you go away so I can go back into my room\" stuff. They both got more bitchy as time went on but I just sucked it up while I was there until my (then) boyfriend got home and I could go stay with him. They invited people over on weeknights without my consent who smoke and drank and were loud until 2am even after I asked them to quiet down because I had classes in the morning. One girl has her boyfriend over almost literally 24/7. The only time he would leave was when he would go home maybe once a week. He showered (in our shared bathroom, can't tell you how many times I stepped on what was hopefully mucus whenever I tried to shower), did laundry, kept his food in our pantry, and kept his weed outside on our balcony and sometimes inside. He is basically an illegal tenant, not on the lease, not paying rent or any utilities yet living with us. He also invited his friends and family over to stay our place rather than his own without asking. These girls also poisoned my cat with ibuprofen. Whether purposely or accidentally, I don't know. They hated him despite knowing I had him before agreeing to live with me. When I confronted them about it, they said the cat must have opened the childproof bottle himself (which I tested by throwing the bottle off the counter - the lock stayed on surprisingly!) and denied even accidentally leaving a pill out. That was a fun emergency vet bill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround the beginning of October, things were really rough for me. My depression and anxiety were through the roof, my grades were failing, my living situation with my roommates was incredibly hostile, my cat was poisoned, my boyfriend of two years broke up with me with no explanation, and I just couldn't take it anymore. I packed my things up and went home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been home for three months now. I've paid rent ($600) every month I haven't been there while trying to find a girl to take over my lease. The only way they will let me out of the lease is if the girls both agree to taking me out. But in order to do so, I have to help find a replacement. 'Help' being the key word. I've found three girls over the course of this who were interested in taking over my lease, all who \"didn't work out\" when my roommates told me why they wouldn't be taking over my lease. They've done nothing to help find someone to replace me. I have another girl (a foreign exchange student) who is interested in taking over the lease when she arrives, but they haven't been able to FaceTime yet so I don't know if it will work out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRent is due on the 5th and my parents just told me they won't be paying. So my hope was that things would work out with this girl quickly and she could take over before I have to use my credit card to pay (which of course I'd really prefer not to do for obvious reasons.) I sent a text to my roommates basically telling them of my situation, and saying that I really need things to work out with this girl for me. They replied back hostilely saying I was responsible no matter what (which I understand of course) and that I couldn't tell them how to make things work with this girl, who again, is the third one I've found after they refused the first two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, I'm pissed. I've been paying for the months I'm not there which I understand is fair, however: this is the third girl I've found. I've done my part three times, each time that \"didn't work out\", while they've done nothing. I understand that I'm the one who left and so I have to help, but in the lease, it only says I have to HELP find a replacement, not find one altogether. Let alone three times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parent's view on this is just the same. They're tired of paying rent for a place I'm not living at when I've done my part and the roommates have done nothing. So here's the part I'm asking if I'm going to be an asshole on -\n\nMy parents want to hire a lawyer (my dad's friend) to tell them basically this: Remove me from the lease or we tell the apartment every breach of lease they've done and get it terminated altogether.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where the history comes in. The illegal tenant, the weed (which is legal in my state if you're over 21, however none of them are), the poisoning of my cat (animal abuse), and everything else they've done the lawyer says will terminate the lease entirely. This will not only get me out of the lease, but them as well and they'll have to find a new place to live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do feel bad for having to possibly resort to this, but both my parents and I are tired of dealing with them and feel this is the only way to get me out now. Depending on how things go with the foreign exchange student I've found who's willing to move in, I'll update this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - I lived with hostile roommates, moved out, and have found multiple people to take over my lease all who my roommates have refused. WIBTA for resorting to taking actions into legal matters and threatening to get them kicked out as well for their breaking of the lease if they don't release me from the lease?",

      "description": "So backstory, four years ago, I was on exchange with two of my close friends, A and B, overseas in South Korea. They chose two schools that were close by each other and thus were able to room together in an external apartment while I had to room in my own school‚Äôs dormitory, which was about 30 minutes away by train. A flew to Seoul 3 ‚Äì 4 days prior, while B and I took a flight together. As the earliest date that my dorm would accept admission was the next day after my flight, I had to room with A and B for the day of my arrival and I‚Äôd pay for it. Since I was heading the same direction, B convinced me to split the cab fare from the airport to her apartment with her, although I was perfectly fine with lugging my own luggage around and reach there eventually. (She is a petite person with two luggage). Reluctant because I was cash-strapped but I agreed.\nI was not a person with good directions, much less in a country with primarily foreign language. During the ride from the airport, I casually asked her whether it was alright for her to follow me to my dormitory the next day to get me settled in as well, since I was bad with directions afterall. B agreed and was nice about it. Fast forward to when I settled in their apartment for the night, their landlord was nice to offer us all a lunch treat the next day and possibly a tour. A was excited and brought up the idea of walking around the area with B, and I casually brought up that B had agreed to follow me along to settle in my luggage and accommodations as well since both A and B were well settled. \nA just let out a horrified look and said ‚ÄòYou expect us to bring you to your school?‚Äô and gave B a look while B avoided glances with me and said ‚ÄòYeah, I meant like, we‚Äôll see how it goes. I mean, we also have to find the route to our own schools as well.‚Äô And that was it and I was so crushed. I had to go to my school by myself to settle for the first day in the cold-ass weather (I‚Äôm from Malaysia, so it‚Äôs summer all year round here).\nWhile I understand their own concerns of getting familiar with their own environment, I felt really betrayed, and couldn‚Äôt believe that they would leave me to find my own way to my dormitory in this kind of weather with my luggage‚Ä¶\nMy question is AITA for resenting my friends in this situation? Was I being entitled for expecting my friends to show some decency to at least accompany me on my first day to my dormitory in a foreign country?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I started dating almost 2 years ago. We do not live together. He has a 14 year old daughter from a previous girlfriend, who broke up with him for her now-husband shortly after said daughter was born. My boyfriend raised his daughter on his own for a a few years, but now she lives primarily with her mother and step father.  My boyfriend has custody on weekends.\n\nI understand the importance of the time they have together, and I like spending time with my own family (very sickly grandfather), so I spend my weekends seeing my family, and he spends his weekends with his. We rarely ever see each other on weekends. \n\nI spend time with him and his family (parents, siblings, daughter) on special occasions and celebrations when they invite me. They're all very very nice people. But I don't try to make time to be closer to them in general.\n\nI guess I'm just wondering if I'm the asshole for not trying to be closer to them, especially his daughter. I'm not rude or cold or standoffish when we are together but sometimes I feel weird that I don't try- if she lived with my boyfriend I think the dynamic might be different, or I'd try harder, but as things are, I'm not sure if I should. I understand she has a complicated family life and there is drama (not involving me) but I don't really know if I should be doing anything in particular... I guess I don't know what my place should be, so I do nothing.\n\nShould I, by virtue of being in a relationship with a man with a daughter, automatically consider myself akin to her step mother? \n\nIf I had a kid with my boyfriend, would I automatically have to treat our kid and his daughter the same? Or would that only be the case if he and I were to get married? If we don't get married, WIBTA if I didn't treat his daughter as my own? \n\nI have no inclinations on this, but it's something I wonder sometimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for telling my sister to leave me alone",
      "description": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\nGoing to be a long story.\n\nBackstory:\n\nIm (19f) the youngest in the family and I get treated as like it. Im not going to say a specific number but I have more than 3 sisters. I have a very overprotective narcissistic mother, whenever I argue against her, she will talk behind my back to my sisters on the phone = which leads my sisters arguing with me in the end; basically my mother always turns the whole family against me if I dont listen to her. In case youre wondering, my mother argues on what I should do in the future and what I dont = break up with my bf, never move out of the house, pay her back on her raising me, etc. Its exhausting, frustrating, and it gave me depression/anxiety because of it, knowing that no one in the family will never listen to you and no freedom. We‚Äôre not an emotional supportive family type, most likely a financial supportive type. So theres nothing much I get out of this family.\n\nSometimes most of my sisters will offer to listen on why I hate talking to mother and why I always disagree with her. I cant stand her, even thinking of her makes my blood boil. Claiming I should always be at home and never leaving the house even if I get my degree because Im the youngest, it wasnt fair and home felt like prison = mother always claimed it was because she did it to ‚Äúprotect me‚Äù and always said ‚Äúyoure a terrible daughter for leaving me‚Äù. \n\n\n\nSo the story goes:\n\n\n\nRight after I got into college I desperately wanted to move out, I wanted to get away from mother as much as I could. My depression was getting worse the fact that I was told ‚Äúno good daughter, you should stay‚Äù (language speaker btw) and I needed the space away from her as much as possible. One of my sisters insisted on helping me to do so, we‚Äôll call her L. My relationship with my sister L was alright, but I was surprised she wanted to help me move. Though the difference between her and my other sisters would be that she hates my bf. Now at the time my bf was recently at his home country for a few months, and he hasnt talk to my sister L nor will he ever be interested. I know she hates him because near the beginning of our relationship my bf wasnt the greatest person to be around with, and argued once with sister L. Its been 3 years since that last argument and 3 years since my bf has ever come near my family. My sister L still hates him today. My other sisters dont mind him but my bf thought it was best to stay away from my family after the argument.\n\nSo back to the story, sister L found an apartment for me, did the arrangements, drove me to see it, etc. It was all great until my mother called me up on the phone and told me I should never move out of the house, sister L backed me up and I cried out of joy because finally someone stood up for me. I moved out and enjoyed my freedom.\n\nAfter a few months in college, my bf came back from his home country and I was excited to see him after a while. We planned to see each other on the day and hangout. During the time my mother called in to ask how I was, which was strange because she never asked me how I am, she would usually call me up to argue over something small about my life. I said I was fine and asked her if she needed anything or wanted to say something, she said no in return then hanged up. Back to having the day of my life with my bf, he told me he got his license before asking to hangout, I was excited to see him drive. He drove safer than my sisters I can say.\n\nAgain my mother called in on the same day in the afternoon, I couldnt call back because my phone died afterwards. I decided to bring my power bank to charge the phone in the car. I was anxious and my anxiety was kicking in because I know that once I miss a phone call from my mother, she sends phone calls to my other sisters = they will send a bunch of text messages, telling me to stop being a bitch and answer mother‚Äôs phone calls. This is what its always been like and its my mother being manipulative into getting me to answer her. In the end I get called ungrateful by her = ‚Äúyou‚Äôre ungrateful to your mother, you listen to your sisters but not me?‚Äù\n\nIts frustrating and it makes me cry. After my phone was charged enough to turn back on, I was waiting for tons of messages, and I was right. I scrolled through message after message and I cried in my bf‚Äôs car while he was driving. I was reading words like ‚Äúyou better fucking not make mom mad, im sick and fucking tired of hearing her always talking about you‚Äù = I screamed and cried. I called my mother back and said I am driving with my bf, she was furious because she doesnt believe that my bf can drive. I understand that so I took a photo of him driving and sent it to her, she still didnt believe me. My bf tried to calm me down but I was angry and sad, I had flashbacks of conversations with my mother on how she told me I should never leave home even after college, I didnt know why but it came to mind. My mom hanged up and I got more messages from my sisters, then my sister L messaged me.\n\nShe found out from mother that I was driving with my bf. She asked why am I driving with him, why am I letting him drive, does he have a drivers license, etc. Questions after questions, I was having an anxiety attack and drank some water but it didnt help, I coughed it out and my bf parked in the parking lot near the stores to calm me down. Then she said to stop pissing mom off, I broke down hard because after all she did to support me I thought she was willing to understand what I was going through despite her hate on my bf. Then I told her = ‚ÄúWhy cant you guys just leave me alone and let me live my life without questioning it‚Äù\n\nOf course my sister L was pissed off and gave me a huge paragraph saying she is cutting ties with me, because of my lack of maturity, how unappreciated I am with mother and how she cant stand my bf. She sounded like mother but it hurt more because this was the sister who supported me and I didnt think me saying what I said would caused this. I just felt harassed by everyone and was sick of it, broke down and cried like a child. \n\nThe last words my sister L said was have a good fucking life. AITA for saying this to her?\n\n\nTLDR: I told my supportive sister to leave me alone because I felt like she was harassing me along with my narcissistic mother and other sisters after finding out my bf, who just got his drivers license, drove me around to hangout. She cut ties with me after that because she cant stand my bf and me.",

      "title": "AITA for ending a 3 year friendship with no explanation?",
      "description": "As the title says I ended a three year long friendship recently. For a bit of backstory, the girl I was friends with was in my 8th grade homeroom and thats how we became friends. We sat on the bus together and next to each other in homeroom.\n\nIt was a slow culmination of things that led to this happening but the ball started rolling in mid October last year. She met someone about this time who she really liked and who liked her back. I encouraged her to pursue this relationship with him because at the time I didn‚Äôt think much would change. \n\n(important note, at this time I was working on weekends at McD‚Äôs) \n\nThings changed soon after that. She and a mutual friend we were close to began to talk about these trips they‚Äôd take to the mall. I was a little hurt by this because I was never invited to a trip with them, it took me asking for us to go together. I understand that I was busy, but there were times that I got out earlier and could have set up something then, or I could have taken a day off. I digress. \n\nShe gets her boyfriend and becomes more distant. All she talks about is her boyfriend, including their first time together. I feel a little uncomfortable with this because I don‚Äôt want to hear the nitty gritty and at this point, I hadn‚Äôt met him yet. I go over to her house one afternoon and I dm him from my instagram account asking if he wants to hear a funny story involving his girlfriend. He gets pissy at me and says ‚ÄúIf its about [his gf] I want to hear it from her!‚Äù Fine, I understand. I don‚Äôt dm him after that until the next day he tells me he‚Äôs blocking me because she told him too. For a bit more context, I had been weirded out because I still hadn‚Äôt met him. She kept saying he didn‚Äôt want more friends. Thats fine. But at the time she was my closest friend and I wanted to get to know her partner a little. \n\nNovember comes and goes and in Developing my gallbladder goes nuclear meltdown. I go to the ER and then get admitted into the pediatric ward to get the stone and my gallbladder removed. My mom, dad, and brother were visiting with my parents staying all day. My internet friends were keeping up and checking on me as this went on. My friend did a little. My school friends were more caring about my wellbeing than she was. \n\nAfter I was released I stayed at home for a week and the weekend after I had plans with this friend to meet up at the mall and hangout for a while. I had been warned one of her other friends could be there and that was fine. I let her know when I was heading out so we could meet at the food court and go from there. I arrived to find nobody waiting for me. I texted and called to find out where she was. I‚Äôll admit, I got really angry and was ready to leave. She finally texts me back so I can find her at the store she was so she and her friend can finish their purchase. For the rest of the trip I was third-wheeling. I texted my mom to pick me up after a few hours and left quietly. \n\nIt got more and more distant between us. I began to notice that she never texted me first. I know I can become clingy with friends and I was for a bit because I felt scared her boyfriend was taking up all her time and left none for me to even text her. I eventually texted her two weeks ago that I was done and she knew why. She blocked me on instagram and that‚Äôs that. I had thought we were okay but after my trip to the hospital and after Christmas vacation I recognized that we weren‚Äôt and it wasn‚Äôt going to be fixed. \n\nThere were a few things I left out. I would change what I was talking about to not upset her but she‚Äôd talk all the time about her boyfriend. I‚Äôd try to talk to her over text and get very little back so I‚Äôd stop messaging. I was trying to support her, and actually ended my side of the friendship with our mutual friend because she said how he‚Äôd make her uncomfortable and would come onto her. I‚Äôm not without my faults and you don‚Äôt have her side of the story either. But yeah. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hello, everyone. I have a strong inkling ITA, but needed to confirm, so please lay it out honestly.  \n\nFor the past couple weeks, a few friends and I have been planning a 2 week vacation overseas later this year. The group originally included, myself, my gf, and my friends Don and Michael. The four of us have been good friends for years now.\n\nNow Michael has been dating this girl, Melanie, for about a year and some change. We all like Melanie enough, she‚Äôs a nice person, and treats everyone respectfully. However, it‚Äôs been unanimously decided amongst not just us 3, but the entire friend group that Melanie is just *okay.* \n\nWhile she is a nice person, we have very different senses of humor, demeanor, and perspective. \n\nThat being said, we all still go out together, hang out together, and Michael brings Melanie to almost all of our functions and events, which is completely fine.\n\nHowever, Michael asked today if Melanie could join us on our vacation. Obviously we all said yes, as she‚Äôs his gf and we all felt he was entitled to bring her. On top of that, my gf is also going, so how could I object. However, no one was exactly ecstatic about the situation.\n\nMy question is AITA for having negative feelings about Michael bringing his gf along with us on our 2 week vacation?\n\nMy thinking was that if I was spending a lot of money and going through the inevitable overseas travel pains and stresses, I‚Äôd like to do so with the friends I originally planned with. I feel that Melanie will be a little bit of a downer, and I would like to avoid being in exasperating situations with her if possible, especially on a long trip. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So one of my close friends just found out that she has to work the day after Christmas because none of her other coworkers are working, even though they'll all be in town. She plans every year to see her grandparents out of town that week. She messaged me and immediately starts flipping out, insulting her coworkers, ranting about how dumb and lazy they all are, and how she can't go to see her grandparents because of them. I told her she should talk to her boss more and try to negotiate. She said she can't and what if she gets fired, yadda yadda. Then she goes on to brag about how loyal shes been and how hard she works (she works part time and was just telling me yesterday about how she called out of work \"sick\" and needed help to come up with a story for her boss...she also calls out of work or leaves early pretty often.) I call her out and tell her she should've given further notice since she does this every year and she should quit crying about it and talk to her boss (more blunt version of what i said).\n\nThen she starts saying all she wanted from me was a shoulder to cry on, some reassurance, not all these ugly things I've said. She says I hurt her feelings. I tell her I'm sorry that I hurt her feelings, it was not my intent. She then goes on to freak out and say she's going to cut herself and I have such a hard time finding sympathy for her. Am I being an asshole? Should I feel bad? Should I have just sucked it up and reassured her? I dont think this is a relationship I could continue if this is the case.\n\nTL;DR: My friend overreacted to an easily fixable situation, I called her out on it, she threatens to cut herself. What am I doing wrong?",

      "description": "My wife informed me last night that she had blood in her ear. I was very concerned and told her that she needed to check it out. She had recently flown on a plane and it could be ruptured ear drum. I suggested that she call her doctor on Monday and schedule an appointment or, if she felt any discomfort to go to a 24 hour medical clinic right then. There is one about a mile away that has very good doctors.\n\nMy wife informed me that she knows of some app that has doctors that makes house calls. She said that she could use that app tomorrow (now today) and have a doctor come to the house. I said that I believed that was a terrible idea. It made no sense for her not to go the mile today and see a doctor at a clinic that would be more experienced than a doctor who makes house calls on apps. I told her that the clinic may have tools to exam her that the traveling doctor did not have. I suggested that I would watch over the small kids, and she could go now, or I would take her in the morning. \n\nShe said \"Then take me now\" (and not in the fun way). I told her fine. She said okay but that she was not ready yet. It was only about 8 pm, so I said sure. An hour later she is now ready to go. The younger kid is sound asleep. I told her that I would watch the kids and that she should go. I believe that the doctor would examine her with that light/ear thingy and prescribe her antibiotics. Not a huge event.\n\nShe says that I need to take her right then and that I don't love her. I said \"No, it's just a matter of being an adult and taking care of yourself.\" She storms off and says that I don't love her. She slept with the kids. When she wakes up, I will take her (but not in the fun way).  AITA for not waking up my daughter so I could take my wife to the doctors last night?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "For clarity, I already know I'm an asshole. I just want other people's opinions and views.\n\nA band I've been listening to for a while is coming out with a new album. I'm extremely excited and told/made my mom listen to them. A couple weeks pass (still excited) when I get a text from my mom telling me to check my email. In there contained a digital preorder copy of the album. Normally, I would be thrilled except for a few things. \n\nEven though I do listen to a lot of music on my phone, I actually much rather buy a physical CD rather than a digital copy. I've recently got into CDs, and I love them to death. When my CD-love first started, my mom specifically asked why I don't just buy it digital copy. I told her that it's kind of like a book, when you need to get that physical touch to be closer to it. So, I've never expressed anything about buying digitally. \n\nThe other problem is that the album releases in 5 days, and it'll be accessible anywhere. I looked it up and the digital copies can cost up to 10 dollars (my mom won't tell me the cost). So it's kind of obsolete, in a sense.\n\nHowever, even though I slightly disappointed in something that I don't really want, I still appreciate the thought immensely. She went out of her way to do something nice when I can sometimes be a pain in the ass (we got into an argument today b/c I didn't want to go to kickboxing). I just wish I could force myself to truly like it.\n\nTl;dr: AITA for not liking a gift my mom got that I had expressed no interest in, but had a lot of thought in it? \n\n",

As the PM, i need facts, dates, lead times and technical data...  that's it.\n\nHe will get me this information, but it takes 15 minutes or more to extract it from his whining about everything other than what we can do to succeed.  For example, I ask \"when will x be ready to order\" and his response is, \"well, you know that something completely unrelated to project is going on, and I feel / think / dont know\"...  \n\nLike 5 minutes of straight up bitching before I get any usable information.  Its grueling!  \n\nI've now gotten to the point that I ask him to email me status updates so I can avoid the whining.  Today, after a call to the boss, we needed to talk about changing vendors to save a few days on something, and he started complaining.  I stood up, looked at him and said \"if you have nothing productive to add, I'm going to find us a new vendor\" and walked away while he was still flapping his gums.  \n\nWere not friendly outside of work, and I'm not interested in his life at all.  I'm that way with most of my colleagues, it makes it easier to be their PM this way.  Nobody has an \"in\" with me, and everybody is on an equal level.",

      "description": "So my husband runs his own business and is very successful. I stay at home and have recently started working part time.\nHe started this business before he met me, but it was a little half assed. He just did the work he needed to get by. When we got married and had a kid he decided to start it back up. We agreed to be legitimate and do all the paperwork, mostly handled by me. I worked with him doing the actual labor for the first year while bringing our baby along. It was a nice family operation. Well, the baby grew and I could no longer be mom and work with him so my role became mostly bookkeeper and phone answerer. As the business grew he had to hire out for the actual work so he could manage everything and focus on costumer service. \nSo here we are 5 yrs later. I still do the books, averages 2-4 hours a month. I also take care of all the licensing/bonding/insurance etc. All this work is front loaded since once it‚Äôs renewed and submitted at the beginning of the year, it‚Äôs done until a new year rolls around. Not much time involved but critical to the survival of the business.\nThis whole time he mostly refers to it as ‚Äúhis business,‚Äù ‚Äúhis money‚Äù and gets irritated if not angry when I refer to it as ‚Äúour business‚Äù or ‚Äúour money.‚Äù I have no access to the bank account and while he used to tell me the balance he often says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my problem, not yours.‚Äù \nI don‚Äôt really want to have my name on the paperwork. I really just want acknowledgement that I‚Äôm half this operation. I‚Äôm valuable to its continuation, and that it‚Äôs my money too even if he does most of the work that earns that money. He says that he‚Äôs the one earning the money therefore it‚Äôs his, and I could sign on as an employee and get a paycheck for actual hours spent working. So am I the asshole for wanting to be a true 50/50 partner in this and thinking that the money this business earns belongs to me too?\n",

One of them was my little cousin (8M) who probably took to much influence from the internet,  he thinks he is a great singer and whenever his mum isn‚Äôt there or he posts on the internet he is trying to act cool by swearing a lot. Things were going pretty good he asked to play smash with me on my switch and totally whooped his ass as our lord king dedede since he dared to pick K.Rool, Then we get my brother and other cousin join in (She‚Äôs not related to my other cousin) and we play some matches. Afterward they all get bored and we played hide and seek, it was all going fine and every one was having fun. Up until my little cousin comes up and smacks my ass. He had done this a couple of times before but this was the final straw. I started to tell him that ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just smack people‚Äôs bums (Live in Scotland but probably couldn‚Äôt have said asses as he would have made an even bigger deal out of that) because it could be considered as sexual harassment if done to the wrong person.‚Äù He then starts to run away from the problem and my mum comes up to see what‚Äôs wrong, I tell her that my little cousin smacked my ass and was telling him off because of it ( he obviously denies it though because he doesn‚Äôt want to get in trouble). Now my mum goes and defends him because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm older‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs only eight‚Äù, I tell her that he should learn that those actions are wrong and could potentially land him in jail (Hell he could even get serious repercussions if he did that right now considering you can be held responsible for your actions at age eight in Scotland).  My mum says that ‚ÄúEven though you shouldn‚Äôt go into your little brothers room because it annoys him you still do it.‚Äù I immediately tell her that it‚Äôs totally different annoying your little brother than SEXUALLY HARASSING SOMEONE she just tells me ‚ÄúLet it go you‚Äôre ruining the party‚Äù. After all this my little cousin tries to make everyone feel sorry for him and saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm walking home right now‚Äù, He then later came down ecstatic because he got 6th place in fortnite. Was I being a bit of an asshole for telling him off? Also I‚Äôm 14M but I don‚Äôt think it changes the fact that it could still be sexual harassment if done to somebody who is not related to him.",

I typically used another helmet since we didn't have one. However, this particular incident, I used this one guys helmet. Now for all the non-sports inclined, this is something you're SUPPOSED TO DO! You are supposed to share equipment when your teammates  when you don't have one. I used it, and the second I  got in the dugout, this kid comes up and starts harassing me, apparently he did not notice.  He cried to his mom, who then came and harassed me for a while and boo'd me when I went up to bat - albiet late cause I couldn't find a helmet. This  kid also said I had head lice and I had to get my own helmet.  So, reddit, AITA??\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Excuse my insecurities i have the curse of being a people pleaser\n\nSo, i gave my sister the fishkeeping bug. Wed gone into petstock to buy a new collar for the dog, and she went to look at the fish and show her daughter the bettas. Ive been setting up a tank for about a week now (gonna be a blackwater just need the peat to all sink down) and i think shes caught all my excitement so she bought a small tank, and got me to set it up for her (more like i just did it cause im just as excited for it) \n\nAnd we started talking what to put in it. A lot of the fish she and her partner wants are cichlids and plecos and other larger fish. Ones that can grow beyond 10 cm and up to 20 cm even. Which limits those fish intensely to only living through being juveniles then dying because the tank is too small (15 ltr)\n\nSo i got her to write down what fish she wants and narrowed the list down to fish who are peaceful or at least only aggressive towards specific species, and mostly smaller fish. The largest fish is the most aggressive of course, but its the only bottom dweller we're planning on other than the catfish so im not anticipating problems.\n\n(The list is 6 tetras, 1 catfish, 1 kribensis and 2 dwarf gourami they all live at different levels so hopefully there wont be overcrowding problems, i did suggest just starting with the tetras and the catfish to see how full that makes it)\n\nI woke up this morning feeling like maybe i should have just given advice rather than saying yes/no to her suggestions as its not my tank and i was acting like i deserved a say in what goes in it.\n\nSo, AITA and should i take more of a backseat when we go in today to find what plants she wants and decor? Shes going to ask my advice either way but i feel like i took over a bit last night when i had no right to.",

      "description": "Awesome sub here. I‚Äôve been struggling with this one for the past year or so, could use some input. Throwaway account.\n\n\n\nA few years ago, my mom divorced my stepdad. Out of the blue. Now this is really unlike her. She got through business school while taking care of my and my bro and sis. She eventually bought a house and they lived well. Keep in mind, owning a home was her dream her whole life.\n\nAnyway, I lived in Oregon at the time. She in Oklahoma. Out of nowhere I hear that she has taken off with a random guy she knew from her childhood, who has been known as an ex-meth-head. She take a road trip from OK to OR to see me and my bro. My stepfather, who she was still married to, just woke up with her gone with one of their cars.\n\nImmediately I felt like things weren‚Äôt right. It‚Äôs not that she is acting much differently, it‚Äôs just that maybe she seems a bit more...childish. It‚Äôs one thing to make a trip to see your son, it‚Äôs another to do so with a guy who lost his teeth from meth. Whom I have never met. I can‚Äôt tell if she is on drugs, she seems ‚Äònormal‚Äô aside from her very not normal actions. \n\nSince then, I‚Äôve just sort of...ghosted her I guess. She‚Äôll call every now and then and I‚Äôll talk to her for a bit. But lately I‚Äôve been ignoring her calls. She is living with that guy she took the trip with. She has a masters degree in business yet hasn‚Äôt had a job for 2 years since she just up and left my (ex) stepfather and my sis in OK. She says she has been looking for a job, that bills get right but they‚Äôre ‚Äòsurviving‚Äô. \n\nI‚Äôve made a point to cut contact with family members who are assholes. My dad is an asshole and I have no problem not communicating with him. He‚Äôs done egregious things like steal from my grandfather, use my brother‚Äôs name for credit cards and other fun stuff. \n\nBut with my mom it‚Äôs just, all the signs point to some sort of either drug abuse or mental instability. She isn‚Äôt asking for money, she is overrall cheerful on the phone when we do talk. We used to be best friends. I grew up in a trailer park and she worked all the time as a nurse, made sure education was the number 1 priority for me and my brother. I owe a lot of my constitution to her.\n\nBut I feel like I am so far away from that side of life that I grew up in and I want no part of it. I‚Äôm putting myself through college. I share an apartment with a wonderful gf. We make good money. I guess what I‚Äôm saying is I don‚Äôt want my future kids seeing all this stuff from their own grandmother. Perhaps it‚Äôs even a little bit of shame for explaining my mother‚Äôs actions to my friends and gf. Despite how much I care for her, I simply don‚Äôt want her around this life I had built. \n\n\nTLDR am I the asshole for ghosting my mom for non-conclusive/personal reasons?",

      "description": "Some context ~ back in September one of my friends, S, took his own life. We hadn't had much contact other than homeroom a couple weeks before, so I found out a few days after it happened and took a day off of school, since I was upset about this and didn't think I would be able to go all day without crying. I knew him well enough to call him my friend, we talked to each other in passing, and he was such a nice, sweet guy. He was always smiling, super happy go lucky, and it just made me laugh and smile to be around him. I never would have expected him to do something like take his own life, but I guess he hid it well.\n\nHis girlfriend, J, who was my friend for several years before I had gotten to know S, was also deeply affected by this and stopped coming to school for about a month and a half. All she would post to any of her social media would be pictures of her and S. She acted like he was still alive. I was really worried about her and was super relieved when I saw her again. I knew she was struggling, like all of us. \n\nIt was only recently that I felt okay to start talking about S again. I shared stories about him during lunch with our other friends, and we all laughed and cried together. After lunch, however, J pulled me aside. Here's basically what she said:\n\nJ: Could you please stop acting like you know S that well? You weren't even friends. \n\nI had known him longer than she had known him, so I was a bit taken aback by this and got angry. \n\nMe: You were dating for what, half a year? He was my friend. I'm allowed to get upset. Maybe he didn't think of me as a friend, maybe he didn't talk about me all that much, but I considered him my friend, and you can't take that away from me. \n\nJ: He wasn't your friend and you know it. We were together for almost a year. He never mentioned you. You hung out with him outside of school once. \n\nMe: At least I don't go around posting his pictures all over snapchat like woe is me, my boyfriend is dead. It's not like you were going to be together for the rest of your lives. It was a high school relationship! \n\nJ walked away and stopped talking to me after that. She called me an asshole and basically stopped coming to lunch. All of our other friends were alright with this, cause she had apparently been invalidating their relationship with S too. I understand that she's grieving, but so are we. \n\nSo AITA here? Did I take it too far? ",

      "description": "Two of my very good friends had an on-again off-again \"thing\" for a couple years appx 5 years ago, when they were just transitioning from high school to undergrad.  At the time, I was very close with my girl friend \"Nora\" and did not know the guy, \"Jason,\" because Nora and Jason went to different colleges.  I met Nora in college when she and Jason were talking.  Nora and I spent many nights talking about Jason, with Nora asking for advice and me generally just agreeing with her that guys suck when she and Jason were going through hard times.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward about five years, Nora and Jason haven't spoken in three years since their falling out, and I realize that Jason and I happen to be going to the same grad school with all of our classes together.  This is the first I've met Jason, but I quickly realized he was Nora's Jason.  We also became fast, inseparable best friends.   Jason and I were best friends for a year and a half.  Recently, things have evolved into a fairly serious romantic relationship.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom everything I gathered from Nora and Jason, they had a very emotionally charged relationship -- a lot of  passion and a lot of arguing, but they never formally dated, only remained interested in each other for a while.  I  recall Nora being very torn up when they had their falling out, and Jason conveyed to me in the last year that he was also torn up at the time.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, I reached out to Nora recently and told her that Jason and I have been \"talking,\" and asked her permission to go on a date with him.  When I asked her permission, she gave me a resounding \"YES\" and told me that everything happened so long ago, she feels like she was a child at the time.  Nora additionally is in a very happy relationship and is currently engaged to be married.  Despite this, I can't help feeling like I'm betraying Nora for how serious Jason and I are getting.  Nora asked me today to meet up with her one-on-one, and I know the purpose is to ask me about where I'm at with Jason.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is: AITA for getting serious with Jason? Am I completely breaking \"girl code\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks, reddit.  Trying to balance two relationships that I really value. ",

So they introduced me to this guy who was their classmate and said that he wanted to tag along. They said that we might have the same interests as we both like tech and stuff. So fast forward, we're on the way to pizza and me and the guy had a talk, yet there's something about him that i just don't like? I cant point it out, he's not terrible by any means nor ugly, just a little awkward I guess. \n\n\n\n\nThere's this time that I was sitting alone, enjoying myself then suddenly he comes and sits right next to me, wanted to talk to me. So we talked, I was being nice to him and all then suddenly he talks about his favorite Japanese rock band and a few sentences later he blasts out his favorite song full volume out in public and we're in school so it's easier to hear. Thank God two girls who were my friends came up to me talked to me and he paused his music. So now I'm handling two conversations and this guy is just annoyingly a bit embarrassing to be with tbh so i entertained the girls more lol. Then he tries to talk to me again about politics which im quite keen on and enjoy talking about time to time but he makes it pretty unbearable to talk about even tho he's not really misinformed about it. I still kept talking to the girls when he continues his music out loud which annoyed me but I just kept talking to both sides. And those girls weren't even trying to talk to him lol. So yeah they eventually left, and I finally had class so I left him lol. We were classmates in one class too along with my other friends but I barely talk to him even on the topics I'm interested in. There's also times where he'd text me but I dont entertain him at all. \n\n\n\n\nNow he's pretty lonely and I feel bad for him tbh but I wish him the best that he'll make friends in the future.\n\n\n\nSorry for the text wall, I just wanted to elaborate my story (sorry if done poorly) and hear Reddit's opinion on whether I'm an actual asshole or not.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Met a guy, didnt like him but idk why so I decided not to be friends with him.",

      "description": "Some context... She's one of my closest friends and we've lived together for over a year and she is the best roommate ever. She told me she was struggling with rent because it's a little high. Her parents live 45 min away and she was debating on moving back with them at the end of our lease.\n\nI have a friend who needs a place next month and they offered to pay her rent if they could crash on the couch, she could still stay if she wanted, it wasn't a trying to kick her out thing. I suggested this to her, she doesn't like this person and declined. I also suggested subletting to get and extra month or two's rent as a backing. Explaining I'd rather miss her for a month or so than lose her as a roommate forever. She was a little annoyed and may have felt like I was trying to kick her out.\n\nLast night she messaged me saying she was looking at other places and is going to see one tomorrow so that if my friend wanted they could do a lease take over. She says the reason is that it would be an extra $1300/year in her pocket but that her mom feels like I'm kicking her out. I'm wondering if she's saying it's her mom but it's really her. AITA for suggesting she leave for a few months?",

      "description": "Sorry for long post! TLDR at the bottom\n\nSo first some backstory. This is during my senior year of high school. I was in a relationship with a guy I really liked. We had been friends for about five years prior so we knew a lot about each other. He didn‚Äôt like social media very much and I was very into it only because there were certain family members that only saw me grow up through social media pictures. They were never able to come out and visit me because of where they lived and finances. My dad and I have a very close knit relationship. He‚Äôs honestly my rock. He became my rock after my mother passed away. I come to him with relationship problems and he comes to me with overall advice when dealing with new girlfriends. I‚Äôm also his ‚Äúfirst line of defense‚Äù when it comes to new relationships. I‚Äôm able to tell if he‚Äôs gonna work out with the girl pretty easily usually.\n\nSo we‚Äôre getting close to the end of the year and Prom is about to roll around. I ask him if I‚Äôm gonna be able to post prom pictures online so that my family members can see. He is immediately completely against it. Keep in mind this is something that him and I have been discussing for quite a long time and he originally said that I could. He took back his word because he was suddenly and uncomfortable with it. Which I understand completely but also, you took back your promise. \n\nWhen this discussion came around I was slightly scared that it was going to be a make or break situation, which it turned into as a simple discussion transformed into a 2 1/2 month argument that made a relationship very brittle. About two weeks before prom was my birthday. Knowing that he was coming over to my house for my party, I asked if I could have my dad sit us both down and we both explain our side of the story to him and my father gave his honest opinion. He was against it at first but then let me sit him down with my father. \n\nThe conversation went well and my dad suggested only letting me post about us on special occasions which my boyfriend agreed to. After word got out that I let my father help with this decision, I started receiving a lot of flak from family friends that were about my age as well as just friends in high school. I even got a nasty message from his sister. He seemed fine with the whole meet though, he didn‚Äôt seem uncomfortable. And it did end up finding a good compromise for us and we went on from there. We did end up breaking up but that was for another reason. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt have gone to my father if I knew what to do in this situation. I didn‚Äôt want to never be able to post about us, which was the ultimatum he gave me. I was just so lost and didn‚Äôt know what to do. \n\nSorry forgot the TLDR!\nI asked my dad for advice in a relationship regarding a heavy discussion. \n\nSo am I the asshole for asking my dad for advice?",

I've noticed recently that I dont enjoy spending any time with her. I dont share the same interests as her anymore, little things she do annoy me, and overall I feel like shit and completely drained of energy after hanging with her. It's mostly little things, like she will gush about crushes and dates, but seems to get uncomfortable when I talk about my dates and girls. \n\nShe gets upset at my friends when they want to hang out with us. She's also really overprotective for some reason, its like her number 1 priority is to keep me safe and healthy, even if it aint her business. She gets upset when I go out drinking with friends, even tho I'm 18.\n\nIn short, I don't like her as a person anymore. I don't get anything of value from hanging out with her, I actively feel miserable hanging out with her. I don¬®'t hate her or anything, I just hate being around her. I've tried not messaging her, but we hang out at the same spots, so she always seems to find me. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I flat out told her I don't like her as a person, and don't want to be in her life anymore?",

      "description": "Hey guys soo, I've been pretty good with ending most relationships. I typically will let those emotions flow through me instead of holding onto them. \n\nSo I(25M) ended up jumping into this relationship with this girl(20F). We both worked for the same company but we dont work directly together. It was one of those surreal moments when I realized I wanted to be with the person. \n\nSo the girl and I started dating mid summer and things were great and lively, sex was plenty, company was amazing and it just felt like I could lower my guard around her. Maybe 3 months in I noticed some minor issues and had asked if we can talk in person because these were somethings I wanted to address. After her freaking out and overreacting almost to the point of tears, we both let out the things that were bothering us. My past was a little on the wild side(in terms of past sexual encounters), who I was friends with, why I was friends with them, and she made sure to remind me of every step of the way. I understood and agreeded with our talk.\n\nNow fast forward to the start of the month and she has been constantly been saying that I'm being 'distant' and how shes consistently busy with work/school/volunteering. I try to be more vocal with what I'm doing or how I'm feeling that day or in that situation, it seemed to work for a short while. So on the 21st I was going to make us dinner and I'd meal prep for the two of us, we hadn't had time with each other in 2 weeks and I just wanted sometime with my girlfriend, and a family emergency comes up...so I call her and explain what's going on and shes completely understanding, so shes telling me she feels guilty for leaving her cat for the night..then 30seconds later shes excited to leave for work because she gets to work with these two people she likes, but she feels guilty to leave her cat for the night.\n\nSo on the 23rd she texts me saying she isnt sure if she wants to keep the relationship going because when she graduates(1.5years away) she wants to move and she knows I wouldnt want to move where she does...I explained to her how that isnt really a good reason to stop dating. I asked her if she needed a break from this, and she didnt say yes or no. I had decided to put the relationship on hold and asked her if she could give me 2 days to think over, she kept asking and asking and asking and kept pestering me to tell her, that on Sunday I wanted to grab a coffee and talk...she keeps pestering me and I just blurted it out! I told her why were breaking up, the consistent repetition of how we didnt have anything in common, the age gap and everything that I had mentioned above .\n\nSo now I've been feeling like shit because I broke up with a girl who I felt I had some real feelings for, I know that I cant salvage the relationship.\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with the (now) (ex)girlfriend.",

      "description": "My friend from high school and I are both getting married this summer, about a month apart. My friend and I are reasonably close; we see each other once or twice a year and keep up through Facebook/text/email in between, and he's invited me and my fiancee to his wedding. The problem is, I'm not planning to invite him to mine. I know through the grapevine that our weddings are going to be about the same size (if anything mine will probably be a little bigger than his), but I'm only inviting a couple people from high school, and if I invited him and his fiancee, I'd feel like I had to invite 4 or 5 other high school people and their plus-1s, too; there just isn't room. I don't have any reason to think he resents me or expects an invite--it's not like he's said anything about it--but it's obviously an awkward situation. (He definitely knows my wedding is happening, and the general timeframe, even if he doesn't know the exact size/date.)\n\nSo here's the question: I'd genuinely like to go to his wedding, to see him and my other high school friends, and I don't really have a reason not to--other than the fact that I'm worried it'll be rude if I show up to his wedding without inviting him to mine just a few weeks later.

      "description": "So right now I'm in a pretty shitty situation with someone whom I consider my best friend. I've known my friend for a whole chunk of my life (15+ years) but we only became close during the latter years of high school. \n\nA few months ago my friend went through a really tough time with his family. To spare the details, he considers it one of his darkest moments of his life. During that time, I wanted to be there for him but I didn't know how to help. At one moment, I said some words that were interpreted as insensitive, which looking back I can agree with. All in all, he became enraged and said some pretty hateful words that made me feel hopeless and sad because he's one of my only close friends. After that conversation, he went to his other friends seeking help, which he did and I am truly grateful.\n\nBut what he said to me, those mean words, sticked with me for a quite a while. I was scared, I was frightened, and I was depressed that I couldn't be his friend when he needed one most. So a month later, after his situation with his family dissolved, I approached him and confessed my disappointment and sadness about what he said. I also said that it would have been nice if he apologized, because my feelings were truly hurt. He was my best friend and I didn't want what we had to be broken.\n\nWhen I asked for an apology, he was mad that I didn't just ignore his comments and acknowledge that he was going through a lot of shit (to put it nicely), and that it was justified for him to act mad during that time. \n\nSo am I the asshole for expressing my feelings about what he said? I just wanted to let him know that I felt scared of losing him, but perhaps the way I framed my 'confession' was selfish? Things have gotten quite tense and I'm afraid things won't ever go back to normal. ",

      "description": "Bit if context, I've known this guy for ages. He's phased in and out of \"best friend\" territory, but he's sort of one of a small group of guys I consider to be my best friends. 3 of them (4 including me) all met through me, and I always drove us around (first to get a license) and decided what we did back in high school, so I kind of considered myself to be the \"leader\" of the group.\n\nOne dickish thing that happened, just for some more context: my first ever girlfriend was his girlfriend at the time. I didnt do anything but for some reason she wanted to leave him for me, and I was feeling lonely enough that I accepted. She turned out to be an absolute psychopath, and the whole thing was a horrible experience, but even though she tried to turn me against him constantly, it never worked.\n\nOne day, I got another girlfriend, and she and I moved in together waaaaay too soon, but that's just how it happened. Meanwhile all my other 3 friends moved in together without me. We all lived this way for about 6 years.\n\nThis year, she dumped me, and I decided to finally fill that open room in the house. All gravy, right?\n\nWell for some reason, over the last couple years this guy has kept pulling this \"alpha male\" garbage. He used to literally brag about his penis size, and he did this for a good while until I told him he had to cut that out for all our sakes. But still, he's constantly trying to be the driving force behind everything. He wants to be in front, he wants to be in charge, even when he clearly doesnt have a clue what's going on.\n\nAgain, I've talked to him, this ultra dominant alpha stuff is no fun. It just feels inauthentic and annoying. His (ex)girlfriend told me he never lets her on top in the bedroom, and I think that extends from this same need to always be the one in power.\n\nEverything feels like a competition. He targets me down when we're playing smash bros, he does everything in his power to be the most charming, the kindest, the cutest, the smartest, and to get the most girls. To me, it keeps coming across as cocky and full of himself, but it's bern working.\n\nIn fact, girls that had clearly liked me before now seem to like him more, which itself wouldn't be so bad, but they're outright ignoring me at best or being uncharacteristically hostile at worst. I have no idea why, like it's actually a zero sum game.\n\nHe hasn't directly done or said anything bad to me this whole time, but the CONSTANT competition and false dominance has worn me thin long ago and I actually cant even escape it. I live with him and he keeps forcing himself into whatever I'm doing.\n\nRecently, he's friended a coworker of mine that I kind of liked, but she and I have a bit of a strange history. She liked me first back when I was taken, and when I became single, we started getting closer until I said it was too much too fast, and too soon after a 6 year breakup.\n\nAnyway, he friended her, and now his non-stop, hyperactive social media presence is starting to get hearts and laughs from her, and she's starting to send him pictures of stuff she thinks is cute. I'm worried this is going to start to go the same way as the other two girls.\n\nNow I know what some of you might be thinking- he's just insecure and needs validation. Definitely possible, but even the slightest thing gets to his head so badly I just cant even bring myself to be supportive of the guy. I dont want to see him succeed, I want to see him get knocked on his ass so he can dust himself off and show a shred of modesty again.\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way?",

      "description": "Me and my wife have been married for almost two years. Its been our dream to have a big family. She is 21, i am 24. We are both healthy and have an active sex life, but she has a heart shaped uterus and has miscarried twice,  the last time being two months ago. After losing two of my children i am also depressed but I try to keep a positive attitude for her.\n\nOur second miscarriage was in the second trimester and was very difficult as we both started to feel like \"mommy and daddy\". We were \"competing\" over which gender it would be.\n\nI thought the baby would be a boy so i bought a bunch of baseball stuff for babies, little hats and mitts. I also made my ringtone on my phone \"watching scotty grow\" by bobby goldsboro. Just sort of a playful thing since i joked we would name him after my grandpa scott, she wanted a girl and made hers that \"girls want to have fun\" song.\n\nAnyway, the baby was a girl named Charlotte. Shes been despondent these past few months. I havent been exactly ecstatic either but she wont even eat some days.\n\nI kept my ringtone the same for a little bit, partly because i was sad and partly because i forgot. She heard it one day and started crying terribly. I changed it, but i also resolved then to try and make her feel at least somewhat better.\n\nWife doesnt like cats and dogs arent allowed where we live but she had a hamster growing up. I bought a baby hamster with a big glass case and put a teeny tiny pink bow on her. I gave her to my wife with a card that said \"Would you be my new mommy?\"\n\nShe reacted terribly to it and said that it made her feel horrible and that i was being an insensitive asshole. Im just trying to help and the way she reacted put me on the defense so we got into an argument and arent on speaking terms since last friday. I keep the hamster with me on the coffee table as i sleep on the living room couch. Ive seen her play with it but she wont talk to me.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Just wanted to start off with that I understand the whole 'people move at their own pace' ideal - I feel like this could apply if they wasn't making silly mistakes that slows them down constantly. Am also writing on phone - sorry for any formatting &amp; spelling errors in advance! \n\nI've been with my partner for almost two years now (we're both 23) we met during our last years of University. Their course goes for 5 years while mine went for 4 years. \n\nI've always been a bit paranoid &amp; high-strung about 'wasting' time mostly with my parents stressing how important it was from a young age. I tried really hard to secure an internship during my last semester which then landed me a job right after I finished with uni which was super great. My partner was supposed to finish end of 2018, but because they forgot (lol) to enroll back into their course this year before the cut off they basically lost 6 months (Semester 1). \n\nWhat infuriates me is that they don't really care about it and is actually happy that they have more time to 'chill'. 'Chill' meaning waking up at 4PM and then playing games through the day and sleeping at 3AM. If they've stayed at my place the night before, I'll come home to find that they've just been on my computer the entire day, dishes still not done from the night before even when they said they would do them. \n\nI've talked with them briefly about what they has planned for the future and they mentions that they're probably going to casually work for another year (2019-2020) before thinking about full time and just spend more time 'chilling'. \n\nI think the source of my frustration is that we're both at different points in our lives, I've lived out of home for 6 years now and am financially independent. They just seem very content to just wallow around at their parents home doing nothing and actually wants more time to play games and do things the way they want before thinking about moving out or trying to take care of themselves. It's gotten to the point where if I need to clean up after them or constantly remind them about something I feel that frustrated knot in my chest.\n\nIs my frustration justified or am I just a big A for being annoyed at how someone is living their life - especially my partner? Knowing if I'm the A or not will help me decide how I should try and fix this feeling. ",

Well I did it to my crush just so I could get to know her. Turns out that my friend already did it to her but said that he didn‚Äôt like her but knowing I did.

Of course he lied to me about it too.\n\nFor the next two months I wanted to know what actually happened so I talked to his now girlfriend(my old crush) and told her my side. She told him he was gonna break up with him but I ended up saying sorry. Of course all my friends sided with him for the next 2 weeks but then told his parents and lied to them too. This is really where it ends and we are all friends again. \n\nYet besides I‚Äôm called a jerk and an idiot because he lied and I told his girlfriend, his friends(before they sided with him), and my friends what actually happened.

      "description": "My mom has serious blood pressure issues and takes medication to help it. It‚Äôs been this way for decades, and even she admits that it‚Äôll probably be her blood pressure which kills her one day. Within the last week she saw a spike in her resting BP levels while on her meds, just low enough to not go to the hospital so long as it didn‚Äôt go any higher, it seemed to resolve, but it definitely put me on edge.\nShe is also an incredibly determined woman who won‚Äôt let anything stop her from getting tasks done, whether it be grading papers or pruning the garden. Between army training and a pretty barebones upbringing, it‚Äôs shaped her identity that she needs to be strong enough to do tough work herself, and doing manual labor makes her feel good and distracts her.\n\nAlone these two things bother me in tandem, but she has a slew of other problems like osteoarthritis, a really bad knee, a bad back, and other long term aches, scars, and pains that come with getting into your mid 50‚Äôs. \n\nToday she came in from outside, having worked for a couple hours on the garden. She was soaked in sweat, hair disheveled, and panting. I knew she was working on something outside, but I never checked what. \n\nMe, being concerned over her exerting herself so heavily (worried less about the cold as it‚Äôs Florida) ask her if she‚Äôs ok and if she‚Äôs checked her blood pressure. \nHer response was ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my meds today so I don‚Äôt want to know.‚Äù \nI got into a one sided argument about how that‚Äôs exactly why she needed to check it, where  she mostly blew me off and went to take a bath and rest up. \n\nHad I not lost my dad suddenly to cancer, maybe I‚Äôd give her more leeway. But these days nobody feels safe from their own body. I‚Äôve told her as such, and while she‚Äôll try and comfort me that nothing will happen from it, I simply cant believe that after my dad passed at 65 from an incredibly rare form of cancer.\n\nAm I being paranoid? She finds satisfaction from it, but I worry that one day she‚Äôll come back from a hard day‚Äôs work and is gonna have a stroke when nobody‚Äôs looking. ",

      "description": "Ok, this one requires a little back story so bare with me...\n\nA few years ago my ex and I had broken up. I admit that I was to blame, I made a lot of mistakes &amp; it was just hard for us to work through them. I hadn't even moved my stuff out of my ex's apartment and we were still talking frequently. Out of nowhere, I began to get messages from someone I didn't know and it turns out it was my ex's new SO. They began to threaten me and insult my mother &amp; siblings, demanding I move my stuff out of my ex's apartment or they'd throw it out on the street. I just want to note that at no time did my ex tell me they needed my stuff gone now and when I tried to confront my ex about this, their new SO would just threaten me again.\n\nIn hindsight I probably should have gotten a restraining order, but everything was such a whirlwind, I just grabbed my things and couch surfed at my friends' apartment. Never really spoke to my ex again but still felt a lot of pain &amp; resentment from the way I was treated, regardless of my mistakes.\n\nFast forward to about a year later. I have a group of close knit friends that have been together since high school and we often hung out on weekends. At one point I had lived with almost everyone in the group &amp; at one point one of them even lived with me and my ex. So we were pretty close.\n\nThere was one particular weekend when I asked everyone what they were up to &amp; they all said they were busy. I couldn't get many details and they avoided providing any info. I tried not to think too much of it until the next day I see all of the social media photos of most of them hanging out with my ex &amp; the SO that threatened me. I will admit - I saw red. Most of them knew what had happened since I had at one point slept on the couches because of it &amp; I get that they wanted to see my ex, but to see them laughing and having beers with this person who made my life hell? I couldn't take it.\n\nI got angry and hurt and began to just avoid them. I didn't know how to deal with the situation and instead of getting in a fight, chose to avoid conflict. About a month passed and I finally began to feel like I could get over what happened and went to a party everyone was at. I couldn't have guessed the way many of them would act. All I wanted to do was move on but I was instead faced with these \"friends\" telling me that I was the one in the wrong &amp; being immature and not a good friend. They got in my face, yelled at me &amp; I asked them to just let it go but they wouldn't. They essentially blamed me for the situation because of my difficulty with expressing my emotion &amp; for not being great to my ex.\n\nBefore things got any more heated I decided to just leave the party and since then some of these \"friends\" have told everyone that they would not go to any get togethers or parties I was at. And in return my \"friends\" who were less involved in this fight, or whatever you want to call, have told me it's probably better if they don't invite me anymore so to avoid drama.",

      "description": "My sister had his friend a while ago who used to always get into trouble. The friend was banned from so many peoples houses so that was my first red flag. We didn't blame her for the stuff she did because her parents didn't take care of her and she didn't have a positive role model. She then got expelled from school which was my second red flag. I really didn't want to her in my families house but my sister liked her so I went with it. Fast forward a few weeks and it is my sister's birthday. My sister invites this person over and the person ends up stealing my sister's birthday money. We know it was her because no one else was in the house was the time.\n\nWe kick her out of the house and talk to her mom. Her mom denies the fact that the girl stole from us and we never got our money back. We could have called the police but we didn't. Fast forward to this girls birthday and no one in our family wishes her a happy birthday. Her mom then contacts us saying that her daughter was really sad we didn't say happy birthday. I don't see why she thought she would get a happy birthday after stealing from us and getting kicked out of our house.\n\nSo tell me AITA for not saying anything to her for her birthday",

      "description": "I'll try to make this brief. I have 3 bio kids (10,12 and 13) and 2 step kids (9 and 11). My husband and I agreed a long time ago that we did not want to get cellphones (specifically smart phones) for our kids. We decided this for multiple reasons but mainly financial/we saw it as an unnecessary and potentially dangerous device. A few months ago, my step kids mom decided that she wanted to get my step kids phones since her step daughter had one. She asked my husband his opinion (he told her) and if he was willing to contribute (he wasn't) and then went ahead with it. My bio kids went through some jealousy (particularly the 13 year old who couldn't understand why her 9 year old sister would have one and not her) but they've gotten past it now. The problem is that in going through a recent redesign of the custody/child support order, it looks like my husband will be required to pay significantly less support, and now his ex is asking that he pay half of their cell phone bills. My husband is leaning towards agreeing so as not to derail the negotiations, but I'm feeling pretty bad about this. We've been able to explain to my bio kids that their step siblings phones were their moms thing and that we still stood by our decision to not have them. However now that we might be contributing to it, I feel like we're sending mixed messages to the kids. And if we just don't mention that we're paying it to the kids, I still feel like I'm being an arsehole for not treating them relatively fair. We're trying to teach them not to compare themselves to others and that everything doesn't always have to be equal, but AITA here?",

They live together and have been best friends for years. More often then not Matt invites him to almost everything we do. Which is fine but we aren‚Äôt exactly ‚Äújust friends‚Äù and we do plan romantic evenings for each other. Saturday was not, but this has been an ongoing issue.\n\nWe got to this concert late on Saturday night. Matt and I went to the bar and got a drink. After the first band played i tapped out and said I wanted to go sit. Matt went to go talk to his friends. I really didn‚Äôt care. I worked all day and was exhausted, so i just wanted to get off my feet and browse reddit.\n\nTwenty or so minutes go by and Matt comes to sit next to me. Eventually i tell him I‚Äôm exhausted and just want to nap on his shoulder for the show.\n\nSo that was my night i slept til the end. When i woke up him and joe we were talking. We had good seats at a table near the stage. Once the show ended we were out. These were not assigned seats, just they were lining the wall for a GA event.\n\nI literally saw nothing wrong with any of this. Then last night Matt got mad and said i show too much PDA, and threw Saturday night in my face saying he couldn‚Äôt talk to his friends and they were mad that we ditched them. I would have not been mad if he moved and woke me. I didn‚Äôt mean to sleep the whole night i just wanted to sleep while the bands changed. Like it wasn‚Äôt some plot and i really didn‚Äôt think it was very sexy. My goal wasn‚Äôt to hold him down all night. I was just beat! \n\n",

      "description": "Ok, so for the last 5 or so years i haven't gone to this school, but my brother still goes there. While I was in 1st and 2nd grade I did some pretty stupid stuff and got into a lot of trouble. But after 3rd grade I fixed my act and didn't do anything wrong. My peers however continued to exclude me from any and all activities EXCEPT when we had a project on the computer. They would almost ALWAYS pick me for a partner or for their group because I knew my way around Word and Powerpoint a lot better then they did at the time. However, after the project, they would take the 100 after I did 99% of the work/research and pretend like I didn't exist. I was not invited to any events, any sleepovers/parties, or anything with an outside connection to school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and ADHD, and I still didn't know how to properly handle these conditions (I do now). I also was almost diagnosed with Opositional Defiance disorder and Conduct disorder. Keep in mind the teachers, counselors, and administrative staff were all well aware of these conditions. The parents of these children were also well aware due to the meetings held after any occurrence resulting in detention or ISS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was in 3rd grade, my brother started at this school in kindergarten. At the end of 5th grade, I left while he stayed at the school. I am now in 11th grade looking back, and was wondering if these feelings are properly placed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR AITA for hating a school for excluding me exclusively due to past actions?",

      "description": "So, yesterday my ex bf texted me a few nasty things, calling me names and so on, because someone told him i cheated on him (we broke up 1,5 year ago) which is not true. It's actually the second time he did this. The first time was two months ago when the rumors started to spread and my bf didn't seem to be interested so i blocled my ex on fb. \nThis time he messaged from his friends facebook, so screenshoted it and send it to my boyfriend, specifically telling him i don't want him to do anything, since i just wanted to ignore my ex and let it go, so the situation wouldn't get worse. I send it to him only because i wanted him to block my ex and the pther account (I asked my friends to do this too and they did), but my bf was getting angry and didn't seem to respect my decision and really wanted to start a fight with the ex. So i told him that if he texted my ex, it is break of trust and i would have to consider breaking up with him, since i trusted him when i send the screens to him. He then got really mad, saying i won't tell him what to do and that i was threatening him with break up if he does not do what i say and stopped talking to me for two hours. I wrote a big message explaining why i didn't want the situation to escalate and why his reaction hurt me (i needed support and he got angry with me instead because i didn't want to get into a bad fight with the ex) and he was cold, replaying with one word responses. I told him i felt dissapointed and tried to comunicate with him, saying that he is a great bf, but i needed him to support my decision and so on.. He didn't text him in the end, but still seems to be really angry with me and isn't meeting my effort to comunicate calmly and lovefully about the situation. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for telling him i don't want to deal with my ex the way he wants to? Or because i told him that i don't want him to message him and if he does anyway i would have to think about ending the relationship? \n\nTL;DR: My bf is angry because i want us to block my ex on facebook instead of arguing with him.

      "description": "So, to start off, my fiance has a Chihuahua, which I hate small dogs in the first place because of bad experiences with my Grandma's dogs. However this dog of his is especially bad in my opinion.  \nFiance has had this dog ever since he was 12. He's very attached to Dog, obviously. Dog has been sleeping in his bed that whole time. Fast forward to now. My fiance and I are planning on moving in together soon, however we have a huge dilemma. The dog.  \nThe biggest problem is that this dog is highly aggressive. Although he's come to tolerate me, I still feel the place where he bit me on the face a few months ago. I didn't even approach the dog when it happened- my fiance was saying \"Isn't he cute?\" And shoved the dog in my face. It surprised both me and the dog, and the dog reacted with a bite. Obviously in a fit of anger due to the pain and the mark it left, I mentioned to my fiance that normally when dogs bite they're put down, causing my fiance to burst into tears.   \nI also feel like my fiance gives more affection to the dog than me. I know this isn't true, but it's honestly what it feels like. I told him I am *not* ok with the dog sleeping in our bed when I move in with him. The only reason I tolerated it when I was visiting him was because I was the guest and I've been taught a guest should be thankful they're being allowed over at all. He's upset with me and is begging for me to accept the dog in our bed.   \n\n\nThe truth is deep down, I'm more mad at him than I am at the dog. All he does when Dog is involved is try to get me to coo over it. I'm honestly sick of it, and I know it's not the dog's fault. Whenever I try to talk to him about it he gets really upset. I don't *think* I'm being too harsh, but at this point I don't know.   \nWhat do you guys think? Am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for going on vacation with dads ex?",
      "description": "Sorry this goes on for so long, I feel like a lot of the details help understand the entire situation. TLDR at bottom. \n\nMy dad was engaged to this woman and she was a huge part of my life (from about age 7-17 or so). It was kinda a long distance thing, she lived an hour away so we would visit her on the weekends. The travel and relationship problems would stress my dad out, and he would take it out by yelling at me and my brother, but we were too young to realize that was the problem, we were just unhappy with the entire situation. She was mostly kind to us, made sure we were always having fun at parties she would throw, took us on adventures, even took me out of the country for a week vacation for free. \n\nThey broke up a few years ago, but I wasn‚Äôt told any details about why. All I knew was she kept harassing us, calling us at all hours of the night upset and crying. Everything eventually calmed down so that was it, my dad started dating other women. \n\nRecently, my grandmother (dads mom) got into contact with her (they knew each other all her life) and found out she had breast cancer. My dad told me this, and encouraged me to get into contact with her and visit since we knew she would probably be having a hard time (cancer and she basically has no family left close to her). \n\nAfter a couple months of thinking about it, I reached out to her through text and I ended up visiting her for a weekend. It was very nice to catch up and talk since she was a very strong female role model in my life as I was growing up. When I got home, my dad was angry with me. He claims I‚Äôm the reason they broke up, it‚Äôs all my fault and I hate her and he doesn‚Äôt understand why I would visit her. I tried explaining to him that he encouraged me to reach out to her and that my issue was with how he treated me not her. The argument ended eventually and that was it. \n\nWhen I was visiting her, she briefly mentioned I could join her for another vacation if I wanted. I figured why not, so we solidified plans for me to join her on a week long vacation. I didn‚Äôt know how to tell my dad this, so I was waiting until after Christmas as to not ‚Äúruin‚Äù his holidays. As I was trying to ensure everything was planned out, I asked my dads current girlfriend (who I got along with) if she thought it was weird that I‚Äôm friends with my dads ex. She said no, agreed she was a big part of my life growing up, and she didn‚Äôt find it concerning. I asked if she could drive me to the airport and she said yeah, not a problem, just remind her when it got closer to the date. \nThe problem starts when ex fianc√©e called my grandmother and mentioned the trip to her. Grandmother calls my dad, he calls his current girlfriend to confirm, then calls me flipping out. He‚Äôs upset I didn‚Äôt tell him and that I‚Äôm trying to sabotage his current relationship by asking current girlfriend to drive me to the airport. \n\nThis goes on for a while, with him being upset with me, but eventually he came around to the idea. He said she is a good influence and I‚Äôm allowed to have friends if I want to. The problem is current girlfriend. She claims I‚Äôm ‚Äúa manipulative little bitch‚Äù trying to break them up because I‚Äôm jealous of their relationship and she can‚Äôt be friends with me as long as I‚Äôm friends with ex fianc√©e. \n\nI reached out to her to try and figure out why she was upset and to try and reassure her that I‚Äôm not trying to break them up and all that other stuff. She ignores me. \n\nTime comes for the trip and dad is happy and sees me off. I‚Äôm on vacation and attempt to text and call my dad, and he ignores me. He eventually responded, saying he misses me and all of that. I have a great (free) vacation, enjoy myself, and got out of the stress that living at home and work causes me. \n\nI get back from vacation, and my dad hasn‚Äôt really been talking to me. He finally confronts me, and asks again if I‚Äôm trying to break up his relationship, why I always need to ruin his life, and why he doesn‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt fix everything his current girlfriend is upset with. \n\nSo, I understand my dad being upset because their relationship didn‚Äôt end in the best of terms, and I didn‚Äôt really communicate with him before my vacation. However, I am not a part of his current relationship, and his current girlfriend is refusing to talk about this like a mature adult to him or me. \n\nI just wanted to enjoy a free vacation with friends that I haven‚Äôt seen in years from my childhood (it was more than just me and her on the trip) because it was literally a once in a lifetime experience (someone else paying for a week long Caribbean getaway for little me who has never had an actual vacation in my life). \n\nI have tried to talk things out with both my dad (who keeps changing his mind on how he feels about this) and his current girlfriend (who refuses to talk to me, just bad mouths me to my own father), but I am getting nowhere. My dad just tries to make me guilty about trying to break them up. I don‚Äôt want him to try and get back with ex fianc√©e, I think him and his current girlfriend are great together, but they are dragging me into their problematic relationship and using me as a scapegoat (they have A LOT of other problems that started before this). \n\nI‚Äôve been trying to move out, but my financial situation is difficult, as there are more problems than just this. I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm actually causing a problem in their relationship. \n\nTLDR: went on free vacation with dads ex fianc√©e, dads current girlfriend claims I‚Äôm trying to break them up.  ",

      "description": "Throwaway and this happened several years ago. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was about 12 and my dad had to take over the company they shared together. For several years we didn't see him because he had to work so hard to keep this company running to pay for our and his bills since my mom had a burnout. When we did see him again he kept telling us how awful of a person my mom was for doing this to him, and telling us how she 'wasn't as good as she pretends to be' by giving examples of bad things she did to him, like hiring an expensive lawyer to get custody. We kept telling him this wasn't any of our business, but despite this, at any small inconvenience or any time he went through a rough time he would bring her up. He would also get angry at us for dumb reasons like not doing the dishes when he wasn't home despite him never mentioning that he wanted us to do them. He really hurt me and, as far as I can tell, my brothers with this because we love them both and to have someone you love say such bad things about someone else you love as well is just hurtful. \n\nBecause of all of this, I stopped really caring for him and one of my brothers stopped visiting him alltogether. He is my dad and I love him, but he was acting so childish about all of this that I didn't care to give him any presents or show him that I cared. At the time I got my first job and was finally able to buy an electric guitar, as I had dreamed of for years, causing me to blow the money I earned pretty quickly. I knew my dad's birthday was coming up, but honestly, I didn't care. I didn't buy him a present, and my one brother who visited my dad with me didn't either. He got upset, and still brings it up to this day, and even mentioned this in a talk about how we let him down and he let us down. This shows he does realize he let us down as well, but I am not sure to what extent since he never mentioned that. Was I the asshole? Did I do something horrible or was it justified? It plagued me for a while now since I know I hurt his feelings, I just wonder if this was an inherentely bad thing. I feel bad for this because I know he went through a lot and yeah, my mom caused most of the stress, but he didn't have to be so uptight to use the few times we saw him. Thanks for reading. ",

We have both had feelings for each other for about 4 years even before I was married, but the timing was just never right.\n\nWhen we started seeing each other we had agreed to keep it secret from our friends because they're the type to make it a big deal and neither of us want that, and it's easier to avoid any drama that may arise with my ex. The basic plan was to wait until the divorce went through and I was completely moved into my apartment for us to be \"official\" and open about us. \n\nAt the beginning it was a kinda go with the flow no pressure thing, but it naturally turned into more serious stuff and talk about a real future together that I thought we were both excited for, especially since he keeps joking about how I should have married him in the first place and I'll be so much happier *when* we get married. It seemed like an actual relationship just kinda secret. Up until the past 2 weeks I have been working a full 60 hours mandatory overtime at work when I only normally work 30 hours, and between that and other responsibilities I havent had as much time to see him, but when we talk and see each other its the same passion.\n\n I finally had a night off tonight and tried to hit him up, but didn't get a response which I thought ndb hes busy or sleeping. So I went to hang out with a mutual friend of ours instead, who brought up the friend I've been seeing. I was told he's seeing a new girl, who he met a week and a half ago who is from out of state, and she is staying at his place until Tuesday, and they all went out to dinner the night prior and they seem like they have a great thing going. I didn't react but god it hurt. Me and him have spoken about a LOT of things when it came to our relationship arrangement, but we never spoke about being exclusive. Am I wrong to assume that's a given? He doesn't even know I know, and I don't want to tell him, I just want to end it. I know I was asking a lot for him to wait for this stupid divorce to finish, even though we were seeing each other anyway. But I feel if I call it off now with no explanation he can actually continue things with this other girl and still be happy without me being in the way. WIBTA for being upset about this and calling it off without further explanation?",

      "description": "I‚Äôve recently reconnected with this friend (‚ÄúS‚Äù) we were friends in college, drifted then started speaking again in April last year. When we started speaking again we used to go out/hang out a lot, however in recent months I‚Äôve been feeling like the ‚Äúspare‚Äù friend, who she only contacts or wants to hang with when no one else is available. For example, inviting me to a party 2 hours before it‚Äôs scheduled to happen (I knew nothing about it beforehand) because all the friends she invited had cancelled, then refusing to take no for an answer when I told her I couldn‚Äôt attend because I was ill. \n\nThere have also been frequent occasions recently where S has gone weeks without messaging me, only to do so when she needs to borrow money ( usually around ¬£30 or so), usually for things such as food shopping. I used to borrow it her when it was for ‚Äúurgent stuff‚Äù (¬£50 to put a deposit down on student accommodation so she could move out of her ‚Äúabusive‚Äù mum‚Äôs house, ¬£20 for urgent medicine) and she always paid me back, but recently I‚Äôve felt a bit less willing about it.\n\nI have no issue borrowing her money from time to time, provided she pays me back obviously and it‚Äôs needed out of urgency. However she always seems to message about money within a week of her being paid (she works through the week whilst attending uni, as do I, however S works more due to having a shorter set of lecture hours) and from what I gather from social media it‚Äôs usually spent on takeaways, alcohol or to pay off various Studio payments, a website she‚Äôs frequently ordering from.\n\nShe tells me all her money goes on bills, however the student accommodation company we rent from includes bills for gas, water etc with the rent (overall ¬£90 a week) which all gets paid at the beginning of each semester when student loans get paid in. The only possibly bills she could have is potentially a phone bill, which I doubt costs an entire month‚Äôs wage, so I feel like she‚Äôs being dishonest). \n\nWhen student loans came in in September she somehow managed to spend the ¬£800 of it that was spare after rent within 2 days (to this day I do not know what on), then spending several weeks complaining she‚Äôs skint. It seems as if she cannot manage money, or rather just chooses to spend it on things she wants rather than necessities- she has also tried several times to rope me into spending ¬£500+ of student money in order to go to Disney World with her- money which I would prefer to save for essentials/the future.\n\nAs a result when she messages for money I usually tell her I don‚Äôt have much to spare (which is true, as I only work 8 hours a week due to being at uni the rest of the week, thought when I can I do try to get overtime). However I feel a bit like an arsehole for making excuses to not borrow it her, I usually try to help friends out and feel a bit bad for making her somewhat an exception. \n\nOverall even though I know she would most likely pay me back, I just feel a bit uneasy borrowing money to someone who chooses to spend all their own money on things they don‚Äôt necessarily need then asking others to take care of the necessities. I‚Äôm also beginning to feel as if she only sees me as a personal piggy bank, due to her only communicating me when she has no one else to turn to or needs money. \n\nAm I an arsehole? ",

Its causing me anxiety and now my BF is hurt that he isn't getting affection from me. My BF isn't angry at all, but I feel that maybe there is another way to handle this that I don't know about? I was an only child, and have never lived with kids so I have no ideas on how to keep from getting sick. I have asked my BF to have him and his kids wash their hands, but he often forgets. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

She had a ceremony 6 weeks ago and invited their friends and all their children.  I have to say I am pretty insulted that she would invite a bunch of children to her real wedding ceremony and not invite her niece and nephews to the wedding that is basically just party.  I have no idea why she went through all the motions to get married 6 weeks ago, unless she just wanted the wedding gifts from her family but disliked them enough to not want them at the actual ceremony.  \n\nSo, I will go by everyone‚Äôs judgement.  WIBTA for skipping the whole deal, considering my plate is paid for?  Or can I just skip this whole ridiculous mess that I don‚Äôt really want to go to, return the dress that I bought, and stay with my kids?",

      "description": "20 year old guy, at university.\n\nIn first year I was very overweight and ugly, and a virgin. I had been fat for many years so girls never paid me any attention. After losing weight and even paying for some plastic surgery (yes I went to such lengths), I finally became 'attractive' just before the start of my second year last September. \n\nI was still a virgin so paid for an escort (legal where I live). The encounter was very anxiety ridden and I struggled to stay hard...I felt so awkward and weird when I had to cuddle up with her.\n\nSo my second year starts and I now for the first time find that girls approach me at parties and nightclubs, with some giving very explicit hints to come back to their place. I even kissed some of them at the club. The issue is that every single time, I am way too afraid to go back with them and get my clothes off, even IF I am drunk. It happens every time, and I've probably missed more than a dozen opportunities. People are always puzzled and surprised when they find out I don't get laid, they get confused even.\n\nHowever I know better than to blame women and be an Incel. How can I blame women if they're actually wanting to hook up with me? This has lead me to blame myself. And I hate myself for not being confident enough even with alcohol.\n\nAs a result of this, when I go out to clubs, I basically drink myself to dangerous levels...I drink a whole 35cl bottle of Whiskey straight and then drink even more afterwards,  and smoke a half pack of cigs every day when I wake and skip lectures. When I get approached by girls but mess up or chicken out, I go to the bar and order more drinks and end up stumbling back to my flat alone. My hangovers last a whole day and I get out of bed late at night the next day to rinse and repeat.\n\nMy close friend pulled me aside recently and told me \"Bro, I love you but you're destroying your life...you're being an asshole not only to yourself but to your friends for what you're doing to yourself\".",

So we have had a very rocky relationship for over a year but broke up for 4 months and just recently got back together and planned a trip for new year. \nDuring the time we had broken up we both saw other people, problem is that after a lot of insisting from his part to know with whom I had gone out, I ended up telling him and chaos unleashed ! The guy in question is the little brother of one of his exes and so he thinks I plotted this all along (not the case, we just got along fine and went out). \nSo my (now ex) bf has been falsely accusing me of cheatong on him, on planning to cheat on him, etc.. last night we slept together so I thought maybe things got back to normal but he started telling me things such as that I could only be forgiven if I accepted to do a threesom or that he would just go back to our country and look for a new gf... imagine how I felt, and this morning that he tried to have sex with me, I just couldnt and he ended up getting angry because according to him it is because the other guy \"ruined me\". \n\nSo, this afternoon we went on a road trip but barely spoke, so when we got back in I told him I couldnt do this anymore, so either we spent time together trying to solve things or that we should split ways and he should find a new hotel for himself. He snapped, started to insult me and ended up leaving...\n\nI just dont know how to handle this anymore, I really cant be with someone whom I still love but from whom I receive this type of treatment.

      "description": "My girlfriend and I were recently home from university for Christmas break. We do not go to the same university and do not see each other very often. A few days into the break her friend opened a door and it smashed her head giving her a very serious concussion. \n\nDue to this she can do pretty much nothing except lie in the dark. She can't read, she can't watch movies, even talking can be painful for her. I have every single sympathy for her and I can completely understand how bored and upset she must feel.\n\nBecause of this, I spent the first two days at her house just lying in the dark holding her for 8-12 hours. No talking no nothing. I love being with my girlfriend, I love seeing her, but this got boring pretty fast.\n\nShe asked me to come back and do the same on the third day. I told her that I wanted to see my friends and do other things too. She was upset. I understood this, she's frustrated about being lonely, bored and in pain.\n\nI did not see her that day. The third day I came to see her for 2-3 hours, and left to do other things. She was extremely upset, and told me that it was obvious I didn't care. This was not the case, I care a lot and want her to be entertained, but I did not want to spend my whole Christmas break lying in the dark.\n\nI continued this trend of seeing her a couple hours of the day for the rest of the break. It's been a few weeks and she's feeling much better.\n\nShe is still extremely mad at me because I didn't stay with her during her, \"time of need\".  I don't see it this way, I spent a few hours with her every day. She told me that if I was in her position she would've spent the whole day everyday with me, and is quite upset that I wouldn't do the same.\n\nAm I an asshole here? Or am I justified in wanting to do more than just lie in the dark with her all day everyday?",

I have a lot of work to get done (essay for ap lit, test right when we get back to school in Calc, latin exam I missed and have to make up, etc). My mom calls me downstairs and asks me to take my brother on a walk. Now, I really don't want to, and told her so. She said I had a literal week to do all my homework, but I want to get it done quickly so I can go do fun stuff like hang out with my friends, play the sax, and go swimming. I pointed out he can go on his own walk, because 1) he's 12, not 5 and 2) we live in an upper-middle class suburb that's basically one of the safest places ever. I've walked around the neighborhood at 12 at night before multiple times. So he can safely go on a walk by himself. But my mom forced me to go with him.\n\nSo I was on my phone while walking, doing a quizlet, but I noticed some moving vans near a house, and in the yard hanging out (it was pretty warm yesterday) were 2 kids that looked around my age, a girl and a guy. The girl was kinda cute, so I walked up to them, introduced myself, and asked them if they just moved in. This started a conversation. My brother asked me to stop flirting and come walk with him. I just told him it's safe for him to walk by himself. He seemed kind of angry, but walked away. I got both of their numbers and we went home. My brother was there, and my mom was mad at me for 'abandoning' him. I don't see why. Like I said, my brother's 12 and in a safe suburban neighborhood. There's no need for me to accompany him. \n\nAm I in the right here, or aita?",

      "description": "Some background: I'm a high schooler working (paid) in a position at a small office essentially overseeing unpaid interns. I got this job because I had been an intern for a long time previously, and was promoted when the previous manager left.\n\nI was an intern alongside my friend when I got promoted. As a manager I noticed that most of the time my friend was just on his phone and browsing the internet most of the time instead of doing the work. To be fair, most of what we do is data entering which can get fairly monotonous. I can understand my friend for slacking off because at the end of the day he's and unpaid intern just volunteering for the experience.\n\nHowever, today my friend sent me a draft of one of his college essays talking about his internship at the office, and he completely lied about some the things he did there. For example, he said that he was promoted to senior intern for his work (there never was a promotion). He said he was tasked in this new position to delegate and oversee new interns and had the freedom to create and manage projects (thats my job). He said he had conversations with the head of the office to improve the projects (I'm not even sure the head remembers his name). Finally, he said that he was leading a particular project we were doing that I actually supervised. \n\nEssentially, my friend was saying on his college applications he was doing the job I'm doing, while not even fully doing his duties as a regular intern. When I asked him about it, he straight up admitted he was lying but said I shouldn't care since it wouldn't affect me any (we're not applying to the same schools). I basically told him that I would make sure the person who promoted me at the office (the head of the entire intern program) would follow up with the colleges he's applying to, so he should change his essay to make it reflect the truth. I can understand embelleshing your achievments, but not straight up fabricating them. Now he thinks I'm an asshole.\n\nAm I?",

I currently just got a job full time making about 12.90 an hour while I'm also going to college full time, I'm trying to save enough money so that I can afford to go to school and not end up with a huge debt on my hands.\n\nSo My dad just got a new job that pays a lot less money than his old one and my parents are currently strapped for cash but my dad is still blowing his paychecks on stupid things like candy and soda. My mom called me into our living room yesterday to tell me she's going to start charging me rent because money is tight. I told her that I won't do it because for one I was promised that I would be able to stay living at home for free as long as I was attending college and for two why do I have to make up for the money my father carelessly spends. It's not my fault that they don't choose to budget their money. I just recently lent her 100 dollars that I didn't really have to give her on the promise that I would get it back by payday. Payday was yesterday and she told that I didn't need it back and that she'll keep it just in case she needs it.\n\nSo I am asking my fellow redditors, am I an asshole for not wanting to give my mom money?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Throwaway because reasons. My wife went to her cousin's bachelorette party and took my niece with her (she's 18 freshman in college). She offered my niece if she wanted to go with her and I was fine with it so long as my niece could be open with her mom. I was happy for my wife because I understand she's happy for her cousin and I honestly try to be as supportive as possible especially if I think my insecurities get the better of me. \n\nSo drop them off wish them the best and to enjoy their night. I get a text around midnight that they were ready to be picked up. I head out with my 4 year old and 2 year old to pick them up (neither of them drive plus my wife was drinking) once I pick them up I hear from one of the other guests that they really enjoyed the stripper yada yada. Mind you my wife made shorthanded comments joking about going to the bank for singles. I asked her point blank and she gave me a vague (well duh it's a bachelorette party) I kind of shrug and then remind her how she's been with me in situations of just hanging with my friends and how she would react to a scenario like that. I don't make a fuss and let it go say no big deal. \n\nI understand I don't doubt her one bit but it bugs the shit out of me that she lacks the perspective that if i don't ask for details maybe you should keep it to yourself. I trust her and if you had fun awesome! But it took about 4 times for me tell her that yes I trust her but that doesn't mean I want the details of said cool girl time debauchery. Knowing full well she's been on my balls calling to check on me every 30 minutes if I play DnD with friends or running errands with my mom and getting checked up on as if I might be having an affair right in front my mom (my mom would strangle me herself considering her previous relationships). \n\nAm I the asshole here? I just wanted her to have fun and I wasn't interested to know the details. I trust her but it fuckin kills me she has a horrible double standard. I honestly feel if i enjoy something without her she will guilt trip the shit out of me if she wasn't there. This moment just hit me to the point where I realized I might be done with this shit.",

I am back again with another moral dilemma concerning the same couple as last time! \n\nMy previous post about the same couple: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/arhjkt/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_best_friend_for_dating/?st=JT7R3AG6&amp;sh=e0abbeff\n\nTLDR: My best friend says she won‚Äôt date my ex after I told her their closeness makes me uncomfortable, suprise, they end up dating, I feel weird and upset with all of it. \n\nReading the post above might help explain the situation \n\nSo Best Friend and I are junior and senior (respectively) in high school, and that glorious hormonal mosh pit of a dance is coming up. That‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs prom time!\n\nKeep in mind, I‚Äôve been telling Best Friend that I am uncomfortable being around them as a couple. At one point, she reveals to me she‚Äôs not even entirely sure of her feelings toward Ex. She‚Äôs confessed that there are ‚Äúunresolved feelings‚Äù between her and her own ex, but she insists that she‚Äôd never revisit the relationship. \n\nIn this same convo, as she‚Äôs discussing her doubts about Ex, and I kinda slip up in the moment and say something along the lines of ‚ÄúOh, thank god. I was worried you were gonna bring Ex to prom!‚Äù. \n\nWrong thing to say, and I feel a little guilty for jumping the gun like that. She gets a weird look on her face and that ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see what happens‚Äù before prom, and I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it, because ‚Äúa lot could happen between now and then‚Äù. \n\nI am sorry, but I do not want Ex at my senior prom. He‚Äôd be going in my group, because we are all in one friend group and those are my only friends. I would feel like total shit all night, remembering the previous two proms I spent with him. As unhappy and embarassed about it as I am, the breakup is still tender and seeing him hurts. I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with them if I didn‚Äôt feel so... ouchie whenever I saw him. He‚Äôs not even in high school anymore. \n\nI have considered restating this to her. I might‚Äôve been able to suck it up and shut up if I knew they were completely in love, but she‚Äôs not even sure how she feels.  I don‚Äôt know. I really don‚Äôt want him there.  \n\nI know this story is biased from my point of view, but I will try to answer questions and such as neutrally as I can. \n\nWIBTA? ",

      "description": " \n\nAbout 1 year ago I started to become friends with my best friends (BF) boyfriend, and he'd occasionally invite me out to do things with him. At the start I was very sceptic about the whole thing, constantly asking BF if it was ok, they aren't uncomfortable with things, and they always said it was fine. So after a while of this I stopped asking if it was ok because 1: It had always been fine before and 2: I felt that now as a friend of her boyfriend it wasn't entirely necessary to ask to see a friend. Occasionally I would still ask if it was ok just to check, and if BF ever brought it up they would confirm that it was alright.\n\nYou guessed it though, recently it hasn't been so alright. Apparently BF feels that all of their friends would prefer to see her boyfriend instead of her, and that when I do go to boyfriends house BF feels left out in a way. I'm told (by boyfriend) that BF always knows when we are hanging out, and the issue only really arises after the day. I should mention that nothing has ever happened once between me and boyfriend, it's been entirely friendship.\n\nI want to know, AITA? I haven't had a chance to talk to BF (issue escalated a week ago, and before that they always said it was fine) , and when I do hopefully it'll clear a lot of this up. Should I stop seeing boyfriend? It would suck because they're a good person and a good friend, but I'd rather have my best friend then a good one.",

Anyway so in my junior year for whatevrr reason they stop doing it and I fail more classes. Even before I fail 1 or 2 classes in semester. So right before winter break I get call onto my councilers office and he tell me that unless I pass all my classes at end of semester and then next semester I don't have enough credits I can graduate. Ok I have never pass all my classes even when ectra help. Then I'm really sad for Christmas and that sucked. We have a big fight on NYE but went out anyway and got really drunk. And they blown up my phone all night but I ignore them. I went home in the morning and they stay up all night for me and pissed off. We have a big fight and I leave. I stay with different friends and my bf which is totally forbidden but I didn't care becos I was mad. After I miss enough days school they call my mom and she calls me and I'm just like it doesn't matter becos I wasn't going to graduate anyway? And they said I can't come home ever if I don't go back to school but its been to long anyway. So I know this is all over a mess but am I the asshole or should they let me come home at least to get my stuff?\n\nI wear out all my friends and broke up with nf over some stupid shit well he broke up with me. I am living in a pay for the week motel and I barely have any money for anything but rent. If I could get my stuff I have some money from Christmas and I could get my clothes and stuff to sell.\n",

      "description": "My brother's birthday is coming up soon so he has invited some friends to go clubbing the day before. He called me to talk and to invite me to also go with them so we could celebrate his bday all together. I know most of the people he is going with, and though I wouldn't say they are straight up friends, I get along fine with them. My issue is not with any of them, my problem is that I really don't wanna go to any club anytime soon. I've been countless times and have sort of outgrown that whole vibe. I think it's a super shallow experience, straight up just don't like going anymore, would have a bad time, and bring the whole mood down with my not wanting to be there. I have nothing against anybody who enjoys going though, have a good time. It's just not for me anymore. I can try my best to pretend I'm having a good time but eventually the mask would fall off and people would start noticing. To give ya'll a little more context, he did this for his birthday last year also, and that time I actually went, so I feel like he should maybe pick something different to do this year instead. I even suggested this to him over the phone and he won't budge. It's his day though so it's his choice on what he wants to do and I totally respect that. I said that I would think about it and would let him know soon. He pretty much said I would be an asshole if I didn't go. I can't tell if this is coming from a good place or not. I'm torn between thinking he just wants me to be there so bad because I'm so important to him, or if it's his sort of narcissistic personality coming out and demanding that I go or else. He would never let me hear the end of it if I didn't go. He said he would do it for me if he was in this situation, but I don't really believe that. The next day we are also having the family get together to celebrate his special day. We're probably going to a restaurant and just chill all day, so it's not like I wouldn't celebrate his bday entirely. So what do you think Reddit? Should I just make this sacrifice? Just get totally wasted at the club so I don't have an unpleasant time? Or should I just not go because I don't want to and become the asshole I was always meant to be? ",

      "description": " So I recently moved like a month ago now from my hometown after completing my education to be with my GF who currently lives with her sister. Both do work normal day jobs and obviously for me I am eagerly trying to find work while also wanting to explore the city. However since getting here though I‚Äôve had to accustom to different living habits and noticing the strangeness to not have your own ways. I am in no way a picky person to live with by any means but like basic things to be able to put my clothes in adequate space, to do my laundry my way and keeping a clean kitchen are necessities I need when living somewhere. Now closet space was an issue with my gf that we had to resolve after a few weeks, but all my pants are still hanging by clothes hanger which I am not use to. Secondly my GF‚Äôs sister recently bought this place and is trying to save on hydro and water by not using the dishwasher and only doing laundry when she is here on the weekend. Now over the course of living here I have been doing the dishes all by hand in the morning when they have left for work and dishes to do at night as they often don‚Äôt like cleaning dishes after supper throughout the week because they claim to be tired after a working day so I have been doing piles at night too. On top of her power saving habits I‚Äôve needed to adjust to waking up in cold temps as she turns heating down to 15C over night in the middle of winter.\n\nLiving under what feels like doing the dishes 70-80% of the time I also end up having to shovel whenever it snows by myself (only 1 shovel), clean the baseboards, vacuum the house/week because of her dog, salt the ice laden path to the front door because they both couldn‚Äôt shovel it better before I got here. Another time I had to go rent a truck and pickup large sheets of wood for her sister on the complete opposite side of town because she can‚Äôt do it during work. I don‚Äôt really like saying no to anyone when asked to do things because I don‚Äôt like upsetting people and am not lazy myself, but its draining when finding a job is like a full time job and I have a load of house chores to do while they are at work and then when they come home all they do is watch TV and leave dishes. I also have to cook and prep food also or else I get sidekicks or grilled cheese for supper...\n\nAll being said I‚Äôm grateful for my GF‚Äôs sister to allow me to stay here and all, but we are still paying 600 from gf and 300 from myself a month. Additionally I buy basic stuff needed such as a kitchen garbage can, paper towel and not dollar store garbage bags. But it‚Äôs getting to the point that I am kind of resenting the fact I feel like I am treated as a stay at home dad or something and get a text or asked on weekends from the sister if I can shovel, clean the bathroom, dust the place, vacuum, start cutting this wood, etc. I‚Äôm scared to say no because of ensuing arguments.",

      "description": "So I broke up with my ex about the first week of January this year. I was the one who broke up with her to make that clear. Breaking up we still had feelings for each other and wanted to stay together but can't because we both want to go completely different directions in life. \n\nAfter this breakup, she has drunk messaged, called, or snapped me maybe once or twice a week saying how she misses me, wants to be with me, and physically wants to be me, aka horizontal mambo. Now I never indulged her to go pick her up and bring her to my place or anything. I pretty much just said, \"yeah it sucks, i miss you too, we both have feelings still but bad ideas\" I tried asking her to hangout when we were both sober but she only wanted to see me when she was drunk, that should have been a red flag.\n\nYesterday I finally got the box of her stuff together and took it to her place to give it back and help her with her car, it was totaled recently and she needed to go fill out some forms to sell it to the dealership. \n\nNOW I MADE THE MISTAKE. I fucked up here i know and tried to kiss her. She rejected me okay fine, but I was kinda hurt after being told how much she misses and wants me. I then ask if she has been with other people since and if she has a date for her sorority event this friday. Yep, shes been with minimum two guys. Okay i shouldn't care, but after her telling me how bad she wants me that just fucked me up. She then asked if i'd still be able to take her to finish the car stuff on Friday. So pretty much she wants me to be a glorified chauffeur. So pretty much she wants to be friends still but only for me to drive her and never actually hang out.\n\nSo am I the asshole for being super pissed for her messages and everything and then being mad that she still wants to be \"friends\" and have me drive her around when I want to go no contact?",

There is another railway which a different friend made which he made connecting to my house. My house is becoming a train station where there is a lot of messy rails. So in a solution, I relinked all of the tracks to a small building that has a track going to both of my friend's house and not including mine\n\nThe friend that originally made the tracks got pissed and just made the train tracks messier and linked my house again, but in a lazy way. The tracks took up the whole train station and didnt look pleasing. I got a little pissed by it. I rearranged  the tracks and made it more pleasing to the eye. I told my friends that I fixed it and they didn't mind at all (including one of them who made it). I showed it to the friend who originally made the tracks and he got pissed and said all this.\n\n\"I want to physically assault you\", \"Everyone is mad at you.\" While I said \"It's more cleaner and easier to move around.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind both of our tracks have the same exact function.",

      "title": "AITA for getting revenge on my neighbor?",
      "description": "This may be a long story because this has been going on for a year, but here goes. About a year ago, i moved into a trailer park. It's in a very rural area, which is good for me. I like peace and quiet, it's nice and tranquil.  Up until my neighbor started to be a nuisance. It was this family, which had a ton of kids, like at least 7 or 8 and a dog, a big dog, a great dane. It was fine for awhile. They seemed ok, they invited me and some other neighbirs for barbecues and everything. But as time passed, they got more and more annoying. \n\n\nFirst of all, their dog. They never watched their dog, they just left it outside. He pretty much wandered all over the trailer park. Sometimes, their dog would come over and play with my 2 dogs. But, he also would come over and poop on my lawn. Which is gross, i mean, it's bad enough having to pick up after my own dogs, but then i had to pick up their dog's crap too. So, i just went over and asked them to not let their dog crap on my lawn. But they got rude and defensive about it. \"Well, your dog comes over to our yard!\". WHich was true, but my dog doesn't crap on their lawn, just to play with their dog (which they said was ok). \n\n\nSo, things were tense after that. Speaking of their dog, it kept coming over to my yard and getting into fights with my pitbull. Which is not good, you can't have these big dogs fighting like that. So i toldthem to keep their dog off my property. They never listened and kept letting their dog run around the neighborhood, and unfortunately, the dog ran into the road and got hit by a car and passed away. Which, was sad because the dog was actuallly pretty friendly. Just had poor boundaries.\n\nSo, they got 2 new dogs. 2 Chihuahas. They kept these 2 dogs outside 24 hours a day. During cold, heat, everything. They never let them in. The only place they were allowed to go was the tool shed. They could never come in their house. Their dog kept coming over to my yard, so i complained again. They put their dogs in shock collars.\n\nBut, these dogs made me miss the Great Dane. Because these dogs bark at EVERYTHING. It's like non stop. All day it's just BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK. I mean, i know dogs bark, but this was too much. Especially when the owners leave them out for hours, or really days at a time, and don't do anything to stop it. That's not annoying, they're being a nuisance to the entire neighborhood. So, me and a couple other neighbors visited them and asked them to control their pets. They said \"Well, call the police if you don't like it!\" and slammed the door. This went on for months\n\n\nIt got really bad, because it was an all day, every day thing. So eventually we did call the property owner. So, property management visited them and told them to keep the noise down. It got to the point that i had to call the police or the property owner almost once a week. They'd come over and tell them to keep their dogs quiet. I mean, i know that dogs bark but when it goes on for 2 or 3 hours at a time, then yeah, that's a nuisance. It's not like i was calling on the first bark or anything. It was also made worse by the fact that they would just leave the dogs alone and go away from the house. Just leaving them out in the yard when they're not home\n\n\nSo this went once for about 4 months. And one time, we called and they got a fine. A ticket. They started doing the right thing. For a couple weeks at least. I finally had enough and called animal control and told them about the dogs being out and barking and they took them away. I remember, i went outside and saw their young kids (at least 5 or 6) were crying. \"Why did the bad man take Lucy and Diaz away?\", then the mother pointed at me. \"That man, he did it. He made them do it!\"\n\n\nSo, after about a month, I got a visit from the propery manger. They said that my dog had been going onto their property.This was actually really bad timing because it was my son's birthday. I was having a cookout with the family and actually invited them as an apology. They just told me to go to hell.  So, i started cooking the burgers and setting up the picnic tables and next thing i know, i see the property manager coming up along with a police officer.  She told me that she got a complaint that my dog had been going on my neighbor's property. So, I asked which dog it was, she said it was my pitbull and that he was going over next door every day for the past 2 weeks. But the thing is, my pitbull actually passed away, like a month andn a half prior to this. I actually looked at their trailer and saw them peeking out the window while the manager was with me.\n\n\nI mean, we have another dog. A Corgi. But we keep him in the house or within my fenced backyard because he couldn't be trusted. He would wander off. A lot. I explained the whole situation, and she understood it, that they were getting revenge for getting their dog taken away. Especially since the dog they complained about is dead. Which was also a low blow to us, because my son loved that pitbull and he was so upset once he heard about the neighbor and it reminded him of his dog.\n\n\nSo, after the party, i confronted them. I almost got into a fight with the dad \"You know, if i wasn't in front of my kids right now. I'd kick your ass!\", so i walked out and he told me \"Watch your back\".\n\n\nSo, after a couple weeks, he started up again. His revenge on me. \n\n\nKeep in mind, at this time, i worked TWO jobs. One was an office job, the other was at the nursing home. i worked all night and would sleep during the day. And becuase of this, i don't like a whole lot of noise. I mean, some ambience is okay, but people being a nuisance is not okay. Here's how they got back at me. The whole clan (mom, dad and kids) all got in their driveway and just started screaming their heads off. Hooting, hollering and everything. And this woke me up, about 3 pm (i usually get up at 6 pm for work). I bought ear plugs, But it got worse. They started blowing air horns, and i swear i heard a saxophone in the noise. Their was a chainsaw at one point as well. This was during the day, at night when nthey weren't screaming, they would blast country music from their car radio. Full blast. I mean, i would sometimes leave at 8 pm and get home around 4:30 or 5 am and it was still playing full blast.\n\n\nThis went on for almost a week and progressed each time. I thought they'd get bored, so i didn't call the police. You know, too much of a hassle. But i did call the police. My son couldn't sleep, he was tired of it. They came, and even when they were over there, my neighbor still had their music playing. So, anyway, they got a warning.\n\n\nA few weeks went by, i'm mowing my lawn. And his wife came up to me. She actually apoligized and said the father had been drinking too much and everything. That she's ashamed of how petty he's being and that she threatened to divorce him. Then the husband came up and grabbed her by her arm. He scolded her for ''Apoligizing to the bastard\". He told me how much the kids loved those dogs and that i'm a homewrecker and his wife is divorcing him because of me.\n\n\nSo, later that day, he dragged out his amplifier to the porch and his guitar and played over and over, full blast. So, that night i had enough. I knew the police would be no help, so i grabbed the trash can from my bathroom, full of used toilet paper and dumped it all over their lawn. I also sent a fake phone call to their home phone, pretending to the the wife's lover.\n\n\nThe next morning, the fireworks went off. They argued, she started screaming \"I'm tired of this!\" and she divorced him and took the kids with her.  He started screaming that he loved her and to come back. \"You can't leave me! You can't leave me! Come back! Come Back!\"\n\n\nAnyway, he had a bit of an emotional breakdown on the lawn. Then he started blaming me for what happened. To top it off, i'm actually considering hitting on the ex-wife.\n\n\nAm i at fault here?\n\n\nSo, am i the asshole for escalating this feud so badly that i caused a man to get divorced?",

      "description": "TLDR: Roommate lit blunt in front of me in our kitchen while making casual conversation and proceeded to smoke it in his room\n\nA  little background, I live in an on campus apartment with a close friend from high school and our new roommate.  I'm not a huge fan of the new guy, he's a few years older than us and stays up late most nights playing video games and being pretty but rationalizes it to us by saying he's a twitch streamer so he has to yell and scream.  I've been woken up a few times by him jumping or shouting but it's not frequent enough to be a problem, just a nuisance.\n\nAnyway\n\nThis happened roughly fifteen minutes or so ago so the smell is still very fresh.  I was sitting in our living room doing some last minute studying for an exam I have tomorrow.  Our new roommate (I'll call him NR) came out and went to the kitchen which is right next to the living room.  Conversation went a something like this:\n\nMe: Hey\n\nNR: What's up man?\n\nMe: Nothing much, just some cramming.\n\nNR: I feel that I feel that\n\n(His back was towards me but I could clearly see he was holding something against the electric burner on the stove)\n\nNR:  What test you got?\n\nMe: Thermo \n\n(At this point he was pretending to look for something and slightly bent down to take a drag and get an ash going)\n\nNR: Well good luck\n\nAfter that he walked back towards his room with his hand behind his back and closed his door.  I have nothing against smoking weed and may or may not have done so a few times but never on campus let alone in our apartment.  My other concern are the room inspections tomorrow night.  Since we live on campus we have room inspections once or twice a semester and I know how long a smell can linger.  I'm concerned about this somehow tying back to me or my friend.  I just know if I did say something it would turn into a he said vs she said kind of argument since I can't really PROVE he was smoking in the apartment.  I'm just honestly torn because I don't really care about smoking weed and don't want to ruin his life over it but at the same time I have my own best interest at heart and don't want to risk anything related to my education because I just got accepted into my major today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, would I be the asshole for saying reporting him for smoking weed in our apartment?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I said something rather dismissive I suppose, but I stand by it. \n&gt;‚ÄúIf my husband makes less than the full time nanny ($30/hr), or the cost of daycare then we‚Äôd be wasting money by hiring a nanny and him not being a stay at home dad.‚Äù\n\nNow I find this personally very reasonable and financially responsible.... but he said I was being too demanding in my wants for a husband along with my life goals and it made me feel kinda like an asshole... \n\nso reddit am I the asshole for expecting my husband to quit his job if he makes less than what it takes to care for the kids before school age?\n\nDisclaimer: this wasn‚Äôt the only thing he considered demanding but it was a big part. The other things were I wouldn‚Äôt go to the gym *with* my husband because I don‚Äôt like to exercise with people (maybe it‚Äôs cuz I‚Äôm fat but I just like to do that shit by myself). And that I want a husband that‚Äôs taller or as tall as me (6‚Äô0). And I don‚Äôt want him to be fat, because I‚Äôm working hard not to be fat and I want a life partner with healthy habits.\n\nDisclaimer 2: I make more than the nanny currently and I don‚Äôt expect to change my career drastically within the next 10 years. Earn another degree maybe, but no wild changes. \n\nDisclaimer 3: I‚Äôm 23 and single as a Pringle. So these are just future projections. \n\nTLDR; if my husband makes less than we would have to pay the nanny or day care I would expect him to quit his job and be a house dad... AITA?",

      "description": "So, first off, I have bipolar disorder. It's taken decades of trying, but I'm finally on a med combo that works and I'm fairly stable and high functioning. I have friends that I hang around with that are also bipolar, and attend a support group. I'm fairly active in the community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, I wake up insanely early for some reason. Like 3-4:30am early. I just can't sleep. So I dick around on my phone until Starbucks opens at 5. Then I roll over there and study. There's usually the same people there. Older men on tablets with earbuds in, so it's fairly quiet and usually I can get a lot done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday though as I was waiting for my drink a grizzled guy started talking to me, asking my name, if I was going to work. Along the lines of \"Oh, studying? What are you studying for? Oh to be a nurse? You must like money.\" Then he started telling me all about him and how he lost his wallet and ebt card, etc. etc. It was embarrassing, because I just didn't want to be put on the spot like that in front of everyone, but I felt like I had to talk to him to be polite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething was just off in him. He was too wired and loud for that early in the morning. Usually everyone there speaks as if they're in a library. I don't know if he was high or drunk or mentally ill, but something was off.  So I grabbed my drink and went to sit down. He sat down too and I thought \"oh good, now I can study!\" But nope! TJ kept started talking to himself, loudly. Repeating \"I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man\" to himself loudly. Then someone else came in who he started peppering with questions. Finally they just turned around and walked away. TJ started talking to himself more. I covered my ears with my hands to drown him out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally some policemen came in and he made a hasty exit- they were just there to get their coffee- no one had called them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a big relief that he had left, but I still couldn't concentrate on what I needed to be doing, so I left too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I felt really bad. Like should I have talked to him more? Should I have been less annoyed for him spoiling my study time? Should I have been more sympathetic? He didn't seem like he needed help or was a threat to himself, he was just very obnoxious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know. WITA for being annoyed?",

From there it snowballed into a manipulative relation ship from his part and me feeling bad for him because of his manipulation to make me think there was something to feel bad about. \n\nEarlier this year I was on our local high school football team. I invited my dad to my first game/scrimmage. He said no for no apparent reason and made the excuse he was busy. I asked him what he was busy with. He came clean and said that he wasn‚Äôt he just didn‚Äôt want to go because the bleachers would hurt his back ( my father has had 2 back surgeries to fix a problem of his but it still causes pain).  I said that was fine because I figured it was a better excuse than most and that he would not come either way. A few weeks later I‚Äôm scrolling through Facebook to find he went to his fianc√©s daughters game. \nHer daughter is a cheerleader that is all. I later called him out on it and he responded with his fianc√© had bleacher seats. He also said that it was a real game not a scrimmage. \nI responded with why couldn‚Äôt you come to my game after buying a bleacher seat. He said they where to expensive(50$ for those wondering). \n\nI found this complete and utter bull crap because he lives in practically a mansion house and owned a brand new 1794 truck. \n\nI called him out on this and that because one thing led to another. In the end he called me an over entitled brat for wanting him to come to my football game and stop being a manipulative Pearson. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I know the title seems heartless but let me explain. \n\nI have 2 friends who I‚Äôve know for 1-2 years, R and D. They‚Äôre good friends and we like to joke around a lot but recently they‚Äôre behaviors have been getting more and more on my nerves. \n\nLet‚Äôs start with R. R has no respect for my personal boundaries and constantly touches me in places which are triggers for me. For the past year I‚Äôve continually asked him to stop touching me but he never listens. I think it‚Äôs worth mentioning that I‚Äôm trans (ftm) and he‚Äôs threatened me by saying he‚Äôll call me by my deadname if I didn‚Äôt do something for him. This is a big trigger for my dysphoria and he knows this. When I call him out he paints himself like the victim and says I took whatever he did the wrong way, wether it be him belittling my mental health and making it seem like not a big deal or touching me when I tell him not to, and he rarely apologizes. How hard is it to just apologize and move on, seriously? He does tale it to the extreme sometimes and even went as far as to one time tell me that he should just ‚Äústop talking‚Äù and I told him how ridiculous he was acting but he didn‚Äôt listen. \n\nD is childish and annoying. It‚Äôs like he still stuck in elementary school (we‚Äôre in high school) and he acts very immature. I‚Äôve only ever told him once to ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù bluntly but that was only because he was getting on my nerves. When I do hint that I want him to act maturely he takes it to the extreme and acts like a stereotypical asshole. He also has a habit of running in really stunted steps (basically he barley brings his foot up and drags it along the ground as he runs) and it really annoys me. \n\nI have another friend who‚Äôs just a whole other story. He‚Äôs all around mentally unstable and ill probably write another post on him some other time. \n\nSo yeah, AITA for hating my friends because of their behavior?",

(Neighbor is 28F and married to Neighbor‚Äôs Husband, 38M)\n\nAnother guy starts coming to the barn, an 8th grade boy called Mattie. Now Mattie had been held back a year because he briefly lived abroad and ~foreign school systems~ or whatever, so he‚Äòs 15 and should be a freshman in high school. But he‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs still super in 8th grade.\n\nSure enough after a few months Emily and Mattie start dating. My friends and I initially make a few cradle robbing jokes because c‚Äômon, but we‚Äòre for the most part cool about it. However, when Emily goes on vacation with Other Friend, Neighbor, and Neighbor‚Äôs Husband, it comes up that a friend in out group, June, doesn‚Äôt actually know who Mattie is.

So within our group chat I was playfully teasing Emily about his age OR SO I THOUGHT when all of the sudden she hands her phone to Neighbor and shit gets real.\n\nNow I deleted the screenshots as an act of goodwill, but I‚Äôll try to paraphrase our conversation below. M is Me, N is Neighbor, J is June. Also J and I are lesbians which comes up in the conversation.\n\nN: I had to take the phone because Emily is so upset during what was supposed to be a relaxing vacation. Wow OP, for someone who likes to think of herself as progressive you sure are intolerant of other people‚Äôs relationships!\n\nM: Excuse me? I don‚Äôt ‚Äúthink I‚Äôm progressive‚Äù. Are you saying that because I‚Äôm gay?\n\nJ: Emily is gonna turn 18 soon though and then their relationship won‚Äôt be legal.\n\nN: It‚Äôs not because you‚Äôre a lesbian, I‚Äôm bisexual and I‚Äôve probably hooked up with more girls than either of you! (OP‚ÄôS NOTE: i am 17. everyone else in the gc is 16 or 15.)\n\nJ: that‚Äôs really creepy. Why are you bragging about that to a group chat full of teens, aren‚Äôt you like 30?\n\nN: 28 actually, but thanks! Also it wouldn‚Äôt be illegal for Emily and Mattie to date so long as they don‚Äôt have sex. I met my husband when I was 14, he‚Äôs ten years older than me. We didn‚Äôt get together until I was 19 and we‚Äôve been together ever since!\n\nM: That‚Äôs fucking disgusting and it seems pretty pedophillic that a 24 y/o dude met a tween and decided he was gonna marry her.\n\nN: It wasn‚Äôt abusive. Love is love, right?\n\nJ: Fuck off you homophobic freak.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs pretty much where the conversation ends. I don‚Äôt speak to Emily or Other Friend for a week or so, but once school started I send her an apology. I basically say that I was sorry about making hurtful jokes about her relationship and that I didn‚Äôt realize they upset her and wouldn‚Äôt make comments like that again. I very carefully don‚Äôt mention anything about Neighbor because I felt like I wasn‚Äôt in the wrong there. I also send an apology that June had written up but couldn‚Äôt send directly which said she hadn‚Äôt meant to attack Emily and was sorry that she seemed aggressive.\n\nThings go back to normal-ish for a while, but  Emily has been skipping out on group hangs on account of being busy. I plan a movie night and as we‚Äôre discussing it in the group chat, Emily texts me that she won‚Äôt be going if June is there. I‚Äôm pretty confused because as far as I know, June apologized and all was well. However, Emily tells me that she never got a genuine apology from either of us because we didn‚Äôt apologize for arguing with Neighbor and neither of us admitted we were wrong. (this is why she had been skipping hangs). I tell her that it‚Äôs unfair of her to ask that of me and that I would never believe that Neighbor was right and I was wrong. \n\nWe get into it a bit more, I bring up that Neighbor was being weirdly homophobic by comparing gay relationships to legally pedophilloic ones, Emily says that Neighbor couldn‚Äôt possibly be homophobic because she‚Äôs bi and ‚Äúwas a lesbian.‚Äù This pisses me the fuck off and I say, ‚Äúfor you to look me in my dyke eyes and tell me im overreacting for being pissed at your shitty friend making homophobic comments is unbelievably shitty‚Äù (to which she replies ‚Äúcan you fucking not right now‚Äù) and I shut the conversation down. \n\nFour months pass. I act ambivalent at this point because she has to spend more effort to avoid me than I have to to avoid her, but it still kinda sucks. We were best friends for like five years and now our friend group is split down the middle as she won‚Äôt go to anything that June and I are at. Eventually she contacts me and we smooth things over with no actual apologies or admittance of wrongdoing, and go back to business as usual.\n\nBut I want to know, because it still bothers me sometimes: am I the asshole for unknowingly making fun of something she was actually sensitive about and then shit-slinging with her other friend? Or am I right that it‚Äôs weird for an 8th grader to date a Junior in high school and for a 28y/o‚Äôs best friends to be some teenagers?",

      "description": "I adore my older siblings, but I do hold some animosity for what they did to me when I was younger. I'm the youngest of my full-siblings (I don't live with my half-siblings), so I was an easy target, but I could usually retaliate in some way. When I was about seven though, my siblings and dad were watching Chucky and I was kinda lonely, so I asked if I could watch and my dad agreed, but told me it would be scary and because I wasn't willing to be a coward in front of my siblings, I sat and watched part of it, all I remember was I saw Chucky murder someone and this terrified me, which my siblings realized when I asked my dad to turn it off and seeing as I was close to tears he did, my siblings were rightfully angry about, but left me alone about.\n\nIt was around a week later and I still had an irrational fear about the doll and I wouldn't allow the light to be turned off, because I thought he could get me in the dark. I eating dinner and I assume being an annoying little sibling, it was clear my older sisters were getting annoyed and both went to the room I shared with my second eldest sister (it was the largest bedroom) and I followed them, they noticed and let me enter first which I found a bit odd, but didn't really care, until the closed the door and turned the light off, telling Chucky was going to get me and even though I was able to turn the light on, I was still scared and by this point bawling and they only let me out when my dad heard the commotion and went off on them, so they let me out of the room. Unfourtanetly they continued to do this to me when I got on their nerves, or our dad was gone\n\nEven years later I can't have the light off without the door open and the hallway light on, or I start panicking. Both my sisters have apologized, but think I am being a bit of an asshole for holding resentment for it and I starting to think their right, but I still can't shake it off as me being irrational.",

      "description": "Basically, my friend and I were on a bus together and she had my crush‚Äôs number from being on a group chat with him a very long time ago. I had not added him but rather her and I had permission from the group to do so. She starts texting him weird stuff, keep in mind it‚Äôs almost impossible to stop her from doing stuff like that, and I told her to stop when it seemed to be getting out of hand. She did not stop. He was asking her (not very politely) to stop texting her, but she continued because she found this hilarious. I ended up texting him that I was sorry for my friend and that I had told her to stop, but she would not, but he said to her that he never received those messages. So I tried again on WhatsApp later (there‚Äôs no WiFi on the bus and I don‚Äôt get much data) where I saw that he had blocked me.  He also went onto a group chat with a load of our mutual (can‚Äôt remember the spelling I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs early: ah-quaint-tans-is) and told me to p*ss off with my friend and to stop adding him to group chats. I had only ever once added him to a group chat and when he didn‚Äôt want to be there I never added him again. My friend had added him to another group chat weeks ago but I did not say she should and, yet again, I said not to do this, but she did not listen. Luckily, in the group chat where he told me to p*ss off, I did manage to explain to people what happened but I‚Äôm reconsidering whether I am a bad person, because he is half ignoring me whereas before we were really good friends. I will describe what I believe to be his point of view but I don‚Äôt know 100%. \n\nHis point of view (in first person):\n\nMy friend added me to two group chats where her friend got my number. She was texting me in a really weird way and she kept insulting me. She said that my friend tried to text me as well (probably to do the same thing) but I never got the messages so she was probably lying. I had just got out of school which just was the cherry on the cake. I was really p*ssed at my friend for letting her friend do this to me, and so I took a bit of revenge and told everyone on a group chat that she was a bad person to make sure she never did that to my other friends. Now I don‚Äôt know how to talk to her because she looks scared around me. Another one of her friends keeps telling me that she hates me, which doesn‚Äôt get to me but I just don‚Äôt really appreciate it. I know that this girl likes me but geez she was like a creepy stalker. I have blocked her on WhatsApp and now she‚Äôs ignoring me a bit in  addition to looking scared. I mean, that could be down to a lot of things but I don‚Äôt know. \n\n(Keep in mind that his view isn‚Äôt perfect because I am not him but I tried to keep this as unbiased as possible)\n\n(Sorry mods I don‚Äôt really see anyway to implement paragraphs so sorry)\n\n",

      "description": "So it's new years eve, alcohol is flowing and everyone's having a good time, I'm there with girlfriend who sees some people she knew from her childhood in the neighbouring booth. Now things are all good, we are having fun and are both intoxicated by British standards (which is like 5 times the socially acceptable amount for Americans), and then one of her friends gives me a nudge and says /u/viralmelon go over there she is being harassed.\n\nLo and behold, they're a bunch of ugly cunts with even uglier personalities, no sooner I walk over, they start saying things like 'oh yeah he has to be with her' And calling her a slut and saying she's unfaithful, pretty sure they said I was rapey and a paedophile as well as a f*****. I have general anxiety disorder and am incredibly awkward and uncomfortable-looking, they would have a field day with me. Now I've never been jealous in my life and if I wasn't told what was going on I may not have noticed, but I wasn't going to stand there and have the 2 of us be humiliated by a bunch of toothless Neanderthals.\n\nHowever I'm not the strongest guy, nor was I stupid enough to fight them, so in a flash of rage I pulled one of their seats out from under them as they moved to sit down. The guy landed flat on his ass in a drunken mess.\n\nNow this was a monumental Fuck up, but for a split second I felt like the awkward protagonist of an early 2000s coming of age film. This feeling evaporated as they all squared up to me and told me to go outside, pure screaming at me. This rage was impotent, I just calmly sat down and smiled at them, inside the bar they couldn't do shit.\n\nAfterwards, as we were leaving, we found out they were kicked out of the pub and one of them saw me and punched me in the back of my head. I just walked off and didn't express pain, I was kind of laughing inside.\n\nAnyway we moved to another side and my friends calmed them down, while I briefly felt moderately proud, I'm guilty that I placed my friends and girlfriend in danger cause my feelings were hurt, which is very weak. However, there are too many homophobes and just general degenerates in the world, I figured even if it was underhanded, i dealt a small amount of comic justice.\nI just feel guilty for acting like a child, and scaring people by putting myself in danger, afterwards I apologised to my friends and said there was only so far I could go, before it got too much.\n\nSo yeah, am I an asshole? If the answer is yes, I'm not a misogynistic homophobe, so there's that. \n",

      "description": "My mom runs a daycare in our house. When they're napping, she opts to sit in the kitchen and read a book instead of the living room. Fine, whatever.\n\nWhen I get home, I ask if she wants to go downstairs to watch TV (we have a TV in the kitchen but the chairs are wooden, whereas we have comfy couches and a recliner downstairs). She usually says no because she has trouble with the stairs. I've suggested we put a TV in the living room many times over the years and she always says no. She claims we have nowhere to put it but if we rearranged things, we'd have room. Alternatively, we could just mount it to the wall above the piano. We have a spare wall mount that she bought for my sister's room (but my sister didn't want her TV mounted) and I have one in my room so it's not like she has issues with wall mounts.\n\nShe usually ends up doing all of the dishes. Most of them are from her daycare anyway. I do most of the cleaning (her bathroom is always absolutely disgusting - she claims it's used the most but it's not). I got her a Roomba for Christmas because every week she put the vacuuming off until Sunday at 10pm and then would yell because she still had to vacuum. Now it vacuums every night at 9pm so she can't say the vacuuming doesn't get done. Other than that, I clean the bathrooms, vacuum the basement, and dust both levels. Also, every night I take the garbage out, and I do all of the laundry (3+ loads/week) because again, stairs. She does also usually cook dinner, but when we order in I pay 50% of the time. I also do *all* of the shoveling and lawn mowing because of her arthritis.\n\nThe other night she bitched at me because I never do the dishes. I told her that's because I take out the garbage, do most of the cleaning, and do all of the laundry. Those are my chores. She says she's frustrated because she feels like she never gets out of the kitchen. I pointed out that there are plenty of other rooms in the house that she could spend time in, but she chooses the kitchen with the hard-ass wooden chairs and that's not my problem.\n\nAlso keep in mind that I pay rent (she asks for $150, but since she's on my phone plan it makes more sense for me to just pay that and then pay her the difference than for me to pay her $150 and then have her pay me $50 back a few days later), saved her $10/month on her phone bill by adding her to my plan, and pick up stuff all the time on my way home from work (full time) that I never ask for payment for (she used to bitch because my sister asked for payment so I just don't bother).\n\nI know she works hard, but I do too. My job is a desk job, but one mistake can cost clients and my boss several thousand dollars.\n\nSo, AITA for not doing the dishes?",

      "description": "(Written on phone sorry for any grammar/spelling issues)\n\nNow hear me out before you immediately say that I am. I NEVER go into this room, it's her room where she does her makeup and such. I didn't know this light was out or I would have just changed it, also my wife can't change it because she is to short to reach\n\nTonight, before I go into work my wife says she has a chore for me to do. She tells me \"I need you to change some light bulbs\" and starts naming a few that have been going out. Each light has 2 bulbs so when only 1 goes out I don't usually notice. She continues telling me about that both in her room have gone out and she's afraid to go in there at night (I work late shifts 2 days of the week and over night shifts 2 days of the week) and can't do any of her chores in there while I'm at work (NO I DONT GIVE HER CHORES TO DO). So as she's telling me all of this she has an embarrassed infliction on how she's explaining it to me and I can't stop laughing. She keeps going on about how it's not funny it's serious she doesn't know why I'm laughing because she's afraid of the dark and what if there is someone living in there and only comes out at night and I about cried. \n\nSo without going into too much detail AITA for laughing? (more details can be explained if needed, but I don't think I'm totally TA.)\n",

I have reached out to him multiple times to get him his mail, Ive given it to my neighbor who goes to church with him to deliver it, Ive left it on my front porch and told him its here and looks important and every time he has come and gotten it but now hes getting more and more distant and not answering my texts. I figured he would eventually do a simple mail address change and fix all of this but that hasn't happened even after i have asked him to do so. Now i have mail piling up on my kitchen table that has been here for almost a month, some of which are from the IRS to one of his companies and yet he has failed to pick up. Im getting pretty tired of being his personal assitant for his companies and thinking about throwing all mail from this point forward away. AITA?",

      "description": "So  my roommate keeps always going on and on about how I eat \"more\" than  him, and how he \"only eats a meal a day\" and doesn't get why I'm so  thin. In reality he eats 3 peoples worth of food (not trying to be mean,  its legit that much) and its all VERY high calorie meals. VS me, where  if I do go to Mcdconalds I get like 2 hashbrowns and a soda, and I  usually eat a lot of vegetables, rice, home cooked soups, ect.\n\nI've  had to start eating a lot better and usually eat multiple very small  meals a day. Like one small baked potato and corn, or rice and miso  soup. But he still insist I eat more and doesn't know why he's fat.\n\nFinally  I had enough and said \"Its cause you eat very high calorie meals and a  lot of food at once...\" and he's been quiet since and just generally  moping all day.\n\nHe's been the kind of  person to play off doctors saying \"You need to eat better and exercise\"  as fatphobia, on seriously. And keeps INSISTING he has chronic fatigue  syndrome when doctors keep saying \"No you legit just need to fucking eat  better and not sit at your desk all day playing WOW!!!!\"\n\nHe  also keeps insisting he's \"bit boned\" and \"just has a bad metabolism.\"  when at this point I don't think that's true. He was a very thin kid  before he started sitting inside all day playing WOW and eating food.  Who knows, maybe if he worked out, age well, he'd lose the weight  drastically.\n\nBut anyways, am I in the  wrong for pointing this out? My bf (who's fat I might add. more to love)  says I'm in the right. And if you're gonna be fat just be fat, don't  blame it on shit or BS us with \"no I eat so litttleeeee\" because We know  its not true. But I don't know man. I was a fat kids and am now skinny,  but any time I point out weight things to my overweight friends they  get pissed and say I \"don't get it\" and have \"thin privilege\" (I wish to  god I was joking...) and I'm just not sure what to believe anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Rommate is huffy I said he eats a lot of food at once and a ton of calories even though he eats \"one meal a day\" vs my \"many meals\" and how unfair it is I'm skinny.",

      "description": "Anywa im 20, and about a yearago, I had sex with a cougar. A married cougar. She was older, i think 38, in that ballpark.\n\nIt started off rather innocently though, she'd just make comments as I would pass by her house, like \"hey handsome!\", and after a few days, I helped her with carrying something in her house, when I did, she invited me for tea. And, after that, she started to invite me over rather frequently, sometimes to hang out. Other times to help with things around the house.\n\nI started to get curious, since she seemingly lived alone. When I asked If she was married, she told me she was, but her husband had been deployed for almost a year and she was incredibly lonely.\n\nShe started to get more aggressive with her advances. And she promised she'd keep it a secret if we tried anything. That was all I needed.\n\nWe were intimate that night. Needless to say,it was great, most of the women Ive been with were very shy during sex, but she wasn't, she was more of a take charge person during sex. We hooked up a few more times after that, but stopped when her husband came back.\n\n\nThey divorced after awhile.\n\n\nBut, am i the asshole for doing this? I mean, it was an impulse choice, but he kind of chose to join the military and leave her behind like that.",

      "title": "AITA for calling out my ex?",
      "description": "Throwaway account for starters (also, I'm a girl). So this all happened within the past couple of hours. My ex, M, and I have been broken up for several months but have continued to be friends and still hang out frequently. When we were dating, there was this guy my roommate was hooking up with who I was friends with who would come over and hang out. For some reason he mainly would talk to me and would purposely bump into me or something and although I could see how it could be taken as flirting, I always thought of it as friendly banter.\n\nM, however, thought it was super disrespectful because it was in front of him and he definitely thought it was flirting. This became a big deal because M grew to hate him and never wanted to be here when he was over. \n\nFast forward to today, M and I are broken up but still hang out frequently. We were just casually talking when he told me that his ex from 4 years ago messaged him out of the blue and apparently wanted closure on their relationship. However, this same ex has also been married the past year and a half. At first I figured it was whatever, and M and I just continued chatting as usual. \n\nAfter awhile I asked him if they were still talking and he said yeah and I thought it was kind of strange, given the fact this girl is married and it started with them talking about their past relationship that was years ago. So I asked him what exactly he was doing. Maybe it's just me, but I would't really feel comfortable talking to an ex that's married, especially if our past relationship was what started the conversation. Early in our conversation he had even stated that he wouldn't feel comfortable with his wife talking to an ex she was intimate with if he was married. \n\nSo I basically was like, \"dude, she's married. Do you not find it weird that out of the blue, 4 years later, she suddenly wants closure? Don't potentially become a homewrecker.\" His counter was along the lines of that it wasn't his job to make sure she sticks to the marriage and that he wasn't the one that signed the marriage license. At this point I was kind of at a lost for words because to me it basically sounded like he didn't care what happened to this girls' marriage even if he potentially had something to do with it. \n\nTo try and keep things as short and to the point as possible, he felt that there was nothing wrong with being a person for her to talk to and that if their marriage doesn't work out then oh well. I tried to explain that he's being disrespectful to her husband and that maybe he isn't the person she should be talking to and that he could be the bigger person and just not talk to her so as to not become a reason for this couple's potential split. Along with this he's said that it's not his job to make sure she honors her marriage, plus he said that he's aware of the possible repercussions to her but that apparently she seems willing to take the risk.\n\nI just feel like overall he's a hypocrite and doesn't care about what he's doing, plus, I feel like he's being even more disrespectful than the guy he ended up hating. \n\nBut anyways, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Called out my ex for talking to his married ex and he doesn't see the problems there.",

      "description": "For those who don‚Äôt know, there was an issue about a number of fake Lululemon Instagram accounts being made. They promised that you could be a Lululemon model if you followed their recruitment account, tagged them in a post and had at least 150 followers. Lululemon has stated that they are in no way associated with these accounts and are working to get them removed. \n\nOne of my aquantainces whom I follow on Instagram, who I will call S, made a post tagging a fake Lululemon recruitment account. After seeing it I immediately messaged S to tell them that it was fake. S simply responded ‚ÄúOk‚Äù and I thought that would be the end of it.\n\nTwo days later, I saw that S had tagged the Lululemon recruitment account again, and, I messaged S saying ‚ÄúWhy are you still tagging them?‚Äù \nS responded quite quickly ‚Äúbecause I can‚Äù\nI cringed at that and responded ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an argument. You‚Äôre implying that there is no harm in tagging them‚Äù\n‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt‚Äù\n‚ÄúThere is‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù\nI gave S a long paragraph but, basically, when you follow them, they follow you back, which allows them to stalk your account. And by tagging them, S might cause someone else to follow them and get stalked.\nI guarantee you that she didn‚Äôt even read it because after 3 seconds, S replied ‚ÄúO my god. Stop harassing me‚Äù\nAt that point I was starting to lose my patience, so I replied ‚ÄúHow is that harassment? You ASKED for that explanation‚Äù\nShe responded with ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt like you critiquing everything they do. Mind your own business. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs fake.‚Äù \n\nWe‚Äôve argued over this 2-3 times and it usually just boils down to that.",

We had already celebrated his birthday with our family at home, this was just going to be for him and his friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe body of the party is the inflatables, which is about 1 1/2 hours. During this time I was basically just sitting on a bench by myself browsing Reddit. Afterwards, they sang Happy Birthday and served pizza and cake. For a bit of clarity, I really don't eat pizza or cake unless it's a certain type I like (it wasn't).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had wanted to stay at home and just chill, but my dad forced me to come because my little brother would be \"upset that I wasn't at his birthday party\".

This was my first relationship and I didn‚Äôt know she was dating someone at the time. Had I had a fraction of the life experiences I gained through the 1.5 years of dating this girl, I would have walked away from the beginning (but there‚Äôs no sense on dwelling over something I can‚Äôt control). Big surprise, she cheated on multiple times. I‚Äôm really caring and nice so I stayed with her despite everyone telling me not to. Recently, she‚Äôs started talking to someone or seeing someone. That same person is the reason we are broken up, as he had drunkenly kissed my ex at a party, prompting her to end it with me. On top of all of this, I have plans to hang out with her ex (the one she was dating before me) so we can match up our stories. I‚Äôve heard that she had cheated on her ex despite her adamantly denying she had to me multiple times. I could care less what she does with her life. I‚Äôve blocked her on all social media, deleted her pictures, blocked her number and told her I don‚Äôt want to speak to her. But this was all before I learned this new information. So, WIBTA if I were to call her out? ",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago but still haunts me over who was the asshole in this situation, if anyone. Throw away because...subject matter.\n\nSo, my brother and I were both college students at the time. We were back in town visiting my parents. I was feeling ill and left the dinner table early and laid down on the couch. I guess I ended up falling asleep there because I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of my bro masturbating. Now, this was 100% unintentional. He had no idea I was there. I was on the couch in the living room and he was sitting on the floor on the other side of the living room. So I wake up, I'm confused and don't know what to do. Like...I just froze. Fucking...what are you supposed to do in that situation? So I panicked and did nothing. Well. Whatever. He finishes, goes to his room, and scurry off to my room, the end.\n\nIt was a few years ago so I don't remember the exact details but I was pissed and told him so the next day, fully expecting him to be like, \"oh shit I am so sorry I fucked up I didn't mean to\" BUT NO he was pissed AT ME. \n\nMy reasoning for being mad: it's not like it was some secret that I laid down on the couch (he was there during dinner when I wasn't feeling well), didn't intend to fall asleep there, and the responsibility is his to make sure there is no one in the room when he is masturbating in a common space?! \n\nHis reasoning for being mad: I irreparably (I dunno, maybe an exaggeration...) embarrassed him by not making him aware of my presence and waiting until he finished/left to leave.\n\nMy response to that: I had just woken up and freaked out and didn't know wtf to do. \n\nHis response to that: I don't remember, but he definitely stood by his position that I was the one at fault here. \n\nFor context, I am pretty sure he was in the living room because the internet was super shitty/spotty in his room and was probably watching porn or something. I certainly didn't look, and I don't think he ever specified that this was the case, but that's my assumption. \n\nWe both wanted the other to apologize, neither would, our parents started getting pissed that we were having some mystery fight we wouldn't tell them about and ruining family time, eventually we just agreed to never speak of it again and that was that. It hasn't ever come up again in the years since and I love the fuck out of my bro, he's a great dude, and this was a weird blip on our relationship. BUT STILL he was so adamant that I was the ass in this situation and I really didn't think I was, so here I am for judgment. I've tried to represent the events and both sides fairly. So, AITA? ",

I was already iffy about going out since I lost my driver's liscence and would've had to drive out 20 min without one, but against my better judgement i went anyways, because I love this girl and promised her we'd hang out. Anyways, I arrive, and call to tell her i'm here, but she doesn't answer. So I call on another social media, and still no answer... I didn't know exactly which appartment was her mom's, and I have pretty bad anxiety, so instead of knocking on random doors, I just waited in the car.... A few minutes later, still no answer from her, so i wait some more. After 20 missed calls, and 2 and a half hours (no i'm not exaggerating, that's how long I waited outside in the parked car, in the cold), I just said fuck it and left. A few minutes after I arrive home, she calls me crying, telling me she fell asleep (for 2 fucking hours), and that she was sorry and really wanted me to drive back out to go hang with her. Now I'm a pretty patient dude and would bend over backwards for this girl,  but I was kind of pissed off at that point and told her I wouldn't see her tonight. Her mom ended up driving her home, but now she's very sad and is sending me messages implying she's sad and crying, and I'm kind of guilt tripping myself into wondering if it was wrong to refuse to see her now.\n\nAITA for not wanting to visit my girlfriend, after waiting 2 and half hours outside her house and eventually driving back home?",

One night we started talking and the conversation kept going for hours. Toward the end of the night (pretty much the morning of the next day) I found out from her that she broke up with her boyfriend at the time. Not a lot of people knew they were dating because they kept it low so no one would know, including me. I didn't think that much about it but felt bad for her because I knew her ex and he can be an asshole sometimes. For probably the next week it was constant talking and texting each other until 3 am. We started to hang out outside of school and there were even more obvious signs that she was willing to give me a chance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew at the time that she was giving me obvious signs but kept it going. My last 2/3 relationships ended up in me just being the rebound and it made me insecure going for girls that have recently broke up with someone since I think I will just be another rebound.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did think she was pretty and have had small crush on her for a while even before she broke up with her bf. I told my good friend Rob (told me I could use his actual name for this) about everything that was going on. I told him that I was going to wait a week or two more before I actually ask her out on a date. He knew about my past relationships and he understood why I would wait a while. Just like high school is word got around and through mutual friends she found out that I liked her as well. After a couple days she gradually stopped talking to me and stopped hanging out with me and things went back to the way they were before. I found through mutual friends that FF though I was leading her on and that she hated me for it because I knew that she just broke up with her boyfriend.

      "description": "Take it easy on me - ltl, ftp, on mobile, etc etc.\n\nSo, yesterday morning I'm on my way to class and my gas light comes on, so I pull into a gas station. I'm flustered because it's already been one hell of a morning - running late, screeching toddler in the backseat, rush hour, you get the idea. I'm talking to kiddo (3m) through the window trying to explain yet again that no, throwing a fit does not mean you get candy for breakfast, yes, you have to wait until dinner for candy, no, we don't throw toys in the car. I'm distracted, so it doesn't really click at first why the gas pump won't let me run my card. \n\nI decide it's not worth it, I'll pull around to another pump that has the card reader working, and hit cancel payment. Displayed on the screen: \"Please see cashier to cancel prepay.\" ....what? Prepay? I didn't prepay? \n\nI'm one of the only people there. It's a big station that has 24 pumps, and maybe 5 or 6 are taken. The closest person is several stalls away, so it's not like it was an error where the person on the other side of my pump or the space behind me told a clerk the wrong number. For all appearances, it looked like someone just prepaid for this pump and just.... left. But why would someone do that? My best guess is maybe it was one of those \"pay it forward\" moments... \n\nReddit, I'm not proud... but I used the prepay. It was $20 worth, over half a tank for my car. \n\nIt's no excuse. I should have gone in and told the clerk, and made sure it wasn't a mistake. But there was no one, and I was in a hurry, and I'm a single mom doing school full time. I'm not proud. But $20 is $20. \n\nReddit.... AITA for taking advantage of an abandoned prepay?",

      "description": "This past New Year I was at a party with some friends and one of them brought out the game Scattergories. In short, each person draws a card and puts it in front of them. The card has a symbol and a category, and if you match someone else's symbol you call out something from their category to score.\n\nM matches a symbol with R, and has to call out a \"Famous Cowboy\" a he says, Dak Prescott. Dak is a football player, not a traditional cowboy, but by all means is famous and is on the Cowboy's team. I thought this was a really fun loophole to get a point.\n\nAt this point D says no and denies M the point because she is a huge Eagles fan and will have nothing to that football team. M and I agree whatever it's a game, but we'll keep the loopholes out.\n\nNext I match symbols with R and she has to say a \"Monster\" to which she says Harvey Weinstein and picks up the card for the point. I think that is a great and hilarious answer and would have been happy to give her the point, but we established a precident. M and I say no that's not a real monster and if M can't call Dak Prescott a Cowboy, they can't call Harvey Weinstein a monster.\n\nWe got a look of horror from D and R at the idea we wouldn't consider him a monster. I have no sympathy for that guy and think he gets what he deserves, but I just wanted everyone to follow the rules. Loopholes are allowed or they are not.\n\nIt ended with R mockingly saying to D, \"Don't worry they're cool guys,\" and then we moved on. I just wanted it to be fair and came off as a sympathizer to a bad man. Maybe I am the asshole for taking a New Years game too seriously, but I like knowing rules.\n\nThank you for reading, I accept my fate asshole or not",

      "description": "Hi everyone! My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years, he hates conflict and is generally happy to go along with plans I‚Äôve made (doesn‚Äôt force himself to, just is an easy going person). I‚Äôm a big planner and want to go on a vacation somewhere together. \n\nHe has financial concerns because we have a few bills recently from our cat going to the vet. He makes enough to cover living expenses and food, but barely. We have a travel fund explicitly set for him with $540 in it (only for him because I make enough to have extra / have ample savings). \n\nWe had talked about going on a trip to NYC because my friend would be gone letting us stay for free, plus I offered my JetBlue points (I have enough for 2 FREE round trip flights) because I know his financial concerns. We could also use the travel fund for food, etc. He dragged his feet on asking his manager because he was scared and then the tickets were too expensive so we couldn‚Äôt go. It then came out that he was also still concerned about finances. This is fine, but it was MONTHS of planning and him saying ‚Äúthat sounds fun‚Äù etc. We fought, and he let me know that he‚Äôd tell me his concerns in advance next time.\n\nNow anytime I try to bring up travel, he resorts back to ‚Äúthat sounds fun‚Äù and agrees with my financial planning (‚Äúoh it‚Äôs cheap enough you could use the travel fund‚Äù ‚Äúwe could stay for free with your parents‚Äù) but doesn‚Äôt want to commit to anything because of financial concerns. I don‚Äôt quite understand these concerns because we have the funds, we can stay for free at places, etc. \n\nSo the question is, am I the asshole for getting upset at him for wanting to travel but not committing to anything? I get frustrated because he says he wants to go, and when I make arrangements for it to be financially possible he still has problems with it.",

      "description": "I am in my 30s, married and have a son. My parents want me and my family and my sister and her husband to rent a condo on the beach for five days this summer. Don't get me wrong, I love my parents and we have a good relationship. But I do not want to vacation with them. Here are my reasons why... \n\nThe trip will probably cost about a grand total. This includes splitting the cost of the condo, gas, meals, dog boarding and any  planned activities. Could we afford this trip? Yes we could and it's not a terrible deal. But I don't like the beach. I burn easily, sand sucks and gets everywhere you don't want it, I am not a beach person. I don't want to spend $1,000 of our hard earned money on a trip that I am not excited about. Originally they said that we could use their friend's condo for free and we wouldn't have to pay anything for lodging which is the only reason I was considering it. Turns out we can't use it this year.\n\nI have been trying to get pregnant for a while now. Had two MCs last year and my husband and I have been trying again for the past six months. Basically all of my free time is spent thinking \"what if I get pregnant\" and I really don't want to use a week of vacation when I may need it for maternity leave. It's frustrating for everything to revolve around this \"what if\" but what if I do need it? We have had full fertility  work ups and no issues were found so the chances of it happening soon is very high (fingers crossed). \n\nThe week they want to go falls on my husband's and my anniversary. We've had a tough year with the two MCs and our marriage has only gotten stronger. We want to do something for just the two of us on our anniversary. Sleeping on a pullout couch in a condo with my family does not sound special. \n\nHonestly, these are my current reasons but I can't foresee a situation where I will ever want to vacation with my family aside from a long weekend getaway. My parents and sister are great people and I love them dearly. My sister has actually become one of my best friends as we have entered into adulthood. But it's odd to me to go on a trip with my parents as an adult. I have my own family now and want to go on our own vacations. I feel like saying yes now will turn this into an annual thing and I don't want to have this conversation every year. \n\nI know they only want to spend time with us and to take my son to the beach. We live about 3 hours apart and see each other every couple months for weekend visits so we don't spend a crazy amount of time together but it's also not like we only see each other once a year. In theory it sounds like a nice trip, but there are so many reasons why I just don't want to go. My sister and parents are asking every day if I am on board and I don't want to hurt their feelings but I don't know what to say. So tell me Reddit, AITA? ",

      "description": "I‚Äôm sure many of you will think this post is dumb and I am a clown for posting about this, but my girlfriend is so upset I need to know if maybe I am underreacting...\n\nBackground: My (24M) girlfriend (26F) have a pretty solid segregation of household chores that works for us, some weeks I‚Äôll do more other weeks it‚Äôll be her. What never changes, though, is that I do all the dishes and she does all the cooking.\n\nLast night GF asked me to take some chicken out of the freezer so she could cook it after our show was over to take for lunch the next day. Show ends &amp; the chicken is still pretty frozen, so GF says she will wake up early (7:15am, when I also wake up) and cook the chicken for both our lunches. \n\nNext morning comes and GF really wants to have sex, I‚Äôm tired and really want to shower, but hey it‚Äôs sex so of course I comply with her request. After she gets off I let her know that I‚Äôm running late for work and need to shower, so I don‚Äôt finish, I just run to the shower.\nAt this point it‚Äôs late (around 8:20) and I obviously know it‚Äôs impossible for her to cook our lunches before I leave, so I (apparently passive aggressively) ask her if she‚Äôs going to cook the chicken and have me pick it up from her job at lunch time.\n\nLunch time rolls around and GF let‚Äôs me know that she had indeed cooked the chicken. I had training for a new product today, basically all day, and was invited to have lunch with the instructor. I tell GF to leave my lunch in her job‚Äôs fridge for me to pick up tomorrow instead of today.\n\nSHE GOES OFF. ‚ÄúI was late to work for you‚Äù (she gets in around 10am usually, today 11am) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never fucking cooking lunch for you again‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why the fuck I go out of my way for you‚Äù ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to me‚Äù ‚Äúget off your fucking high horse‚Äù...

      "description": "Hello, everyone this is my first time writing something like this so bare with me.\n\nWithout a doubt I despise/resent my older sibling who I'll call Zach for now. For years now Zach has been raised like a fucking king by my parents, they always let him off for stupid shit he does, and has grown a serious self centered ego because of this. Zach has always gotten on my nerves and has been a terrible role model for me growing up.\n\nAs I get home from school my parents are frantic because Zach's not answering his phone and the truck he uses gone. 2 DAYS later we're eating dinner and the fuck just walks in like he never even left. safe to say parents were pissed and yelled at him for once. Couple months later, my parents, little bro, and I were shingling a clients roof. Mom gets an overwhelming pain in her stomach. We were asked to finish today so dad had to keep working while I resorted to calling Zach to come pick her up and take her to the EM.\n\nHe didn't pick up.\n\nA near hour goes by while my mom's crying in pain and he doesn't answer his phone or our house phone. I had to drive her to our house so she could change, holding her hand while driving as her face is beet red. We arrive and I bang on his door cursing at him while mom changes. She was in the ER until 2 am as she was passing large kidney stones, I don't know what would've happened if we were too late but thankfully she recovered.\n\nThis fucking guy has gone nearly a year without working with my parents, nearly wasted all of his money by getting takeout with ‚ÄúJackie‚Äù (his gf), and dumped his workload onto me. I had some hidden anger for him but this takes the fucking cake.\n\nHalloween of last year, my parents called me, I go and ask what's up. They give me two photos of an ultrasound. I didn't believe it. I gave it back to them and asked if they were scaring me. They were looking at me with smiles. FUCKING SMILES. Maybe I'm just overreacting, its a good thing to have a child but then I remembered. HE'S ONLY FUCKING 20! \n\nAbout 1 week ago my parents decided to make a room in our garage into a room for Zach and Jackie. They have been working all week, my parents and a close friend. I'm getting called to help out and notice that Zach isn't with them, he's in his room. He‚Äôs watching hulu, in his bed with Jackie. I'm busting my ass to move all the materials into making this room for him and he's not even helping. I sit back in my room while my parents keep calling for me so I tell them to call zach instead. Dad ended up so frustrated that he ended up disconnecting the power so everything was down but for now I have a hotspot.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTL'DR: My brother has always been a pain in my side and has done bad choice once after another to the point where he's going to be a father despite not being able to even legally drink. I've shown no support for him and my parents have asked when I'm going to. Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "So, its been a while since my ex broke up with me but its been eating my mind and no one else has given me good opinion what was right or wrong.\n\nSome background before starting, So we were in 3 year long distance relationship.I had met her whole family and stayed at her home for a week, got lots of love from them and I loved them too. she had stayed with me for 2 months there was up and downs a lot but we made up every time.\n\nHer family was financially stable until her father lost good job after that they were in huge debt. I kept helping her a lot both mentally and financially even my parents agreed to pay for her college but she wanted to do job to help her family and not go to college. I told her she can get good paying job if she goes to college first but she never listened and just wanted to help family. \n\nSo, after doing few jobs she got job at a resort and one first day her staff(will call him X) forcefully kissed her, she slapped him few times that's it. I told her to complain to superior but she said she don't wanna create trouble or lose this job. After that, X kept kissing her and touching her whenever he liked and she did nothing, didn't slap him or oppose him, not complaining to superior and kept doing job like its nothing wrong while breaking inside mentally. \n\nAfter a week I couldn't just watch her like that and told her father that please force her to quit or complain to the superior personally else she may even get raped, even I don't know how far X has gone with her. She got mad at me as she had told me to do nothing and then forced me to tell her father that I have lied about whole thing and make up some excuse else she will hurt herself. So, I did that and after few days of not talking she told me everything has ended and just to forget her.  \n\nI didn't even get to have closure or to know anything, If you guys have any questions about missing info feel free to ask. I just wanna know Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "My mom and brother are visiting me here and have a 2 bedroom hotel room.  My mom came early and hung out with my 2 kids for the day and checked into the hotel. Its 9:30pm-ish and my mom and kids are waiting for me and my brother to come up to the hotel room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I go and pickup my brother from the airport.  We are both freaking exhausted.  We both had long days.  We get to the hotel elevator, both carrying luggage.  I push the button for the 10th floor and the elevator doesn't move.  I quickly realize you need a room key for the elevator to move.  I start texting my mom to come down, but she's not responding.  I'm pretty sure she's asleep as she has stopped responding to group text awhile back.  So we're both just standing in the elevator.  It's not moving.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of a sudden two girls show up.  Obviously hotel guests.  I'm thinking \"oh we're way lucky.  I'm just going to push the button for the 10th floor after they use their room key to push their room number\".  This scenario has happened like dozens of times in my experience in hotel stays in the past.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight as the girls start walking in, my brother jumps out of the elevator.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm shocked and say, \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\" to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe says, \"It's not right.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI start trying to convince my brother to get back into the damn elevator.  He's refusing, saying \"it's not right.\"  WTF.  I realize the girls are just standing there bewildered, so I start trying to explain the situation to them.  \"Can we please use your room key to get to our room?  My mom....\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It's not right.\"  My brother interrupts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Uhhhhh‚Ä¶..I'm not comfortable....\"  Girl #1 says.  Both girls are staring at me like I'm crazy and about to murder them.  Sigh.  Frustrated and tired, I give up and get out of the elevator.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe and my brother start arguing and he's like, \"We can just go to the front desk and get room keys.\"\n\n  \n\"No, we can't.  The room is reserved under mom's name only.  Not ours.  And I'm pretty sure she fell asleep!  We could have just pressed the elevator button right after them without even saying anything!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It's not right.  We cant do that.  It's not rig....\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust then, some guy shows up to use the elevator.  I quickly follow him into the elevator, leaving my brother mid sentence as we are arguing.  Surprisingly, my brother quickly follows me into the elevator as well.  I push the 10th floor right after the guy uses his room key.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get to the hotel room and of course my mom was asleep!  My son answered the door.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "(throwaway account) \n\nMy best friend (BF) and I have been friends since 4th grade. Ever since then, a lot has happened - she changed schools, moved away to another state, college, etc. \n\nThe thing is, BF's life is slightly messed up. Absentee dad caused her parents to live separately for a long time finally leading to a divorce. She then moved away with her mom and brother to live with her uncle to cut back financial costs.\n\nEver since the move, her life has been a roller-coaster. In many cases she has been enjoying her life - especially academically (compared to me) but her home life is a little sadder compared to mine because her uncle is often an asshole.\n\nBecause of the uncle, she finds her home life to become difficult because she finds the uncle to be pretty controlling. Alot of times I've agreed because he does sound a little harsh, BUT he's the sole earning member of her family (which is her, her mom, her brother, her grandmother, the uncle and his wife and three kids) so I mostly try to understand if he says something strict. There's some sound reason behind it. \n\nWhenever something like this happens, she complains to me about it. I always try to reason it out and make her feel better or give her solutions  or some help.  \n\nAlot of our conversation topics are related to some problems she's having either in school or life.\n\nOver time, I personally believe we've grown apart. I definitely love her and care for her, but I've made newer friends and grown closer to my existing friends. So has she. \n\nI also think she finds it difficult to believe that I've changed. I'm more of a 'out of sight, out of mind' kinda person so I kind of get how she could've sensed that I'm a little more distant.\n\nBut I feel like I'm her agony aunt or something. Because of her stressful life, I've always told her to rant to me whenever she feels upset because going to a therapist isn't a really viable option for her, but now I feel really tired.\n\nI love her (not so much as I used to if I'm being honest) but I'm trying not to invest myself too much in her problems because then I get affected too. \n\nAlso, when I was going through some tough shit and was seeing a therapist, if I called my BF for help, it wouldn't be too great. She's not the best consoler to talk to when crying.\n\nAnd, ever since we've started college, I've made new friends who I like alot. Because we're in same classes I talk to them more. I think because of this I've been neglecting her a little which also makes me feel really guilty. \n\nA few weeks ago she asked me if there's something between us that has changed. I fibbed and said that it must be stress (we're having tests and shit) because I don't want her to know how I feel - her life is stressful enough. (No one likes to find out that their best friend might be tired of them.) \n\nSo, AITA for feeling tired and distant from my best friend?",

I told her if she hates it so much she can get a job and do something but she literally refuses. she spends what little money my mom has on dumb shit and wonders why my mom gets pissed. \n\nmy sister, who is turning 30, will literally throw temper tantrums and will pout if things don't go her way. it can seriously last hours or even days. she lies, constantly, about anything she can. she's a habitual liar (I used be too but I'm trying really hard to work on it and be more honest and open). \n\nI'm not perfect either, I don't have a job right now because I'm a full time student (my sis isn't. she doesn't want to go to college/they can't afford it) but I have had jobs in the past which is how I'm even affording being a student (I paid for everything myself). other reasons i suck:I'm a slob, I'm lazy, I smoke a lot and I still sometimes lie about dumb stuff. I probably contribute daily to the mess my sis cleans up. \n\nit frustrates me that my sister acts like a spoiled toddler but she's still family. birthdays are a huge thing for all of us but I just can't bring myself to care about hers this year.  my mom says I should suck it up and be nice to her and not ruin her birthday for her. I do feel slightly like an asshole if I hurt her feelings (especially on her birthday), but like a justified asshole? \n\nAITA? \n\ntldr; I've got a spoiled brat/drama queen for an older sister, her 30th birthday is coming up. mom said I need to be nice to her and not ruin her birthday\n\noh and I live in New Mexico.

      "description": "So about a month ago my gf of 2 years and I broke up. Her friends came to me asking what had happened between us, claiming a story completely different from what had happened. So I went through the details of how she had emotionally cheated and broke up so she could have sex guilt-free because she wouldn't technically be cheating. I showed some texts I'd gotten from her to prove my point when they wouldn't believe me. Since then most of her friends have turned against her, and my ex hits me up calling me an ass, and that it was none of my business what she'd been telling them, and that I should've just dismissed it. I get that if I hadn't told her friends what had happened (and to be honest, I did include some personal, intimate details) then she wouldn't be getting so much hate for her actions. I know that the way I displayed my viewpoint to them was filled with a lot of spite, and my personal hope is to ruin her life the way she did mine (she quite literally gave me a mental illness and some issues and habits I won't include here). I don't really care that she thinks I'm an ass, but it got me thinking about the issue.\n\nAITA for turning my ex's friends against her by telling them about her cheating and abuse?

      "description": "My friend had her bachelorette a couple weekends ago. The two ladies organizing her bachelorette sent out an email about the bachelorette in September (6 months prior) asking us to RSVP. I initially said I could go, but between September and March my work schedule changed (which is not unreasonable I don't think?), and I was only able to spend the Saturday night instead of both Friday and Saturday. I emailed them a few weeks prior to the bachelorette about this (even though I hadn't heard from them at ALL yet), and I got no response. Five days before the bachelorette, I got an email detailing the entire weekend and the costs, which amounted to $430 per person, for approximately 15 girls. I told them I could only make it the second night, and they said that since everything was already booked, I would have to pay for the AirBnb, bus and driver they rented out for the weekend, the prix fixe wine tasting and luncheon on Saturday afternoon (which I couldn't attend). They were able to exclude the cost of some miscellaneous items (not sure which) but that I would still need to pay $370. \n\nAm I being unreasonable in thinking that paying $370 for one night (which basically included dinner, a bus taking us to and from the club, and a bunk bed for the night) is WAY too much? They didn't consult us at all about costs, or what we would be doing, etc. in the six months between the invitation and the email outlining the event. I emailed her back saying that I was surprised at the costs, and I offered to pay for the AirBnb, (because obviously they had to book a house big enough for everyone for the whole weekend - they weren't going to get a new AirBnb the next night to accommodate changes in numbers), the private bus (even though it would've been WAY cheaper to get Ubers) and the Saturday night prix fixe dinner. She responded saying that they already paid for everyone's wine tasting and luncheon ($150) on the Saturday morning/afternoon, and that it would be unfair for her to absorb the costs because I RSVP'd initially. The poor bride got sucked into it, because she then ended up texting me separately asking me what the problem is, etc. \n\nAm I being an asshole here?!",

We have a highly romantic and sexual relationship and she's even called me her boyfriend before but now she just says I'm a friend.\n\nShe's been spending a lot of time with her friends over the past few days and she's been saying shit like it's the first time in years she's been happy. I'm fine with her having friends and hanging out with them but whenever I suggest hanging out she always declines because she has plans with her friends and when I confront her, she says I'm creepy and obsessive.

      "description": "Today, while driving home from work, I was approaching an intersection on a side road with a blinking yellow light.  I know this means ‚Äúyield‚Äù not ‚Äústop‚Äù but I‚Äôve been through the intersection before &amp; it‚Äôs never been a blinking yellow so my initial thought is that the stoplight isn‚Äôt working properly. Since this particular intersection has a blind left turn, I slowed down significantly (almost stopping to peek around the corner) to make sure no one was coming from the other direction even though the stoplight gave me the right of way. I just didn‚Äôt want to wind up t-boned because an overzealous left-hand turn. \n\nAs I came to the rolling stop, the gentlemen in the car behind me decides to lean on his horn, excessively so. Not just the quick tap of the horn to remind you the light has changed but the ‚Äúhow dare you drive so horribly, asshole‚Äù beeping.  I get through the intersection &amp; he continues to beep so now I‚Äôm a little peeved. When he finally passes my car, my road rage gets the best of me &amp; I flip him off. \n\nUnfortunately, we‚Äôve now approached another intersection &amp; the light is red. So he then proceeds to stop about 15 yards short of the car in front of him so he can line up with my car &amp; share a few choice words. \n\nHe yells that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot supposed to stop at a fucking blinking yellow light‚Äù to which I responded ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not usually like that...there could have been a car coming, asshole.‚Äù So he said ‚Äúgo back to driver‚Äôs ed dumb bitch!‚Äù and drove off. \n\nThe whole interaction really pissed me off because I felt like I had done the right thing by slowing down  (not necessarily the textbook  choice but given my familiarity with the road n‚Äô such, a logical choice) &amp; I thought the other guy was being a TOTAL asshole. \n\nI talked about it with a cousin and he said the guy wasn‚Äôt really an asshole because I *hadn‚Äôt* been following the traffic laws and I had just decided I knew what was best despite being familiar with the road rules. He said I also could have caused an accident by improperly slowing down at the intersection. \n\nTL/DR: Guy excessively beeped at me for stopping at a blinking yellow (with good reason) . I got pissed and flipped him off. We exchanged words where he gets called an asshole and I get called a dumb bitch. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "So let me start this by saying that I (21M) have been with my Girl (21F) for around 18 Months now.\n\nWe have a relatively okay relationship, I feel like it may be on the down fall as instances like the below, seem to be happening more and more. \n\nSo lets just jump to the thing that happened that has me Questioning whether I was the Asshole or not?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo me and my Girl were watching TV, chilling on the sofa. She does this thing where she will lay her legs over my knees and sort of dangle her feet on the edge / near the Coffee Table. Now this Coffee Table had a Drink that I had just made for myself plus a Rolling Table for my Weed which had some already grinded out, ready to make my next Joint. My Girl who  decided she was no longer Comfortable, kicked her legs off mine.\n\nAs she kicks her feet off of me, she kicks my drink over, manages to spill the contents all over the table (Weed included) and smash the Glass in the process. So as you can Imagine, I'm Pissed that my weed is now fucked and that there is glass and Fizzy pop everywhere. I rather angrily say \"This is why you dont put your feet on the table/over the table, because shit like this happens\". She then gets defensive and says \"If you didnt leave your Glass near the Edge, it wouldnt of got knocked over\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis comment has me Fuming, Are you actually Joking? I put something on the table, regardless of whether its in the middle or on the edge, because its a Table and that its purpose is. Its not a bloody Foot Stool for your feet.\n\nAnyway so the outcome to this was that we didnt speak to each other for a couple of Hours. She feels that she did nothing wrong and im just being Shitty. She hasnt even apologised for knocking the drink over, let alone for ruining my weed. I just want to know, was I the Asshole for having a go at her? or was i justified in my doing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Every single time I've been assulted - kissed against my will, grabbed, creeped on, touched etc, so I just don't go out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, it's my universities O week so I decided that I would go out with some of my new friends to a couple bars and have fun. I was sober D so while I didn't drink I did have a pretty good time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil, after deciding to get some food from a nearby McDonalds with a friend, we decided to leave. We went back to the bar to find them and I waited outside while he went in cause I've hurt my leg and didn't feel like trying to navigate a packed bar of drunks. I also didn't expect to be waiting that long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, my friends decided that he wanted to dance a bit more and told me he would be staying for a while. Okay, I'm not happy with this as I am already scared being outside alone even though I was near the security guards in a lit area, but, I decide sure whatever, he's having fun, I can wait a bit longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot even 2 minutes after that decision a lot of loud aggressive people show up and are denied entrance to the bar which freaks me out as the loiter a bit nearby me. They move off, but now I'm really on edge and just want to go. Then again, a minute later, a very drunk man who was denied entrance several times started to talk to me, and started leaning on me heavily, trying to make me look at him etc. I move off and stand just inside the bar by the guards scared out of my mind, unable to actually reach him cause of the amount of people around me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriend shows up and as we walk to my car I have a go at him saying that I didn't like being left outside and that he shouldn't have changed the plans like that when we didn't have very good contact with each other, and that I had been terrified.\n\nHe apologised, and I appreciate that, however, due to me being fully drained and very close to a meltdown I didn't really talk on the way home which I don't think he liked.\n\nHe started saying I shouldn't have gotten so angry, and at least he waas honest etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow it's about 45 minutes later and I've been home for a while and I feel like shit. I'm thinking I shouldn't have been so angry, and that he's right and I am overreacting, and that this is a situation I put myself in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, I think I ATA, what do you think?",

      "description": "I (23f) knew my boyfriend (21m) for 9 years before moving across the country to be with him. I got my own apartment. He lives with his sister (25). We have been together in person for 7 months now and we have been spending a lot of time together. We spend nearly every night together and he stays at my apartment. 2 nights a week we stay at his apartment. He used to be very close to his sister and since he and I have been dating he is not as close with his sister anymore. This past weekend we have not seen each other for 3 days due to conflicting schedules. He said that this time apart made him realize that he spends so much time at my place because he hates his apartment and just don't care to be there. That since I came we just had so much history and background that we got super intense super quick. He said that this isn‚Äôt a bad thing, it‚Äôs good actually but yesterday he had to ask his sister what was going on in her life and she had to ask him too, and he feels like they just lost the connection they had. On top of that their refrigerator is empty af. He said he spends so much time at my place bc his place is loud and everyone above him is stomping and having parties. But he realized yesterday that in doing that he‚Äôs just kind of stranding his sister to deal with it all herself and that that‚Äôs not fair. Now he no longer wants to sleep over at my place. This hurt me a bit and I told him maybe it‚Äôs for the best that we spend some time apart. That tonight we can hangout as planned but after that maybe we just need some time apart from each other. I told him I understand completely about his sister. AITA for asking for some time apart to take a step back from our relationship? I thought this is what he wanted anyway, to spend more time with his sister. I am just confused on what he wants me to do and I feel I‚Äôve grown so dependent on him that I need to take a step back. \n\nTL;DR my bf is very close with his older sister and no longer wants to sleep over my house so he can spend more time with her. AITA for wanting time apart to distance myself from the relationship as I‚Äôve grown very dependent on him? ",

      "description": "First time poster warning. \n\nOne of my friends seemed to always be unomfortable with physical touch and always looked disliked it. Unless friend would intiate it. The problem was that another friend, (I'll refer to her as K to avoid any confusion) was very into physical affection (hugs, in your space, shoulder touches). K would often hug my friend who always seemed to be a little distressed whenever it occurred. K and friend were friends, but friend was too nice to tell K that their affection made friend uncomfortable.\n\nK happened to hug friend and I made a comment about shipping them since I often do make comments like this as jokes. I think I made Friend even more uncomfortable(in hindsight I probably shouldn't have said that) and once K left, friend started to complain slightly how K always invades their personal space but doesn't want to be mean and tell them that they don't like it.  So I went up to K, while friend had a look of 'wtf are you doing' and said something along the lines of 'Friend gets uncomfortable when you hug them'. K just looked at friend and said ok. When I went back friend was super distressed about it. Friend asked me why I would do that and now friend and I both will look like assholes. Friend also said that I shouldn't have stuck my nose into their business and that they'd just get used to it despite how uncomfortable it made them. Friend has been avoiding K since I told K about their discomfort and I can't help but wonder if I damaged Friend and K's friendship. So Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "I live in the first house on a private drive that is maintained by HOA. The way it works is everyone in the HOA pays dues and then all of us that live on the multiple private drives pay an extra amount (usually more than the overall HOA dues) that goes into a private drive fund to pay for repairs, plowing, etc. of the private drives. Since I'm the first house on the private drive, in front of my house is a no parking zone because there's a stop sign where the private drive ends into the county owned public road cul-de-sac. \n\nOften times someone visiting one of the houses on the cul-de-sac will park in front of my house. It makes it more difficult for me to back out because it's hard to see around the car in that direction and forces me to make a multi-point turn when I'm backing out of my driveway. Anyways I normally don't really care because usually the car is just there for a short time and hey if it's closer than a legal spot so you don't have to walk as far go for it. \n\nLately though there's been 1 car in particular that will park there on Thursday night and leave their car there until late Sunday or Monday. It's just kinda annoying and I feel like if you're going to leave your car there for several days you should park it in a legal spot. It's also annoying because it feels like I'm paying an extra couple hundred dollars a year just so someone not paying can park there whenever they want. So today they happened to be sitting in their car waiting for the neighbor they're visiting to come home and I said \"Hi, I'm not asking you to move or anything, just in the future if you're going to leave your car here for a while can you park it somewhere else?\" She replied with \"What's the problem?\" and I just said that it makes it more difficult to back out because I didn't want to get in to telling her it's no parking and a private drive an all that. She just said \"well I won't be here for a while\" and rolled her window back up. \n\nIt seemed pretty clear she didn't take my request well. So was that an asshole move?",

      "description": "My ex best friend (female) and I (also female) had been friends for ten years. I had never had a true best friend before so I kept hanging on, despite the fact that she didn‚Äôt always treat me the best. For example, she never supported the relationships I was in and she would poke fun at me for gaining weight off and on.\n\nWhen we hung out, it was always where she wanted to go and we did what she wanted to do. She loved going to clubs but it wasn‚Äôt my thing. When guys would approach me, she‚Äôd tell them to get lost because we were having a girls‚Äô night. I didn‚Äôt mind chatting with them but she would be annoyed that I was giving them the time of day: ‚ÄúThey only want one thing. Quit wasting your time.‚Äù (She always considered me a bit na√Øve in the guy department.)\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I started getting serious, he said he wanted to meet my best friend. We decided to meet up with her and her new boyfriend. Afterward, my friend called to tell me that her boyfriend said he once bought drugs from my boyfriend. I told her I didn‚Äôt believe him and her boyfriend told me the story. I was taken aback and asked my boyfriend about it. He said no, he‚Äôs never sold drugs and had no idea what her boyfriend was talking about. My friend was adamant that her boyfriend was correct and that I shouldn‚Äôt be dating a drug dealer. (Her boyfriend is over here buying drugs and my boyfriend is supposedly the problem? Also, my best friend used to have a drug problem and had to drop out of college as a result. I‚Äôm not sure if she was using again at this point.) She never wanted to hang out with my boyfriend because he‚Äôs supposedly a drug dealer and, obviously, she didn't approve of the relationship.\n\nMonths later, my friend came out as a lesbian. (When we first met, she told me she was bi but preferred women.) Her new girlfriend never wanted to meet me because she has jealously issues and didn‚Äôt think we should be friends. We hung out alone without our significant others and could never get together as couples. It was also weird that, as best friends, we couldn‚Äôt talk about our significant others since they didn't like us as individuals.\n\nAt some point, we‚Äôre chatting on the phone and my friend states that she wants to adopt a child. I‚Äôm not sure where this was coming from since she‚Äôs never expressed interest in having children, didn‚Äôt have a stable or well-paying job, just started dating someone new (the girlfriend that doesn‚Äôt like me), etc. Taken aback, but still annoyed about the whole significant other situation, I blurted out, ‚ÄúBut gays shouldn‚Äôt adopt children!‚Äù I have no idea where that came from and I certainly did NOT mean it or believe what I said. I don‚Äôt really remember how the conversation ended but we haven‚Äôt talked in years as a result of my comment. I tried to reach out to her but she wasn't interested in maintaining our friendship.\n\nAITA or was our friendship doomed anyway?",

      "description": "In this I am \"Sky\" and she is \"Madi\" and this argument is about my friend Jen. The other people mentioned dont matter that much. Im just gonna copy and paste the discord convo but if you want me to email you screenshots or something then I will. Also if you have questions or are curious about something, please ask. \n\n\nSky 09/29/2018\nWith all due respect, I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs nice to uninclude Jen. She‚Äôs one of my best friends at the moment and I really don‚Äôt think what you‚Äôre doing is nice. I‚Äôm sorry if this makes you hate me too, but if Jens not coming, I don‚Äôt think I want to be included. I just can‚Äôt respect that you would uninclude a friend this way, it‚Äôs not cool to me. I get you‚Äôve had arguments, but is she not still your friend? You invited her to your birthday party, you sat with her at lunch, and now your casting her out cause of your silly fued? That‚Äôs uncalled for. If you want to invite me back, add Jen first. Then, I would absolutely love to go camping with you.\n\n\nMadi üíï09/29/2018\nI guess good for u and all but id rather not spend my time with someone who knows nothing about me but continues to talk about me like they do. Notttt into that at allll. And I actually consider u a friend while i thought jen was for about 2 seconds but was civil cause i didnt want to break the group chat so i kind just delt with it. But then they talk about Alexa in a bad way when they dont know what they r talking about and then they try to talk about ME like im a 2 faced bitch when i have literally never done that??? And like i like u as a friend but i dont like jen and if u cant be friends with me because u feel that me not liking someone‚Äôs personality is too much then i guess thats sad but ill have to deal with it\n\n\nSky 09/29/2018\nFirst of all,, did you seriously just call toast by their real name when you know full well that toast goes by toast because of gender stuff?? Like, they‚Äôre your best friend?? Seriously??? Like I‚Äôm not even that close with toast but when I talk about them I call them by they/them and by toast because that‚Äôs the name they wish to be called. Second, Why the hell would you pretend to be friends with Jen if you didn‚Äôt like her, Like even when she‚Äôs not at the school anymore? Just break it off with her if you don‚Äôt like her. Plus, you can still be friends with m e even if you don‚Äôt like my best friend, I don‚Äôt care. But my view of it was that you were purposely avoiding your friend cause of a feud, which is uncool. I want to be your friend, and I‚Äôm going to continue to invite her to hang out with us. Because she‚Äôs not just my friend, she‚Äôs also friends with maverick and Ryan. Also, you don‚Äôt want to break up the group yet you uninvite jen while still inviting mav, me, and Ryan? How do you think that makes us feel??\n\n\nMadi üíï09/29/2018\nToast is fine with being called Alexa we talked about it in pride. Second i never pretended to be friends with Jen. Plus ur view was wrongfully guided by one side of the spectrum (Jen). I dont want to continue to hang out with her because i dont like her. I had to not invite river to parties because she didnt like river. Im not going to cater to someone when i dont even want to be around them. Im not going to uninvite river and toast because they dont like them. Then it wouldnt be fun. Also im not damaging anything by inviting people to something because i thought she knew we werent friends like??? Ud think after calling me 2 faced and childish and all that shit that the friendship is over dont u think? How do u think i would feel having to  be around someone who said that shit about me. Did it not occur to u that i had feelings too or did u forget that every doesn‚Äôt revolve around Jen.\n\n\nSky 09/29/2018\nWhy the hell,, ok why the fuck would you not invite river to shit cause of Jen. I‚Äôm inviting toast and jen. I expect them to be civil and to get along, if they don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs not on me. You shouldn‚Äôt not invite river cause of Jen, rivers your best friend, not jen. That‚Äôs so fucking weird that you would say that. Second, I‚Äôm not wrongfully guides by Jen. Jen and Mav and Ryan are the only ones that seem to care about me, Jen has been a positive impact on my life, she‚Äôs made me more confident in myself and made me feel stronger. She has guided me positively and I definitely view her as a role model to me. Also, ‚Äúdid it not occur to you I had feelings‚Äù oh? Did it not occur to you that I had feelings when you left me sobbing on the ground? :) cause it really made me feel insignificant and like you didn‚Äôt care about my feelings. Cause listen up, I care about you more then you fucking think, so don‚Äôt you dare fucking say that. Jen is just the one who seems to actually be there for me when I‚Äôm in dark times, so yes, i want Jen to be included. Also sure, maybe not everything revolves around Jen, but not everything revolves around you either. Did you ever think about that?\n\n\nSky 09/29/2018\nListen. I‚Äôm kinda stressed by this whole thing and I don‚Äôt want it to go on. So let‚Äôs make this simple. I want to stop arguing right now, I want to stay your friend and I want to be friends with Jen. If I plan I hangout I will invite both of you because you‚Äôre both my friends, I don‚Äôt want this to break our friendship or make you not want to hang out tomorrow, I‚Äôm sorry I even brought it up, it‚Äôs making me really sad and upset. I really did think you were friends with jen, sorry if that makes me ignorant, that‚Äôs just what I saw. So seeing you not include her made me sad, I guess I get it now. Sorry. Can we just forget about it?\n\n\nMadi üíï09/29/2018\nSobbing is a cute word for silently ignoring me with headphones. i left because my ride was there and i tried to talk to u and u ignored me and u were not being kind to anyone at that time so i wasnt about to defend u and tell u that ‚Äúits ok u were right!!‚Äù When u were calling someone horrible names that they did nothing to deserve. U are wrongly guided by Jen. U might not think so. But u definitely are. I just wanna know when iv told u about whats happened between me and jen. Cause i know i didnt say anything soooo where r u getting ur info from. Its definitely not biased or anything. :)))))). Never said the world revolved around me so thx for ur random comment. And to round things up, just to learn u, u dont invite 2 friends who dont get along to a party because that really rude. Neither will have fun and just cause tension and nooo one likes that. No one. Fun ruined. Party ruined. Being civil wont fix anything. Anyway river didnt even like know jen at all. I was friends with her at that point and didnt want to have a shitty party because she wouldnt get alone with someone no matter the chances that they might get along tell me one time u came to me and expressed in anyway that u needed help? And then tell me when u did that to Jen. Both u and Jen said mean shit to toast which really hurt their feelings over nothing and really expected me to not be angry with u. Wow. Just really proves how u dont think about anyone elses feelings.\n\n\nSky 09/29/2018\nBitch I wasn‚Äôt fucking wearing headphones?\nI was crying my fucking eyes out having a panic attack\nWhen I have panic attacks I can‚Äôt fucking speak\n\n\nMadi üíï09/29/2018\nU were watching a video on ur phone\nU literally were\nThats what u were doing\nIt was shane dawson\n\n\nSky 09/29/2018\nThat‚Äôs not what I fucking remember\nI wasn‚Äôt watching shit\n\n\nMadi üíï09/29/2018\nWell :shrug:‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n\nSky 09/29/2018\nI also just said I wanted this to stop and you ignored me\nAnd now I feel like shit\nI‚Äôm fucking shaking madi\n\n\nMadi üíï09/29/2018\nWell that sucks\nWhy dont u talk to ur mentor\nAhh yes the old 5 second ignore\n\n\nSky 09/29/2018\nAre you fucking serious?\nDon‚Äôt show up.

      "description": "I (F24) have been friends with Megan (F26) for close to 15 years. She‚Äôs kept me a secret friend for 7 years. She‚Äôs been engaged for 4 years to a woman she met at college, yet she tells me constantly she‚Äôs with her for convenience. \n\nWe went through our childhood crush faze years ago, but she has always honestly told me she loves me, &amp; that she still loves me now. Ever since she was young she saw a future with us together, &amp; honestly I could never see her in that way. We tried a few times over the years, but I could never get past kissing as it just felt strange &amp; wrong. It feels natural holding her hand &amp; hugging her when she hugs me, but anything sexual just doesn‚Äôt click. \nI can appreciate she‚Äôs a good looking woman, but I‚Äôm not sexually attracted to her.\n\nBeing such good friends, we are both pretty honest &amp; open, &amp; we‚Äôve talk repeatedly about how we love and respect each other, but how I can‚Äôt see her more than anything but my best friend. \nShe really is a wonderful friend, she knows I‚Äôm there for her 24/7 &amp; it‚Äôs mutual. I‚Äôm so proud of everything she achieves &amp; has already achieved in her life, &amp; honestly I wish I was allowed to be publicly proud of her. I spent my birthday away from home, &amp; she travelled three hours to spend it with me and other friends. When it‚Äôs her birthday my birthday card is hidden &amp; presents are passed off as gifts from family members. \n\nI won‚Äôt be invited to her wedding.\n\nHer fianc√© knows stories about me when we were younger, &amp; she knows through mutual friends of ours how much her fianc√© was in love with me, but we‚Äôve never met. I‚Äôve never been allowed to meet her.\n\nMegan keeps me a secret. We have to hang out in secret, yet we talk every single day. Her family love me, she‚Äôs always taking me to go visit her grandparents &amp; her parents. My family love her too, but she‚Äôs straight up lied to her fianc√© that we‚Äôve been talking ever since they got together. It‚Äôs now been close to 7 years I‚Äôve been a secret, &amp; honestly the fianc√© deserves better.\n\nMegan told me today whilst watching Netflix that if I wanted her, she‚Äôd end the engagement &amp; be with me instantly.\nThis is not fair to the fianc√©. Should I tell her that I exist? That the woman she‚Äôs in love with has lied to her face for years on end, &amp; will continue to do so? \nOr do I carry on having my friendship be kept a secret? \n",

      "description": "Greetings. will probably delete this post because I will be thumbed down into oblivion. Recently my mom's friend at work had a dilemma: her husband was involved in a bad car accident. Currently, he has broken ribs, dislocated shoulder, he is on breathing support etc. He is in rough shape. As it came to be, it was not just any old car accident; he was drunk at 8:17 in the morning and lost control of his car and was gravely injured. Now, after hearing my mother and sister talk about this mishap, I chimed in with a little of my two-cents. I told them that I feel he should not be alive after his accident. Him still being alive is too good for what damage he has caused in his time, as well as what could still possibly happen. For years, he has been driving drunk due to his alcoholism and has little to no regard for others around him as long as he has a cold one in his hand.  He has put his hands on his family or basically been a dead beat dad for the entirety of his children's lives. My mom informed me without being so straight forward, that it is not my place to judge. I got a little heated saying his injuries were too good for someone who drives drunk frequently and hope he learns his lesson.\n\nNow,  I work in customer service for a phone company, and come across many men who cannot drive due to not having a license. (Have to validate cell phone accounts at work through a scan-able ID. I usually ask why they have an ID instead of a license and they usually laugh and say one too many DUI's. This infuriates me. I have family members injured by drunk drivers, friends killed, and relatives and other acquaintances who have lost loved ones due to these foolish people. It makes me think what if I would lose my family or my girlfriend due to someones poor choice. This being said, I have developed a strong prejudice against alcoholism and drunkards. Drunk drivers to me are some of the worst scum of the earth who always seem to take some of the best people from this world way before their time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all this being said, AITA?",

I ranted about another friend to her, we'll call the friend i ranted about J.\nBasically what happened between me and J was this:\n\n1. I came to school a few minutes too late and saw J sitting on a bench, in the hallway crying. She was surrounded by friends. \n(they weren't comforting her btw, they were just sitting across her. Minding their own business, Idk if they tried to comfort her but the whole time while i was there no one said anything to her. For all i know they might've tried). \n\n\n2. No one said anything to her so i tried to talk to her, to see if i could help her and maybe say the right thing to her to make her feel better. \n\n\n3. This is where i try to reach the core of the story. Mind you, all of her friends already knew this WAY before this happened. It has been going on for a long time. \nShe said to me that her parents were yelling at her last night, because she wanted to discuss smth and what she said came out wrong. She then proceeded to cry some more and because i felt bad and kinda awkward\n\n",

But for whatever reason, he had REALLY bad BO. \n\nAt first I asked for a different seat, even in economy cabin if no seat was available in business. But the flight was over sold. I tried adjusting the air conditioning to blow directly in my face, spritzing some eau de toilette on a napkin and holding it to my nose. I could still smell the BO. \n\nSo finally I said something to him. I told him I didn‚Äôt know if anyone had said something to him before, but he had really bad body odor. I told him he should consider using a strong deodorant before going into public spaces. I said maybe it was his diet or his culture (he‚Äôs Indian/Southeast Asian) or a medical condition, I don‚Äôt know. I encouraged him to have a little consideration for the people around him who may have sensitivity to odors and to use a deodorant. \n\nThe flight attendant was very apologetic and came by frequently to make sure I have everything I needed (snacks, drinks, etc). At least she was sympathetic to my plight. A few other passengers around me came up to me after we deplaned to thank me for saying something. But the Indian guy gave me the nastiest look in the terminal on our way out. \n\nI don‚Äôt think I could have handled this any differently. AITA here for saying something?",

Now everyday he keeps texting me with the same sentence:\"Say it, you don't want to be My friend\" and everytime I just tell him that he's My friend. Until yesterday, I told him he was just a paranoid freak and I never answered his lasts text.\nI remember he told me that his entire childhood was horrible, that he's been bullied and that he had no friends, or the ones he had would be bullying him in the end.

      "description": "So for the past few years me and my roommate (who I will call Guitarist, because he plays guitar) have played in a band together. We didn‚Äôt know each other before being in a band together but have become close friends since then. A few months ago, Guitarist and I moved into a place together, as it was mutually beneficial for both of us and we both figured we‚Äôd make good roommates. \n\nRecently Guitarist has gotten more and more flaky about band commitments, including regularly missing band practices with flimsy excuses, missing shows and generally not showing any sort of interest or initiative about the band. Me and the other members have talked to him about this and expressed our concerns, but he insists he is still invested in the band. I have also noticed since moving in with him that Guitarist doesn‚Äôt to play guitar in his own time and has also been flakey about commitments to his other band.\n\nDuring December last year we played some shows interstate that Guitarist was unable to make due to work commitments (which we completely understood). We had a couple of friends of the band fill-in for us, who did a great job and we had a lot of fun playing with them. Both of our friends have expressed interest in joining the band, and myself and the other members of the band agree they‚Äôd be a good fit. \n\nMy issue is that at the end of the day I still think Guitarist is a great guy and I‚Äôm concerned about creating tension at home if we kick him out of the band. I‚Äôm torn between this and what‚Äôs best for the band, as myself and the other members have dedicated a lot of time and energy to it. ",

      "description": "Hi everyone, throwaway here. Sorry if this is long.\n\nBackstory: my friend has been with his current gf for a while, she definitely has a weight problem but it‚Äôs never something I have brought up. \n\nAnyways,\n\nI was at at my best friends Super Bowl party yesterday, he invited about 10 friends and told a couple of us to bring our dogs. I have a 95 lb German Shepherd, and he has a 60ish lb pitbull mutt. These dogs are literally best friends for over 2 years and do everything together. We take them everywhere together and they absolutely love each other. Most dogs are scared of my dog for how big he is, and this is literally the only dog friend he has so he gets a little crazy when he sees him. They love to play..they are both extremely energetic and have spent 3+ hours nibbling and chasing each other before.  It‚Äôs always super cute and we just let it happen because they love it.  \n\nNow, we were watching the game...most people were just drinking or talking and at this point I‚Äôm pretty drunk. Now our dogs are in the other room making a bunch of noise chasing each other, me and my buddy have no problem with it. At some point my friends GF, asked us if we could shut them up or if I could put my dog in their kennel. (My dog never goes in a kennel at this point in his life). We both insisted that it is fine, and yelled at our dogs to keep quiet. They immediately stopped making noise but kept playing. At some point our dogs knocked over an expensive clock they had while we were playing a drinking game. Friends GF instantly screams, gets up, and hits both of our dogs. My dog instantly growled and snapped at her but did not bite her, and then ran over to me. \n\nI got mad and asked her why the hell she hit my dog, she went on a rant talking about how annoying my dog is and how she doesn‚Äôt want him in her house anymore. She proceeded to yell at me for how untrained my dog was (he isn‚Äôt, however I got him from a German Shepherd sanctuary when he was 2 and he was a handful back then) he‚Äôs perfectly trained now that he‚Äôs older and I haven‚Äôt had a problem with him since he was adopted. At this point I got mad and told her to stop bitching..she goes off on me and calls me an asshole. Best friend gets involved and yells at us to stop. We stop.\n\n30 mins later  I‚Äôve drank a bit more and our dogs are still playing, causing no harm just messing around with each other. I can tell she is fuming because she is just staring at them. She asks me ‚Äúwhy the fuck is your dog so annoying‚Äù and I‚Äôm pretty hammered and I respond ‚Äúmaybe your fat ass ate all his kibble, I know you always eat Stella‚Äôs (friends dog). She goes irate and tells me to get out of her house with all her friends backing her up. I yelled a couple of a pretty mean insults at her involving her weight and a lot of the guys started laughing which didn‚Äôt help. My best friend also hasn‚Äôt said a word during this.. she tells me to leave and I tell her fine but she needs  to wait because I‚Äôm hammered and need an Uber. She says no and starts pushing me out the door. She‚Äôs a pretty big girl and I‚Äôm struggling to stay inside while her and her friends are pushing me out the door. (I didn‚Äôt even have my dog packed up). My other drunk friends are just laughing.. my dog sees what is going on and runs over and bites one of her friends on the arm who was pushing me, he drew blood but I later found out he didn‚Äôt get her too good. Anyway, after this they start yelling how they‚Äôre gonna get my dog killed for biting and call the cops.i grabbed him and got the fuck out of there and drove home with my dog (real bad choice I know, but I was being drunk and was emotional)...After last night my best friend won‚Äôt talk to me or respond to any of my calls. I know i shouldn‚Äôt have made fun of his girlfriends weight but I really feel like she overreacted. ",

      "description": "I'll get straight into it - I love playing RPGs, but I always prefer to play nonhuman characters. It's tough for me to explain why, but basically I have some social issues and find it a lot easier to act as something nonhuman than as a human. I've mentioned my preference in passing a few times, but most settings accommodate this easily, so we've never had a lengthy discussion about it.  \n\nMy Fiance likes to be the DM. He runs games at the weekend for a few mutual friends sometimes, but I can rarely attend due to work obligations. In a couple of weeks, I'll have a day off at the weekend, which is rare, so I asked if I could play that week. He was happy to let me into the game, so I asked him about a few character concepts for the setting they were playing in. \n\nThis is where it turns out that he was planning to run a one shot that week in a setting where 99% of the characters are human. I asked him if there were any nonhuman options and he responded with \"There are a lot of different types of human.\" I told him that I'd think about whether it was a good idea for me to play - I really don't like playing humans and I knew that even if we could compromise, he probably wouldn't be happy. He likes to keep things lore accurate and he's very conscious of the \"DM's girlfriend\" stereotype. \n\nHe was upset, saying that he really liked this setting, he'd thought I liked it too and wanted me to be excited and happy to play like he was. \n\nThis whole conversation took place over text, so we'll talk about it and find a compromise later, but AITA here?\n ",

      "description": "So my bf and I were talking and I randomly mentioned \"it would be nice to get to hang out with your brother while you're home\". I said that, but knew it wouldn't work because of the distance issue. My boyfriend is coming home to visit for 7 days, most of his time will be visiting his family, but for 3 of those days, he will get to visit me. The distance issue is that I live 2 hours away. I'm planning on driving down to pick him up and drop him off. He wont have a car and his brother wont have a car. I would stay down where his parents are if his parents were not so dysfunctional. They are really hard people to be around. So I am understanding as to why my boyfriend wants his brother to come with us/ why the brother wants to leave, but now I have to ask my parents if they mind as well as miss the quality time I would have if it is just me and my boyfriend. \n\nI haven't seen my bf in months due to him moving across the country. I would love to hang out with his brother for maybe a few hours when I come down to pick my boyfriend up, and a few hours when I drop my boyfriend back off, but I definitely just want my boyfriend to myself. I've been waiting to see my boyfriend for so long and now I feel like I'm in a tricky situation.\n\nThe other piece is that my boyfriend hasn't seen his brother in a year due to his brother having to go to a wilderness school. Which was terrible. They have a lot of catching up to do, and I feel like they'll need privacy and space to talk about things, I just dont think coming to visit me and my parents will give them that space. \n\nLast piece, I'm gonna be seeing my boyfriend at the end of January for a week when I go out to visit him. \n\nI just feel like I'm being an asshole wanting him all to myself.\n\n",

      "description": "First off, sorry, no way this is not going to sound at least somewhat braggy (not my intention though).\n\n**Tl;dr:** My parents never complained about me spending/asking for money, so I started asking for more. AITA?\n\nI (M19) have absolutely no idea how much money my parents have or make, they never told me and they are very secretive about it (everything related to their work or income is locked up in secure lockers). It is probably quite much, judging by the size of the house and how easily they seem to spend/lend it. \n\nI'm currently studying CS in X city, and I still live at their house in another city. They cover all my education- and health-related expenses. What I've noticed is that, as long as I can give them a reason, they'll pay for pretty much anything. Examples:\n\n1) I wanted a new laptop for university, but after buying myself a low-end laptop because it was cheaper in high-school, I didn't want another one that would be almost unusable 1 year later, so I asked for a good one. They immediately ordered the one I wanted.\n\n2) I thought it would be nice to watch some TV from bed and ordered myself a big tv and wall mount for 2.5k, when I (jokingly) asked them if they would pay a part, they agreed to 50:50. *--&gt; here is where it dawned to me*\n\n3) I told them I disliked 2nd class in trains because it's more crowded. They simply asked why I didn't just buy the 1st class ticket. *--&gt; now it was clear*\n\nBecause of that I've started to ask for money more often, e.g. for PC parts or flight tickets. I wonder if it's wrong to do this. AITA?",

      "description": "Hi all!\n\nThrow away so that I don‚Äôt accidentally dox myself, since this is a bit specific.\n\nMy group of friends has been taking a ski trip annually for 6 years.  Through those years, the group has grown to about 25 people.  This year, between 22 and 25 people will be attending.\n\nOne person in the group (we‚Äôll call him ‚ÄúSam‚Äù) always rents the house for everyone to stay in, and we pay him directly.  Payment determines your rank in who gets first choice in beds.  First to pay gets first choice, etc.  This year, there is enough room for 17 people to get a bed, if every bed that is larger than a twin has two people in it.  Everyone is paying over $300 per person to attend.\n\nMy fianc√© and I are both going on the trip.  We got to talking about it with another couple, and we felt that we‚Äôd be better off getting a condo nearby the house (within 1.5 miles) to guarantee that we get beds and are able to enjoy the trip.  Sam would not be losing any money by us doing this, as he only needed 16 people in order to recoup his money, and 18 people minimum have committed when you take the 4 of us out of the equation.\n\nWe brought this idea up to Sam earlier in the day, and didn‚Äôt hear back before we had to make a decision on the condo.  After discussing further, we decided to book it, thinking it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal and that everyone would be better off.  More butts in beds, no one is out any money.\n\nUnfortunately, Sam and a few others seem to be pretty upset with us, insinuating that we‚Äôre screwing up the trip.  They don‚Äôt understand why we care about having a bed, when there is room for air mattresses and the like.  Plus, they‚Äôre upset that we won‚Äôt be with the group the whole time, even though we plan on hanging out at the house to do everything but sleep.\n\nSo, before this gets any longer, are we the assholes for booking this separate condo on a group trip?\n\nTLDR: Group books large ski trip for multiple years running. My fianc√©, me, and another couple decide to book a condo separate from the group so we can have beds and more people in the main house have beds too.  No one is out money in this scenario, but people are upset that we won‚Äôt be staying with the group.  AWTA?",

      "description": "**Background:**\n\nCurrently I am a 19 year old living with my father as a full time college student attending a local community college to finish gen eds and a little bit of major classes before transferring off to the big University in the near by city. I have succeeded solely on self-motivation and have done pretty well in school, averaging among the top of my class and President of a couple clubs.\n\nAt about 13 I started working with father's landscaping company. Landscaping is busiest in the spring around finals. This meant that I was super stressed around this time. I also really did not have a 'summer vacation'.   He was making 6x what I was for near the same work. To which he says he only does it to pay for child support. A lot of the insane profit margins is him cutting corners. Working conditions were 8-13 hour days, sometimes upwards of 90+ degrees with high humidity, uncaring of mild illness or injury (rolled ankle), and sometimes dangerous (provided improper footwear with spinning mechanical equipment on wet slopes) for a minor. I toughed it out through most of this, though flipping out on occasion.  This past year I did at least 50-70% of the physical labor. Over the past 5 years he has easily made 100k profits off of me.\n\n\nOriginally I planned to shoot through college as quickly as possible. Taking courses in quick succession and taking on debt if need be. He would neither loan me money, cosign on a loan, or pay any substantial sum of the cost (he has 400k just in stocks). Also a strong implication was placed on 'I want you to work this summer and fall instead of taking classes to pay for part of college, or else'. In response I procured a joint venture of expanding and fully legitimizing the business into proper form. The response was along the lines of 'no I want out' and 'you cant handle that and college'. So the residual situation is a very inefficient small business startup where I am to juggle my own jobs, (using vehicles/equipment only at his approval) his jobs, and remaining school.\n\n\n**On to the issue:**\n\nThe background leads up to my current state. \n\nLast night I flipped out on him for being an asshole over the current situation. He thinks I am the asshole over it. He makes schedules completely going against my plans and jobs, stealing my time and needed equipment out from under me. For example yesterday he took the s10 out and it started 'having issues' so it is now in the shop. I asked for the usage of one of his trucks since I had a job planned for today, rejected. Likewise I asked him 4 days ago if he could go out and give me a second opinion on a bid, he found ways to be busy all day every day and then said he was going out with his girlfriend early on Friday. Last week however, I was forced to chauffeur him around all day for a dozen different estimates that he could have done on his own. \n\nHe also rejects most reforms or compromises to life or business systems.",

      "description": "Sorry about formatting, I'm on mobile.\n\nI've tried to post this several times, but it's gone through weird\n\nTo give you an idea of how much this is, my first attempt at writing this was about 7500 words. I'll keep it brief. I got into a fight with this guy on PlayStation. Everyone (in the party) agrees he has an ego problem. I'm pretty sure I have one to, but it's not near as extreme as this other guy. I've had a friend swayed over to playing for honor (a notoriously toxic game) with a notoriously toxic person, while being of a notoriously toxic age. I've known this friend for a while, so me being torn from him by these people was a bit crushing. After I'd been kicked from one too many parties (me and the rude guy had arguments constantly and, because he has no confidence, he kicks when he's routed) I got into an argument with my friend about it and he ended up blocking me on 2 separate platforms. I plan on trying to be friends with him later, during the next marching band season at my school, I think because he's a freshman and I wasn't the most stable guy around at the time, we'll be better suited to being around each other when we both become more mature. I was told the group I'd left had bonded through their hatred of me, and that the annoying coward leader is still shouting commands to this day. Sorry if this isn't conveyed correctly, or if it needs info, my 7000+ word version covered everything in extreme detail, and if you guys want, I'll post it in a Google doc and share the link. Thank you.\n\nEnd of original post, I can fit more detail\n\nMy and the guy I've argued with do argue way too much, so I try to stop, but I get angry easily and prepetuate it\n\nAlmost everyone has a problem with the guy I argue with, but he's a high rep in for honor so they respect him\n\nI've occasionally had problems with my friend before, but he's much better than he used to be, and I still need to grow\n\nI have completely shut off contact with the party, except for 2 people (the friend and someone else who's calm)\n\nI am trying my hardest to not cause conflicts and to leave that group alone.\n\nLet me know if I need more detail.

      "description": "So, my dad says he really wants to go to El Salvador soon because he wants to see his parents who because of their age may not have soon. My grandpa is doing fine right now but he has had brain surgery in the past and can't walk like he used to. My grandmother has a pacemaker and although she's still in good shape too she's also had her health problems in the past. He last saw them in LA last September cause they went to visit my aunt but my grandpa felt hella uncomfortable and I don't think they wanna come to the states again cause they get really homesick. He loves his parents very much and I love my grandparents too and I totally get where he's coming from. \n\nHowever, El Salvador is a hella dangerous country. There's a lot of crime and a while lotta gangs. Civilians over there live at risk and the tourists have to watch over their backs even more. People have been robbed, kidnapped and even killed simply cause they're from the USA. My dad is in his 60s so it's not like he could fend anyone off. The other thing to consider is that my grandparents live 2 hours away from the airport. That's a long time when you're driving on badly maintained roads and around people looking to rob you roadside. Even if he goes for one or two days I would not feel well. Plus, my family themselves have had bad experiences with people over there. One of my uncles got pulled into the side of the road and a group of guys robbed him and tied him to a tree. I've had cousins beaten up by gang members. My aunt has been robbed twice. And my other aunt has been threatened by gang members over there too. All in all, I get why he wants to go see his parents as much as possible during his final years but every second he's over there, a dark cloud of pessimism resides over me that something bad will happen.",

      "title": "AITA for hiding my eating disorder?",
      "description": "I was in a relationship with a guy for 2 years. From the ages of 16-18. He knew I had body image issues and an eating disorder when I was a pre-teen, and at one point, my eating disorder came back. Full force. I was not taking care of myself, writing down calories, using a pro-ana website, abusing lax, a lot of stuff that was just awful. It was november of 2017 when it really started so I was 17 and he was just turning 17 in a few months. About 1-2 months into it, I finally got the courage to tell him because it was all getting out of hand and I wanted to tell someone that genuinely cared about me and that I knew loved me. I did it and his response was \"Why do you care what other people think of you?\" and \"I feel like I failed\".\n\nWhen we started dating, he told me about a past relationship with a girl who had dealt with an eating disorder, but it was a short relationship in 9 grade(3 years before), so he made it seem like he knew how to handle it at the time, until I told him. I tried to tell him that it wasn't about other peoples thoughts, and that it wasn't his fault, and it made me feel so guilty. He kept doing it for about a week so at one point, I couldn't handle it and I told him I was better. I tried to tell him that it wasn't about other people or his fault. He would bring it up every night and the guilt just kept building up.\n\nOver time, my eating disorder went back and forth. Feeling bad and then being ok again. 5 months later, he visits for my birthday(since we were long distance). He finds a journal I had just sitting in my closet of calories I had counted. I jumped on him to take it away because I didn't want him to find it. I pretended it was something else. I was starting to feel ok again and I wasn't ready. I was too scared of a similar reaction again.\n\nThinking about it now, I completely see where I went wrong. We were both so young so I understand that he wouldn't have known how to completely react, even after explanation. But is it all my fault? Since the breakup has ended, he has brought it up. After I've apologized, he has told me that he's still hurt that I hid it from him, bringing up that he didn't know how to react(repeating what I apologized to him for as if I'm validating his reaction). He doesn't seem to bring up anything he did, but maybe he didn't do anything? I got really scared when it was happening, so it felt like a kick in the heart when he reacted the way he did (even after explanation). I opened myself up after having such a hard time for so long, and I had such a hard time dealing with it after seeing his reaction. I was so vulnerable, and I felt like I could turn to him before I did it.\n\nI understand that I should have just come to him again, ignoring the fear, because he still just didn't understand and I should have understood that... but was I completely wrong? Am I the asshole? I know I am for a lot, but am I 100% the asshole? When he brought it up recently I didn't know how to respond. I want to show him that I'm sorry, because he's a good guy, but I don't know what to do. He says that he just made a mistake. That it was just a mistake.\n\nAm I 100% the asshole?",

We fight a lot, but usually it‚Äôs not a problem‚Äîuntil today. Last night we talked about playing League of Legends tomorrow, as tomorrow is the last day of the ranked season. When I woke up this morning, after doing the usual, I logged on at around 11:30 to start playing. I messaged her, but she didn‚Äôt respond so I assumed she was asleep (on weekends she sleeps in late to recover from lack of sleep from school), so I messaged one of my good friends from HS and we started playing until she could play. After the first 2-3 I would check my phone to see if she was awake yet, which she wasn‚Äôt. After about 4 games I just stopped checking assuming she had something else to do. Well we were halfway through a game when she messaged me through the game. She was mad that I had started playing without her, and felt that I didn‚Äôt want to play with her. I tried to tell her id gladlymplay next with her, but I guess the damage is done. She refused to talk to me, and hasn‚Äôt answered my calls. Apparently she went in to work to try and get her mind off it. She just recently messaged me her on her break that she ‚Äúneeded to have a serious talk.‚Äù Am I the asshole for playing with my friend while waiting for her to log on after we agreed to play?",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago, but I still feel bad about it, and wonder if I should have acted differently.\n\nI was a senior in high school, and prom was coming up.  I was an awkward guy, never had a girlfriend, had a hard time talking to people.  I had a massive crush on a girl, J.  J and I were kinda friendly, she would go out of her way to talk to me, hang out with me, and I had the impression that she was interested in me, but I didn't have the courage to make a move.  Classic story, you all know it.  I was determined to ask J to the prom.  I had been wanting to all year, and as it approached I kept working up the resolve to do it. \n\nOne afternoon, I was alone in one of the classrooms, working on a project.  The door opened, and in walked three girls, C and two friends.  I had known C for a long time, but never really been close to her.  They walked up to me, and C sheepishly asked if I had a prom date yet.  I froze.  C was about to ask me to prom, and I was still working up the courage to ask J.  Here's the thing, I had no interest in C.  I had the teenage mantality that you're supposed to go to prom with your big crush, and it's supposed to be a big romantic event.  I didn't want to go with C, I wanted to go with J.  But as I said, I was very awkward.  So in response, I stammered sonething about not being available that weekend.  C immediately looked crestfallen, and rushed out of the room, her friends consoling her.  I felt awful.  But I really wanted to go with J.  \n\nA couple weeks or so before prom, I finally managed it.  J had sat beside me before class, and was talking to me.  During a lull, I mustered my resolve, and asked if she had a date for prom.  She did.  She was going with S, a guy in our friend circle.  My heart dropped to the floor.  So much for my romantic dreams.  \n\nThing is, I wanted to go to prom.  I was 17, this was a big deal.  Everyone goes to their prom.  You tell your future kids the story.  I had to go.  But I couldn't bring myself to approach C, after what had happened...and besides, she must have asked someone else by now, right?   So...I went alone.  I was the only person to show up without a date.  I kept watching the doorway for C...and she never showed.  She didn't go at all.  I spent the evening on the sidelines, watching J and S dance together and fighting back jealousy.\n\nTo this day I feel bad about it, but at the same time I don't know if I was wrong to decline C since I was planning to ask J at the time.  So...am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So a couple of months back I discovered this really cute Ukrainian model, she only did like softcore photo shoots and stuff like that but I dont really mind that too much. I found a few galleries of her online and because those get taken down sometimes because of copyright and stuff I saved them on a USB stick. \n\nA few months later I'd kind of forgotten about this and my girlfriend asked me whether I had a USB since she needed one so I gave her mine. Next day she texts me asking why the fuck I have porn with a girl who looks like a fourteen year old. That threw me off but then I remembered what she was talking about. The model in question was actually 22 or so in those shoots though so definitely not underaged. \n\nShe did kind of have a youthful face, I guess, soft, roundish face, small chin and relatively wide midface. So that possibly makes her look a bit young. \n\nI tried to explain it to her how she's actually 22 in those pictures and it's probably subjective if she even looks young. She said that might be true but what does that say about me when I specifically saved pics of a woman because she possibly looks quite young, which I thought was fucked up because she was basically insinuating that I was a hebephile. \n\nI told her I'd get a second opinion on the girls looks and send one of the SFW pictures where she's outside playing with a kitten to a friend asking him what age he thought the girl was. He replied he thought 15 or 14 or so and jokingly, I must add, asked why I was stalking teens on Facebook. When I explained the situation to him he wanted to know the girls name ...\n\nAnyway this didn't really help my case so now my girlfriend basically more or less thinks that I like younger girls even though Im not a hebephile and I didn't look at anything illegal. Am I the asshole for looking at porn with this girl who is completely legal but possibly young looking to some?  Also she's not opposed to porn in general, we both look at some.\n\nI posted this on the relationship subreddit yesterday and they basically said I was a creep for looking at this adult woman and that I'm probably into young girls so I'm looking for a second opinion.\n\n\n----------\n\n**tl;dr**: Girlfriend found porn I saved with a girl who she thought looked \"too young\". Now she probably thinks I'm actually into younger girls. Am I in the wrong here? ",

      "description": "My immediate family, who all things considered are quite lovely, live 2 hours away and have coordinated a day (not Christmas) for folks to get together and celebrate when everyone is free. I was excited because this basically freed up my holiday week to have a sort of mini vacation without any schedule obligations.  Now however I'm getting pressured to still come over on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in addition to our scheduled day. I know I could just tell them I have other plans, but I'm feeling a lot of guilt because of general expectations to spend the holidays with family. Am I a grinch if I'd rather just stay at home and decorative cookies with my girlfriend?",

      "description": "When I started my job, I honestly loved it. Since then, my manager's boss got fired which caused a chain of events and led to a major management change. My manager no longer had any under him and our small team of 4 in a large company got broken into two smaller teams of 2 under different managers. My close co-worker and I got placed under one of those \"professional managers\" who don't really know what you do and my ex-manager and his co-worker got placed under another new manager they promoted from an overseas office and moved to our location. \n\nEx-manager quickly quit for obvious reasons (losing his position) and his co-worker stuck up with it a little longer but eventually got fed up with and left. This left an odd team dynamic as it left two people under the management of two people. I'm sure it doesn't take a professional to realize how this is a terrible idea. The new overseas manager wanted to replace his team so he started looking for new hires. My co-worker already did everything in the job description for this role since we've had to fill in, he just didn't have the title or pay increase. Many people were shocked that he wasn't immediately offered the job and that they were even considering an outside hire. (I'd like to note here that he and I were doing just fine with the two of us and had someone helping us with more trivial day to day tasks)\n\nManagers told him that he wouldn't be getting the role and they hired someone from outside the company. This upset him... a lot... putting it lightly. He was essentially denied the title and pay for the work he's already doing. \n\nToday the new guy started. His manager is on a business trip at his old office, so my manager has been handling his start. Right off the bat I knew he wasn't a good fit. The new guy is easily in his 50s and very overweight. Now before someone accuses me of ageism and body shaming, my job often consists of crawling under tables, climbing up ladders and carrying heavy-ish equipment when installing new technology. I don't think I'm wrong to assume he will not be helpful in these areas. I tried to keep an open mind though and talk with him for a while. When trying to show him some of our job or have him shadow me while working, he would be constantly talking over me and try to piggy back on what I was saying. You know, those people who try to finish your sentences to try to prove they already know what you're saying? The final straw is when I got called to troubleshoot something, he met me there. While I was assessing the issue, he starts telling me what to do. I just said, \"I know\" and walked away. The worst part is that most of what he was saying was wrong.\n\nAs I said, his boss who is indirectly also mine is out of town and is expecting me and my co-worker to train. WIBTA if I told him no? I also don't want my job on the line.",

      "description": "Now I know this is probably just going to sound like a teenager rambling about doing chores. While that is a part of it, that's not what annoys me.\n\n\nI (17M) have multiple chores around the house that my dad (46)\", dad's GF, 3 dogs, and I live in. Those chores include taking care of dogs (feed, water, let out, etc.) garbage, putting dishes in and out of dishwasher, cleaning whenever I'm told to (living room, bathroom, kitchen, and, obviously, my room), including others.\n\n\nNow what I'm annoyed about is how I'll do all these chores daily and never get told thank you or anything for all these things as \"it's expected\". My dad and his gf constantly say how once I get a job, do I expect to be told thanks everyday or something along those lines. My answer would be yes, I would be doing work and would like to be appreciated, and I'd also be getting paid, unlike the chores I do as I don't get paid in way by my dad or his gf.\n\n\nAnother thing that happens is if I am unable to do these chores, like if I'm not at home for an extended period of time, like say visiting my mother for the weekend, he wont do anything except take care of the dogs. I'd put the dishes in the dishwasher and run it the day i leave, and they still would be in it when I got back 2-3 days later. And as soon as I get home I'm told \"empty out the dishwasher\", as if he couldn't do it, despite not working. Other times I'll be in the bathroom taking a shower or just taking a dump, and one of the dogs would start asking to go out, badly, and instead if doing it himself, he'll yell at me to hurry up, even if I just got in there.\n\n\nSometimes he'll be up earlier than me (which is often) and he won't take the dogs out and instead have them wait another hour or two until I wake up and have me do it, his excuses being either he wasn't dressed or the dog was sleeping, both excuses that if I used, I would've been yelled at and gotten in trouble for\n\n\nOther excuses he uses to not do them are that he worked all day (which i understand and appreciate, I wouldn't even be living in the house if it wasn't for him, but you working all day doesn't mean you can't take the garbage out once or twice) or that he has to start dinner, but then doesn't start it until an hour later.\n\nIve tried telling him these things, but he never listens and will always say I'm just complaining about doing chores, and if I continue, backtalking, which then escalates to other things and becomes it's own little fight\n\n\nAgain, this isn't just me complaining about chores, i do them like I'm supposed to, I just wish I One: am thanked and appreciated for what I do and two: not have to do everything by myself and instead have my dad do it here and there\n\n\nSo AITA",

      "description": "Sort of a throwaway account that I mostly use to lurk. Oh boy. Where do I start?\n\nI met my (online) friend group 3 years ago. It was essentially a support system for us, since we all had some shit going on. At the time (and presumably to this day), the one with the most fucked up daily life was this (now ex friend) friend, I'll call him Y. \n\nWe learn Y's dad is an abusive prick who should be in jail for the amount of fuckery he's done. Y has been doing every fucking thing to get away from him, like moving countries. Y is apparently a very very valuable person in the sense that he's doremisofucking good in everything he does + he's drop dead kill you with a glance gorgeous (we'd all exchanged photos and Facebooks, so yes I can at least say the \"really attractive\" part is true). It's why we've assumed Y-Dad wants him to take over the family business and tries to sabotage all of Y's attempts to get a life AWAY from him.\n\nY self-harmed, had been diagnosed with a whole bunch of crap, had already had previous suicide attempts, and generally had not been doing so well. His extended family who he'd been staying with was receptive to everything including his dad being a huge asswipe except his mental health. Here's when it went down. Y told us he won't be around for a few days... proceeded to get hospitalized and 'grounded' by his extended family for attempting suicide, again. Hell broke loose.\n\nMy other friend was furious (he still is to this day) but still supported him at the time. The rest of us were just...I don't fucking know man, how the hell are we supposed to feel when a friend we've come to know so well tries to off themselves and adamantly refuses to go to therapy? I should probably mention than the country he'd moved to was supposedly no other than ***dun dun dun*** South Korea and if the KPOP industry says ANYTHING about SK's view on mental health it's that it's virtually nonexistent to them. Our group stayed together, though aforementioned friend (let's call him L) admitted to us later on he never really forgave Y for refusing to seek help.\n\nAll seemed well. Y started getting...closer to the edge again. Another friend (more of an acquaintance to me since I found him a bit of a huge pretentious prick at times buuut that's legit not related to this), let's call him S, decided to tell Y he likes him. Thing is, Y had had a crush on S for at least a year. Y was fucking ELATED and everything was smooth sailing again!! Everyone was content. Y wasn't gonna try and off himself anytime soon! It gave us time!\n\nDead. Fucking. Wrong.\n\nMy memory got fuzzy over details because this all happened 1-2 years ago. I remember S broke. He said he didn't really *like* Y and only did it because he had been scared Y would try and Go Commit Die again. Y understandably was outraged at this revelation. They broke up immediately. He ranted in our group chat... and L *defended* S's decision, claiming he would have done the same. I too agreed with him. We would have done anything, fucking anything we could to keep Y alive from so far away. Had S told us before he'd told it to Y, we probably would have kept it secret.\n\nThat's where I have to ask. Were we manipulative? Were we the assholes? I want to believe we weren't, I really really want to believe we supported the right thing, but now with the whole \"you can't be selfish, you can't stop someone who really wants to die to not die, you can't force them into ultimatums\" thought train regarding suicide, I don't know. I just don't know.\n\nTo clarify, we all did not still stop being friends with Y over this. But I do believe it had been some form of catalyst to the overall breakdown of everyone's relationships with him.\n\nP.S. mildly irrelevant? i guess? but S is younger than Y. I forgot the exacts but minimum of 4-5 years age gap. S was still 15-16 while Y turned legal at their time of dating. Y just last year preyed on another younger friend and dated them. She was 15. So tl;dr Y turned out to be, in essence, a pedophile.",

      "description": "I've been feeling a little bad about it but I just wanted to know your guys' thoughts.  I'm soon to be building a new gaming computer and I wanted to give my current one to my friend.  It's a middle of the pack computer(it's not bad is what I'm trying to say, would cost maybe $700 to build nowadays) and I don't really want to strip it for parts and sell it.  My friend from Middle School is quite a bit less fortunate than me, he loves to play games with me but sometimes we just can't play because his computer now is too old.  Here starts the story:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him I wanted to give him my current computer and he said no.  After a couple weeks of \"maybe, no\" with him he just flat out said he feels bad and does not want it.  I basically had an argument with him where I told him it makes me happy to give away my computer to an old friend, I'm not doing it as a pity party(it's not like I'm going out and buying a computer for him), we'll finally be able to play games.  After a couple minutes arguing about it he finally gave in but he kind of ended it on an \"okay fine I'll take it so you stop telling me to take it\" kind of thing.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel bad now because I just wanted to be nice and upgrade his PC for him instead of just throwing it away, but it feels like I forced it onto him.  I realize arguing with my friend to give him something is kind of dumb.  He didn't want the computer because it made him feel like he was getting something for nothing, I wanted him to take it because I like giving away things(it makes me feel good) and he's one of my best friends who I felt deserved it.

      "description": "So what happened was me and my friend got out of class and I had another class on the other side of campus. I decided to drive over there and my friend was asking for a ride and after I said no he opened the door anyways and got in. I drove him to his car, it wasn't that out of the way. I was waiting for him to get off and he just sat and talked and I said you gotta go I got to get to class. Now this friend is pretty handsy and loves to poke you and tickle you. He started messing with me pretty vigorously. Its important to note that the car is not in park and I am pushing the brake pedal. I get pushed and lose my footing of the pedal and my car starts rolling towards the concrete barrier. I press what I think is the brake pedal, but it is not and we hit the concrete barrier. \n\nI have insurance, however it does not cover my car. So all the expenses are coming out of pocket. The reason why my insurance is not normal is because this car is a 2005 Infinity G35 and any accident will be ruled a total loss. Ive fixed cars in the past, but this is far and away above my knowledge and expertise. I took it to a mechanic that says he can fix it up and that it doesn't look nearly as bad as it is. He said I can expect the price to be 1.5-2.5 thousand. \n\nNow would be important to talk about our financial backgrounds. I am from a well off family that has been very supportive. My parents let me know that they will give me a no interest loan, but they will not give me any money. Which I am very thankful for, and do not expect any money from them. My parents never have given an allowance or any type of free money. This does not mean that they don't occasionally buy me clothes or food. As a full time college student it is hard to maintain a full time job. I would usually have 2 part time jobs, now I am down to one job that pays around $450 a month. It's not a lot but its what I can manage as a full time student. Now my friend is not as fortunate as I am. His parents do give him some spending money though. Which he routinely blows on alcohol or weed. That's as far as I know about his financial background. After the accident I realized if I should not push him away or break the friendship because of this accident. Especially if I were to ask for some money. So my question to you is if I should ask for his help in paying a mistake that I think is 75% his fault. And if so how much.  \n",

      "description": "About a couple of years, I started hanging out with a friend that I recently met. I had just started college in a different region of the country where people spoke a different language altogether, so it was slightly hard to adjust. Amidst all the chaos of semesters papers and other activities, we became good friends and would frequently see each other. A couple of months later, we hooked up one night and it got pretty awkward after that. We didn't exactly meet up much after, I felt like she wanted some space. Also it was time for our semester exams again so I started studying again. I never study except on the week before the exam. Our vacations started and we went to our hometowns. We still kept in touch because we liked to watch movies a lot and discussed it. But it wasn't at the same intensity as it once was. During the break, I met someone and we sort of hit it off. We start dating a couple of months later. While this happened, my friend got involved with her college student body council and we almost stopped talking because she was busy most of the time. \n\nAround later that year, during the winter I was alone and extremely bored. I didn't have anyone to chill with for at least half the month. I was on social media when I saw that my friend was still in town and I dm'ed. We talked and decided to meet up. She stays in a strict dorm, we decided to come over to my place. We watched a couple comedy specials, I got sleepy and I said goodnight and slept off in the next room. \n\nSome time next year, I meet her best friend/ roommate, who tells me that she was expecting to hook up that night when she came over. But I was in a relationship and we never had any thing like that before for me realize this. \n\nAlso this is my first Reddit post ever. I hope the community could help me out here if I made a mistake",

Her husband saw the man from their 4th floor window, and went down and checked on the man, and called for an ambulance and made sure he got taken to the hospital. \n\nI know all of this happened because the wife stayed in the hotel room(not helping)and took a series of photographs of the man unconscious, and of her husband checking him, and of him being loaded into the ambulance and posted them on Facebook.

Like it would be fine if she just wanted to post about what happened and how her husband helped. But really!?!

      "description": "My mother has been going through a lot lately. She lives with constant pain and she takes care of my grandmother with Alzheimers. She is also very depressed and has told me she wants to kill herself. Now I always worry about her and have tried to help her out with daily things more. \n\nAnyway...I had class today then I went to the gym. While at the gym she called me and told me theres food at home, and asked me to get some soda from the store for her alcohol. I said \"I guess\" in a tone in which showed I didn't really want to. She had been saying she wanted soda for a couple days now, but I'm not good at remembering things like that unless you outright ask me to go do X, and I still might forget.... She got mad and hung up on me. I was at the gym doing my thing so I wasn't really wanting to talk to my mom atm. The reason I didn't really want to is because I forgot my other shirt for the gym so I was gunna have to go to the store soaked in sweat. Plus it was dark out already. \n\nSo I go to the store like I said I would, got her soda and went home. Low and behold she's pissed and doesn't even talk to me. So I eat food, then go in her room (doors closed) to say sorry. What I really wanted to say is why the heck are you mad at me, I didn't really want to go, but I would. But that would piss her off even more and she would probably cry. \n\nI said sorry, and she's still mad at me. Her doors closed and still doesn't want to talk to me. Ive dealt with situations like this too many times to count. I catch myself being like her sometimes and it pisses me the fuck off. AITA?\n",

      "title": "AITA For keeping a story fron my past a secret to my friends?",
      "description": "Alright, so we're group of 6 15 year olds (including me), basically your typical group of teenagers. Think of a less exaggerated, \"relationship-less\" version of the kids from That 70s Show. Three of these people I've known since the 7th grade (my school is both a middle school and a high school, that's why we're still in contact), and the other two I met recently in the start of 10nth grade. September of 2018 is when we all started hanging out, and it is now mid/late-January 2019.\n\nLast week, 4 of those 6 members (once again including me), recently met up in one of those 4 people's houses, and we started playing truth or dare. Us almost always pussying out of dares and almost always saying truth got us in a serious mood, as we all had to respond to things such as \"What would you do if all of us died and you had to choose which one was going to live?\", \"Honestly rate everyone in the 'gang' individually\", or \"What is your greatest fear?\", but we were still playful non the less.\n\nThings got even more serious however when we all went out for a short walk, and one of my friends started telling us about traumatic experiences of hers, and then told us a specific one with more detail. Another one of my friends said very vaguely that he had a similar experience, and the other one didn't say anything. We got back to the friends house and it was getting late so we had to live. After hearing my friends' stories, I was in the mood to tell them one of my own, but we had ran out of time so I told them that I would tell them next time we all met.\n\nNow, here's the internal conflict. As I got home, I started evaluatimg my decision to tell them the story. My friends' stories took place when they were around 11, but mine was much more recent, much more complicated, and involved a lot more people, most of which are other friends of mine (to sum up the story without getting into detail, me and another group of friends had our summers and states of mind ruined by someone who was being a controlling, manipulative, and bitter cunt \"friend\" we all had to put up with). I thought maybe that I shouldn't tell them, for the following reasons:\n1) This story goes beyond me. Other friends who were involved in it might not like the story being told to anyone else. I feel that it would be incredibly disrespectful to them and what we've all been through to just put what happened out there (especially since some people from both circles know eachother).\n2) One of the people who was involved in the situation (who is in both 'gangs') specifically asked me NOT to tell the story to anyone, and I would like to respect his desire.\n3) While I do thing the guy who caused my trauma was being an absolute asshole, I still find it disrespectful to tell this story, since he's not entirely that bad (I also place some of the blame on me for what happened), and he was also a young teenager at the time, which would make it sort of justifiable for him to make poor and selfish decisions. Besides, after this experience I'm sure he'll change, if he hasn't already (maybe I'm being too naive, but oh well)\n4) Their stories were significantly less fucked up and impactful than mines is, so them insisting that I tell it to them because they told me theirs, especially after I've explained this is not really the most respectful thing to do (but more on that later).\nTo sum up, I trust those people, but some things are better to keep to yourself.\n\n\nSo, here comes Monday, we're in recess and someone from the group reminds me that I haven't told them the story yet, and I say that I'm not sure if I should tell them, explaining my first and last reasons only to them, but they are still pressuring me to tell them (not at the point where I'm stressed out, but to the point where I just feel a little annoyed and disrespected), although one of them did show some understanding.\n\nIt's Wednesday, and they're still bringing it up. Now, it's my mistake that I told them that I would tell the story in the first place, as I didn't think it through, and I should tell them the other reasons, however they're pretty stubborn. I do see where they're coming from, as it probably took a lot out of them to tell their own stories, and the mere thought of not telling them makes feel like an asshole. I've explained that I trust them 100% (and that me meeting them fairly recently does not affect that), and if I had any other traumatic stories similar to theirs I would totally tell them, just not this one.",

Our school has an annual tour for the choir where they usually visit places such as Europe, Spain, Latin America, etc. This has been a tradition for everyone the past 50ish years. However, due to complications, the usual director is gone this year and there have been 2 replacement teachers throughout the year, meaning we aren't as organized or confident. Despite this, the second teacher we had this year insists on having a tour to Nashville. There were 6 guys(small af) in the choir at the start of the year. Two dropped, and two guys don't want to go on tour, meaning there is me and another person going on tour(other guy is determined to go). Personally, I think that there is little point to going on tour with 2 guys and mediocre songs. But if I don't go on tour, I'm basically going to make it not happen for the choir, which is mostly filled with seniors that want this and might kill this tradition.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to go?",

After he broke up with her for the umpteenth time he came to me and disclosed that he was planning on sleeping with a girl (girl 2) we‚Äôll known to sleep around when I relayed this to him his reply was that she told home she is a virgin and would not accept anything else. \n\nA few weeks go by and he returns to me, I ask him how things went with girl 2 and he told me not to tell anyone, she gave him gonorrhea and that he considered getting back together with girl 1 I told him that would be shitty and if he did to tell her and if she took him back to use protection. When girl 1 came to me because girl 1 and I are friends and I‚Äôm friends with ‚Äúrandy‚Äù she asked me for advice and I told her it was not a good choice but did not tell her about the STI he had gotten. \n\nAgain after a few weeks they are back together and I hear she caught what he has (heard from mutual friends then eventually from girl 1)  it‚Äôs been a year since this and I wonder if I should have been more explicit in my warning to her and betray his trust or would it have even been a betrayal.

      "title": "AITA for using the word \"lame\"",
      "description": "Hey all. Recently one of my friends took exception to my use of the word \"lame,\" citing its ableist origins. Honestly until she said that, I never made a mental connection between \"lame\" as a descriptor for something uncool and the word as a slur against a disabled person‚ÄîI have never in my life heard someone use \"lame\" in its original meaning, except on period TV dramas. Of course I'm familiar with the original meaning from literature etc., but I have never heard it used that way in real life. (But of course, I am not disabled and therefore unlikely to be targeted with a word like that, so I *would* be unaware, wouldn't I.)\n\nAnyway, she asked me not to use the word, and I have complied, for the most part, but I'm finding it very difficult, it's entrenched in my vocabulary. I try very hard to keep myself from saying it in front of her. *For me*, \"lame\" has absolutely no ableist connotation in contemporary usage, but then again, I hate when people use a slur and then say, well it doesn't mean xyz *for me*. If you're not the person a slur targets, of course it won't carry the same weight/viciousness. I think it's hypocritical that I'm not using it in front of her but using with other friends. That means I've made no significant change, I guess.\n\nBut I also don't think the word \"lame\" is comparable to racial epithets. Don't most insults come from offensive origins? When I call someone stupid, I mean to insult them by saying they're less intelligent and implying that being less intelligent is bad. Is that ableism against people with intellectual disabilities? When I call someone lame, I don't mean *anything* about their body, I mean it as an insult against their taste. Ugh, I feel like I must be the asshole here, because I'm making some kind of special exception about this specific word. If someone of a minority group says that something is offensive/hurtful, I generally listen to them.\n\nI really love the word \"lame,\" it has a very specific meaning of absolute uncool that no other word can match. Please, I need to know if I'm being an asshole here. [Also if anyone's got any good, not ableist synonyms, let me know.]",

I have never shown that I would be unable to handle myself should the situation arise. I live in Colorado and frequent many parks hardest rated trails. I am now 16 and decided to ask my parents (divorced) to go camping alone for a night over winter break.\n\nMy mom took a day to think and had a few discussions with me about whether or not I feel I am ready and the logistics of doing it. She then decided to allow me to go. (I could‚Äôve not told my dad at this point and just went but I wanted to see that he was ok with it as well) upon asking my dad I get an immediate no. Without discussion or even a chance to say where I wanted to go. I asked him to talk about it and he simply ignored me. A few hours later I texted him saying that I would not watch his house this next upcoming month he was going on a trip unless he discussed what his issues were with me so that I would at least know. He has not yet responded. My question is does using his vacation as blackmail to have a talk with him (I made it clear that as long as he talked with me I would watch the house he didn‚Äôt even have to say yes) make me the asshole. I don‚Äôt think him being an asshole is an outcome as I know he is simply concerned and that is why I want to talk. I only want to know if i was an asshole in the way I handled the situation.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read :)",

My parents and sister went on a 10 day holiday overseas and asked me to house sit and look after the family dog, a husky.\nMy Mum doesn't work and my Dad, a tradie only works when he wants to. They are home most of the day as is my disabled sister. \nMy partner was using my car while she gets a new one and I used my Mum's car for the week.\nMy Dad specifically said do not let the dog sleep inside, although when I used to live at home a year ago he was allowed to. \nI work 12 hour shifts and spoke to my Mum about this and she said that it's a bit cruel to leave the dog outside in the medium sized back yard for 20 hours a day and that he could sleep inside. I didn't speak to my Dad about this because once he decided something he will not change his mind and will just get angry at being questioned.\nThe house is a two storey but the downstairs area is almost a second house on its own which is where I stayed. This used to be my room/area when I returned from university.\n\nAITA?\nThey arrived back at 3am Friday morning and the first thing my Dad did was to come down stairs and check if the dog was inside. Which was odd since it basically separate from all of his stuff. \nHe then woke me up by yelling at me for letting the dog sleep inside, leaving the air condition on and the ranch slider to the backyard open (I am the asshole for this but I forgot) in my defence it wasn't wide open but I still should've shut it. \nHe called me a stupid cunt, that he gave me one instruction (not true I get lists of things cause he thinks I'm an idiot) And stormed off back upstairs.\n\nLater that day I had decided to call in sick as I only had a half day and had not gotten much sleep. \nMy Dad came back down stairs and berated me again saying I directly disobeyed him, \"fuck you\", \"there is fur every where\", \"why are you still here\", \"You will pay for this cunt\" to which I replied \"don't worry I won't come back\".\n\nMy Mum later came down and said I don't know why he is mad about the fur he has never vacuumed and the weekly cleaner is coming today. \nMy Mum also told me my Dad said \"I am never allowed to stay there again and if I do there will be trouble\". My Dad have had a fist fight early last year which he started and is now never spoken of until now I guess.\n\nWe had agreed myself and my partner were going to move back in April and May 2019 before we move to England in June which I guess is now not happening. \n\nSo am AITA for letting the dog sleep inside?\nI feel bad that my Mum and Sister are going to have deal with my Dad being in a bad mood for the next week because of this. \n\n",

I didn‚Äôt mean all homeless people, I don‚Äôt have a problem with them coming in to get warm or being at the library in general. But the city I live in has a major problem with homelessness (like most west coast cities), and a lot of the time, they‚Äôre watching porn or harassing other people or basically camping out at desks.

      "description": "So this could be an obvious answer, since a majority of the involved party are in agreement, but since I‚Äôm the most empathetic in the family, to their annoyance, I might as well ask for a second opinion. And there is a bit of backstory, so I may accidentally miss some things, ask away if there is some discrepancies that need to ironed out.\n\nBACKSTORY: My parents have been divorced since my freshman year of high school since my dad cheated on my mom with a girl half his age, and then continued to date her on and off again for the next seven-ish years. Now when they divorced, my dad and my relationship grew (he literally needed a crying shoulder I guess), and for some reason at the time I inadvertently blamed my mom for the divorce. I didn‚Äôt have the whole story at the time, I was completely in the wrong, and was being a cunt (this is somewhat important). \n\nNow I am an extremely awkward fuck, it takes me time to actually be able to have a normal conversation with someone unless our personality is compatible. Basically if I don‚Äôt immediately have a connection with someone, I come across as a cold asshole, which I try to work on, but I‚Äôm kind of hopeless sometimes. So the first time I met my dad‚Äôs girlfriend, which I knew was the person he cheated on with my mom, I was extremely uncomfortable, and kind of fucked up, by not making eye contact or having a good conversation. She apparently took this personally and assumed I hated her, when in reality I just am bad in social situations. This was before ACTUALLY I hated her because for the next seven years there was not one moment where they weren‚Äôt fighting or either one of them did some crazy shit to each other (I can elaborate if asked). Now my dad likes to play victim a lot and he is pretty good at it. Like I said, I blamed my mom for the divorce even though it was completely my dad‚Äôs fault. His girlfriend is insane, but I can infer that him being a constant asshole to her made her crazy. \n\nFFW to now: They are ‚Äújust friends‚Äù now, though part of me think they are secretly seeing each other, but that is pure speculation. Everyone in my immediate family hates her, and will leave if she shows up to our place. On thanksgiving, my dad and I were alone in a room and I asked what he wants for Christmas. He tells me that he wants me to be accepting of his life, for me and my sisters (who I am very close with) to accept his girlfriend, and for her to be allowed to go to family gatherings. He then heavily implies that me not accepting her is the main source of his sadness, and he also implied I was leaching off of him since he pays for my car insurance and half of my community college, which I was grateful for, but now I just feel guilty about it ever since he brought it up. I don‚Äôt have a job atm since I left my warehouse position, and I‚Äôm going through some existential problems, where I‚Äôm having to accept working till the day I die, which is a scary thought. The fucking point is I don‚Äôt have a job, and I‚Äôm relying on him so, he could have a point. \n\nI gave him the cold shoulder for a week after his ‚Äúrequest‚Äù, and then when I went to his home for a family dinner, I saw my technique was actually making him depressed so I felt like I had to let it go, and try to pretend what he said didn‚Äôt kill me inside. As far as he knows, we‚Äôre ok now, but I‚Äôm still angry at him for what he said (more the source of his sadness thing rather than the leech thing), and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to deal with it, because I will not be around the girlfriend, and if I had balls I‚Äôd cut him out too. I think they both suck, but one is my dad whom I have an ok relationship with so I let it go when he tries to guilt me about it. Also my siblings and I tell him he could be with her, but just not around us, which created a ‚Äúher or us‚Äù situation.\n\nTL;DR: AITA For not wanting to be around my dad‚Äôs girlfriend, saying I‚Äôll leave the area if she‚Äôs around. \n\nFor those who read: Am I stupid for asking this?\n\n",

      "description": " So, I‚Äôll try to make this as unbiased as I can. It all started at a debate competition my friend and I were at. It was a usual debate competition, where there were 5 rounds, and between each round there was about an hour long break. Anyway, our second round was about to begin, so my friend and I head up to the classroom where it will we‚Äôll debate. When we approach the classroom, we can see that there‚Äôs still a debate going on, so I take a seat on the staircase nearby and my friend follows. Time passes, and I get bored, so as a time filler, I start fooling around. I tell my friend random jokes on from my phone, but then I get bored from that. We had now been waiting for 30 minutes, and the teams debating before us still hadn‚Äôt finished. Now, this is where the all the drama started. I start making weird noises on the staircase, and my friend starts laughing. He calls me an ‚Äòautist‚Äô and pulls out his camera to record me. I keep doing it, because it‚Äôs amusing both of us, but then I stop being weird, and he stops filming. He says that he‚Äôs going to post it on a group chat, and I tell him to stop, but he does it anyway. I ask him to show me the video, he says no, and that I can see it on the group chat. I leave the topic alone, and I continue on with the competition. After the competition, I check my phone, and only one person has responded to the video. The person responds, ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôve seen a special ed kid at school who looks like him(she was referring to me).‚Äù I get pretty offended by this text, but I assumed she was trying out new humor, since the video that my friend posted didn‚Äôt include him calling me an autist, and the person who responded to the video was quite against using words like retard and autist to describe something bad. I passive aggressively try to attack the person by mocking them and their sense of humor. They constantly claim that they were not joking and I get mad. Before I can say anything else, another person jumps into the conversation. This person, or person B, is best friends with person A(the person who responded to the video). Person B asks for an explanation of the video, and I tell them everything that happened. Person B then starts ranting on the group chat about how it‚Äôs wrong to use autist and retard like that. Under normal circumstances, I would‚Äôve heard her out and agreed, however this time I didn‚Äôt because she was aiming the entire lecture at me, and I didn‚Äôt believe that i had done anything wrong. I attempt to disregard all of her points by responding ‚Äòlmao‚Äô to each text, and she then calls be a bastard for being a bystander in this entire situation. \n\nSo this is the dilemma. \n- Am I really a bystander if I was the one being made fun of.\n- Shouldn‚Äôt Person A also be accused because they assumed I was being a special ed kid, even though the video didn‚Äôt have the words autist or retard in it?",

      "description": "   So i got a uncle that made fun of me since i was a kid, he was always trying to prove that his kids was better than me, he always was calling me a fat kid and making fun of my way to do things. So i grew up, lost weight and got myself my first gf( i was a 15 yo), and it was really cool for 3 years, but then she changed too much so i decide to break up with her. 3 months ago her mom said to me that she was depressed, and then i tell my mom, that tells my whole family, and on a family party  on my uncle house, and my uncle was making fun of me to my whole family, they all know that im depressed since my 12 yo.  And he was saying thinks like \"this boy made his girl crazy, not even a good girl like her can live with that guy\". That was really hurting me but im not the type of person that get's angry easier, so i just ignore him. \n  Then 2 weeks ago we got another family party, now in my parents house, and the news for we was that his wife cheated him and he forgive her(it happened like 2 months before actually), He  come on the party late and his wife was there too, so no one was saying to much about that anymore. But then he got a little drunk and started his casual bully on me, always talking about my life and shit. \n  I got drunk too, so i was really honest if i can say it like that, because i started to make fun of him, thinks like \"fuck off you cuck asshole\". And... He get mad, really, he tried to hit me with his bottle, his wife started to cry( and i feel bad for that) and suddently my whole family really get mad with me, but i was too drunk to give a fuck, i started to yell so loud thinks like \" fuck you hit me if you can you pussy, you are the first cuck of the family\". Really shit was crazy, but then he go home after that discussion.\nI was ok with that all to be honest, but now i got atleast half of my family(that i love) hating me because of that night. Im really trying to know if passed the line, did i go too far? I feel guilty to hurt herbut i think he deserved. Now his wife is saying that she will never go to a family party again, my cousins are mad with me, my mom wants me to apologize and im really curious about what you redditors think about that. AITA?\n\n\n*TLDR* : I have a uncle that make fun of me to the whole family when i break up with a girl and she turns to get depressed after, but when i made fun of him getting cheated and forgiving his wife my whole family turns on me.",

Now though he's not being civil and trying to talk to us which is annoying. He has threatened to go to guidance on us and we're just trying to say sorry and before you say I don't care about guidance but F1 does and we did apologise before he said he'd go to guidance. Also he has said now that me and him were never friends and that we'll never be friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat annoys me is that he has a history of making up lies to bully people but he hasn't done that in quite a while so I don't know if he'll do it. he's saying that he never took the child predator jokes as jokes but he was laughing along with us and even called me a rapist (which i took as a joke) also F1 months ago jokingly said \"what do you call a guy who sleeps with a hunch of girls?\" so we replied \"A fuckboy\" and then he said \" and what do you call a woman who sleeps with a bunch of guys?\" which we said \"IDK\" then he said \"PB's mum\" and he's still holding on to it even though it happened months ago\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for thinking I was joking with my mate  and then he took it as bullying and didn't even blame the people who started it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to clarify F3 has autism and he made the joke up so idk about the ADD and ADHD part but he should be the person who can say that PB has autism even though it would be messed up he should still be the person who is most allowed to say it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: we've been joking with him about the pedophile jokes for around 2 months\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit Edit: we were very close friends and made vulgar jokes about each other ",

      "description": "Disclaimer: I do not support any discrimination between races or support racist organizations, please don‚Äôt take it that way.\n\nSo me and my table group were chatting. We have this Asian kid who‚Äôs racist, like really racist. He says the n-word with a hard r at least 50 times a day at my school. The Asian kid started making racist jokes. Literally everyone at our table, black, white, or Hispanic/Asian were laughing at them. It‚Äôs not something to laugh at, but we all knew he wasn‚Äôt being serious. At least, I think that. I used to be his friend (before he starting being really racist with the N-word) and I thought I‚Äôd share some of my racist jokes with him. Not because I particularly liked that he was racist, just because he used to be my friend. Oddly enough, he gets offended whenever someone says something about Chinese people. \n\nI whispered my jokes, and he started laughing. I laughed too, they were (kinda) funny. \nNow believe me when I say I don‚Äôt support racism, because it‚Äôs disgusting, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs racist (unless you mean it to be) to tell jokes and laugh at them. This one short kid ‚Äî let‚Äôs call him Joseph ‚Äî had a different opinion. Joseph decided he would go over and tell one of my black friends that I had made racist jokes. (The Asian kid decided to tell everyone at my table I made those jokes, so that‚Äôs how Joseph knew.) \nI wasn‚Äôt even intending to oppress or make fun of him because of his skin color, it was a joke. Please believe me when I say I did not mean it to oppress black people. \n\nJoseph might have a grudge with me, because he keeps trying to start this and make it into a big thing. So now my black friend is mad at me. Am I the Asshole for laughing at racist jokes and telling them?\n\nNote: I believe that comedy (whether right or wrong) will always create new jokes out of sensitive topics. I do admit that I shouldn‚Äôt have told those racist jokes, but I also can‚Äôt go back in time. \n\nTLDR: Made racist joke, am I asshole for saying racist joke and laughing at them?",

      "description": "Sorry for formatting im on mobile. \n\nMy boyfriend (ill call him C) and I have known eachother for a few years and started dating a few months ago. When we first met, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I liked his best friend (ill call him B). He was kind of loud, obnoxious, and immature for his age and in comparison to my now boyfriend. After a while, like a year ish, though I figured he seemed chill enough. My boyfriend and I were flirty with eachother and liked eachother, but we were not together. \n\nAfter another 6 ish months he was kind of acting off and distant so I gave C some space and we weren‚Äôt talking very frequently. That‚Äôs when his best friend started hitting on me, asking for nudes, all the likes. At the time I was feeling kind of lonely so I said fuck it and did it and talked with him, and then he ghosted me. I was kind of surprised since I had thought he was a nice guy. \n\nSo I told C what had happened and he said something like ‚ÄúHaha oh yea B does that kind of stuff all the time, to girls he finds everywhere‚Äù So I was kind of upset and asked C why he didn‚Äôt tell me B did that kind of stuff and if he could talk to him about it. So I don‚Äôt really like B, at all, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a very good person at this point. \n\nC tells me he‚Äôs tired of seeing guys treat me like shit and that he wants to start ‚Äútalking‚Äù (basically talking like we‚Äôre together if that makes sense) again even though he has a girlfriend at this point! I just tell him I guess so and that happens for another few months before he got mad at me for I guess questioning his actions and morals. I kind of got off topic. \n\nRecently he told me that ‚ÄúB is ok with you so you should be ok with B‚Äù. Which in my mind makes no sense, so I told him no I don‚Äôt like B I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a good person‚Äù. Yesterday C said he was going over to B‚Äôs house for his birthday and I just said ok. Then C said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt hold a grudge forever you know‚Äù. And I just said that thinking someone isn‚Äôt a good person isn‚Äôt the same as holding a grude‚Äù \n\nAITA for not wanting to get along and be friends with B now? Everything happened like 2 or 3 years ago. ",

      "description": "I work as a nurse in the UK and currently work in a team providing care for patients at home. I joined the team in February and mostly everyone was really nice and welcoming however for one woman my mere presence seems to fuck her off. I honestly can not recall what I ever did or said to cause such a reaction but it makes my working life rather awkward. This has been going on for months and has been worse since I‚Äôve been off work sick for reasons out of my control. Despite attempts to make amends I have been met with silence, cold hard stares and bitching behind my back in my ear shot. I try to not let this bother me until today. We were alone in the office and the phone goes off, my colleague answered it, a frantic relative call asking for some advice. At this point I should point out I am technically the most senior person in the office and therefore responsible for patient care. My colleague who is a role below me (not that it ever matters apart from legally) states there is not trained staff present and therefore we can not help them, hangs up. I sit utterly shocked that 1) she bluntly ignored the fact I was senior than her at the time and 2) that we couldn‚Äôt even give them advice which is a lie because if she actually handed the phone to me I could of helped. What pissed me off more is the fact soon as my other colleagues come into the office she swans over to them, telling them the problem and getting the exact same advice I would give. I can deal with her not liking me as a person but I can not however understand why get disrespected in a professional manner when I‚Äôm well known for being one the hardest workers. I am planning to confront her tomorrow and call her out on this breech of patient safety and also for being an utter bitch ruining my time in this team.\n\nAm I a asshole for doing this? ",

      "description": "My partner visited his parents on Sunday. He wanted to watch formula 1, and we don‚Äôt have sky channels, so he got over there very early to catch it, around 4.30am. He was going to do a few things, watch the race, service the car and go out for breakfast.\n\nI woke up at our house (we rent) at 9, and didn‚Äôt hear from him until 11. He said he‚Äôd fallen asleep after the race (fair enough) and was going out for breakfast now.\n\nI asked what time roughly he‚Äôd be back (id originally assumed about 11.30 as the race was so early but we hadn‚Äôt actually discussed this) and he got really annoyed. He said it makes him really anxious giving a set time because it stresses him if it gets near the time and he isn‚Äôt leaving yet. \n\nI said okay, don‚Äôt give me a set time, but is it going to be more like 2 hours or 5 hours? I didn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôd done the car yet. He does give an answer of 2 hours but is still really angry that I asked and says I‚Äôm belittling him feeling anxious. I understand it makes him anxious, but I wasn‚Äôt sure what I could plan for the day as I like to know what I can do.\n\nAm I the asshole? I feel like he just doesn‚Äôt want to do anything that may upset his parents over me. I said it‚Äôs just common courtesy to give a time, even if it‚Äôs a very rough one. If running late just text and say ‚Äúrunning a bit late, be back in an hour‚Äù? We‚Äôve been together 6 years. I feel like I‚Äôm failing to see his POV and whether I‚Äôm being unreasonable. ",

      "description": "Saturday theatre practice for my high school. \n\nAfter practice was over, I was hanging out with some upperclassmen (all of whom I admire and want to become closer with). \nTo preface, my school is very friendly and all grade levels roll with each other like there isn‚Äôt a difference. \n\nAnyway, I was talking to a group of upperclassmen after practice. Our conversation got to the topic of butts. We began remarking on this junior guy, ‚ÄòJim‚Äôs‚Äô butt (who is in the conversation) and how it‚Äôs very firm when he flexed it. He mentioned how weird it was that people slapped butts, but it would be weird if someone were to punch one instead. So junior girl ‚ÄòAbbie‚Äô flexed her butt and invited a few of us to punch it. Then Jim let a few of us punch *his*. (Only Abbie punched his butt). We laughingly agreed it was odd. \n\nCouple seconds later Abbie asks him questions about how he got it to be so fit etc etc. People left and right of me quietly interject with things like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just genetics‚Äù after  Abbie and Jim work out that they have the same regimen. \n\nAbbie seems baffled that he has a better butt than her, and the rest of us are humored at the conversation. Others (in her grade level, mind you) continue to reaffirm that it‚Äôs probably just genetics or diet or the fact that they are different sex, *maybe*.\n\n I finally make the lighthearted joke ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre just flat!‚Äù \n\nHere‚Äôs the catch: I am very flat. Time and time again I have tried to work on gaining better curves, but to no avail. I used to be very insecure about my curvature, but I learned to just deal with it. On top of that, I‚Äôm also flat in the boob department. So.... there. \n\nImmediately after my ‚Äújoke,‚Äù Abbie muffles something and turns away, making slight crying sounds. I take this as dark humor, because I make the *same* type of jokes (you‚Äôll see here in a second). \n\nBefore she‚Äôs completely out of sight and being tailed by a friend, I laughingly say, ‚ÄúI can say it cuz I‚Äôm flat.‚Äù \n\nHowever, she is gone. I immediately realize that she just left to cry. A separate junior girl, ‚ÄòKatie‚Äô, tells me that it‚Äôs okay and that they are drama queens. \n\nI hear this and continue to stare in the direction that Abbie and her friend ran off. I try to do a joke by sniffling, but upon Jim hugging me and trying to cheer me up (in a humorous way, like you would a child), I realize that I might legitimately cry. \n\nMy worst fear is to ever be the cause of someone‚Äôs pain. I try to make it as obvious as possible that I thrive lighting up people‚Äôs day. My policy this year has been to never meet a stranger. And this girl, who ran off because I tried to diffuse a lengthy discussion about her seemingly failing butt workout routine with a flat joke, now probably has boundaries up for being my friend. \n\nI didn‚Äôt even look at her butt before making the joke. Hell, I can‚Äôt even remember what it looks like (but it sure wasn‚Äôt flat). I apologized to her but I still feel bad as shit. Am I an asshole?\n\nEdit: A week later. She thought I said ‚Äúfat.‚Äù",

      "description": "Some context here; my younger sister (21) recently came home from a 6 month work placement abroad. She has a lot of stories about her time there (understandable) but really talks about nothing else but that, at any given opportunity \n\nA few weeks ago we decided to watch a film altogether as a family. It was quite an emotional and dramatic film about a man suffering from depression (it's Manchester by the sea for anyone who's seen it). In the middle of quite a pivotal and poignant scene, my sister asks me to pause it, in a way that suggests it's something urgent. This wasn't at a scene change or even at a pause for a drink etc, but smack bang in the middle of an important scene.\n\n\"MARIA'S CAT has died!\" \n\nNow it turns out this is someone who she barely knew abroad, and I hadn't even heard mentioned before. Also,our family are not cat or even animal people:. I clearly don't want harm brought to them but in all seriousness I don't care about someone I've never met and their old cat dying.\n\nI was quite annoyed that she'd interrupted this emotional scene. If it'd been a crappy comedy or she'd waited until a proper break, it wouldn't have wound me up, but this isn't the first time she's done this. She sometimes will just  start playing  videos on her phone with the sound on during  films and her usual excuse is \"well, I'm not watching properly anyway\" as if that's a justification? I had a bit of a go at her, saying \"could that not have waited?\" to which she got annoyed and said I didn't care about anything but whatever I'm focussed on. I argued it was ruder to stop a film to announce a minor acquaintance's pet dying.\n\nMy dad didn't fully take sides but said I was quite mean about it, but I think my point stands and that it's a case of picking your moments of when to announce things like that.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Long-ish!!! Apologies &amp; huge thanks in advance for anyone who makes it through!!\n\nWe've been together for \\~3 years, live together, &amp; are deeply in love, but this is an argument I am very conflicted about &amp; I'd really appreciate an independent opinion. For context, he works Mon-Thu 9-5 at a stressful office job for a multi-national, multi-billion dollar company. He has been there for 5 years or so, is now a manager, &amp; makes 3+ times the amount I do. I am doing my PhD, am in my third &amp; final year, and I work largely from home. I have a supervision about once a month, and this is the extent of the conversation I have about my work with other people. I've tried talking to him about my work before (my PhD is in literature, and he is a reader, so it's ostensibly something he might be into), but he's never particularly interested and I'm not bothered enough about it to keep trying. I'm happy to just keep ploughing away, it doesn't really define me as a person and we both have plenty of shared interests/hobbies to talk about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo recently, he has started a new role on a new project at his job. His old position had lasted 2 years, when usually roles in his company last only a couple of months. He got very good at it &amp; by the end was incredibly bored. He wasn't being challenged and was really struggling to find the motivation, so when he was offered this new role we were both ecstatic. His days seem much busier &amp; every day he comes home enthused about what he has been doing and tells me all about it. After having spent the whole day alone, I really relish these chats and make him a cup of tea so we can both sit together and debrief when he gets in. As with anything, there are bits I find more interesting than others: he is very science-minded and often tells me in great detail about certain structural or organisational issues which I nod and smile though, but he is also a very warm, caring person and has a lot of pastoral care responsibilities, which I find a lot more interesting. Today, for instance, he was telling me about how he was helping someone in his care at work who is having a difficult time personally, and I told him how impressed I was at how he had handled it &amp; we spent roughly 20 minutes discussing the other the ways he could help this person. His line of work can be very cold &amp; exploitative, and I am infinitely proud of the compassionate, caring environment he creates for the people in his care &amp; the extracurricular work he does on mental health care. After this, he started talking to me about a sticky organisational task he has been working on for a couple of weeks, which he truncated with \"which I've done a really good job on\". He's very self-assured &amp; has pretty great self-esteem, so thinking this was a bit braggy I replied, \"oh, if you do say so yourself?\"\n\nAnd this is where the argument begins. Extra context: I am having a difficult time with my depression/anxiety at the moment. I am burnt out, am having significant issues with a psychiatric referral mix up and side effects from new medication, and am finding it's really affecting my productivity. The new anti-anxiety medication has completely ruined my sleep cycle, and as a result today after a sleepless night &amp; an uncomfortable medical procedure at the doctor's in the morning, I came home, decided to have a 30 minute nap to try &amp; recoup some energy for the afternoon's writing, and ended up sleeping through my alarm until around 4.30pm. I have a big meeting tomorrow and am now feeling extremely guilty/anxious about admitting to them I haven't been as productive as I should have been recently. My partner knows all about this, and is as always very understanding/helpful.\n\nSo, my partner begins telling me that actually, this organisational project IS really important, and he was disappointed that I wasn't more enthusiastic when he'd initially told me he'd finished it a few days ago. I apologised, saying I hadn't realised it was that significant as he hadn't really explained it fully. He offered to do so there &amp; then, but I said it was okay I would just take his word for it. At this point, we'd been talking about his day for half an hour or so as we were cooking/doing the washing up, and in honesty I was cranky from my unplanned nap, and a little bored of being talked at. He asked why not, and I said because it didn't really matter and I would just find learning about the nitty gritty of this situation dull. This, I admit, was rude of me. I apologised, but I couldn't in honesty take it back. I DO find it dull. I really enjoy listening to the ways he helps and cares for other people at work, and I'm always interested to hear about what his co-workers I have met &amp; know have been up to, but at the end of the day where I've been staring at books for 8 hours or just feeling guilty and unaccomplished, hearing him bigging up what an amazing job he's doing with an important Excel spreadsheet isn't my idea of relaxing. I try not to drone on to him about my work, because fundamentally it will always be less interesting to other people than it is to me, and that's okay. Also, as he has been busier recently his evenings have been very packed - we chat when he gets in, then he usually does a workout, showers, organises his lunch for the next day while I cook, and after we eat he plays video games to wind down until late, so I have been feeling a little neglected, and a bit desperate for some quality time together NOT talking about work or doing work ready for the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA? My head is so fogged with this depression slump &amp; new medication that I'm not sure if I'm just wholly in the wrong here. I feel very guilty for not being completely selfless and revelling in his success with him, and I feel like perhaps I feel jealous or as if he is \"rubbing it in my face\", which of course is wrong and a selfish way of seeing it, but I also feel that he is being unreasonable in his expectations of me, and maybe a little insensitive. Completely happy to hear any &amp; all opinions, &amp; TIA!!!!",

      "description": "I am considered the psychiatrist of my group of friends. Most of them will come to me with what it troubling them and I do my best to give them honest and helpful advice. However, there's one friend in my group, lets call her Claire, with way more baggage than I can handle. Claire has a problem where she keeps getting herself into relationships that are doomed to fail and goes back to the same guy multiple times. Over this past weekend a guy, let's call him Mike, that has rejected her multiple times once again \"played her\" as she would put it. So I did my best to comfort her and told her that she needs to mature and realise that she is getting herself into these situations. Well the next day Claire calls me and tells me how her, Mike, and another guy we know, let's call him Dave, all broke into Dave's old house to get drunk. Now Claire's on antidepressants and recently got a new prescription for a different brand which apparently doesn't mix well with alcohol. She proceeded to tell me how she had blacked out to the point of not being able to move and almost stopped breathing, the other people there had to call her mother to come pick her up because she was so messed up. While they're meeting her mom the cops arrive and threaten to arrest them all for public intoxity and breaking and entering. In the end they let them go after calling an ambulance to check up on her and Dave had to drive her car to her house and carry her inside to her bed. She tells me this story with an air of bragging and even goes as far as joking that she couldn't have protected herself. Needless, I didnt have much to say except I'm glad she's ok and she needs to be more careful. Later on in the day my best friend, how about Jessie, which is also one of Claire's friends, calls and I end up telling her the story that I was told. What I didn't know is that Jessie' s boyfriend was in the car with her and heard the conversation. The next day, I get a message from Claire that I betrayed her and it wasn't any of my business to tell her business. She proceeds to insult me and Jessie and in the end I just stop responding until I can get the full story. The reason she is angry is because Jessie's boyfriend knows, which is the only person that knows except me and Jessie, then I find out later that she was planning to tell Jessie's boyfriend anyway and him saying something about it as she was telling him is the reason she is mad.\n\nThis ended up being way longer than I thought so I made a super short TL;DR.\n\nTL;DR I told my best friend someone else's story about almost dying and now she is mad because the other persons boyfriend knows about it even though they were planning on telling him anyway.\n\nHad to repost because of inappropriate wording.",

I notice this when I make a joke at work when she happens to be in a bad mood (which is...often) and she snaps at me, but will use the same or similar joke the next day.\n\nJackie also is one of those girls who probably fits in the r/nicegirls category, and she extremely critical or her own weight and appearance.

For context, she is very pretty and actually really skinny, skinnier than me. It leads to insecurity issues for both of us. Sometimes she makes me think that if she thinks these bad things about HERSELF, what's stopping her from thinking these things about me?\n\nI've been trying to implement some \"house rules\" to try and get her to be kinder to herself, such as correcting her when she says something bad about herself to something positive. \n\nOne of her friends found out and called me manipulative, and said that if I was really Jackie's friend I'd accept her \"quirks\" (might not be the exact phrase, it was a couple days ago) and it really shook me.

      "description": "Sorry in advance for the essay, but here goes.\n\n  \n\nSo for some context, I am a second-year university student in what most would call an intensive and exclusive major program (3% of applicants get in). I live at home - because dorming is an expense neither me nor my mother want to take on, and my mom works in administration; her salary isn‚Äôt ridiculous, but with that plus my grandparents‚Äô pension, it‚Äôs enough for us (me, her, and grandparents) to live fairly comfortably in a middle-class neighborhood. Unfortunately this means we get very little, if any, financial aid from the university, but in my opinion it‚Äôs better to be over that earnings cutoff than below it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my mom has always been very grade-focused, expecting nothing but As throughout my academic career (which I deliver for the most part), and in return, she is very generous with money when it comes to me. When I started university, she told me to just live at home and focus on school, and she would pay for tuition, books, gas for commuting, food, etc. And so, I did just that. I have a credit card connected to my mom that I use for the things listed above, and a debit card connected to my own bank account with which I pay for random stuff I want, outings with friends, and anything really that is ‚Äúextracurricular‚Äù. I‚Äôll admit, on occasion I‚Äôll pay for clothes or something like that on my mom‚Äôs dime, but I also pay for some of my textbooks and around half the food I eat on campus myself, so I think it‚Äôs pretty even. Recently, my friends have been saying that my mom has been telling them she is going to make me get a part time job soon, but she‚Äôs giving me time to find one on my own before she intervenes. I‚Äôm not entirely sure what I‚Äôll say when the time comes, but I know for a fact that I don‚Äôt really want a part-time job at the moment, and for a couple reasons. The first is that I don‚Äôt think I would be able to handle it with my current courses without a marked decrease in my grades or my physical health; last semester I was able to pull off mostly As, but I was constantly staying up late during the week either doing homework or studying, only giving myself the weekend to de-stress a bit and then prepare for the week ahead by watching lectures and taking notes in advance. If I had to juggle a part-time job on top of that, I‚Äôm worried I just wouldn‚Äôt have enough time in the day to do everything I need to do, given that my classes run right through the middle of the day, so I would have to work at night barring weekends, and this semester especially, since I have two classes in particular that run six hours long. Second, I‚Äôm not really in dire need of money right now. I work about 6 hours a week for a family friend, which I am able to do because the hours are super flexible, and it just so happens to pay well enough for me to cover whatever personal expenses I have. My mom has argued with me many times that it isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù, because, and I quote, ‚Äúother people don‚Äôt depend on me to be there‚Äù, and so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still stuck in this predicament. In my opinion, if I‚Äôm performing a task and receiving money in return, that‚Äôs a job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf my mom told me to get a job because she wanted me to pay rent or all my school fees all of a sudden, I would understand that logic, and I guess I would be forced to try and work something out, but as it stands, I feel like I‚Äôm just playing the cards I‚Äôve been dealt, and I‚Äôm assuming she just wants me to be more productive, which I feel I already am, just not in the form of cashiering at Target (not that anything is wrong with that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat‚Äôs about it, AITA Reddit? I‚Äôm not entirely sure if I‚Äôm within my rights or if I‚Äôm a spoiled kid taking advantage of mom, so I‚Äôm counting on you to judge me. Also if anything is unclear, I can answer questions/give more info.",

I keep asking her for reasons why, and *eventually* she gives me two answers:   \n  \n‚Ä¢ She can't get home in time(work for her had ended an hour before, and she went out of her way to grab food before)  \n‚Ä¢ She's scared to let him in an Uber himself(at his age, I was Ubering myself around, at their request.

One of my friends, I'll call him \\*Rico, asks if I can take him to the Jack's house when I decide to go. I agreed to it. Rico calls me around noon and asks me when I want to go, I tell him vaguely that we'll go in a little bit but not too long, and that I have to change my oil first. After I get off the phone with him, I decided to take a nap before I changed my oil because I've been sick for a while and was feeling particularly tired. I end up sleeping for way too long, (four hours) and obviously Rico is very upset when I call him back. I explain my situation to him and that I did not intentionally mean to waste his time because I wasn't planning on sleeping for that long. I sincerely apologize and tell him that his drinks are on me. Now, Rico's at Jack's house with some of my other friends, and I'm basically not allowed to go and have a good time because of my mistake and Rico does not want me there. This whole thing might sound petty, but I was really looking forward to getting drunk and letting go tonight. Now I'm just at home, very flustered, and writing this post. Am I still the asshole in this situation? And is it justified for me to be exiled from hanging out?

When I take too many of my anxiety pills/antidepressants, I start having horrible symptoms like hallucinations, disphoria, dizziness, and a lot more (It's only a specific one, not all of them). I don't usually take them at all. But, I took it because I get anxiety in tight spaces. \n\nBasically, we were having a road trip. We all took turns driving my dad's old van. I took four of my pills because I forgot about the other two that I took. I mentioned this to everyone but they still wanted me to drive. It started getting worse while driving. I was fading in and out, everyone laughing at me sounded like Alvin from the chimpmunks movie. I just wasn't feeling it. They told me that I was saying random things and that I started to act intoxicated. Then, fast forward, it was dark and I thought I saw myself jump in front of the car or something. So, you guessed it, I swerved extremely fast. I ended up crashing the car into a post. I don't remember much after that. They called the cops I guess. The told the cop everything. I went to the hospital temporarily. They let me out because I didn't want to go to rehab or anything. \n\nFast forward, everyone is butt hurt about it and I couldn't care less. All of them keep throwing sneak disses my way and giving snarky remarks like, 'Don't take too many of your pills this time.', 'Is it okay for you to drive or are you gonna attempt to murder us again.' (All of this was today). They've witnessed many incidents with me on my medication. They know I have anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. I even warned all of them about the bad symptoms when I take too much. I just wanted to ask Reddit if I was actually even in the wrong with any of this. ",

So judge away I guess. ",

      "description": "Hi All.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst real post here on Reddit, so please bear with me :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay. So I (21M) have been dating my girlfriend (let's call her Sarah) for about four months now. We get along really well and are pretty similar with just enough differences for it to be interesting. We were both also cheated on during our previous relationships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday I hung out with arguably my best friend (20F - lets call her Kate) and we grabbed some lunch and saw a movie. My girlfriend saw this on social media and understandably (or not) freaked out. My phone was on silent for most of the day, so when I checked it after I got home I saw that I had a near dozen messages. She was asking who the hell this girl was and why am I alone with her? As I mentioned earlier, we were both cheated on by our previous partners, so I can see where she is coming from. I explained to her that I have known Kate for almost my entire life. We grew up across the road from each other and have always been close. I was careful to stress that this is a strictly platonic relationship and neither of us are romantically interested in the other. But Sarah still didn't like this. She told me that it makes her feel uncomfortable to see me alone with other girls and wouldn't like me to do that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I said, I have known Kate my whole life. So I told her that, no, she is my friend and I want to hang out with her. I also pointed out the fact that she has guy friends whom she hangs out with as well. If the situation was reversed, would she be feeling the same? Bad move. She has pretty much ignored me all day and her friend messaged calling me an arsehole for not being receptive to her feelings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit. Am I right here or AITA for not being sensitive to her feelings? I really like this girl but this feels like a deal breaker to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Hung out with my female best friend. Girl friend freaked out and asked me to not be alone with females (cheated on in previous relationship). I told her no and now she is super pissed at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I am in my first year of university and am living in ‚Äòhalls‚Äô, the way the housing is set out is a house of twelve people over three floors with four people on each floor. I live on the top floor, generally quite quiet, about three times a week there will be noise from people when it‚Äôs a night where people go out. My room is next to a girls room who goes to bed early, between 10:30 and 11:30 (I would consider this early, any noise has almost always stopped by 00:30) every night, at this time I will usually be watching a film and/or talking with a friend in my room. I have been consistently getting messages asking me to stop, keep it down or simply to go somewhere else as she‚Äôs trying to get to sleep. All requests I would gladly do if I was being excessively loud, shouting, laughing hysterically, screaming etc. She likes complete silence when she‚Äôs trying to sleep and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I need to stop my life to accommodate 100% for her. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there have been a handful of times where I have understood her request for me to keep it down when I have gotten carried away but I feel it‚Äôs a getting a little ridiculous, what are you expecting living in halls? \n\nInitially I felt so guilty about it but I‚Äôm starting to get fed up of it and want to know AITA, and if I am what you‚Äôd recommend and if I‚Äôm not, how I go about speaking to her, I hate confrontation and can be quite socially awkward. Other than this situation, I love her to pieces and she‚Äôs one of my favourite people that I know at Uni but I can tell this is effecting our friendship. ",

      "description": "So I (20 F) have been wanting to travel all over Europe as long as I can remember but never really had the means to do so &amp; plus always had work &amp; school. My parents are supportive but always talked me out of it because of money issues.  I‚Äòm finally able to go for about a month &amp; a half &amp; asked a few of my friends if they wanted to join but because of their schedules or money no one is able to tag along with me. (Understandable) so I figured I‚Äôd just go by myself. I was a bit iffy on that but as I‚Äôve been researching &amp; talking to people my mindset has completely changed &amp; I‚Äôve become really excited about the idea of solo travel. Now most of my trip is just me but I might meet a few people I know out there. My family isn‚Äôt too happy about me going by myself but I‚Äôm not going to not go because others can‚Äôt; otherwise I‚Äôd never end up going.\n\nOut of nowhere a (distant) cousin of mine said she might join me on my trip. I had mixed emotions cause cool I would have someone I know with me but also I was really excited to travel solo. I figured my parents or brother told her about it but I wasn‚Äôt thinking too much into it. Come to find out the reason she is interested is cause my dad &amp; brother offered to pay for part of her trip so I don‚Äôt go solo. \n\nI‚Äôm annoyed because they did this without asking me &amp; also cause they were so big on us not having enough money to travel yet they‚Äôre giving her money when they could have helped me out instead????  No one offered to help me when I talked about it. When I think about it I feel so bratty &amp; selfish but I‚Äôm kinda hurt by this. Am I overreacting? AITA??",

The other place was an hour on a bus away. \n\nI'm at home for that part so I get a lift in later too the second place and when I get into the car I find out the place has changed again as we're not going with his co-workers. My friend waited outside this 3rf place for nearly an hour to go in with me and when I get in him his girlfriend and my girlfriend aren't speaking. \n\nThe night goes by and my friend walks off after having what looked like a 'heated debate' do I go and try to cool him off. I get back and my girlfriend starts talking to him and he walks off again. \n\nHer point of view was that he messed them around. His point of view was that it wasn't his fault his co-workers changed the plans and he had apologised for it. \n\nI tried to get them to see each others points of view but they both just seemed to get annoyed at me. \n\nThe part I think I'm an asshole for was I left pretty drunk with my gifriend and when we got out of the taxi it turned into some huge screaming match where she would give out to me for siding with him and not listening to her and I called her a selfish bitch (regretted) for not allowing me to speak. I ended up walking away so I could write down what ai wanted to say because she didn't seem to listen to me. \n\nAm I the peacekeeper I was trying to be? Or AITA playing both sides? \n",

This is around the time I started dating my current boyfriend.\nI love sex, and my boyfriend does as well. However, my boyfriend can't stand the idea of having sex with me while I'm bleeding.\nExcept, he never complains, really. He only ever jokes about it.\nHe has been allowed to sleep with other girls for about 2 years now, but he never did. We sometimes resort to a.. different kind of penetration (Don't want to make this post to crude. But you know what I mean) when I have been bleeding for a really really long time. I'm honestly fine with that, and he is as well, but it's just not the same as the real thing, and I really really miss it. \nI really want to respect his wishes and boundaries, and I would never ever force myself upon him, I'm just frustrated at times.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking my boyfriend is a bit asshole-ey for not wanting to have sex with me while I'm on my period?\n\nTldr; I'm always on my period and I want to have sex with my boyfriend, but he doesn't and I think that is a bit of a dick move.

      "description": "I am a senior in College now living with a few roommates. One of the roommates and I hang out a decent amount and I know he likes to gamble, and is possibly addicted. Yesterday, he came into my room and asked If i wanted to play Fifa and bet on it with him; I agreed. Ive played him before and I know i am a lot better than he is. We began playing $5 games which escalted to $35 on each game by the end. After playing for like 3 hours, I only lost one game and I won $200 off of him. He graduated a semester early so he has to pay loans, rent and other shit but he only makes $14/hour at his full time job. I feel bad because he told me he can barely afford to eat now, which is definitely an exaggeration but still I feel bad. Should I give him back some, if not all, of the money or should this be used as a lesson. ",

      "description": "last year I took up a new job at a restaurant working in the eveningsTo give you an idea of the place, it was a small restaurant of about 12 tables plus we take phone orders, online orders and do delivery. The front of house is expected to  open the shop, tske bookings, seat tables, put through the online orders, answer phone orders, take orders, make drinks and deserts, clean the restaurant, clean all dishes, do the end if day accounts and shut the shop, and most days out of the week there would be one person doing it all by themself.\n first my boss was really lovely to me, saying I was picking things up well. Then about a month in, her whole demeanor completely. After this point any mistake I made she came down on me like a ton of bricks.\n‚Ä¢ After being shown how to do something once I was expected to remember.\n‚Ä¢ Anytime i did ask how to do something she acted like I was an idiot. \n‚Ä¢ If I was doing close she expected me to reset the restaurant do closing procedures in half an hour. \n‚Ä¢ She would speak so nicely to the other waitress, then when i attempted to talk to her she was cold.\n\nAfter a while she had me convinced that I was just a shit employee who didn't know how to do anything. One night I was speaking to the other waitress who they adored, and she reassured me that their expectations were somewhat unreasonable. My boyfriend would try and comfort me by saying that if i was really that awful then why hasn't thid happened at other places i worked.\n\nThen I was contacted for a trial at a new restaurant . After the trial I agreed to do some more shifts with them. I told my old boss i needed a week off I wad planning on talking with her later in the week about leaving. I was afraid of her response as one of the waitresses was still working 3 months after she was meant to leave becauseour boss guilted her into staying and hadn't bothered finding someone else. \nWell wouldn't you know it, my first proper shift at this restaurant and who decides to go have lunch there? My old boss,i can tell she isn't happy.\n\nA week later we organise to meet up and talk. I wanted to go in there and meet halfway, saying that I'm sorry things went out this way and I should've handled it better but here's why I felt i had to do what did. \nShe said I left her understaffed when i knew she didn't have a babysitter for her child and couldn't be there all the time. When i said I wasn't going to leave things that way she rolled her eyes and told me it looked different from whete she was sitting and it didn't look good on my character, despite never being late for a shift and constantly picking them up when she was short. When I tried to point out what I felt was unfair, she would just say how i wasn't suited to this role. Towards the end she just cut me off.\nThroughout the whole time I worked for her i never once received a pay slip and was not payed penalty rates. I could report her to the fairwork commission for this. However a part of me feels petty.",

      "description": "Context: I‚Äôve lived with my boyfriend for about a year and a half. He‚Äôs wonderful and so far living together has been some of the best times of my life. He‚Äôs 27 and I‚Äôm 25. We don‚Äôt really have arguments but one of the only things that seems to really bother him in our relationship is the fact that I don‚Äôt do my own taxes. My father has always been the one who handles finances in my family so every year I give him the necessary paperwork and forms and he just files it for me. He does this for everyone in my family (including my grandma, siblings, and mother) because although he is not diagnosed my siblings and I are convinced he has some level of OCD or anxiety and likes for things to be very particular and done ‚Äúhis way‚Äù. I never complained or put up a fight about it because I don‚Äôt see a reason to have to worry about doing my own taxes when my dad is more than willing to do it for me. If my dad one day did decide that he didn‚Äôt want to file my taxes for me than I would be more than willing to suck it up and do it myself. Last year during tax season my boyfriend unexpectedly freaked out when he heard me talking over the phone with my mom telling her I mailed dad my W2s and got very upset when I confronted him about it. I never gave it much thought but he‚Äôs outright told me that he thinks it‚Äôs really weird that my dad does this for me and that I‚Äôm so dependent on him. I see where he‚Äôs coming from, but I thought he was being way too dramatic about the whole thing. While he‚Äôs not estranged from his family, he is not close with his parents and moved out when he was 17 and is very independent (I on the other hand am very close to my family and didn‚Äôt move out until I was 23) so again I can see why this confuses him.\n\nA few days ago I received my W2s for this tax year. My boyfriend made an offhand comment about if I was planning to do my own taxes this year to which I told him that I was probably just going to let my dad file them again this year. He immediately got huffy and kept asking me over and over again why I just didn‚Äôt do my own and that he would be happy to show me how. I explained that I didn‚Äôt want to have to worry about it and that‚Äôs it‚Äôs just easier to have my dad do them for me. He then asked if I didn‚Äôt trust him enough to show me how to properly file my taxes and asked what I would do if we got married. This threw me off. Of course I trust him, he‚Äôs been doing his own taxes since he was 17 and of course if we got married I‚Äôd file our taxes together, but no matter how many times I tried to explain myself he didn‚Äôt seem to understand that this is just a matter of convenience and it‚Äôs so much easier to let my dad handle it than worry with it myself and then have my dad fret over whether or not it was filed properly. He then stormed off to the bedroom effectively ending the conversation. We‚Äôve been tiptoeing around the subject and haven‚Äôt talked about it since.\n\nSo I don‚Äôt know. Am I the asshole for not letting him help me with my taxes and just sending it to my dad to take care of, or is he reading way too much into the whole situation? Please help.",

He then says I shouldn't be angry because \"if someone does something nice for you and fails you should still be thankful\" to which I respond \"you didn't fail, you're choosing to not cook for me\"\n\n    Then of course I call him an asshole which just made the whole fight about me insulting him when he's \"trying to be nice\" blah blah. His other argument is that I like my eggs and bacon a certain way and he's never made them that way. But like.....learn?

      "title": "AITA for Thinking My Friend Should Have Checked in on Me?",
      "description": "Background; my friend, one other person, and I are in a group chat where we talk rather consistently every day. The friend in question and I have been friends for around three years, and have talked pretty much every day for around two. She is, however, recently went totally silent in the chat for around a week and a half. During that time, I‚Äôve had multiple really shitty things happen that I would have really liked someone to empathize with me or at least acknowledge me in any way, including my dog regrowing lumps in areas where she‚Äôd had cancer, getting them removed, and then going to the animal hospital a day later because she scratched the stitches out, and a call from a debt collector saying that my father who left home (and subsequently died) owed 7,000 dollars to a credit card company, and that it now falls on my family to pay it, etc. etc. I posted all these things in the chat, because I would have liked some kind of outreach of support, as, I think, friends ought to do for one another. The friend in question has been online fairly frequently (around once every 15 minutes for a few minutes whenever she isn‚Äôt at work), and has read everything I‚Äôve posted, and said nothing. I wasn‚Äôt incessantly spamming these messages, but just went over what happened. This was included with a few messages I sent her in dms, like wishing her a happy Thanksgiving, that were also read but unresponded to. I checked in on her to question what was going on, because I felt a bit abandoned.  \nThe sides:  \nHer side: She says, that very basically, she hasn‚Äôt felt up to talking. That sometimes, she loses pretty much all of her emotional energy, and closes herself off to everyone but her and her immediate family, and that we‚Äôve talked about this before, and it just hasn‚Äôt come up this way, and that I was acting rather dramatically by coming to her about it, given that we‚Äôve established that she can be (or just is) very emotionally unavailable. That she‚Äôs here for me in case of emergencies, but that she spends basically all of her energy on trying to fix her life and maintaining her relationships with her family, and doesn‚Äôt have the energy to check in on friends or reach out when she knows they‚Äôre not having an easy time. She likened it to a person feeling unable to get out of bed in the morning or take showers when suffering from a depressive episode. Additionally, she finds that the conversation lacked any purpose or solvency, because I can‚Äôt change the way I feel about her doing that, and she can‚Äôt change the fact that she just doesn‚Äôt have the emotional investment to be there.   \nMy side:  \nMy side basically boils down to that I never asked her to have an entire conversation with me or pour over every detail of what was going on in my life, but that after being friends for as long as we have, it felt very shitty for her to say she lacked any emotional energy whatsoever to leave me on read while she was very consistently online while I very evidently would have just liked a ‚Äúthat sucks, I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù or ‚Äúthat sounds difficult.‚Äù   \nI acknowledge that, even though usually we talk every day, sometimes she just isn‚Äôt up for it. And that generally, she‚Äôs a very emotionally unavailable person to people outside of her family. But I think that claiming that a word of encouragement for a friend, or maybe a reciprocation of well-wishes (as in happy Thanksgiving), takes so much emotional energy that she just can‚Äôt do it, is dramatic at best, and seems rather selfish or fickle at worst. I suggested to her that, the same way that many depressed people find cognitive strategies to at least go through the motions of a normal day, her emotional unavailability may not lack the solvency that she says it does, and that much of it may be her own thought processes. Which, again, isn‚Äôt to say that she owes me the energy to hold conversations every day or anything, but that at the point where she closes herself off for now weeks at a time, where she can‚Äôt find the energy to extend any sort of sympathy toward anything that was going on, it becomes a barrier to the friendship where I don‚Äôt feel as though she‚Äôs trying to show she cares.  \nAfter around a three hour conversation on the topic, we both went silent and haven‚Äôt said anything since. I‚Äôd like to know if I‚Äôm the one in the wrong here, because I‚Äôd like to repair things between us as soon as possible. So, AITA? ",

It's our first real relationship for either of us so I'm a bit apprehensive of doing something to mess it up. We're not exactly GF/BF as of yet but it's heading that way, so semi serious I guess?\n\nAnyway, the problem arises cause I recently got a text from a guy I went to school with. He's left now, and I'd say we were kind of friends? We got on well in school, but we never really hung out outside of that. He's one of those guys who has a kind of flirty personality.\n\nLast time I saw him was at a mutual friend's party. He was kinda drunk, I was sober and we hung out all night because my friend I came with ditched me. It was fun, and I was grateful to have someone to talk to. However, I heard afterwards that he kinda liked me, although I don't even know if that's true. We chatted for a bit online the next day, but the convo died and I haven't talked to him in 6 months.\n\nOut of the blue, he texted me and asked if I was up for meeting up. I think it's pretty unlikely that he still likes me, seeing as we haven't talked in 6 months, but others have said he might be looking at it as a date. I don't know why he wants to meet up seeing as we're not close. I'm honestly a bit worried about him cause of some of the stuff he's posted. WIBTA for going? Do I need to explain all this to the current guy? WIBTA if I didn't?",

      "description": "Throwaway account, of course.\n\nThis happened on new years of last year, so January 1st 2018, and ever since I've gotten mixed opinions from others on whether or not ITA.\n\nMe and my girlfriend had been on and off for a couple weeks, and planned to go to a New Years Eve Party. I hate parties, I'm super introverted and get nervous. She then told me how she was sexually assaulted months ago at a party. I was super supportive of her and proud of her for being so strong and nearly completely overcoming that event. She said she felt unsafe going to another party and I assured her I'd be there to make sure she's safe, along with the other friends that were going with us.\n\nWe get to the party at around 10pm and it's whatever, I'm not tired or nervous or anything yet. About half in hour in everyones having a good time and drinking, I was not, however, since I was the driver. Time goes by and she starts to do thing that get on my nerves. Generally being loud, trying to kiss other people, talking about others she'd like to bang etc etc. Ball drops, we kiss, and she goes back to being crazy. I'm having a decent time actually, I'm talking to other people. Her and I start to argue outside quietly, for a couple minutes, we go back in and she avoids me. Around 1:30 am I decide its time for me to go, I'm getting anxious and tired and all that. I say bye to everyone, and make my way home. Go to sleep, wake up, and she's beyond pissed at me for leaving her. Asking how I could leave her she couldve been taken advantage of again, fuck you, youre terrible etc etc. \n\nNow when I decided to leave the party it wasnt because we were fighting, just tired and anxious. The thought didnt cross my mind that she would be mad at me in the morning for leaving early. And I told her I couldnt do parties for long. I didnt just leave her to be taken advantage of either, I left her with her sober friends who NEVER let her out of their site. I also told them if they needed ANYTHING to call me and I'll come help them with whatever. I personally feel like im NTA because I left her with her responsible, sober, friends who didnt let her out of their site.\n\nI've told this story to quite a few people and it seems like it's a fifty fifty split on opinions.

      "description": "My boyfriend isn't so great at gift giving. I try really hard not to care, he's incredibly caring and wonderful in every other way, but he just does not give gifts well. He will either spend months handmaking something beautiful for me, which is amazing and I love every thing he makes, or he wont have time and just get me nothing at all.\n\nFor my birthday this year, he gave me a very pretty bead and yarn braclet, which I do really like, but nothing else, but I was really just glad he got me something. Last year he didn't get me anything, felt horrible when I mentioned it which made me feel horrible and then insisted he would get me something later but never did. Then I mentioned Id love just a day to go do something together like a museum, and he said thats great and then we never did anything. If I mention anything about it at all he usually will get super upset with himself, promise me something, then never get me anything, and then I feel horrible and won't bring it up again because if I do ever it's a big thing and he will be depressed about it for days.\n\nThis year was a big anniversary and we went on a trip and I got him a kind of pricey necklace because I knew he would love it and it meant a lot to him. He loves it and wears it all the time, and again didn't get me anything but said oh I'll get you something nice too while we are on the trip. He didn't, and valentiens is about a month after anniversary, so I sent him a link to a necklace I liked and mentioned if he wanted to get me a anniversary or valentien's gift, I like this necklace. \n\nWell we were talking today about what to do for valentien's, and I mentioned the gift I got him was running late and would be there the day after valentiens and I was sorry, and he said oh well your necklace isnt here either, and I was like oh thats sweet he actually got it but then he mentioned how it was a combination anniversary and valentien's gift and I was like.... I mean, I thought it would be for one of those, not both, and then he got upset over not getting me a good enough gift and I just feel like shit for even mentioning it, but this is the 10th time we have had this conversation about just valentien's, not to mention anniversary and birthdays. The necklace was the same cost as the one I got him, but I also got him a nice valentien's gift and his birthday is a few days later and I got him a nice gift for that too. It really isn't even about money or cost, I literally just want anything he picked out to show that he thought about it at all in advance. Our first valentien's day was our first fight because he didn'teven get me cheap chocolate, and we both worked at a grocery store and we literally surrounded by chocolate and stuffed animals and cards for months. \n\nI feel like an asshole for sounding like im ungrateful for his gifts, but he doesn't try to pick things out for me or anything, even if its inexpensive he says he worries I wont like something he chooses so he just gets me nothing. But he sort of got me a gift this one time and I feel like an asshole for mentioning the forgotten anniversary gift at all.\n\nPlus the gifts dont mean much when he only gets them because he feels guilty, months later. I worry I spoiled valentiens day already by mentioning that I thought the necklace was for our anniversarry, but he did promise to get me something nice and got me excited for it the whole trip and then just dropped it.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for sending a text to BF's Mom asking for her to not make jabs at our diets?",
      "description": "My boyfriend‚Äôs (let's call him C) Mom and I recently had a little fight.\n\nWe have differing views on health and nutrition and since my doctor told me to go on a special diet, my boyfriend and I dropped sugar and started working out.\n\nFor reference, we both look and feel great now.\n\nHis Mom is an avid gym-goer and takes her nutrition very seriously. Even if we have some differing views.\n\nA few out of many incidences that occurred. \n\n* C and I started drinking milk for calories and protein (due to heavy lifting). After she found out, on a few instances she made a point of either making a funny face when we had milk, calling it disgusting, and going on about why she would never have it, and that she was worried for her son (We had been drinking it for at least 1 month by that point).\n\n* When I went sugar free, the mother and I were just talking about health related things, as we sometimes do, when I jokingly added, \"at least I can still have pizza\". To which she responded: \"going sugar free but still having pizza doesn't make a healthy lifestyle.\" She obviously didn't get the humor. I had to clarify I meant \"once in a while\", but she didn't seem to hear that part.\n\n* C and I had a cheat day, and we were telling her about it. And telling her how awful we felt. To which she replied, \"If you feel guilty for eating foods you like, that's not healthy\". I clarified that we just didn't feel good physically. Her comment was confusing to me, as she completely shot me down when I jokingly mentioned pizza. Mixed messages. \n\n\n* At one point I decided to have a cheat snack, a bag of kit kats that C and I split. I assume she must have seen them in my hand, because a few days later, she brings it up, ‚ÄúOh I see you‚Äôre having some sugary snacks‚Äù and ‚Äúhow often do you do that‚Äù and ‚Äúhow many of those have you had?‚Äù To that last comment, when I paused to think about the serving size, she took that as, defeat? Because she laughed. She laughed. Then we all laughed. But man did that feel hurtful. Almost like she was targeting me, trying to \"unveil\" me in front of others.\n\n* A few days later, back at the dinner table, C is eating his chicken. Normally he doesn't, because he isn't a meat person. I jokingly mention that maybe the KFC chicken we recently tried might have encouraged him. His mom picks up on this and says, \"oh you'll eat KFC but you won't eat sugar?\" Again. Jab. So I asked her if she really wanted to start another food debate, she was like \"nah\".\n\n\nNever before had she been making these comments when our diets were so bad that we had to go to doctors just to figure out what was wrong with our GI systems. \n\nThe final straw was when my boyfriend got stopped by his mom on his way to our room and said the following: \n‚ÄúHave you been eating out a lot lately? I hear you‚Äôve been eating out lately. Has it been KFC? You know that‚Äôs deep fried and full of chemicals, right? You‚Äôre looking like crap and this needs to stop.‚Äù\nMy boyfriend, being a bit of a pacifist says ‚ÄúUnderstood‚Äù and makes his way to his room.\n\nAs soon as he gets in, he tells me all about this as previous small things had been discussed related to this behavior.\n\nI wanted to clear up some things with her so I sent the following text:\n&gt; Hey! C and I were just talking, and he mentioned that you thought he looked really tired and unwell, and maybe it has something to do with our diets. He didn't have the energy to bring it up, as he is tired. This week,  due to daylight savings, the days being gloomy and short in general, and stress from school, both of us have been feeling eh. Oh and we haven't had the chance to meal prep our lunches, which isnt ideal to us believe me. C also had that trip with Joe, in which they spent about 12 hours hiking through cold, wind and rain. When he came home He was stiff and sore, and his clothes completely drenched. On top of that, we've had personal stress between the two of us. To say the least. We've had a hefty week. And we're constantly on the go- from school, to working out, making sure we're eating well. In short, our being tired has nothing to do with the fact we had kfc twice in the two years we've been together. There's also no evidence supporting the link between kfc and unwellness in general. Or milk. Or anything we choose to eat. Unfortunately to say, all foods are processed, and there is no evidence that \"some types of food\" have better effects than others. Moderation is key. As for why we don't often have dinner at home, to be honest, sometimes nobody is home, and dinner isnt there. Other times, it doesn't quite meet our needs, and other times, it's something C may not like (for instance chicken wings. We would both we went out and he had a proper meal than having a few bites of vegetables at dinner which is not enough for him). Although we appreciate it, it doesn't bother us to just grab something if we need to. Thank you for your concern (p.s. KFC chicken is reallly Good :)\n\nShe responded as follows:\n\n&gt;I asked C why he was skipping dinner as his father said it's been a few nights where he or you have said he's not hungry. I asked what he's been eating. I asked if he's taken a new liking to kfc/fast food.... As it's processed meat ...I was asking because I don't know what he's eating and he looks like shit so obviously it's going to concern me. I didn't mention milk. I didn't mention anything else of the sort. I've asked a number of times what I can cook to suit your needs and nobody tells me. I'm doing my best.  A food debate is definitely not happening. Eat what you want. When my kid looks like shit, I'm asking why and it's my job to make sure he's healthy. I'm allowed to inquire. C needs to come out of his room and speak to me.... \n\n\nFollowing this, she lets my boyfriend know that she's too mad to talk, and that she's been deeply insulted. She later invites us to her room, and to summarize, I tried telling her that these past jabs have been hurtful to me--she dismissed my feelings, and made excuses for what her intentions were, a very large fight was had. My boyfriend and I get called disrespectful and more but that's another story for another time. \n\nSo, with what information you have. Please help me see the light. I'm worried that perhaps this is all my fault, that I am to blame because my text was utterly rude and aggressive. I'm so confused. Anything helps. \n\nTL;DR:\nBF and I get fit and healthy, his mom makes jabs at us when we indulge. Bf is told he looks like crap because of having KFC twice. Text is sent, fight is had.",

      "description": "TLDR: My (30F) live-in partner (40M) of 6 years told me he was dreaming about a brand-new high-end gaming computer. He has no savings, and he already has plenty of entertainment options, so I wanted him to wait. But I also said I couldn't dictate what he should spend his money on - especially since I've been relying on him financially. TIL that he already bought it without telling me and got pretty upset. Seeing my reaction, he said he would return it. AITA if he does?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my partner has had a good, high-income job for the entire time we've been together. But he has also acted very irresponsibly with his finances - frivolous spending, unpaid bills, credit card debt and unpaid debt to his relatives, to the point where they had a severe conflict over it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was mostly kept in the dark about this and assumed everything was OK since he had a house and no bank loan. Once aware, I did my best to help him. At the same time, I've felt a lot of guilt about not been able to contribute my fair share - first due to being a student, recently due to unemployment. He's never made it into an issue though, and I'm very grateful for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough there's been setbacks and lies about his level of financial control, we're doing a lot better now. He's paying his bills, no real debt etc. Spending has gone down, although we live very comfortably. I recently got a job so our situation will improve even more soon. However, it's not been more than 2-3 months since our last financial crisis, which had to be resolved by a loan. This happens because he does not save money, and because I've not had an income to share the burden.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when he started talking about getting a brand new, high-end gaming laptop I was a bit weary. He bought a new gaming computer 3 years ago and hardly ever uses it. But we often play games on PS4, at times on our PCs too, and we have more games than time to play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus I didn't see the need for a new one ATM - especially because we'll soon be able to save up for a buffer and plan purchases, save for holidays and make much-needed improvements on the house. But he went behind my back and bought it anyway. I was fairly shocked and upset when he told me, and I still am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom his POV, he got such a good deal on this computer, half price on 4k, that he just had to get it. \"Now or never\", and it's been his dream to own a computer like this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's a very kind person, and I believe him when he says that he wouldn't mind if I spent a similar sum on myself. He's happy living paycheck to paycheck - until it's crisis mode again. I'm so tired of the stress. But given that we're moving into a better financial situation, the crises hopefully won't happen anymore. Plus, maybe I'm overreacting to him treating himself after working hard because of our background on this topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe did get a good deal, and I sort-of feel like the asshole for letting him return it.

I don't hate them, I don't think they're awful people. I love them. \n\nThe way I see it they're no different from being in the military. They dont harm anyone who isn't also in a \"military\". My uncle actually was in the marines and described it like that. They aren't psychos or rapists.\n\nAITA For not agreeing with everyone that being in the mob doesnt automatically make you an awful person who deserves death?",

      "description": "A little context: My dad and I have been on some very thin ice for the last few years because of emotional abuse, gaslighting, lying, and substance abuse. This past year I did not speak to him for six months (we live across the country so this is easier to achieve) because I finally could not handle it anymore after I caught him lying once again to me. My parents finally divorced recently and he has been making real efforts to improve himself as a person (he claims he is substance free, lost a lot of weight, and he just got hired to a real job for the first time in years) so he is spending the earlier part of winter break with us and then my mom will be with us for Christmas. Also I‚Äôm 22, still in college currently, and curse like a crusty old sailor. \n\nStory: I picked my dad up from the airport a few days ago for his week here with the kids. While in the car I‚Äôm talking with him and I start cursing like I usually do. He asks me to not curse in front of him because it‚Äôs disrespectful. Now, though he is my father this man has done nothing in the past eight years deserving of my respect, and he has used this tactic of ‚Äòrespect‚Äô before in order to control me. I am my own adult at this point and frankly I can curse if I fucking want to. So, point blank I informed him ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He asked me a few more times but I did not give in and the conversation died then moved on. I believed that was the end of it as I continued how I usually do and he did not say anything again. \n\nLast night we go out to a very fancy restaurant that my younger sister is employed at (I‚Äôm super proud of her) so that my dad could see where she worked for the first time and he could treat us to a nice meal. We were there for three hours and during that time I tell stories and make conversation and curse as I usually do. We had finished everything, wrapped up the food, paid the bill, and we‚Äôre getting ready to take a nice family photo that I really wanted to get when I decided to tell one last story. I say fuck while telling it and my dad interrupts me and tells me again to not curse in front of him. I ignore his rude interruption, especially because we had already had this conversation, said it again and finished my sentence. My dad immediately stands up from the table, tells me very publicly that he will never take me out again, and storms out. It was extremely mortifying for both me and my sister who‚Äôs workplace this was. I ended up getting just a sibling picture (which I‚Äôm glad I still did) and rode home in silence. I‚Äôm currently hiding in my room because if I see him I‚Äôm only going to say unproductive mean things and I don‚Äôt want to do that. \n\nJust to add a note: my siblings don‚Äôt give one shit about my cursing, you could not hear any other tables so I assume not a single other table could hear or cared to hear our conversation, and we are currently in New England where curses come every other word. \n\nSo, please let me know if I‚Äôm just a raging asshole and need to get over myself. I feel a little crazy right now.\n\nTLDR: My dad asked me not to curse in front of him. I told him no and a few days later at the end of dinner he storms out on me at the restaurant my sister works at because I said fuck. ",

      "description": "Throwaway because she uses my Reddit account\n\nI understand that, for a lot of people, lack of sex and intimacy can be a deal-breaker.\n\nMy SO and I have been dating for about 4 1/2 years now yet we barely have any physical intimacy. She doesn't like to be held for too long, maybe 30 seconds at best, and we haven't had sex in two years. Every time I try and initiate she tells me she just doesn't want to. \n\nMost of the time I figured I'd get an excuse out of it, but it's always just flat out \"No.\" Oddly enough, my ego doesn't feel bruised since she does so much for me. I don't feel a painful rejection. I've considered that maybe I'm bottling it up. I've sat down and had some serious discussions with her about it. We get a lot out of those conversations but I still feel like we haven't made any real progress. \n\nAside from that detail she's quite possibly the closest thing to a superhuman I've ever seen. She runs her own business, helps me maintain the home, destroys me in smash, makes me laugh until my sides hurt, frequently buys me gifts and listens to me vent about work. At the end of a hard day she still has enough energy to go to the gym with me. I reciprocate this as much as possible that it sometimes it feels like a competition and she does it all with a smile. \n\nShe's incredible, but I do feel the lack of intimacy is eating at me slowly",

      "description": "Today in one of my lectures (I'm a student), a person with a support/service dog walks in about 15 minutes late to class. The dog isn't small, so it needs an aisle or something for it to be, which is fair, I get it. What really bugged me was that she asked someone sitting in the very front row in the middle section if they would let her have their seat, and they let her have it. Now the auditorium was fairly packed, and their weren't any empty seats around where this was happening. The person who gave up their seat ended up having to go sit somewhere several rows back. Despite the fact that there were aisle seats available further back in the auditorium, this girl with the service dog felt the need to make someone sitting in a prime seat move in the middle of the lecture. The sheer sense of this person's entitlement shocked me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am someone who likes to sit as close to the front of the auditorium as possible (I can't stand the distraction of people in the rows in front of me scrolling through Facebook on their computers, nor the incessant sound of 400 ish people typing). I feel that this is a situation that I could potentially find myself in. I personally would tell this person to find another aisle seat, and that I have a good seat because I showed up on time. WIBTA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome additional details:\n\n\\- I would consider this dog to be ill-behaved. It rarely sits still, often partially jumping up on the owner's lap.\n\n\\- I was sitting on the left side of the auditorium, so all this movement in my peripheral was very distracting\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So, a little background - I'm away at college (2.5-3 hours away), shit hasn't been easy these last few weeks. I come home on the weekends, but my housing situation is getting progressively fucked and this is likely one of the last weekends I'll have a place to stay at home (power, water, gas, etc. getting shut off in a matter of days). \n\nI've introduced my boyfriend to a lot of my friends and he's getting closer to some of them, and I think it's great.\n\nEarlier this week we're on the phone, he tells me he's having a \"boy's night\" (not his idea) with 2 childhood friends of mine. I'll admit I'm not a fan of the idea of a \"boy's night\", mostly because I've been friends with these guys for years, sort of the \"one of the guys\" friend anyway in every other circumstance and I don't understand my exclusion solely based on my gender, but I digress. Wasn't a fan but ultimately conceded, despite the fact that that was last night (Saturday), and I'm only here for the weekends. I drive the 3 hours Friday night after classes and leave late Sunday night (and I kind of only make the drive to hang out with my boyfriend in the first place). \n\nSo ultimately they had their night, I was fine, tried to make other plans to distract myself but they fell through. \n\nAround 9:30pm I get a text: \"so at some point I need you to pick me up\". \n\nBoyfriend got too drunk to drive himself home. I text back, \"when?\", ready and willing to pick him up, and I go unanswered for 40 mins. \n\nIt's at that point text bickering begins, I reel back, had you brought me I would have dd'd, why am I allowed to pick you up but not hang with my own friends, etc., tell him he should just sleep there (which he was definitely allowed and able to do), get a ride, go home to his place instead of mine (he normally sleeps at my house for the weekends I'm here). \n\nWe fast forward to 3am when he gets dropped off at my house. No real reconciliation since.\n\nHis argument being that I should be happy he's making friends with my friends, he needs to know them as an individual, they want him to feel included, etc. \n\nI am happy that he's friends with them. I do have severe fear of missing out and it sucks to know your friends and boyfriend are having a good time and you're being decidedly excluded, I didn't drive home to spend a Saturday night on my own. And I just don't understand why my being present is such an inhibitor on him having healthy relationships with my (our) friends, I make it a point to give him space and autonomy in situations where we're all hanging out.\n\nSpat still carrying on into this morning. Now I'm supposed to drive him to get his car (which, of course, I will do).\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\n(Kudos for reading any &amp; all of this.)",

      "description": "Ok so one of my friends asked me to help her prepare for a test, I said ok because I was going to study that subject anyway, we planned for Saturday. She spent the whole week telling me everyday to not forget, to the point of exhaustion.\nSaturday morning she sends me a message telling me she cant come, I said fine no problem. I went to take a shower and she called me, asking where I was, I told her I was showering, she told me that she was waiting for me at the coffee shop where we were supposed to study because she wanted to give me something, I said ok and I'll be there.\n Like 5 mins pass and she calls me again asking where I was, told her I was putting on clothes. I'm leaving the house and she calls me again asking where I was, 5 mins later she calls me again, and after that she calls me AGAIN. I'm really annoyed at this point and when I meet her, she comes all happy, I asked her if she was with her boyfriend, she said yes and was going to spend the day with him. I asked why did she lie about not being able to come when in fact she just didn't want to, she tells me I'm acting like a child, I tell her that it's not my fault that she is horny and I got stuff to do, so now she is mad at me and won't even talk to me.",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom. Throwaway.\n\nBackground: He (25) and I (26f) have been together in a monogamous relationship for almost three years and lived together for a large part of that. I recently moved into my own apartment because of his anger/control issues, but agreed to try to work through this with him while he works on his mental health. He is an awkward nerd, while I am much more social. I have an art degree, and he is working towards a neuroscience degree if that gives any insight into our personalities.\n\nLast night, I went over to his place to hang out for a bit and started showing him some things on here that I had saved to show him. A text notification popped up from a male friend I met on r/r4r. My boyfriend immediately goes into this rapid fire interrogation and my jaw just dropped. I have not once given this man any reason to distrust me. I have never been anything but transparent. I have never cheated on anyone and I have no intention of starting with him. He kept saying the typical \"I just think it's weird that...\" and when I responded by saying that it was unfair of him to accuse me of being disloyal, he would say, \"I'm not accusing you of anything, I'm just asking questions.\" Questions like, \"Who messaged who first, and how did you exchange numbers?\" \"What do you talk about?\" \"What do you talk about? (again)\" \"Have you sent him any pictures of yourself?\" \n\nI just left. It hurt my feelings to know that three years in I am still having to defend my character to him. I will always be a social person, and I will never be dishonest or disloyal. This is just who I am and how I chose to live. It's unreal to me that he can claim love for me but get so bitter about these parts of my personality.\n\n1) I messaged my friend first because I was bored, and we hit it off. We were both slow to respond on reddit, so we exchanged numbers. I don't even know his last name, and he's never been anything but respectful. I talk to him about my boyfriend all the time. We also talk about our day, food, dogs, and life. \n\n2) I never told my boyfriend because it did not occur to me that I was obligated to update him every time I made a new friend.\n\n3) Yes, I sent pictures of myself. Nothing cute, nothing \"sexy.\" Pictures with my dog mostly, pictures from hiking, and some pictures from 10+ years ago during a conversation about changing looks/hair.\n\n4) It just seems like every time I do something that brings me joy, it infuriates my boyfriend. I never felt comfortable making art at his house because he would act like I was laying around and doing nothing but making a mess all day. If I go out with my friends, he will text me the entire time. If I bring him out with my friends, it ends in an argument over absolutely nothing. (Example: Went to a craft beer place, left and agreed to meet our friends at a second place. He wanted food, and then got upset with me because he thought I didn't want him to get food when I mentioned that there was food at the second place where our friends were waiting. He didn't talk to me or anyone the entire time at the second location. They kept asking me what was wrong with him. He drove like a psycho on the way to drop me off so I jumped out of the car at a stop sign and had to walk home a mile and a half in the freezing rain in heels. It snowed like 5 hours later. He popped a tire because of the way he was driving. We fought for a week.) \n\nI always want to think he isn't the jealous type, but I am realizing that I have mostly stopped attempting to have friendships with men unless they are someone he hits it off with, which is almost no one. He does not like most people. I have two brothers, and I have always had platonic male friends. \n\nI love my boyfriend. He loves animals like I do, and we have had so much fun together. He is so smart and absolutely hilarious. He can be the kindest man in the world, but his anger/control issues and insecurities are getting in our way. I'm not patient enough to cater to him, and I am tired of having to defend myself to someone that says he loves me. I told him I would stay to help him sort out his medications and work through therapy, but at what point does his mental illness justify the emotional abuse?\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend saw a notification for a text from a (platonic) man friend I met on reddit and started a rapid fire interrogation about the extent of our relationship. \n\nAITA for getting mad at him for being jealous/insecure?\n",

      "description": "Okay, please let me explain and don‚Äôt immediately call me an ass just for the title alone. \n\nI‚Äôm transgender. Ftm, pre-op. Operation due in 21. Let me explain this situation. \n\nI own a discord server with just under a 100 members. It‚Äôs nice, we have a lot of actives and we‚Äôre quite chummy with each other. I host a lot of games/play sessions on there, and we get a lot of positive clout for it. This happened a few months ago, someone new joined through one of my other friends. Sure, nothing wrong with it. I welcome them and they introduce themselves. Nothing goes wrong. About an hour in I made a joke about how the other people left alive in the match were all boys. The new person (who was still alive ingame) outright calls me and says ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm a girl!‚Äù I felt a little embarrassed and apologised with a nervous laugh. One of my other friends (now boyfriend woo!) thought this would be a good opportunity to announce that I had came out as transgender, and I got a lot of support and even a few lighthearted jokes about. The new person, who I‚Äôll call PF, (possibly fake) didn‚Äôt say anything. Completely quiet. I just thought they were concentrating and thought nothing of it at the time. The next time they spoke they were totally in some sort of mood. While I think this is related to the situation, it might not be. \n\nThe very next day, not even 24 hours later, PF announces that they‚Äôve come out as transgender. I thought this a little weird at the time but still congratulated them, as well as some other people on the server. It took me over 3 months to finally come to terms with my gender, and through self deprecating thoughts and support from both friends and family was when I was comfortable with coming out. It took PF less than 24 hours, which I didn‚Äôt get it. I later approached them about this as someone who had also recently come out, and asked what made them realise it. No joke, they literally responded with ‚Äúoh, it just feels good to finally be comfortable in my own skin‚Äù I‚Äôm awkward and british, so I didn‚Äôt pry them about it. \n\nA few weeks in, and PF is becoming.. kind of annoying. The ONLY thing they talk about is being transgender. And, this is the part which really makes my blood boil. They complain a lot about being transgender. Things like; ‚Äúoh, I HATE wearing girls clothes but I have to because my family doesn‚Äôt know‚Äù ‚Äúcan you NOT call me that? my preferred name is ‚Äòthis‚Äô and i‚Äôd really appreciate it if you didn‚Äôt refer to me as my born name‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs so hard being transgender and closeted, my family wouldn‚Äôt ever understand my struggles‚Äù ‚Äúeveryone at school bullies me for my gender, I just can‚Äôt take it anymore‚Äù\n\nAs someone who is closeted (though I look pretty androgynous), has and DOES get harassed and bullied to the point of some mental illnesses I won‚Äôt disclose on reddit, I really really really don‚Äôt believe any of what they say. The worst thing is that they always make the situation about them. Nobody in my server can talk about their own issues without PF coming up with Today‚Äôs Daily Struggle‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, which is always over exaggerated. But my server is way too polite to actually do anything about it, I don‚Äôt want to interact with them about this in case they accuse me of being something I‚Äôm not. I get that everyone has different experiences with their sexuality and gender, even straight and cis people, but this just seems like something out of r/quityourbullshit. All of their problems are over exaggerated and I‚Äôm fairly certain about 90% fake. What do I do?",

      "description": "I had bought my very first car with money I saved up for about $950. It's decent car for a 1993 Ford Explorer XLT.\n\n3 months ago, we had about 10 inches of snow that note very common in my part of Texas. In the morning I had to go to work and my dad wanted to take me there since my car had the only option with 4x4. Their others cars are a Mustang and a Kia that has front wheel drive. My dad takes me and picks up my mom to go grocery shopping. \n\nI'm off work early since the city advised everyone to be off the roads around 8. I call my dad and he tells me that he crashed my car. I'm pissed and ask for pictures of the damage. He says that I can see when he comes to pick me up. \n\nHe arrives and I look at the car. A Side piece is missing, the taillight is flapping in the wind and the front bumper is curved in. My dad tells me that a car was an idiot and had blended in because most of the snow was still on it. He tells me that the brakes had failed. I except that so he buys me new brakes, and offers to double the offer of the car for how much it sells.\n\nRecently my parents had gotten out of debt and have been eyeing a brand new TV to purchase. My dad told me that he would be using my car to get the TV. I tell him that's fine as long as I'm in the car. He says that fine. However he states that he will be picking it up on Tuesday. I tell him it will have to wait till Friday because that's when I have work off.\n\nHe suddenly gets mad at me and says that he will be getting the TV on Tuesday whether or not I'm in the car. I tell him in a very firm voice that he won't be going anywhere with my car unless I'm in it. He gets mad at me and tells me that I don't get to tell him what to do. I start to question him on why the hell he even took my car in the first place when I told him that the Kia could of easily braked and avoided all of this. He suddenly tells me to drop it and that the talk is over. \n\nI storm off and state one last time that the TV is coming on Friday. \n\nSo, reddit, Am I the Asshole for bringing up a old incident whenever he wants to use it again? BTW I'm 16. ",

As I had already sent my half to him I was forced to pay the entire rent plus my half a second time. He promised me he'd pay me back and as we be friends for 5 years I had no issues with it. \n\nHe started okay paying back a few hundred of what he owed before just stopping altogether. We got into a little argument about it as he tried to scam his way out of over half of it, so we came to the agreement I'd move out if he would pay me. I never forced him to pay me all at once or anything, I don't care if he gives me $20 a month I'd just like my money. \n\nNow that I'm moved out I saw that he'd gotten engaged to his long time gf that I'd known for a few years as well. When I sent him a text asking him if he'd forgotten about the money, it had been just about a year since I received anything, I got no response. I know his gf is a nice and reasonable woman.

This made me focus my full attention on her and write her up for anything wrong. last week she had a crash and i made sure she was drug tested. today she was fired for failing the test (test showed drugs 7 months ago). now i found out that she had a 1 year old daughter and was 5 months pregnant both from a guy who wont help her with child support. i dont know why but i feel so guilty like i caused her to not be able to support her child. in all honesty if the girl she started a argument with wasnt a friend i probably would not have focused on her as much. everyone says i was just doing my job but i could have handled it a different way and she would most likely still be employed with a decent paying job.",

      "description": "Last week I (33M) was hanging out with my girlfriend (32F) as I normally do. She left to go workout and then go home for the evening. Everything was fine but it was getting late. She always sends me a message before she goes to bed just as we say goodnight. This night she didn't. It was the first time she she hadn't. It worried me.\n\nI sent her some texts asking if she was okay. I called her. No answer, no replies. It was the first time she hadn't sent me a message before bed. I wondered what I'd do if something were to happen. I'd be the first to know something was wrong. I was the last to see her. I felt like the burden of responsibility would fall to me to blow the whistle if there were red flags.\n\nIn the last message I sent to her, I told her I felt like dropping by her place just to make sure she was there. After a bit, I decided to chill and just go to bed. I figured everything was fine and she must have just fallen asleep, but it bothered me. But I let it go.\n\nIn the morning she text me saying she was sorry. She did, indeed, just fall asleep. But she said that me worrying so much wasn't normal. That me being willing to get up and check on her in the middle of the night wasn't normal. She got upset. Saying that she feels like she can't feel like she's her own person. That she has to make sure to check in each and every night. And perhaps I let my worries get the better of me, but it was really just a few messages. I just told her that I was worried and she scared me. That it was the first time had happened and it was odd.\n\nWe got over it, we talked through it and I learned to not take such a personal stake in her safety. But I've been thinking about it a lot.

      "description": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.. IDK if this should be at r/relationshipadvice but  anyway.. And apologize me for bad English.\n\nSo me 21 and my girlfriend 20 have been in a relationship for over three years now. She is my second GF and I am her first boyfriend.\n\nAt first our relationship rotated around meeting at our parent's places, watching some series and making out, you know the usual teeny stuff. Now we both live on our own in separate apartments. (We're still not sure when to move in together).\n\nOur sex life used to be very good. I had to \"teach\" her how to do stuff since I am her first and only sexual partner (I myself am not that experienced), but I didn't mind and we both were happy. So the trouble began around a year ago. She turned 20 and had to change her pill to a cheaper one (we think that was the trigger) because her health insurance only covered it untill that age.\n\nAnyway, since then she wasn't in the mood very often and she refused to talk to me about that. I tried to be patient about it. She started a very stressful college and apprenticeship mix and I thought maybe it's the reason.\n\nWe still enjoying watching shows, going to the park and the usual stuff together. She is a great woman and I enjoy her company and would love to spend my life with her.\n\nIn the last couple of months we had sex only several times and most of the time she wasn't even there mentally. She just let me do 'my thing'.  It got me really mad. I almost felt cheated on.\n\nSo that's when I tried to talk to her regarding this issue a bunch of times. She told me that she didn't feel the desire to have sex anymore and that she felt bad about it but was too afraid to tell me. We agreed that she should stop taking the pill and we should wait some time.\n\nThings didn't change much since then and in a discussion she asked me if I still wanted to be with her. After long thinking about what I should and shouldn't say I told her that I love her company, enjoy meeting with her family more than my own. But it's true that sleeping at her side and knowing the person you love doesn't think of you in a sexual way is simply depressing.\n\nI thought it was easy. Just wait some time, talk to her about it and we would turn a happy couple again in no time. But it isn't easy for me at all. Recently I even started to think about how easy it would be to get into an affair with someone else and afterwards return to my GF like nothing happened. I don't want this, but the temptation started to be huge. I mean we could just be best friend at this time and it wouldn't change a thing..\n\nAll of this led me to asking for a break from the relationship for some time untill we figure out what's best for us. I still love her and I believe she loves me too, but it has become too much.\nI still don't know the \"terms\" of the break. If it shall lead to a full break up or if we should try our best to stay together.\n\n:(",

Ive recently started showing my own work and have a few shows of experience. So she invited me to help her hang and place her work and to be her date the night of her show. \n\nA few nights ago I expressed how lonely and sad I've been since my best friend and I had a really bad falling out and how I felt I had no friends who enjoyed my company, so I was really excited at the prospect of female companionship and having an evening out with a friend. It didn't even occur to me to be concerned with the location of the show. \n\nThis evening I told my boyfriend I had plans tomorrow afternoon to help her hang her photos and teasingly asked if there was anything I could get for us. We've been having some issues in the bedroom lately and hes bought toys before on his own, so I didn't think it would be seen as a negative. Ive never really wanted to go with him but have bought toys online, I've expressed thou that I dont like the idea of going together. \n\nHe got really upset that I was willing to go with my girl friend and not him. I tried explaining that going with a female friend is less intimate than going with him. I brought up that I dont like the idea of strangers knowing the details of our sex life; that it makes me uncomfortable to think about going and discussing what anal beads would spice up our life best in front of a stranger. Now he is accusing me of feeling embarrassed of being with him and being seen with him and just being over all really accusatory. \n\nAm I  the asshole here for not wanting to go to the sex shop with him?",

She‚Äôs very sweet and keeps good company, but she can be slightly oblivious to things like entering the bathroom. \n\nSince we‚Äôve broken up, the boys have been mostly encouraging except for one, who I will call Chad.

I kept my cool and told him to chill out and reminded I never make fun of his girl. \n\nChad continued with, ‚Äúsorry not all of us have a crackhead fetish‚Äù\n\nAfter this I walked up into his room and punched a hole in the TV he had been bragging about all week for getting it for$40. \n\nHe had been pushing me for a long time and when confronted with the decision to stop, Chad kept going. I don‚Äôt feel bad because it was $40 either way. The way I see it, he‚Äôs had it coming and shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to talk about ANY woman like that.",

I'm (diagnosed) depressed and cannot easily deal with sudden changes in scheduling and long nights alone. Boyfriend suddenly decides to go out because he feels bad from me feeling bad. \n\nSo, my dad has unfortunately passed away less than two weeks ago. It was all quite sudden and very stressful in regards of planning for everyone in my family.  My partner has been trying his best to help me out as well as he can (just like with my diagnosed mental disorders), despite his lack of experience. I often acknowledge that I admire this and that I am very thankful. \n\nAfter a few days, I already notice that I start to feel a shift in our functions in our relationship. Instead of him caring for me, I care for him. Whenever something annoys him, or he gets hungry-angry, I try to solve this. This makes me ignore all my negative feelings automatically. I don't underatand why. I have told him about this, but I can't remember the outcome of this.  \n\nThis situation has carried on, but a lot less noticeable as he has gone back to work after our trip for the burial. However, for me it has reached a confusing breaking point today with him going out with his buds. I obviously do want him to have a life apart from our relationship. I find this very important and having noticed his struggles with my situation have encouraged this as well. However, I have made it clear in the past that I greatly appreciate him telling me in advance, e.g. not one day in advance, as I cannot easily plan something with my friends due to busy schedules; and that I appreciate him trying to not plan anything late into the night due to my difficulties with making it through the night, even more since my dad's passing. I do realise that this is not always possible, but asked to maybe not pile it on too much, which he then continued to do by saying this would be the case the next two saturday nights as well (which are also hard for me to plan around as my friends like to go out this night and I have a panicattack at the idea of going out but that's my problem).  Also, would like to say that this would be a lot less difficult for me not so, for me, soon after my dad's passing. \n\nI know that it is difficult for my boyfriend as well. And again, I really want him to have a social life as well, which is why I'm wondering whether I'm being a psychotic asshole of a girlfriend and demanding too much. \n\n",

      "description": "This happened several years ago and I was just reminded of it today.\n\nThis was in summer camp daycare, and I was about 13 with the other kids being around the same age. I was kinda nerdy and unpopular, but I would sit next to the kids who had a DS to watch them play.\n\nI sat down at the edge of a table and began watching silently. I should note that this was common and nobody really cared much. The person I was sitting next to didn't seem to have a problem with it. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, another kid (Nick) comes over and tells me I am sitting where he was. I give him the ol' \"move your feet, lose your seat\" spiel, and the fact I didn't even know he was sitting there. He was nowhere around.\n\nAt this point he begins to try and push me further into the already crowded bench and into the person to my right. I push back and he falls to the ground, which pops out his hearing aid (which I had no idea he even had). The staff come over and help him, while the kids at the table berate me. \n\nAITA in this situation?",

      "description": "It all started on December 19th was my fathers 62nd birthday and he had a large party with his side of the family. My mother does not get along with them so she didn't go. When I was there my aunt was borderline begging me and my brother to come celebrate Christmas Eve because she was throwing a large dinner party and I said yes because in all honesty I felt pressured because my dad was right next to me and did not feel like causing a scene and in general they are nice people. So a few days later I ask my mother and this is a rough abstract of the conversation... \n\nMe: Are we going to have a dinner on Christmas Eve and Christmas\n\nMom: We can if you want to (kind of excitingly)\n\nMe: Well Auntie blank asked me and Bro to dinner on Christmas Eve and I already said yes.. \n\nMom: What makes you think you can just go (or something along those lines) ( Then starts ranting about how I don't respect her)\n\nMe: I respect you that's why I am telling you first of all and I am also 21 you can't stop me from going. \n\nShe goes silent and then starts throwing a bunch of stuff out from under the cub board against the floor, breaking two glass salad bowls. She actually throws a temper tantrum and starts throwing stuff into the hallway even destroys a rice cooker to the point it actually broke apart.\n\nI try to be nice to my mother because she has a history of terrible shit happening to her and overall does not enjoy her life much so I try to be there for her. My sister has gone completely ghost (my mom basically pushed her away) and my brother is overall just a dick to her and she doesn't have any family in America. (She is from Japan) . She is single, doesn't have a boyfriend, was never married and all her friends have either moved back to Japan and is currently in a fight with one of her only friends. After she was done breaking stuff I said some really terrible stuff because I was just fed up with how she was acting and when I say terrible stuff, like stuff you would never want to hear from your son. I was just extremely fed up with her acting like a child. I am always the one comforting her. When she is crying I am the one that talks to her and stays by her side, not my brother and not my sister. I come home from school every weekend to see her and I even now have to do the yard work during the school year because even though my brother lives at home he doesn't ever do it when she asks. He just invites his friends over and smokes weed in the living room and trashes it. I am constantly trying to balance my love for my father and my mother. Because on one hand my father was a piece of shit to my mom and did not help raise me but, he he pays for my school, my living expenses and even my mothers living expenses. My mother doesn't work and makes no income but, she was the one who raised me and my siblings by herself.\n\nTldr: Mom got extremely mad when I said I was going to spend Christmas Eve with my father.",

      "title": "AITA for not going with my girlfriend to the rodeo?",
      "description": "A few weeks ago she mentioned that her grandparents had bought her and her family ticket passes to go to the Houston Rodeo and asked if I would want to go. I said sure, but for whatever reason her family planned on going on a weekday while we were still away at college so it would just be the two of us. Fast forward to last Friday, I had forgotten I told her I would go and made plans with my brothers to try out this coffee/board game shop with them. Friday night she asked me if I still wanted to go and I said, ‚Äúnot really,‚Äùbecause I didn‚Äôt like the rodeo all that much and my brothers were expecting me. She said that it was ok and she would find someone else to go with her. \n\nI should note that I apologized and honestly felt very bad for skipping on the rodeo with her. She seemed fine with it and we texted normally for the rest of the night. \n\nThe next day she didn‚Äôt respond to any of my texts. At first I just thought she was busy and wasn‚Äôt checking her phone, but she ended up ignoring me all day. \n\nThis morning I texted her another apology and said I wish she wouldn‚Äôt give me the silent treatment. She responded with ‚Äúfirst of all you are not sorry so don‚Äôt apologize‚Äù and that she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. \n\nWe have been going back and forth arguing all day now. She feels like I‚Äôm never her top priority and that I only do things with her if I like them or find them important. Which is not true at all. We go to see the ballet and musicals very often even though I don‚Äôt like doing either of those things, but we go because she loves them. \n\nI will admit I have been more distant this semester and we spend less time together, but I think for good reason. This semester I‚Äôve changed majors (music education to finance), but I kept music as a minor so I‚Äôm doing significantly more School work than last semester. My dad got fired, my mom is finishing her education degree, and I have such a weird schedule that it‚Äôs hard to get a job so I don‚Äôt really have the income to do all of the things we used to. Also, my dad wants to start a real estate company since he is having trouble finding a new job, so I‚Äôve been taking online training courses so when I come home for summer I can work for him. So, all in all I‚Äôve been super busy and that has definitely gotten in the way of us spending the same amount of time together. \n\nWe‚Äôve had a few arguments about this before. Once, when I was super stressed about a big project I had due the next day I told her I couldn‚Äôt go to lunch with her and her parents. The second time I told her I didn‚Äôt think I had the time to drive an hour to watch her performance in a small symphony since I was super busy that week (I ended up going to that one anyway). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I be putting more effort to spend time with her no matter how it effects me?\n\nP.S. Sorry this was so long. Also I‚Äôm sure the formatting is horrendous but I don‚Äôt post to reddit very often. ",

      "description": "Ftp on mobil and all that jazz. \n\nMy bff lives with my husband, me, and my 2 kids. She has a baby that sleeps with her and and she stores all his stuff in my sons room. Last night my son stayed in my daughters room because they have been having \"sleep overs\" lately and we just let it, they are 2 and 4 so young enough they can share a room, theirroom also gets locked at night. We close our door at night because our cat will paw at our feet and wake us up early. We also threw the cat into the hall before going to bed so I know the cat was out before going to bed. I got up at 330 am to find the cat trapped in my sons room and had peed everywhere. Sometimes my roommate goes in there and gets pjs for her son before bed and she  normally shuts doors behind her (nothing wrong with that) so rightfully, i assumed it was her who locked the cat in. I was also tired, annoyed, and bonus points, 8 months pregnant and cleaning up cat urine out of my sons stuff. I sent my friend a text stating \"stop closing the boy's door. The cat got locked in and peed everywhere and it smells really bad\" that was it. I knew if i typed more it wouldn't be nice so I stopped there. When I woke up I noticed it didnt send last nigh so I just hit send this morning since she was already at work. Big mistake apperently because she got all kinds of pissed. She started by sending me 3 texts explaining how it couldn't have been her and it was rude I accused her of it. When I tried defending myself and how that text wasnt that big of a deal she said it was bad because I didn't say please so now I'm ordering her around and treating her like a child and just assuming it was her. I told her I'm not fighting you over text (things always get misconstrued over text I think because of tone) and I'm not responding to her now and ignoring her. I was annoyed when I typed the text and did assume it was her since my kids are locked in at night and couldn't have and I threw the cat out before closing my own door so obviously shes the likely choice since why the hell would my husband go in there? She also goes in often to get stuff for her son so it made sense to me. I didn't say please, I was pissed when I found it this morning. I am kinda a bossy person but I still feel like she over reacted here. Even if she didn't do it I don't think its that big a deal but could be blind by to my own assholery. \n\nAITA for assuming it was my roommate and then not saying please when accusing her of doing it/ ordering her to stop?",

A few months later, I contacted her again because I wanted to reconnect (we were still really good friends, and I missed that). My new girlfriend (we'll call her Melony), with whom I started a relationship after Sarah and I broke up, saw that I had been messaging Sarah on Facebook. She got really upset and thereafter did not allow me to contact Sarah at all. She considers it to have been cheating. She says that I hid it from her, and to be honest, I didn't outright tell her because I did know she is a jealous person, and I didn't want her to be upset with me just for talking to someone as a friend. I don't think I was hiding it from her, though. She had access to my phone, and so she could see my Facebook messages at any time. I also would have told her if it had come up in conversation. I simply didn't go out of my way to tell her.

On several different occasions, this dude has asked me where I'm from, which he never asks anyone else and I get the feeling he wants me to say a village in India or something and is disappointed when I say Alabama. Then again, it might all be in my head and maybe isn't relevant to this story. \n\nAnyway, today I was cutting bread while my two other coworkers were making drinks. He comes up to the counter and asks me what type of bread it is. I tell him, and he makes a comment about wanting to try it next time. I am NOT good at cutting bread and cut a slice too thin (it was too thin to sell but still decently sized.) I decide to tell him, \"hey, I accidentally cut this piece a bit too small, do you want to have it?\" And he looked at me and then at the ground, with this weird facial expression like I'd offended him, and shakes his head no. I said \"no?\" since I was surprised, and my coworker saved the situation by smiling and insisting on putting it in a bag for him, which he took. \n\nSo here's the thing: I feel like it might've been an asshole move on my part to act like I was giving him charity or trying to make him benefit from my screw up. I might also be assuming that he just didn't like that I'm Indian and that I tried to hand him free stuff and that might've offended him, because he took it from my coworker. I might've just lacked social grace and should've said it was a sample instead of making it sound like I was only giving it to him because I messed up.  Am I being an asshole by assuming he's prejudiced or just rude or am I in the wrong here? ",

      "description": "So I (20F) and my best friend (20 MTF) have bee friends since our sophomore year of high school. I‚Äôm a third year currently attending a tech University just 2 hours away from home. \n\nWhenever I come visit, we usually get the topic of the future-relationships, money, etc. It‚Äôs fun for a while, but then I get worried. Ever since high school ended, my best friend has done nothing but work at a low paying retail job, in which he recently quit. \n\nHe struggles with Gender Dysphoria daily, as he hasn‚Äôt started his transition, so I try my best to understand where he‚Äôs coming from, as a non-trans person. He complains often about not being able to find a job, and I understand completely. It‚Äôs hard to find a decent job that will hire you quickly, so it can be straight up frustrating, especially for him because his bosses from his last job went out of their way to misgender him, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that would happen to him at other jobs too. \n\nHe is extremely intelligent, and he‚Äôs an artist, like me. Yet he doesn‚Äôt want to go to college. Sure, college isn‚Äôt for everyone. But, I wish he‚Äôd do SOMETHING that would help stabilize his future, rather than doing cheap commissions from people he knows on discord. \n\nIf he continues to go on like this, he won‚Äôt have any money to do anything. No money to transition, no money to move out, or feed himself, and it worries me. I love him so much and don‚Äôt want him to feel helpless or kill himself from being overwhelmed.  \n\nWIBTA for telling him he should learn a trade, or sign up for scholarships to go to school? With his art skills, he could easily get into a nice art school. However, he‚Äôs not very proactive when it comes to education, and at times it comes off as apathetic. Would I be an asshole for saying this, although his life is not my own, and college is obviously not for everyone? ",

      "description": "First of all: mobile, formatting, blah blah blah\n\nSo basically, my closest friend group consists of me and six other people. We are all really comfortable with each other, and we‚Äôve all been friends with each other for years with the exception of one of us.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, a kid who I‚Äôll name John came to school. From the first week of school, I could tell that John was a really mean person. But I chose to be a nice person and not make assumptions, and tried to befriend him. However my efforts were to no avail, as this guy just chose to completely dislike me, being super mean to me and saying completely incorrect trash talk in front of my closest friends. He spread false rumors, made fun of me in front of the girl that I was trying to impress, and genuinely didn‚Äôt want to let me make any effort to be friends with him.\n\nFast forward a few months, and this stuff has been continuing throughout, and I have stopped attempting to be friends with him. Important info: my close friend group is well aware of my history with John. Some of them are friends with him, but rarely does he hang out with us.\n\nRecently, for the past few weeks, we have started a tradition called cereal Monday‚Äôs. We eat chipotle, walk around town, and for the final act, we would head to the nearby giant, all get those small bowls of cereal, and eat at a nearby coffee shop. I would end up chugging the milk at the end, and it was our fun little group thing. However, yesterday they decided to just invite him to our Cereal Monday‚Äôs despite being well aware of our history. Upon adding him to our group chat, I was up front about removing him and tried to argue with them, but they still decided to defend him, and now he is coming with us no matter what. I removed myself from the group chat and now they are all mad at me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I am considering distancing myself temporarily, but I feel like that will be the wrong way to accomplish my end goal.\n\nAm I being immature, or AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for advising my ex to break up with her boyfriend?",
      "description": "Hello, Reddit! I'm \\[M18\\] and the ex in question is \\[f19\\] for details sake. After not having talked to this person for almost a year, she replied to my Snapchat story, where I continued to to start a friendly conversation with her, since I was bored and on a bus. After some minutes of small talk she said that she needed to rant to someone, and continued to explain everything that she feels isn't going great in her life. Out of respect, I'll avoid saying anything that is directly related to the topic at hand. She also told me that she doesn't really have feelings for her boyfriend anymore, and has felt like this for a while. I asked her why is she still together with him, and she responded that he loves her, and at this point she's pretty much together with him just for his sake. Now, I personally could relate to this, as I had been on the other side of the same situation, where a person was with me for the last couple of months, just out of sympathy, for the lack of a better word. I told her that she should talk to her boyfriend, as I doubted he would enjoy being lied to in a relationship, and to also reevaluate if this isn't the thing that's causing her to be depressed. I also said that breaking up is an option for her. She continued to say that I'm too nice, and that I shouldn't say such nice things,because she'll get attached to me, i continued to very politely say that I doubt that I'm still the same person she remembers me to be, and that when she feel stable and happy I'd be okay with getting to know her again, which with hindsight might've not been the best idea, as I really don't have feelings for her anymore, and I doubt I would've developed any. The next day she told me that she is going to talk to her boyfriend and also stated that he threatened her that he'll jump out of a 7th floor window if she dumps him. (I cannot be 100% correct, but that is what I was told by her). At that point I got very mad, and told her that he is mentally unstable to do that, and that its a toxic and abusive thing to say, and that if I was her I would dump him for saying stuff like that. The next day it turned out that they broke up, and she started texting me. Now I didn't want to lead her on, since I don't want to hurt or disappoint other people in that way, but I started to respond less and less, until yesterday she just stopped sending me things. I felt bad, but I did not want to carry her burden. Flash forward to now, where her ex-boyfriend who she ended up getting back together with today tagged me in his instagram story, and said that ''If a person is depressed and close to suicide that must mean that they're mentally unstable. Well according to (my name) it does (which I don't get at all, since that's how it works, lol) and then goes on to say that I'm a spoiled person, and that the world would be shittier if there were more people like me. Now I feel a bit angry that I legitimately tried to help someone, and ended up getting backlash from it, and what's worse is that there are some people who know me from his followers, and i'll now have to justify myself for trying to do the right thing. So, Reddit, is the backlash justified? Did I end up doing something wrod? AITA?",

We used to hang out a lot together and equally as much with him third wheeling it. Ever since Girl came along, Buddy has been an absent buddy, we rarely see each other and when we do, Girl has to be there. We have common interests so I don't know what's going on there. Girl is ok in short doses but she's a bit hyperactive. In the interest of full disclosure, I probably resent girl a bit for taking my buddy but try not to show it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblem: I scored tickets to an event out of town later this month and asked Buddy if he wanted to come (like the old days I thought). He mentions girl so I told him that Wifey wasn't keen and wouldn't be coming. Buddy wants to come but so does Girl and now she's excited about having a short holiday. He's phrased it as though I have a choice but they'll probably be offended if I exclude her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA for saying I don't want Girl to join us this time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

So last night my flatmate K (20s F) had her good friend C (20s F) for drinks, since it had previously been C's birthday. I (20s M) ended up drinking with them, and we all ended up getting quite drunk, and walking to the nearby Maccas for some drunk food. C was gonna walk home at this point, be K and I offered her Ks room for the night, as she was going to go to her boyfriends. C agreed, and we walked K to her boyfriends flat, and then C and I headed back to mine. \n\nWhen we got home, C felt sick from all the drinking, so I stayed up talking to her for awhile. As I did I realized that I was finding her more and more attractive, and we ended up cuddling on K's bed. I offered for us to move to my room, as I didn't wanna be an asshole, and sleep and possibly to sexual stuff in my flatmate's bed, especially when my room was just down the hallway. C declined, and so I made ready to go to my room and sleep. As I started to get up, I decided to give kissing her a shot, and I did and she kissed me back, and we ended up making out for a bit. After I reoffered for us to move to my room she pushed me off saying she was too drunk to do anything else. So we stopped, and sat there and talked for a little longer, I gave her a few more kisses, and then I went off to my own room. When I got there I had a mild panic, and my drunk ass didn't know if I'd just enjoyed an awkward make out session, or had been super creepy, so my hungover self puts it to you Reddit, am I the asshole? \n\nTL;DR- Got drunk with my flatmate and her friend, offered to look after my flatmates friend, and ended up making out with her on my flatmates bed.",

      "description": "So I started talking to this girl online via a mutual friend that connected us. We started playing videogames together and texting each other. When we first started talking everything seemed normal; we flirted with each other and just got to know each other a little. Overall, I felt like it was casual and that we were just talking. Suddenly things began to escalate on her side.\n\nThis girl begins to tell me she wants to take things very seriously and that she really really likes me, even though we've only been talking for about a couple weeks and we've never even met in person. I tried to reel it back a little after that. I told her I wasn't apposed to being in a relationship down the road but we would have to see where it goes. It seemed like things were going at a normal pace after that.\n\nThen a few nights ago while were talking she suddenly gets emotionally distraught. She tells me she wants go away for awhile, and she doesn't want to speak to anyone in our friend group anymore; she tells me she \"wants live alone\" and says goodbye. I responded by telling her she clearly is experiencing some kind of loss/pain and that at the end of the day I'd always be there for her if she needed to talk to someone and said goodbye as well. In my mind it was over after that and I could move on from this person without worrying about it.\n\nThe next morning the girl texts me at 5am, telling me she's sorry. She revealed that the last person she was in a relationship passed away unexpectedly, and that it's caused her to be apprehensive when she begins to develop feelings for a person. She says that \"she knows she could be happy with me\", and that she \"really does like me\". To me this girl is clearly emotionally unstable. Apparently she has a therapist and she said she's making progress with her insecurities but I just don't want to be talking to someone who is codependent. I find it pretty crazy that she has strong feelings for me even though we hardly know each other. It seems to me like shes just projecting her past relationship on to me and I honestly don't know how in touch she is with reality.\n\nShe's been texting me throughout the day, she will literally text me when she wakes up saying good morning. I need to get out of this and I don't see an easy way out. The fact that we have mutual friends makes it a little complicated. I want to just ghost her and be done with it. Am I the Asshole?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway because reasons, English isn't my first language, so excuse me if anything seems fishy or janky grammar wise.    \n\nBeen together with a girl for a handful of months now, we've had our fair share of arguments, which is fine of course, but one thing that has been bothering me the most - the way she texts.    \n    \n\nNow, hear me out before you start a witch hunt please. We're both adults and I know how ridiculous this must sound, but she has had a change of behavior when texting me. Like, DRASTIC change in the way she interacts with me on a day to day basis.    \n\nIt used to be all fine, a lot of attention from both sides, a lot of interest and just affectionate interactions in general. This, however has been getting less and less, even to the point of straight up acting bored and whatnot. The 'lack of emotion through text' sounds so childish when I type it out like this, but, damn, this shit is actually making me think you know?     \n\nBeing, admittedly, paranoid sometimes, i confronted her about it yesterday. Bad idea, appearantly, as shit hit the fan fast and it snow balled all the way to a full blown argument.    \n\nI was upset I didn't get my point across, but eventually apologized, because she had actually broken down crying (during a phonecall which only made matters worse..) feeling criticized and attacked. She feels as if I don't appreciate her anymore, as if I only nag and bitch about everything. She was _mad_ upset. Jump to today and I wrote her a somewhat long, but sincere apology about how I acted like an asshole and shouldn't have done that.\n\nEven now, she is, understandably pretty pissed and refuses to talk to me most of the day.\n\nMy question for reddit: AITA for bringing this up, for confronting her about my concerns, even if they're this childish? Am I fucking delusional and should be euthanized or is she actually just trying to put the blame on me?\n\nTL;DR I'm upset my gf of a few months was being less affectionate over text, confronted her and made her cry.

      "description": "Backstory: I dated a girl for 2 1/2 years starting in high school to sophomore year of college. I ended up breaking up with her because she was living at home working jobs she hated just to stay near me. I told her she didn't has to stay in our hometown but she wanted to.  I wanted her to live her own life and be happy without feeling stuck there. She ends up moving to Nashville and has a new boyfriend. She seems really happy and I'm really happy for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm now a senior in college and I have I have been dating a girl for 6 months who is perfect. These past two weeks her friends have been finding out that their boyfriends have been messaging their ex's and cheating on them. She is super upset for her friends and is ranting to me about how shitty it is for those guys to reach out to their ex's. She feels as if reaching out to your ex is a horrible thing to do and shows a lack of commitment and trust. The thing is, i actually reached out to my ex 3 months back because her grandmother died. My ex was always super close to her grandmother and basically considered her grandmother he actual mom. So, I reached out to her and said (actual texts words for word)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Hey I'm really sorry to hear about your grandma. I know how close you were with her and how much you cared about her. I hope you're doing alright.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer: \"Not alright haha. I really appreciate you reaching out. Really means a lot and would mean a lot to her too.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never told her this and I always felt it was one of those things that better if I wouldn't tell her. I never talked to her again after that message. Every time I listen to her rants I just keep my mouth shut on how I've talked to my ex too because I don't want her to worry.",

      "description": "TLDR; Cut contact with high school friend because I didn't like hanging out with her anymore but she has anxiety and depression and really needs to hang out with friends to be ok.\n\nThis happened a couple of years ago but she appeared in my dreams two nights in a row and I think I might be feeling guilty.\n\nI (20F) was friends with this girl (19F) all throughout high school. She was fun and I knew from that time she already struggled with anxiety to the point of not being able to do some tests out of nervousness, but it was getting worse each year.\n\nWhen school ended we both went to college we kept hanging out. We would go to clubs, bars and the beach, always by her proposal. It wasn't really my thing, I rarely had fun at those outings and I would much prefer staying home alone in my computer. I knew she couldn't stand to stay home alone because she'd get anxiety attacks so I usually accepted it just to keep her company.\n\nBut I was getting more and more annoyed by wasting my time and money in places I did not enjoyed. Going out with her was tiring. And even when we'd stay in, she always wanted to do something I was not in the mood for and I counted the seconds until she left.\n\nSo I decided to turn down every proposal to hang out with her, hoping she would eventually stop trying. That went on for months and during that time, I found out she was doing much worse with her anxiety and now depression. It was paralyzing her life and I tried to offer some comfort through texts. I knew her she wasn't well, but I can't say I actually felt bad for her, my only concern was not being too much of an asshole by saying \"I don't want to be your friend anymore\", specially now that she was struggling with her mental health. I dreaded that conversation and the awkwardness of running into her after that.\n\nI kept texting her because I didn't mind it. But now her invitations were loaded with guilt-tripping about her wanting to hurt herself if she stayed home so she really needed me to go out with her. That's when I got repulsed and wanted to cut thing off as soon as possible.\n\nI struggled with finding words not to hurt her. So a basically said I did not feel comfortable hanging out with her anymore because we had grown apart and that if she ever wanted to vent or wanted advise, she could still talk to me. As I expected, she was really hurt to hear this and, to my surprise, she said she considered me her best friend, she was also a little offended by the offer to talk to her when she was bad as it would feel like I was doing it out of pity.\n\nShe vented about it to all of our mutual friends and some of them gave me the benefit of the doubt but when they asked me to explain, they were even more astonished by my coldness. I didn't lose lose any other friend because of this, but I'm sure they lost any admiration they ever had for me.\n\nAt the time I felt I really needed to do it but now I can't justify this behavior anymore.",

Our apartment is medium-sized with no guest room and has limited space. I am concerned with the limited space, but also that if they stay longer than a week, then it may bother my roommates who have their own lives and jobs and probably wast their own space, or maybe want to have friends over but may be put off by the presence of my parents.\n\nI want to ask my parents if they can find a hotel for the second week, but I know that they travelled far to see their child and AirBnB/hotels can be expensive in NYC.

      "description": "My boyfriend and I love to play-fight, roughhouse, wrestle, whatever you  call it. We just love this experience of competitiveness and the trust  we give each other to hit and allow the be hit without harm and to  grapple and wrestle.  \nHe being a man is naturally larger wider and  stronger with his 1,80M (6') against my short-ass with only 1,59 (5'2\"),  we are both former athletes from high school and are in-shape-ish, so  its not that easy of a fight, but he does have this natural advantage  over me, so to make things even try to turn his male aspect into a  disadvantage by hitting where it hurts I often try to hit him below the  belt to get an edge when I get a chance on the wrestle.  \nBeing highly  competitive and disliking to lose, it has become ALMOST my to go  strategy due to how trivial it is to apply, but that didn't actually  even things out, he usually gets me pinned before I can fully exploit  his male weak spot. Please don't think that I'm trading full out blows  and kicking and hitting him with all my force, I know it's a sensitive  area (and I might want to have fun with it later in the night) so I  wouldn't hit it hard IF hitting was permitted at all (it isn't), I give  it a slight tap, or punch, not enough to incapacitate him (most times)  but enough to break his posture and flinch on reflex.  \n\n\nI've  actually spoken with him about it and he said something along the lines  of \"As long as I can jack off later in the weekend and can walk  straight, I don't really mind it, be mindful of your force tho.\", but  the reason I'm making this post is...it feels cheap, I FEEL LIKE AN  ASSHOLE, it kind of feels like cheating on a game and when you get the  glorious victory its not glorious at all because you didn't win through  your skill but....through cheats, i hate to win but I also dislike  winning in this \"dishonorable\" way, that's why I put \"almost\" in all  caps before, it will never be my to-go strategy because it doesn't feel  that good, I still wanna beat him on skill and wrestle alone.  \n\n\nAnother  thing to mention, even tho there is some sort of powerplay to it, this  is not something that gets out of play time, in no way this should  resemble an abusive relationship, we are really set on differing what is  okay when we are playing and joking around and when we are having some  serious talk, we don't even have \"normal\" couple fights with yelling, we  sit on a couch and discuss in a really civil manner our problems when  we have one, so yeah, dick punching stays on the playmat.  \n\n\nSo Reddit, what is your say?   \n",

      "description": "I talk with a friend online and we‚Äôre both creative people and constantly coming up with silly ideas for short stories or characters. When we have a serious idea about a story or character we‚Äôll bounce plot or characterization ideas off each other for honest feedback. Since we‚Äôre both night owls we‚Äôre often up late messaging each other about ideas.\n\nI‚Äôve noticed however that when I give honest feedback to my friend about their plots and ideas they shut down and often change whatever their username is to something really upsetting and become incredibly blunt with me. (E.g ‚ÄúK‚Äù and for usernames it‚Äôs currently ‚Äúand set me free..‚Äù) \n\nToday they gave me an idea for a story about two people who are running away (For whatever reason) and meet two others along the way. Two of them are kids and become jealous of the women that joins. I told them that to me that description sounded kinda boring and that I personally prefer stories with more conflict but that‚Äôs just me and I thought that maybe instead of the conflict just being that there‚Äôs jealousy within the group that they have to learn to work together to run from whatever they‚Äôre running from. \n\nOur conversation went like this: \n\nMe: You know you don‚Äôt have to shut down when I give you feedback it‚Äôs nothing against you\n\nThem: Ik.\n\nMe: I‚Äôm just trying to help \n\nThem: cool.\n\nAfterwards they deleted their messages about their idea. And are still being blunt with me. \n\nAITA? \n",

      "description": "So I had gotten this summer job after returning home from university to make a little extra cash. I decided to work at this place because a couple of my friends worked there, this turned out to be a mistake on my part. I have social anxiety, which I have struggled with for years. I wouldn't say that it's severe, as I can have conversations and blend in relatively well without making any situation too awkward. However, I am terrible at starting convos and keeping them going. I often find myself at a loss for words, or I feel like it has run it's course. I am also prone to anxiety and panic attacks\n\nAs per most retail places where the goal is to selll, we had a quota to meet. As far as I know there was no real penalty for not meeting your quota, at least at this particular location, because I was never called out for it, and neither was anybody else. Nobody seemed to really care. \n\nIt would seem that my inability to keep conversations going hindered my sales goals. As I worked there for about three months and only met my goal four times. There were a few times where I barely missed it, but most of the time I made about 60 percent for the day on a four hour shift. I was very confused as to what to do most of the time, as I received conflicting information from my managers. Some of the managers wanted us to push ourselves onto the customer as much as possible, others wanted us to introduce ourselves and ask them if they needed help, and to let them do their own thing.\n\nSo one day, I'm just doing my thing and I make a sale after looking for a pair of shoes for about a minute or two, and afterwards one of the new managers, who we'll call Dave, pulled me aside and chastised me. Telling me that I need to get the merch out quicker, while also saying that my coworker who we'll call Victor, got shoes as quickly as twenty seconds.\n\nNow I think that was an unfair comparison, because at the time Victor was a manager and I was only working there for a month, he obviously knew the very large backroom better than I did. Next transaction, I bought out the shoes, made the sale, only to find out that Dave was timing me on his phone. He said it took me a minute to find the shoes and that it was too long of a time to take.\n\nAt this point my social anxiety started to take over and I was starting to have an anxiety attack. I went into the backroom so that no one would see and started hyperventilating. After collecting my thoughts, I went to Dave and told him politely but sternly that I was overwhelmed and that I wanted to quit. He told me to calm down and to not make any hasty decisions. \n\nI know it probably wasn't the best move to try and quit on the spot and I'm not proud of it in retrospect, but I still wasn't thinking too clearly at the time. He left me alone to do my job after this. AITA for putting him in a difficult situation and being unable to keep my composure in a professional environment?\n\n",

      "description": "To give some background, the houses in my neighborhood are spaced a bit apart, kind of like a normal suburb type feel. My house and the neighbor in question both have gigantic pine trees in our yards, I have two and they have about 4. These things are seriously monstrous and the pine needles are a nightmare.\n\nSo, a few weeks ago, we had some pretty bad weather: primary harsh winds and pelting rain. Because of this, many smaller limbs from the pines trees came down and littered pretty much everywhere. Since I've lived here for a while, it was something I was used to, I picked up the limbs from the yard and roof, whatever. \n\nWell a few days ago, I noticed that there was a small pile of limbs dumped onto the corner of my front yard closest to this neighbors house. Ever since, I have been getting more and more aggitated by this. I don't tend to let a lot bother me, but I feel like this was just a stupid slap in the face. He would have had to go around his front yard, pick up all of the branches, decided they were from my pine tree and dump them in my yard. I've left them there and I cant help but just want to dump them on his property. Part of me wants to dump them in his backyard, another wants to toss them all over his driveway and the last wants to just straight up dump them in front of his front door.\n\nWIBTA if I did any of the above since he felt the need to dump there limbs into my yard? Or should I just clean them up and secretly flip him off when I see him?",

      "description": "Another relationship one\nBackground; I (28M) have been close friends with L (30F) who I met through my best friend (28M), for about a year. Since the start of this year, we have been spending a lot of one-on-one time together, doing the sort of stuff you‚Äôd do on dates. Eventually I realised that I had started to see her as more than a friend. For context, L hasn‚Äôt dated anyone for almost a year. \n\nRecently, I told her how I felt. L responded that ‚Äò(after making her feel sick) she is only focused on her friendships right now, and that she sees me as a really good friend, and that she‚Äôd be happy for us to continue as we were‚Äô. I told her that I understand, and that I am happy to continue as friends - which I genuinely meant. The rest of that week, she basically replied with one word answers when I tried talking to her. \n\nAs it were, I had a 2.5 week long overseas holiday pre-booked, starting that same week, so we didn‚Äôt talk while I was away.\n\nI got home the week of her birthday (3 weeks after I told her how I felt), which I had organised. Things seemed okay as far as I could tell, and we had a good night - L wasn‚Äôt super drunk or anything. \n\nThe weekend just past was the first opportunity we‚Äôve had to talk. L told me that at her birthday she‚Äôd asked the bartender for his number. She told me that this was something way outside her comfort zone, that she didn‚Äôt think she had the confidence to do. L said she didn‚Äôt want me to hear it from anybody else, because there were a few friends who saw, out of ‚Äòrespect‚Äô. To me, it felt like that was an attempt to save face. And it hurt. \n\nI was honest and told her that what she did really hurt - that I trusted her to be completely honest with me to begin with. If she had originally said that she didn‚Äôt see us as being compatible, I was okay with that. I told her that I needed space - because she did hurt me. She made the choice to get his number, and look for something I couldn‚Äôt give her, 3 weeks after she told me she wasn‚Äôt looking for anything more than friends. I know it was only a number &amp; I genuinely don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs happened since, but the intent was to find something more than a friend. To me, that was dishonest. L replied that I was being irrational, and she couldn‚Äôt actually believe my behaviour. AITA?\n\nTLDR: told a close friend I had feelings for her, she said that she was not looking for anything. 3 weeks later she gets the number of a bartender at her birthday, which I‚Äôd organised. I told her I need some space. AITA?",

I listened to her of course and tried to help and make her less sad. It was sad for me also, later i was happier but when we were spending our last minutes together before going to our homes, i was sad. When i was walking back home, i texted her saying that i feel better and it's just that talking about her situation was sad and kinda hard for me. She said that it sounds like i wanted to tell her that the today talk was tiring for me and that she said that it's bad that i focus on my mood when she is in a bad spot and she feels bad (she said it in a more ironic way, suggesting what i said and not saying it as i did). When i was saying that i felt better,  i wanted to make my gf less sad, i thought she might be happier reading that from me. She said that it's obvious why i felt sad earlier (hard talk) and before leaving (usual sadness while spending last minutes with a loved one knowing that you'll have to go). I thought that she may be worried nonetheless, that's why i said that i feel better, i didn't mean to focus on my mood more, i know that it's normal that people feel bad while talking about such things. I just wanted to make her happy by saying that i felt better, and when i said that it's just the talk that was hard for me, i meant that there is nothing more that made me sad, i wanted her not to worry, that's all, but it turned out to be a complete failure judging by my gf's reaction. Is what i did bad? AITA?",

When I messaged him about what happened, he called me about it and explained how the allegations with his ex friend was exaggerated and how they had digitally manipulated the screenshots. He also explained that another story tag wasHis ex friend took down the story after she was exposed. I initially decided to stay neutral and informed him about it but other model stories started coming out. \n\nYesterday, I saw a story from a particular model who has worked with him in the past blasting him for posting a photo of her on his Instagram page without credit while she was blocked by him. I‚Äôm quoting from her social media, ‚ÄúAfter all of it, he continued to reach out to me and other models in *took out the location because privacy purposes* (especially in my living environment) in order to gain credibility. None of us have responded and since, and thus, he continues to disrespect us down the line...Plenty of girls who have worked with him have been sexually harassed during his shoots, as well as manipulated into shooting implieds in order to get them into these situations. I do not want our new generation of models to think this is okay.‚Äù (For non-photographers: implied means photos where nudity is suggested but not specifically showing the state of undress) \n\nWith all of the allegations coming out of the woodwork, I feel conflicted now as to whether or not I should cut him off and even just how to do so if I chose to. I don‚Äôt want my professionalism to be compromised by supporting this photographer but we‚Äôve been friends for several years. \n\nTLDR: A friend has multiple allegations of sexual harassment against him in the creative community. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be the asshole for cutting him off.  \n\n",

      "description": "I am a woman in my mid-thirties working in a white-collar job. Last week we had our performance reviews and I find out that my client did not give me a good review... He chalked it up to lacking good presentation at the office. I was not dressing professionally enough apparently. This *really* pissed me off because this standard is not applied to women in the work place. Men have it so easy, all they have to do is wear a simple button up shirt and pants and they are in the clear. UGGH! Why do we not have double standards in the office people? This gender role stuff really needs to go away.\n\nOver the weekend I go buy all new clothes at a high-end department store. Let's say, I was feeling a bit spiteful when I was picking out my clothes. I decided to purchase some clothes that would be \"professional\" *and... fun?* Anyways, there wasn't any commotion on Monday about my new belted dress, good. Tuesday and Wednesday pass and I get a few more smiles than normal with my slim fitting, low back dresses, good. Today, I decided to up the ante and wore a miniskirt, a plaid top and braided my hair in pigtails. All of this mind you is within company dress code... while I was leaving a meeting earlier today my now ex-colleague laughed at one of my jokes then put his hand on my lower back as we were leaving the room and walking down the hallway. Sure, a funny joke was made, but he kept putting his FREAKING hand there as we were walking and talking down the hallway. gross gross gross\n\nSo, I told my boss that I was sexually assaulted as a result of following his request to dress more professionally... he said that this will result in dismissal if the story is corroborated during the OMBUDs investigation. To give some background on this guy, he is technically at the same level as my boss in the company but I do not work under him (no flipping pun intended, Reddit). Hence, I did not feel comfortable saying anything while it was happening, imagine scrunched up shoulders and walking briskly. Apparently others saw this whole exchange as we were the first to leave the meeting. He was is now on leave while legal and HR sort this out. SERVES HIM RIGHT and I REALLY am itching to talk about my performance review when the opportunity comes up.\n\nThe moral dilemma that I am having is that this is beef that I had with my boss and it seems that there was an unintended casualty in the process, shall we say collateral damage? More than that, I feel like I encouraged him to jump on this metaphorical landmine as my body language (eye contact and physicality) might have encouraged the action. But the issue stands that it was still technically an unsolicited sexual touch, which is not an issue that men face in the office. So am I an asshole for getting my colleague at a minimum suspended to possibly fired? ",

      "description": "To give you guys some info, my little brother was sent to a rehab facility for drugs. He mostly smoked weed but started experimenting with a bunch of different drugs. He was doing Xanax, painkillers, drinking while doing these, etc. My brother thinks I‚Äôm one to never tell on him, I think it‚Äôs partly because I smoke weed and am not considered a tattle tale. That being said I‚Äôve told him numerous times that the pills and all the bullshit he‚Äôs been doing is going to kill him. \n  \n While he was on a home visit, he was trying to get me to find him pills, weed, etc. and I don‚Äôt condone it. I‚Äôve told him that while I don‚Äôt have a problem with marijuana, I‚Äôm not going to enable his behavior. I‚Äôm a MMJ patient and everything I‚Äôve been doing has been legal. My mom has expressed this to him and I keep it all away from him etc. He‚Äôs a sophomore in high school and that does make it illegal for him. \n\n  I expressed these concerns to my mom. I told her he was trying to find these pills and what not and she swore she wouldn‚Äôt sell me out for telling her this. After all I just want what‚Äôs best. \n\n As soon as he got out of that facility my mom immediately told him and I‚Äôm still pretty mad about it. She lied to me and I told her I don‚Äôt want a thing to do with her. I‚Äôm out of the state and will be until February as I‚Äôm attending school. She just told me if I don‚Äôt like it move out. So that‚Äôs what I want to do, I want to go move in with my dad when I‚Äôm home until I can find residency myself. I haven‚Äôt talked to her and pretty much have ignored her since. I‚Äôm mad but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being an asshole or if I‚Äôm acting reasonably. \n\nTIA",

      "description": "Throwaway account!\nI'm sorry about the title sounding bad, but please hear me out!\n\nI've been friends (now ex-friends) with this guy, we'll call him Dean, for about 2-3 years until it happened. We got to know each other because of a mutual friend of a common interest. He was great! We hit it off and we have a lot in common. We would play videogames together and other stuff. It came to the point where we would have inside jokes with each other and stay up all night talking about memes or what not. Well, I've been getting hints here and there that apparently Dean has a crush on me (at the time) and was a bit worried because I don't see him that way, only as a big bro (he's 5 years older than me). Some months go by and it's valentines, he confessed to me. I let him down gently and talked about how I hope to not lose him as a friend because he's fun to be around and he is like an older bro. He said sure and stayed friends for a bit or so I thought. He started to distance himself and talked less. Later he told me he couldn't handle being around me anymore. It broke my heart that I was losing a dear friend and fought for him to stay. (Selfish I know, but he was part of our friend group that I'd hate to tear apart).\n\nAlmost a year go by and I thought his feelings for me faded and things are normal again. I met my then boyfriend (ex now) at the time, and I was pretty open with him to the friend group. Dean met him and we spent time together as a group along with other friends. Though he started becoming a jerk, he's treating my ex like a threat and would always make him feel out of place. After awhile, I heard from our mutual friend that Dean told them that he plans to take himself off the group (again). I got mad at how he reacted and thought that was selfish of him to leave everyone because of how he felt towards me. He brought up several guy friends that I have whom he also met and hung out with (one of them was gay) and how I was \"too close with them\" and that he always feels jealous when they're around me. He told me he never got over me and that he can't deal with the situation and wanted to leave. I finally got tired and said that I won't stop him anymore so he can go if he wants to if our friendship along with everyone else meant nothing to him. He told me he's sorry and he plans to stay. \n\nAt that time I was tired of always keeping myself on his terms and decided to just just stop being friends with him. Our mutual friends understood and most of them said it's alright and it's for the best. He said he's always there for me afterwards, but I just couldn't handle that drama anymore and I haven't spoken to him since. \n\nHe's nice, kind and a fun person except for the times where he was breathing down my neck when other guys appear in my life. Though AITA for breaking off our friendship after telling him that I'd think he was a jerk for trying to do it to me and our friends?\n",

      "description": "To summarise - Over the last couple of years I've completely withdrawn from my old circle of friends, most of whom I grew up with and have mostly known each other since primary school. I work away from home, so we're all used to me being away for months at a time, but then when I come back I'd usually spend plenty of time with everyone. A couple of the lads did almost a year in prison in 2016, and I was one of the only people who'd go and visit them as regularly as I could when I was home, and since they got released I've only spent a few hours with them on one occasion.\n\nI never made a conscious decision to stop seeing or talking to them, it just kind of happened. I stopped making any effort to keep in touch with people, to make arrangements to see people, etc... I just kind of decided I've got my own things I need to focus on. I feel guilty saying it but I actually feel so much better for it. They were never causing me any problems but I think I started to feel my energy being drained as none of them really had anything productive going on, while I'm the only one who's always had a decent career. \n\nA couple of them have messaged me asking if I'm pissed off with them for something they don't know about, that 2 years without seeing them must mean something's obviously wrong. Not that I feel I owe any explanation but I tried to explain without offending them that I just don't have time, after spending most of my time away I've always got other, more important, things to be doing with what little time I have at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTruth be told, I just prefer my own company.",

She is incredibly accomplished in her field and did him a lot of good. But she arrogantly overruled GS and may be banned from Dad‚Äôs facility because GS has that power. ES nastily told GS she was a jealous and angry loser, her life wasn‚Äôt in order and GS needed to be silent and digest what she had been told and make pertinent changes in her life.\n \nThe next morning ES started in on me. I was a loser, angry and jealous and I needed be quiet and reflect on my behavior. Her life was in order, unlike mine. Perhaps I shouldn‚Äôt have laughed, but it was too early for wine. I told ES that I would stop talking when I was done. There was a 25 minute battle of wills. She insisted I shut up and I insisted she was not in control of me. I won.\n \nAs we visited Dad‚Äôs facility she started up AGAIN just before we reached his room (so I would have no opportunity to respond). I told her that if she was going to be a bitch we just wouldn‚Äôt talk, pivoted into the nearest senior restroom, and slammed the door in her face. She went away.\n \nAt lunch she lectured Dad that by indulging his little pleasures (casino) he would leave no inheritance (true). I told her ‚ÄòShut up, ES. We aren‚Äôt getting a dime. Deal with it.‚Äô\n \nThe next day we shared Dad‚Äôs car to the airport. She drove. Yes, I know better. I told her she had alienated GS and might want to mend fences but she cut me off and said if I spoke again she would put me out of the car. I contemplated calling the police since it wasn‚Äôt even her car. Instead I put in earphones and remained silent until we arrived, then got out and left without a backward glance.\n \nThe problem? In 4 months we visit our elderly mother and Mom always arranges a shared room for us. I will never be alone with ES again. Not going to make it a big deal, just stay with my uncle instead. But I know ES will make an issue of it which will pain Mom. She is an expert at this.\n \nAm I the Asshole? I could just suck it up. My parents won‚Äôt be around forever, but I‚Äôm only human. Unlike ES.",

      "description": "This happened a couple years or so ago, when I first met my mates girlfriend. The three of us were out with another mutual friend of ours, and we were all getting along well. We leave this club we're in and go to this small dinghy pub/club nearby. We chill there for a couple hours and at this point we're all pretty drunk. I get myself a fish bowl type drink that could quench the thirsts of a hundred gazelles. We're at a table and a few people join us who we don't know. I go to introduce myself, and inadvertently knock over a drink. Most goes on the floor but some goes on my mates girlfriend. I apologise and go to get some napkins. But before I do, in retaliation, she throws her drink on me, which was about a third full. Most of it hits my lap and she and my mate start laughing. So in my drunken state I feel i must retaliate further, so I pick up this fish bowl and pour the whole thing on her. This thing was so full she probably could've jumped in and swam about. \n\nSo she's fucking drenched and I'm kinda laughing. She gets up and storms outside. My friend goes out after her. I get a text asking me to come meet them outside. When I get there, they're arguing with the bouncer. The bouncer wasn't letting them back in because she was too wet. I try bargaining with the bouncer but to no avail. I looked at them, shrugged and went back inside\n\nDon't see them the rest of the night, but it was about half 2 so most places were closing soon anyway. Get a text the next morning saying I'm a cunt for pouring a drink on her and then leaving them.\n\nSo, AITA?",

(Probably in her 60s, I'm a guy in my late 20s) Coincedentally, I've worked with her before in a nursing home (rather small area) and always thought she was a pretty nice woman despite she clearly didn't recognize me.\n\nI was pumped at the find and offered her the second bill saying something like \"Hey, check it out! Wanna split the loot?!\"\n\nShe looks totally aghast and says \"Oh we can't do that! We have to turn that in!\"\n\nI say \"oh...uh...okay..\" and handed them to her.\n\nI can't imagine that being the right thing to do. If it was a wallet, absolutely. Something identifiable to the person who lost it, totally. But two loose bills at 5 am? Who the hell is gonna come back trying to claim that?

      "description": "Backstory: She and I have been together for just over 3 years. We both graduated college 1.5 years ago. We both wanted to get out of this town immediately after graduating, but she had an opportunity to further her education just after graduation. We decided to stay for the extra year and a half, with the agreement that we would leave as soon as she finished school. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs finally just about time for her to graduate.

However, in the medical field, you generally don‚Äôt get hired for less than a year. I really don‚Äôt want us to have to live 8 hours apart for the next 1+ years, especially since we are supposed to be starting our lives together. Additionally, I have really bad experiences from a past long-distance relationship, and absolutely do not want to go through that again. \n\n\nHer mother also keeps encouraging her to take the job and do long-distance. She‚Äôs a military wife, and has spent years apart from her husband at a time.

      "description": "First off, using a throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\n\nThis is a bit of a rant, so prepare yourselves;\n\n\nA few years ago, when I was a freshman in High School, I found out a girl I was friends with had a crush on me. I told her (in more words) that I wasn't ready for a relationship yet, and she seemed to understand. A little bit later, she dated someone else, but they broke up, and she kind of talked to me on and off after that, but I never really saw her. We'll call this girl \"Girl A\", for the story's sake. A year or two later, I met another girl, Girl B, and we also became friends, along with two other people in a kind of small \"friend group\". We grew as friends, but similar to Girl A, I never really hung out with her.\n\n\nFast forward to this year. I've never been to a school dance through all of middle or high school, and it's my last year of high school. I want to go to homecoming, but I want to have a date. I figure it wouldn't be a bad idea to ask Girl A to homecoming, since we're still on good terms, and I know she at least *used* to like me. I decide to talk to my closest friend who is a girl (not to be confused with a girlfriend) for advice, Girl B. Girl B talks to Girl A beforehand to find out for me if she'll say yes, and then helps me figure out how to ask Girl A to Hoco, which I do. She says yes. However, I want her to know it's as friends, so I make sure to mention that. Following Homecoming, Girl A is talking to me more and seeming to get closer to me, but I try to be clear we're just friends. All of the sudden and out of nowhere, a member of the friend group with Girl B in it reveals to me that Girl B was sad I didn't ask her to homecoming, because she has a massive crush on me. I'm flattered, but when I talk to Girl B about it, I give her a similar \"I'm not sure how to feel about it\" response.\n\n\nNow comes the really complicated part.\n\n\nI go through a pretty hard bought of depression, and Girl B is super nice and helpful, and comforts me throughout. I grow closer to her, and we become semi-official \"boyfriend &amp; girlfriend\". Of course, being the loser that I am, I tell people that I now have a girlfriend to feel better about myself (Girl B doesn't mind, she thinks it's cute). At the same time, I begin to realize Girl A still has a crush on me, and a dilemma strikes when they both ask me to hang out on the same day. Being the completely rational and intelligent person I am (sarcasm), rather than dealing with it, I decide to tell both I am busy, and go to park by myself instead. Obviously, I need to deal with this, but I don't, because I'm very shy and antisocial about it, and I don't know what to say. However, today, I mentioned to someone from my homecoming group that I had a girlfriend. From what I can tell, she went and told Girl A, who really likes me at this point, but I was stupid to let it go on like that, and now Girl A has left the long-lasting homecoming group chat saying she \"doesn't belong there\" and it was \"a mistake to join\". Obviously this is scary and freaks me out, since she's still my friend, but she's not responding to anyone, from texts or calls. \n\n\nI finally got over most of my depression and a ton of drama recently after most of my closest friends left me suddenly &amp; without warning for a different friend group entirely. Girl B helped me through that. Now, I'm worried about this. I really don't want to fall back into that rut, and I really, really hate drama like this, but I don't know what to do. I'm also especially worried about Girl A, because I'm afraid she might A. Hate me for this,  B. Do something bad to herself, or C. Create more drama around me in some way. But I don't know what to do, and I never see her, so I can't confront her about it. It's 11 pm and I'm kind of freaking out about it, I just wish High School would hurry up and end and I could leave all this drama and messiness behind, but it just seems to follow me wherever I go.\n\n\nSo the question is; am I the asshole for letting this go on? I know I should've said something, but is it my fault that this is happening?\n\n\nTl;dr: I took a girl who used to have a crush on me to homecoming, then found out a different girl liked me. I started going out with her, but the girl I took to homecoming didn't know, still likes me, and completely isolated herself when she found out today that I was dating someone.",

Janet is \"still\" addicted to drinking day in and day out. When we found out she was pregnant I begged her to stop as it would harm the baby and would cause extreme disorders and addiction for the baby if it is born. It is already far enough into the abortion where the doctor said the baby will have a brain damage and physical disorders. \n\n We had found out she had a baby and now she wants to keep the baby and keep drinking regardless of the damage it will do to the baby's life. The year before her sister had aborted her baby as a way of getting revenge on her husband when they were pregnant and were going through a fight. \n\nHer sister is extremely pro-choice and thinks that the women should have the say in if the baby should be born or not. I am 100% sure she brainwashed Janet that she should do whatever she wants with the baby and Janet decided she will keep it (because she knows how much it will hurt me). When we had went to counseling she spewed out things saying it was her body, her choice and she could keep drinking as much as she wanted. On top of this Janet kept referring to the baby as a fetus as if she had no concern for its life and it is just a part of her body like a toe and would chop it of for some more cash.  \n\nI am extremely depressed right now my mom just died end of last year and now Janet is ruining my future. I don't want a baby born who is brain dead and filled with disorders (it is not a life I would want to live neither would anyone else) and I will have to pay alimony in order for her to live without working using the baby as a tool.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I will get a lot of crap for saying that I should have a say in the baby's future too and I should have a say in whether we should have an abortion.

We had always been close, working same jobs, hanging out a lot etc, but some months ago he asked me to move in with him because his previous roommate was bad at paying rent on time and just generally didn‚Äôt contribute to the house. I said no, I had reservations; he is bisexual,  and had a thing for me. But he kept asking over time, pretty much coming to the point where he was begging me to move in because he wasn‚Äôt sure how long he would be able to pay the rent alone. So I finally agree. I made sure he left any idea of being ‚Äòtogether‚Äô at the door, as I am heterosexual, and he was on board. I moved in and everything went smoothly for a bit. Fast forward a little, we‚Äôve been there a few months, and he says he needs to talk to me, so I sit down with him and we start talking and he hits me with the ‚ÄúI was offered a job in a different city‚Äù line.  Immediately I start stressing, texting everyone I know looking for another living arrangement for myself and my pet without a second thought. He tells me I have  a little under two weeks to figure something out.\n\nNow let me clarify that I‚Äôm not mad he got a better job and left, I‚Äôm angry that I had a great place before he begged me to move in, I move in, pretty much immediately get kicked out, and then I‚Äôm the one up shits creek because he already has his plans all laid out.  He was apologizing profusely but I didn‚Äôt really want to hear any of it, so over the next week I packed all my shit up into my truck, and while he was at work, I left, leaving the key to the place on the counter.  I am currently living on a couch. I had to leave my car with my mother for about two months (the longest I had ever been without him) until I figured something out. I‚Äôm fortunate to even have the couch I do now. This happened a few months back and Im just now getting back on my feet fully. Anyway, we shared a lot of coworkers, and now a few of them are acting like they don‚Äôt understand my frustration, saying I shouldn‚Äôt have stopped talking to him, etc. he still comes into the place I work from time to time and tries to talk to me but I usually just ignore him.\n\nTLDR; friend begs me to move in with him, I take a leap of faith and agree, he moves out a couple weeks later with no option for me to stay.

      "description": "Despite the fact that this happened several years ago now, I still feel like an asshole because of all of the drama that ensued from this event.\n\nSo. I was out drinking with a friend. Let's call him M. M divulged that he had cheated on his girlfriend a few times with someone who lives in his hometown while he was visiting his parents. He likes exploring different partners, but he wants to someday get married to C, his girlfriend. He stressed to me that I shouldn't tell C. \n\nA few weeks later, I was talking about this occurrence to my friend who I'll refer to as 'S.' I was asking S his opinion on whether or not I should tell C. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have told anyone better yet S, but C has mentioned being rather unhappy with C. After years of being mistreated by M and feeling fed up with his crap myself, I thought maybe C needed to know. However, S told me to leave it alone. I thought it was all done and thought nothing more of it.\n\n\n Later that week, we were all at a party together- me, C, M, and S, and some other friends. S begins to hit on C. It seemed casual and in somewhat good fun, so I didn't think too much of it. At some point, I got too drunk, so I went to go take a nap. While I was napping, S sloppily confessed his romantic interest to C and then told everyone at this party that I told him what M said to me that night. He wanted to 'save' C from M. \n\nThe night ended with C breaking up with M (to be expected). As a result, M and I are not friends anymore (which was also be expected and frankly, I'm fine with), and I don't really talk to C or S anymore either. However, I lost almost all of my old friends who hang out with M, as they all blame me for splitting the two of them up.\n\nAITA? ",

Then he calls me in, tells me to sit down and basically reiterates the same thing previous but in a more stern tone. Then he starts going off rambling saying how my attitude to schoolwork isn‚Äôt what it used to be (he hugged and praised me for the grades on my report card not only a week ago as I‚Äôm a straight A student) and started to say stuff like ‚Äúif you want to quit after your exams and go get a deadend job, living under our roof you will be paying rent and I don‚Äôt give a fuck, go right ahead.

It‚Äôs not like my path in school is putting a strain on his physical well-being, he just gives off a lot for no reason.\n\nI eventually get away after just under an hour and when I go upstairs I vent to my friend about the absolute bullshit waste of time and how everything he said could‚Äôve been summed up in 3 sentences, not 3 full essays vented slowly and sternly. I also said I‚Äôm sick of being told about my attitude and heavy-breathing and to watch it, and that I‚Äôm sick of everything revolving around school.

He came down and basically said he‚Äôs ‚Äúvery disappointed in me‚Äù, I‚Äôm apparently ‚Äúunloyal‚Äù because he would never ‚Äúrip the arse out of me‚Äù behind my back to his friends etc.\n\nHe said he was finished and that from now on he‚Äôll pass himself with me but he won‚Äôt give me anymore ‚Äúpep talks‚Äù\n\nMy friends say I‚Äôm not the asshole but if he‚Äôs so severely disappointed in me for ‚Äúslandering him‚Äù behind his back, who do I believe?

      "description": "I met this girl 10 days ago in the hostel I'm staying at. She directly acted like she was very into me, over the next few days she kept messaging me, wanted to hangout together all the time, hugging me, kissing me on the cheek, the kind of physical proximity you do not show to a total stranger for no reason.\n\nIt was going way too fast, I suspected something was wrong here. I know some girls are gonna act like this with every guys because they like the attention and feeling desired. I didn't try anything with her, decided to wait and see.\n\nWe were having drinks at the bar with other friends and she left after one beer because she didn't wanted to get drunk or party\n She came back at the hostel, other dudes invited her to go clubbing, she took mdma an made out with one of them. I found out the next day and was not even mad, more like \" I fucking knew something was off\". The problem is that she somehow wanted to talk to me about it ( I didn't ask her nothing, she initiated it).\n\nShe told me she didn't call me to go clubbing with her that night because she knew what was gonna happen with that guy and she was sorry. That pissed me off a bit. She knew exactly how she was acting with me and how it made me develop an attraction for her, and now I had the impression to get rejected without even making the first step! A bit like \" you didn't try anything but if you did you wouldn't have succeeded\". Wtf?\n\nI told her we were cool. She proceeded to start hugging me and kissing again. I rejected her, saying it wasn't an appropriate behaviour, that playing with boys feeling is wrong, and to leave me alone.\n\nTwo days later she messaged me again, telling me she found a place nearby looking for staff (she knows I'm looking for a job), and she wanted me to come visit a sharehouse with her. She was very helpful and apparently wanted to apologize by helping me. She kept saying things like \"can we please be friends again?\". Keep it mind I know this person for less than a week.\n\nI eventually saw her today, went to say hi, asked about the flat viewing tomorrow, then said goodbye and went on with my job hunt. 5 minutes later I receive a page long message from her, accusing me of being too cold with her, not friendly enough, that usually only friends are moving in together, that she regrets telling me about the flat, and some other crazy shit. I was speechless. I went back to her and was like what the actual fuck is this? I told her that she was completely insane, that we barely know each other and she send me fucked up messages as if she was my crazy jealous ex girlfriend. I told her she had a very weird obsession with being my friend and I'm not okay with it. I called her a psychopath and told her to leave me alone and stop talking to me or messaging me. We were in the street, some People were looking at us, she was embarrassed.\n\nAm I being the asshole here or did I just made sure to keep a psychopathic stranger out of my life?",

      "description": "A bit of backstory, I live with my mother full-time now, because she has a neurological condition that affects her motor skills and vision, among other things. Due to this, doing basic tasks, such as eating, can be a challenge for her. When I leave for work in the evening, I leave a plate of food for her on the table to eat around dinner time. Typically I arrive home to a mess on and around the table, which I don't mind. \n\nThe problem is, a few nights ago she brought a slice of coconut cake in a take-out box from a restaurant. She left it on the table for ease of access I assume, and when I came home I found the usual mess along with a half-eaten slice and crumbs everywhere. So, assuming she was done with it, I cleared the table and threw the rest of the cake away. The following morning she actually became frustrated with me that I tossed the cake and we got into a nasty back and forth. She could of simply put it in the fridge or microwave. On top of that, I've been spotting small roaches in the kitchen late at night so I've been trying to keep it as clean as possible, especially overnight. She knows this, but maintains that I still should of at least asked her about it first.\n\nAs I said, I understand that she makes a bit of a mess when she eats, but I draw the line at purposely leaving food out. I don't feel that I need to check with her for every piece of food that may or may not go in the trash.",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to break up with my ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô and start seeing other people?",
      "description": "      I know it looks bad that I put the word girlfriend in quotation marks but bear with me for a second. My ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô and I have only been together for a few months and unfortunately I think it was a few months too many. \n\n      We met over the fact we both shared an interest of writing stories with fictional \ncharacters on Tumblr. Someone, who is no longer on the site, invited me to join a Skype group. Same thing would occur there but just on a different platform. I was excited since that would be a new group of people to interact with so I gladly accepted. Boy did I make a mistake.\n\nAt first all went well. I met some new people, shared ideas for future stories and etc. There were a couple times someone had to leave due to the way they acted or they just simply left because they got bored or busy. In just a year there were only three people left; Myself, Someone we will call C and my ‚Äògirlfriend‚Äô who we will call L.\n\n      During the course of that year I informed L, who I wasn‚Äôt dating just yet, that my dog had unexpected puppies and one still needed a home. I jokingly asked her if she wanted it even though it would take a 12 hour drive to get here. Without missing a beat she said yes so I promised to save her the remaining puppy. \n\nShe made the drive up here a month after that conversation and we had dinner at a local steakhouse not too far from the hotel she was staying at. I spent about an hour with her to help collect some things for the puppy after the dinner before she had to go back to the hotel with it. It was getting late so after the little shopping trip she had to go to the hotel to sleep so she would be able to make the trip home. As soon as L got home safely, she shot me a message saying so and I just responded with something like ‚ÄòGlad you made it home okay, enjoy your new puppy!‚Äô\n\n      Time rolled on and things were working out fine. L loved her new puppy and sent me pics of it playing with her other dog who was about the same small size. I was just happy that she was and that her first dog had a little playmate. Fast forward to just a week and that‚Äôs when things started to move downhill. Not only did L have a dog before the puppy, she also had rats. The new puppy, being a type terrier, was not fond of them like her other dog. She had to re-home them as a result. I felt bad and apologized but she said it was no big deal so I dropped the subject.\n\n      Now let‚Äôs move forward a lot more, like all the way to last year in November. I found out she had a liking towards me and I‚Äôll be honest, I really liked her as well. We shared a lot of the same interests and thought it was neat both of us had quite a few things in common. Being asexual was one of them; this will be important later.\n\nI asked her out and she said yes, so of course I was looking forward to being in a relationship with her for a long time. Nothing was really different though, there was no part of the relationship that defined it as a girlfriend boyfriend type of ordeal. It sorta just felt like a deeper friendship. \n\n      Just a month ago I realized I wasn‚Äôt asexual at all, and that my ex just made me feel that way since he was a borderline creep about things related to sex (which we never did, thank god I dodged that bullet). I haven‚Äôt said anything to her because I really care about her, and I told myself that living without sex really wasn‚Äôt a big deal. Not having it wasn‚Äôt going to kill me in the end. \n\nGo back to a few weeks ago, she informed me that her landlord of her apartment told her she couldn‚Äôt have the now full grown puppy because he never stops barking and there were many complaints. She was in tears when she told me this so I stupidly told her to bring it back and she did just last week. She left about two days ago and this dog is a real thorn in my side. My family already has too many dogs to take care of in the first place, and he doesn‚Äôt get along with most of them. He‚Äôs not house trained and looks at my ferret like she‚Äôs his new chew toy. She told me yesterday she couldn‚Äôt take him back after all so my mom looks at it like ‚Äògreat, we have ANOTHER dog.‚Äô\n\n      Now I feel stuck. I like this girl but the lack of just something like handholding, innocent cheek kisses and snuggling when she was here when it was just us became another thorn in my side. The dog seemed to be my breaking point, I haven‚Äôt had any sleep ever since he was dumped off on us and my only hopes for sleep is my job that is all week at my sister‚Äôs. I‚Äôm a babysitter/kinda a nanny so I only come home on the weekends. So honestly, it‚Äôs not fair to my mom either since she cares for the dogs before work and after while I‚Äôm gone all week. \n\nI want to tell L how I truly feel about all of this but knowing her past with previous partners kinda makes me feel bad that I‚Äôll be just become another name on her break up list.",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\nSo I feel the need to take this to reddit because I've been having quite the mental health crisis recently and seem to be incapable of thinking rationally at the moment and the other people in my life only seem to be telling me what I want to hear at the moment.\n\n\nBoyfriend has done his best to support me through said mental health crisis however it has understandably had a toll on him too. We have argued numerous times throughout this but were always able to reconcile our differences in what I would consider to be a mature manner. I feel we both have the attitude that the relationship is worth more than the argument and are this able to forgive each other despite feelings hurt in the moment. \n\n\nThe mental health crisis started brewing as far back as June/July when I started at my current job. I am a junior NHS nurse in one of the busiest hospitals in London and work in an extremely busy unit. My manager for want of a better word is a cunt and bullied me from day one. Other members of staff have done the same but my manager was the biggest culprit and has had the biggest impact on me psychologically. I began to make mistakes and said mistakes lead to self doubt. This self doubt quickly became crippling anxiety which lead to a deep depression and I had to take a significant period of sick leave. I have been fighting the urge to kill myself or self harm most days since August. I have returned to work on an informal performance management basis. I have reported the behaviour to my Lead Nurse (Matron) but was gaslighted. I am due to have a mediation meeting with my manager to discuss my concerns next month. \n\n\nMy boyfriend has encouraged me to move on to another job as he can see how miserable I have become throughout all of this but my parents encouraged me to stay because I left my previous post after only seven months and cannot keep \"running away\" when I run into difficult people. I needed their advice but now I feel broken. On top of the depression I have chronic fatigue syndrome and the toll that the emotion has taken on me has left me near bedridden on my days off. My room is a mess and I don't have the energy or the will to clean it and then I'm embarrassed for him to come home to it. I've put on a significant amount of weight that I am now struggling to even maintain as I have started an antidepressant that makes me starving all the time and I have PCOS that has always made it difficult for me to maintain a healthy weight anyway. This weight gain has effected my self esteem massively and I feel even uglier and even less desirable than I already did.\n\n\nI can understand why all of these things could be pushing him away.  I know that I cannot ask him to accept me for all of my flaws and not accept his in return. However I am feeling like his behaviour could be more supportive than it has in the past two weeks or so. \n\n\nWe have been together since last summer and have been best friends from the day we met. I moved to London to be with him in November of last year. We had a break up lasting approximately three weeks in February but got back together in March. We haven't spent a single night apart since then except for when I have visited family. He has for all intents and purposes moved into my room in my house share (yes he contributes to the bills). We had been talking as far back as April/May about moving in together and even viewed some places together in the summer. They wound up not working out for various reasons and then plans were put on hold when my my mental health started to deteriorate. If I barely had the energy to get out of bed how could I go to viewings and get a replacement tenant for my current room? However the prospect of living with him in a space all of our own has been one of the only things that has kept me going these past few months. My aspirations for my career had been completely shattered, along with my faith in my ability to do my job. I had no idea what my future held professionally. I had no idea what it looked like. But I did know that I would be with him. He had previously said that after a year of living together he felt he would propose, and that we'd move out to a cummuter town and hopefully by the time he's 30 (2021) be trying for kids and I could be very part time or a SAHM for a while. That glimmer of hope felt like the only thing that was keeping me going.\n\nCut to the 21st Novemeber and he tells me he no longer wants to make plans to move in together any time soon because he doesn't think that we have reached the point where we are able to argue 'maturely' yet because I had said that I had wanted space a couple of times during the darkest points of my depressoin. I never once 'kicked him out' or any similar dramatic behaviour of that kind even though he does have a rent free room that he could go to. I understoodthat I couldn't change his mind about it and that fighting with him about it in an attempt to do so would only push him away. I did however say that I felt that in out own plave we would be able to have a bit more space together as we would have more than just a bedroom to ourselves (even if our budget will likely only permit us a small place). I also cried. I cried and cried and cried. I couldn't help it. It felt like my future had been stolen from me by the person whom I wanted to share it with. He appeared legitimately taken aback at my emotional response, stating that \"[he] had no idea it meant so much to you\". He reassured me that it wasn't a precursor to breaking up and that he actually think that it would be good for the relationship. I responded that if he wanted to leave I would prefer that he did it sooner rather than later as it was very difficult to still occupy the same small space as him, knowing that he would rather be elsewhere. He asked if I would permit him to stay until today until he started looking as he is paid on the final Friday of every month. Bearing in mind that he has a room that he could go to in a property owned by his mother this irritated me. He stated that he didn't want to move back into that property as it would be embarrassing and he would feel unwelcome after living with me for so long. Last night he told me off for the mess in the room (I've recently had a huge influx of parcels because of Christmas present ordering) and stated that this was one of the reasons he wants a place of his own. I feel like if I pursue the conversation further or appear to be kicking him out I may lose him forever.\n\nSo to the title... I had a big interview today that realistically I had pinned way too much hope on. I am so ridiculously desperate to get away from my current job and it showed. I find out on Monday but I already know what the answer will be.\n\nStraight after I text him to update him. I'm not proud of the words I used because they probably read like I was just trying to prompt a reaction but I did mean them at the time. My exact words were, among others, \"definitely didn't get it\", \"no chance\", \"I'm never going to be able to leave\", \"I'm a failure\", \"want to fucking kill myself\". He responded with \"of course you are\" in response to me saying I'm never going to leave and then \"no you're not\" to my saying that I'm a failure. I then updated him that I had ordered an obscene amount of pizza when I got home, he said \"without me ffs\". Next time I hear from him is when he's getting off work at 17:13 \"I'm going out for a bit\", \"keep your phone near you\".\n\nHe is very popular at his workplace but does not usually take them up on their offers to go out on a Friday (or any other day really) as he prefers to come home and spend time with me. Obviously I want him to have a healthy social life beyond our relationship and I have actually frequently encouraged him to take them up on their invitations even where I am not invited too. I don't want him to stop getting them because of me. However I can't help but feeling like it is very bizarre that he would choose to leave me at home waiting on today of all days.\n\n\nI have continued to accommodate him despite a revelation that completely broke my heart. He knows I am having self-destructive thoughts. My career prospects are shit and I've become even more aware of this in light of this failed interview today. Am I being unreasonable to expect him to prioritise me over his friends that he complains about when he does go out with them? Or is his response only natural for someone with a partner who's losing it? I don't even know what is reasonable behaviour anymore. \n\n\nAlso, I start CBT next week. I asked for help months  ago but it takes a fucking long time to get seen on the NHS and I don't have the disposable income to go private.\n\n\n\n TLDR:\n\nWas desperate to do well at job interview today and fucked it. Texted boyfriend to update, went home, ordered pizza, cried. \n\nI am currently in a very serious depressive episode and am having self harming and suicidal thoughts every day, which he is aware of. He has put up with a lot of my shit, until today it seems. He just texted to say that he's going out to drinks with his work friends when he usually comes straight home (and has done so for the whole time that he has had this job, which predates this depression) \n\nI know that I cannot be my boyfriend's keeper however I am feeling abandoned at my time of need. \n\n\nAITA?",

Here's why:\n\nThis semester, he only showed up to practice once or twice a month (we usually have 2-3 practices a week). He never inputs any ideas when I ask the captains things regarding the team. Never let's us know if he isn't showing up to practice (at this point we just accepted the fact hes not gonna show up to practice). He doesn't show up to social things outside of practice (not requires, but all the other captains show their face at least for a little bit). And i think most people on the team lost respect for him (him not showing up to practice kinda became a meme). \n\nOur team doesn't have a coach or any other supervision. It's sort of relaxed, but still competitive. But because we don't have any supervision, I don't have anyone to turn to to say, \"hey I don't think he should run for captain again becaude of...^^^\". \n\nI have no authority to tell him that he can't be a captain again next year since technically we both have the same title and he can do whatever he pleases. At the same time, because we are a relaxed team, i guess it doesn't really matter if he is going to be a captain again, since the main captain does most of the work anyways.  \n\nSITS?\nTldr: one of the captains on the team isnt doing his job, I want to tell him he can't be captain again next year.

One of them let‚Äôs call him joe says that Jennifer Lawrence is the hottest person he has ever seen. Now I get that she is very successful and made herself famous and I do respect her but I said she‚Äôs not as hot as Kate Upton. Then I was told to post on reddit to get a opinion from people. So I thought where better to put a poll than on teenagers. I did so then was hit with a ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you treat them like people instead of objects‚Äù. To which I replied they are both very successful but I‚Äôm just asking who is hotter. AITA\n\nTLDR i think its okay to ask who is hotter Kate Upton or Jennifer Lawrence but reddit people think I‚Äôm a misogynistic loser. Also sorry for poor quality I wrote this in a time crunch",

      "description": "This happened maybe twenty minutes ago, i have a tip jar dedicated to all the tips i have saved up over the past year and had a decent amount of it rolled. I checked my jar to find a sizeable chunk taken out of it and almost all of my rolled quarters done. My first thought was that my brother did it.\n\nNow, there are only three other people in the house, my brother, our mother, and her boyfriend. \n\nMom always asks me if she ever needs money and her boyfriend has a job and makes his own money so he never needs my help. \n\n My brother is in his twenties and doesn't have a job but has the only working car in the house. He pays no bills and barely scrapes by. \n\nThis isn't the first time my money has gone missing. Every time it does I've gone to our mom and she's basically told me that she couldn't do anything to help. There has roughly been over 300 dollars stolen from me and i finally snapped. \n\nI went to my brother and told him to stay out of my room and to stay away from my money. He got mad and started saying how much of a terrible person i was for saying that he'd even think of stealing from me. A lot of harsh words were said and he stormed out of the house. My mom said i was out of line. \n\nI'm 19 if this helps at all\n \nDo you guys think I'm the asshole here? I feel like I need an outsiders view",

      "description": "So a little background on me, I was raised in the Evangelical church and went to Bible college and I‚Äôm pretty darn educated when it comes to theology. But I lost faith after studying it deeply enough. I stopped believing in God quite a long time ago. I don‚Äôt believe in the religious/metaphysical aspects of Christianity or the concept of sin (well, that it‚Äôs meaningful). But I never fully divorced from the moral teachings of Jesus Christ. I live my life in following of the red letter portions of the Bible to the best of my ability and I hold Jesus up as a great moral teacher. \n\nLately I‚Äôve been catching a lot of people who claim to be Christians talking about things that are not in the Bible. Okay mostly abortion. But there‚Äôs this trend of associating conservative politics with Christianity when the two in real life have no connection - and quite often a so-claimed Christian will say that you have to vote Republican because of abortion, but having read the Bible cover to cover, I can say with absolute confidence that abortion isn‚Äôt in there. It is clear to me, therefore, that people who say stuff like that are either ignorant or intentionally lying. To me it‚Äôs pretty clear that they aren‚Äôt real Christians if they‚Äôre going to make up their own laws and claim them as God‚Äôs - that‚Äôs putting yourself above the Bible and above God, which is blasphemy. Not that I intrinsically care about blasphemy or sacrilege. I don‚Äôt actually believe that these people are going to hell for their blasphemy, because I don‚Äôt believe there is a hell, although if there were in certain it would be mostly populated with people who called themselves Christian. \n\nAnyway, in a discussion/argument with one of these characters recently, I used the phrase ‚Äúfollower of Christ‚Äù to describe myself and to contrast myself with my opponent who clearly was not a follower of Christ but called himself a Christian. He replied by saying something irrelevant that included saying I call myself a Christian. Now I didn‚Äôt actually call myself a Christian, I haven‚Äôt applied that label to myself in ten years. I‚Äôve always felt that I shouldn‚Äôt, that it would be in some way sacrilegious or disrespectful. But now that I‚Äôm seeing all these assholes acting like assholes while calling themselves Christians, I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I should just take on the label to remove one avenue they use for ad hominem/attribution fallacy attack (‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt a Christian so what authority are you to talk about Christian beliefs?‚Äù). \n\nThere are other practical reasons I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I should just go ahead and declare myself a Christian, and possibly even go as far as publicly lie about my metaphysical beliefs. I‚Äôm considering going into politics in the future, and while we‚Äôve gotten as far as to elect a few openly gay people let night, we still don‚Äôt elect open atheists. So it would be politically expedient for me to claim to be a Christian. I‚Äôm going to have to join a church too, since you can‚Äôt run for office in America without being a member of a church. Claiming to be a Christian makes me feel kind of sleazy, kind of like an asshole for the potentially misleading claim. But really, I‚Äôm much more a Christian in the literal sense (I like Jesus and follow his teachings) than most people who claim the label, and most of them are assholes. \n\nWIBTA, other than by association, if I started calling myself a Christian despite actually being an atheist?",

      "description": "Me [M19] and my girlfriend [F19] have this thing we do where we pick out different move series that we watch in case we have nothing planned for the days that we hang out. Harry Potter is our 3rd movie series that we decided to watch because I had never seen the Harry Potter movies and she had seen them multiple times because it‚Äôs one of her favorites. Before that I chose the Lord of the Rings series because she hadn‚Äôt seen that one and it‚Äôs one of my favorites . Sometimes we have to cut our movie time short because one of us had to go back to our house or it was time for bed (if one of us are sleeping over) well the other day we had to cut ‚ÄúThe order of the Phoenix‚Äù short, about 45 minutes before it ended because she had to go back to her house and we wouldn‚Äôt see each other for a couple days later. Well the day after our movie time I was bored because it was my day off (were college students and I work a part time job) and I almost never have a lot of spare time. I decided to watch the last 45 minutes of the movie and I have to say it was pretty good. When I told her I finished the movie she seemed pretty upset, we didn‚Äôt fight or anything and there was no yelling or tears involved but she still looked pretty upset. And she had done  the same thing before when we watched the Lord of the Rings series on the Two Towers movie so I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal and didn‚Äôt care that she did it. I told her this but I still feel bad about the whole thing. Am I the ass?\n\nTL:DR: me and my gf watch different movie series with each other and I finished a movie without her. ",

I told them I wanted something third party, and they said ill have to pay for it.
