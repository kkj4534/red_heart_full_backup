      "description": "My wife and I have been together for 17 years and married for 15. One drunk evening, before we got married but were living together, we went out and got really drunk. She had a friend that knew the bartenders at a particular bar and they offered to let us stay after hours. I was tired and ready to go home so I went to warm up the car. I returned and the doors to the bar were locked. No answer on the bar phone, my wife’s phone or our friends we had come with. After freaking out I eventually went home and to bed. \n\nThe next day my wife returns home. I ask what happened and it’s clear she cheated on me but would not tell me the truth (she still won’t). \n\nI got over it and accepted that something happened but i loved her and would move on. So we got married. \n\n(I admit that this is when i should have left her.)\n\nYears later, after having our son, we separated during a difficult time. I got a call from her stating she found out she was pregnant. Well, I knew it wasn’t mine. I wasn’t comforting her at first because, fuck that bitch. Then we talked more and I made the decision to get back with her for our son and because I still do love her. \n\nWe have a daughter now and I try to think it’s possible we had sex around the time she would have been conceived but in truth I will never get a DNA test because I already feel like she is my girl and the truth would kill me. \n\nReturning to the story- shortly after we got back together she had a break in her lying and admitted that while we were separated she slept with many people including friends of mine (She was back in our home town and I was about an hour and a half away). \n\nI plan on staying with my wife until I explode or the kids go to college. My sons grades really suffered when we split earlier and I think it’s better for both parents to be in the home. \n\nMy wife loves sex. In therapy I have explained that I really do love her and I care what happens to her. I do. I want her to be happy and I want her to succeed in life so our children can be good people. My only issue with her is that she cheated on me. \n\nSo I have refused sex to my wife for about 6 months now. Prior to that she was lucky to get it once a month. This is how I have been paying her back. I don’t tell her I will never touch her again. I avoid the subject. I don’t tell her that she’s got many more years of sexless marriage ahead of her. If she cheats on me I’ll take her for everything. I’ll keep my kids taken care of and continue to support her in every other way, but she can go fuck herself to eternity.\n\nTo clarify, my wife is an alcoholic and I attend meeting to support her, I buy her valentines cards, and I tell her I love her because I do. She will just have to suffer on the sex side. \n\nSo AITA and I should just leave her, or should I tell her the truth? Which would be, I’ll never touch you intimately ever again and let her decide for herself. Or should I continue on for my kids sake?\n\n",

      "description": "So, backstory. I work Security and have for about two years now. At one of our sites, I'll refer to as S, I was there for about 8 months before the contract got sold to another company and I went to another site. Fast forward 4 months, I quit and went to the company that got site S. \n\nOne of the first people I met was a former, now current, coworker. He works 1st shift, I work 2nd shift. 1st shift is a nightmare mess anyway, but yeah. \n\nI am a bit of a workaholic, and in my second and third week, I've taken on 36 hours of Overtime, my gf moved to another state for school, and it's just me and the cat, so I spend a lot of time working, simply because it's a better use of my time (college is in the works but I am in a bit of debt by biting off an apartment more than we could chew and I will be moving, but I gotta stockpile cash) than sitting around playing video games or whatever. The coworker, referred to as W, only works 25.5 hours a week. \n\nI come in today, and my supervisor comes in very soon after, because he was checking in on the building. As soon as he comes in, he asks me why I've been late every day since I started. \n\nWell, this strikes me as odd, and my coworker for my shift backs me up, saying I've never been late working 2nd shift. In fact, the only time I was late, I made certain to call and let the supervisor for that shift know I was running behind schedule. \n\nSupervisor then tells me \"Well, W on first shift calls me every day and blows the supervisor phone up complaining that you're always late.\"\n\nSo now I plan on making certain to show up early, and make sure that everything has been done to a perfect T, and should anyone leave even a second before their scheduled time, I'm reporting them for abandoning post, as I have not started my shift, and will not be held responsible for their carelessness, while simultaneously dragging my name through the mud. \n\nWould this make me the asshole, considering I will be as nitpicky as humanly possible, to the smallest detail?

Damn, she told me that we could go see a sundown someday. \n\nBut now, she's getting over her problems. She found a new group of friends and is cheerful all the time. But she now cares almost only about herself, only trusts one of her new friends (sometimes not even her), does whatever other people do and gets angry quite often. She grew very lovely to other people at the same time she grew colder to me. \n\nI know it's probably just jealously, I know I'm fucking jealous of everyone. But there's something else.

      "description": "So my parents are divorced, and I primarily lived with my dad since my mom moved across country when I was at the end of middle school. I am now in college (I'm 19) out of state. Living with my dad was pretty rough, he worked a lot and was emotionally abusive to me while I was in middle school so there was a lasting distance between us. The one thing he really got on me about was money. He had a lot of money, he grew up poor and now holds on to everything. He is super financially responsible. Basically, the rule for me was that I was to get a job as soon as I could, and when I got a job I would have to pay for everything myself. I have been working non stop since I was 15. I bought my own clothes, my own groceries (about 75% of the time), paid my phone bill, paid for my car insurance, and even paid him to \"rent\" a car that he let me drive throughout high school. I pretty much never had spare money because I wasn't working full time (still in high school), and I was spending it on all the essentials. Because I never had money, he would often get on my ass about being financially irresponsible if I  bought something that wasn't a necessity, but even when I was broke I never asked him for any money ever. Not once. \n\nSince moving to college things have changed. He offered to pay my phone bill. He tends to buy me groceries when I am visiting. He offers money occasionally so I can go out and do things. There are still things I pay (car insurance, any things that are for fun, groceries at school, textbooks, etc.). My mom is also in my life a lot more now and she is VERY generous. She will buy me clothes, and other little things if I need them (I only take what she offers, never ask)\n\nI share a car with my boyfriend right now and we have been looking into getting another car for next year. I have a job and was planning putting down my down payment at the start of the summer on a used car.  I have enough money saved for that already and I am planning on saving up quite a bit more before the summer. I brought this up one time on the phone with my mom and she told me not to, that she and my dad had talked and they decided they wanted to help me buy a car. She was selling an old one she didn't need anymore and said they were planning on using that money to go towards a car for me. She said the reason was that they had spent an exponentially high amount of money on my younger brother because he is a professional athlete (it is over my out of state tuition cost per year, which they don't pay for even close to in full. I get scholarships.), and they never spent anything on me growing up. I understand that this is a very kind gesture, and I am thankful for it. I appreciate the thought but it makes me super uncomfortable. \n\nThe reason is that my dad is still kind of a jerk about money. At home he is fine (especially because my boyfriend comes with when I visit and I think my dad likes to be generous with people outside the family), never bothers me about it, but there have been instances throughout the year when he is a jerk over the phone. For example, I wasn't working for the first time since I was 15 for the three months of my first semester in college. During that time I was getting a job lined up for this semester (and it is a long term job so I have security all through college). Because I had no job, I wasn't making the money I usually have, and was going off of my savings. I predicted that the savings would last me through the semester, and I was right. I ran out of money 2 weeks before the end of the semester. To get through those two weeks, I asked for gift cards for my birthday for gas and groceries. My dad called me and asked if I was out of money. I said yes, but it was okay I could get by. He started questioning me on where my money had gone, why I was being financially irresponsible, who I was giving my money to, why I hadn't saved more, etc. He has also questioned other things like why I got a parking pass at the school, why I was buying certain foods, etc. He tells me I suck at money. \n\nHe also does things like since he is helping pay for my tuition, he demands that I don't do anything that \"waste my personal money\" in his eyes. I wanted to get a tattoo, and he told me that as long as I was using his money to pay for my tuition, I was not allowed to spend it on \"shit like that\". My own money, that I earned at my own job. I abide by these rules, because I don't have a choice. \n\nNow with the car. My mom is offering it to me, but I know my dad will talk about it and claim half the gift (at least) as his own. I am worried it will be held over my head like the tuition, or that he will get on me for not being responsible enough to buy my own car, using my car to drive places that are a waste of gas, etc. I also really just want to get financially independent, and I feel like as long as I am driving a car that they paid for, I am not independent, and I plan on driving this car for as long as possible. \n\nSo AITA for telling my mom that I don't want the car? It's not at all her fault. I offered to pay half also. Is it a stupid decision to say no just because my dad is rude? I mean it is a half off car. \n\nTL;DR: My mom offered to spot me a lot of money to go towards a car. My dad is a jerk about finances and I don't want to be stuck under his thumb since he will inevitably take some of the credit for the car. I don't know if I am an asshole for rejecting my mother's gift because of my dad. ",

      "description": "For some context, I'm a 19-year-old college student who's been working as a freelancer for the past few years now. As a result, my family has kind of infamously known me as \"the art person\" and commonly use it as a discussion point with co-workers. My mom's boss has a son who is on the lower end of the functioning spectrum of ASD, and needs eye surgery. My mom's boss usually has gotten books / comics drawn for him to understand why these things are happening to him.\n\nMy mother's boss, knowing I'm an artist, asked my mother if I could draw something for her son's upcoming eye surgery. My mother told me about it, but I gave no definitive response at the time that would indicate whether or not I'd be interested in it. My literal response was, \"Oh\". Despite this, my mother's boss assumed that I'd be down to do the project. Weeks later, my mom comes back to me and told me her boss would be sending me the details on the project soon. I was confused, and expressed concern about doing such a thing when I'm a full-time student. I was told that she \"expected something of me now\". \n\nI just got an email from her boss yesterday detailing the project. She wants me to draw roughly 20 panels of art for her son's surgery. I became rather irritated with this, considering I never gave explicit consent to working on this thing. I went to my mom, telling her that I felt this way, especially considering I am being offered *nothing* in exchange for doing this.\n\nMy mother's response was that she thinks I should just do this out of the \"kindness of my heart\", and that she supposes we just have \"different morals\". For context- my mother is a Lutheran, and I am an agnostic. This has been a point of contention in my family for a while.\n\nI feel absolutely livid over this whole thing, but now I'm sitting here feeling guilty about it. Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to do this project?",

      "description": "So this happened a little after Christmas. I work at a chain bakery as an apprentice, which means I have to go do full time manual labor in the morning and go to school for my pastry chef degree instantly after that every day.  I leave home at 06:00 and return at 21:00. My mother is out of country for work and my dad was then at the hospital for about a month (he's fine now), so I had housework on top of that. Christmas is also a pretty tough season for my line of work.\n\nSo me and my co-worker, a 40 yo woman, who tended to be very loud and annoying at work, were in the elevator, and I was leaning on the wall, and I unconsciously sigh.\n\n\"Hey, what's wrong, you ok?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sorry, just thinking.\"\n\n\"Oh? What do *you* have to be worried about? You don't have any *real* troubles! You're like 20, and you don't even have kids!\"\n\nShe said that (more or less) in a very irritated tone, like I insulted her. So I got pissed, and told her something along the lines of \"just cause I don't have kids doesn't mean I don't have a family to feed\" and \"it's not my fault you can't handle yours\".\n\nI understand that she might have her own problems, but I just don't think it gave her the right to dismiss other people's, especially with such ridiculous reasoning.\n\n",

We go out together as friends.I really tried to help her about her problems. \n\nShe started falling in love with me.When I understood it i introduced her to one of my close friend,I wanted them to be in a relationship because I didn't love her I just wanted to help her.She started to overcame her problems.\n\nOne day my bro called me and said she cheated on him and he was angry to me because I brought them together,he swore to me then blocked me everywhere.When i talked to her she said she is sad for what happened but I was still mad at her because she cost me a good friend.I didn't talk to her as much as before they broke up.\n\nAbout 8 months ago we were in friends house,everyone got drunk except me.Gang were sleeping in living room,I went to the room of my friend,layed in bed.Later that girl entered the room.She was drunk suddenly she layed on me,i didn't do anything I knew she was drunk.I talked to her to get up but she said something about she love me and took her hand on my penis over my pants.I stood up and left the room in surprise and anger.She stayed in the room and fell asleep.\n\nWe didn't say a word about that night but she started to act different.She wasn't friendly to me at all.She was like manipulating the group.It was so annoying,finally i left the group and didn't talked any of them.\n\nOne month ago one of my friends from that group texted me.He said all of my old friends angry with me but he said he didn't believe to her.The story was like that \"Everyone was drunk except me, she went into room and layed,after some time I entered room and started to touch her,she couldn't resist and we had sex\".I shocked and felt stupid for all the things I have done for her.I felt bad but didn't care about it because I had already left the gang so it was not a big deal.\n\nTwo weeks ago I broke up with my gf I was in a bad mood didn't know what to do.That night I called that girl and told her to come to my house.She was like waiting for that moment,one hour later she came.We just had sex I told her I'm not serious about two of us,she said she doesn't care,she just wanted me.We didn't sleep together,said goodbye to her and we haven't talked after that night. \n\nSomehow me and my gf started again.I started to be called by the secret number.A crying girl voice swears to me.I know she is her.I don't know why she is mad at me she said didn't care when I told I m not serious with her.Am I the asshole and should I tell my gf about that night?",

      "description": "I’m on mobile sorry for the format. \nMy boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years and we have an almost 2 year old daughter together and we both work full time. Last Wednesday our daycare provider cancelled on us for Thursday, Friday, and we no longer have a back up baby sitter (my grandparents were being our back up sitter but my grandfathers health is declining so that’s come to an end and everyone else we know and trust works 9-5’s). My boyfriend works 330am-1130am on a normal day and I work 830am-4pm (but don’t NEED to be at work until 10 as the first hour or so is considered “administrative time”) I suggest that my boyfriend take one day off and I’ll find coverage to take whatever day he doesn’t. He is very adamant that he cannot take any time off bc they’re very busy and are working mandatory 10 hour days for the next 2 weeks, so essentially I’m on my own. My boss was kind enough to let me take our daughter to work with me BOTH Thursday and Friday but she wasn’t happy about it. So fast forward to Saturday evening and our sitter cancels on us Monday AND Tuesday. So here we are again, I ask him to please take a half day Monday or Tuesday bc I can’t take her to work 4 days in a row and if he takes a half day he gets home by 830am and then I can be to work by 9-930. Absolutely refuses. Nope! He can’t do it bc “10 hOuR dAYs MaNdAToRY fOr TwO wEeKs.” So I bite the bullet and I work for someone else on Sunday so they can work for me Monday and I switched with someone so I could have Tuesday off and now I’m working Saturday (today) Now it’s Wednesday and my boyfriend decides he’s going to leave work at his normal time bc he has a tattoo appointment (so he doesn’t work the mandatory 10 hours)  and then comes Friday.. the real kicker. I text him as soon as I wake up to let him know our taxes have come (we split them in half bc we file separately) and this mother fucker tells me “I’m gonna take a half day today. Can I meet you at the bank and we’ll split the money and have lunch?” \nSo I stewed on that for awhile and come lunch time I go off. Tell him he’s selfish. He can’t take a half day to watch our kid and let me go to work so I don’t have to work weekends but you can leave early for a tattoo and some fucking tax money? I told him he’s selfish and he told me I’m an asshole... so am I? Bc I don’t think I am.m, but maybe I’m wrong... ",

      "description": "Sorry this ended up sort of long but I really really need to know if I’m being crazy or if my feelings are even a little justified. To anyone willing to read it all and comment: Thank you in advance.\n\nSo just a little bit more explanation, my boyfriend/father of my child and I have been a thing for about 4 years now and the past 3 Valentine’s Days, some issue has come up that has made it to where we aren’t getting to spend it with each other. (Example: last year we were in the middle of a cross-world move and he was in a different country while I was still stuck at home)\n\nAnother important detail is that he hates Valentine’s Day. Not because anything has happened to him, he just says he thinks it’s stupid. He very very much knows, however, that I care about Valentine’s Day and it’s important to me. This year it seemed everything was going to work out where we were together and could have a nice night out together (we have a 1 year old so having a night out is even more looked forward to for me than usual). I even brought up the topic to him a week or so ago about us going out for Valentine’s Day. We had a whole conversation about it, so he knows I was wanting us to be able to do something (again, I’m the type of person Valentine’s Day is important to and he knows this, and this will be the 4th year in a row it has been ruined)\n\nHe and his friends play a lot of video games and planned on doing a video game tournament. It’s at our house, and he planned it on Valentine’s Day. This isn’t a once in a lifetime thing, they plan on making this a regular thing (we already have board game nights all the time but they want to start adding this to the mix). On top of that, it’s a game that I am not included in. Meaning he thinks I couldn’t handle playing with them so he did not include me in the planning (game can only do 8 people, he invited 7 people other than me +himself makes 8). \n\nSo not only did he plan something with his friends on a day that he knows is important to me, but he planned something that I can’t even be included in other than sitting in the back and watching. I know he thinks Valentine’s Day is stupid but I feel like in a serious long term relationship, when you care about the person you do things that might not necessarily mean much to you but they mean something to the other person. AITA for having my feelings hurt? (Note I said feelings hurt. I am not angry, just feeling very unloved and sad about it all)",

      "description": "Okay, so the title sounds a bit fucked up, sorry. TL;DR at the bottom. Also, really sorry if my writing is shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me preface this with a bit of info about my Mom. We don't have the best of relationships, she's emotionally abusive and can generally be a very nasty person. Throughout my entire life, especially during childhood, she took some extremely idiotic decisions pertaining to her sex life, such as but not limited to: having sex in the same room as her 9 year old child, who's bed is across from hers... multiple times. Fucking with her door wide open, midday shall I add.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssentially she has made me hear and see some pretty nasty shit from an early age and I'm fed up, just wish she had at least closed her door a couple of times lmao. I'm sure a lot of people have though, so I'm probably just being a baby about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't really get boyfriends often due to, as I mentioned before, her being kinda shitty. So this morning, I wake up and lie in bed for an hour and hear her current (married) 'friend' come to visit her. He somehow found our house despite her never telling him, which I found was really creepy, but besides the point. I decided it's probably time for me to get up as it's 1 PM. So I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I open my bedroom door, it dawns on me that they are fornicating on the fuckin' couch. I know this full well but, man, am I done with this nasty behaviour from her. I didn't really think twice about it and just came downstairs, the couch is in full view of the stairs so... my eyes are filled with the full view of his ass, I'm cringing thinking about it. I say, as politely as I can, \"Can y'all not fuck on the couch, that's fuckin' nasty.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's in disbelief over it and obviously feels very humiliated, which I guess was my end goal here, to teach her a lesson? Anyway, I head for my PC and she keeps asking me very awkwardly, what I'm doing up at this time. It is one (1) in the AFTERNOON (PM). She knew FULL well that I would be up at that time, and even acknowledged it afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, he leaves awkwardly- I'd never met him before that so, that was a pretty good first impression. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Mom comes over to talk to me, trying to laugh it off but she obviously feels embarrassed. She tells me jokingly that they didn't get to 'finish' (in French so I can't really translate too well sorry!), and it makes me feel kinda shitty for messing with her rare hook up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel pretty bad about it... but one part of me feels satisfied for making HER feel embarrassed for once. Still, one part of me tells me I should've just stayed in my room until they were done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: **Mom tried to have a rare hook up on the couch, at 1 PM. I was fed up with seeing/hearing her do nasty shit, so I came downstairs, despite knowing they were having sex... just to make her feel embarrassed for once.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for messing with my Mom's rare chance at a hook up?

Abby is the one whose sister-in-law died of cancer. \n\nCindy messaged me and told me we should go to the funeral viewing for Abby's SIL. I haven't replied to her yet but am trying to come up with an excuse as to not go. \n\nI don't want to go because I'm exhausted. The past few weeks I have slept for no more than 4 hours a day because I was working on my thesis. I just want to spend the next few days resting at home. Another reason is because it feels insincere to go when I don't even know her. I would rather donate to the gofundme page they set up to pay for the medical bills. Even if I was there, I wouldnt have any words of \"support\" for Abby because I don't know anything about her SIL apart from the fact that she had cancer. \n\nIs it really important that I go? When my grandma died, all I wanted was to be given some space. It didn't matter to me if people went to the viewing. I just don't know if other people felt the same about funerals as I do, or if I'm just an asshole for thinking that way.",

I paid for alterations (£35), the belt, the shoes, accessories. I'm also doing my own hair and make up and paid to stay at the venue (not optional). I am the only bridesmaid and maid of honour.

So the main things were taken care of by me and any extras by them. \n\nClarification: I absolutely love my friend to bits and have no major ill feelings towards her whatsoever. It's her wedding and not mine and I totally get weddings are expensive. I didn't question her at any point and am very grateful for the beautiful bridesmaid dress. And at the end of the day, I get to see my best friend get married. Its just now I'm looking back and I can't help but feel a bit annoyed at the situation. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's a non-issue but I can't decide if I feel justified in feeling this way. \n\nIs this normal for weddings?

      "description": "I am the person in our friend group (of 2 years) who tries to make plans to make the persons who birthday it is, the most special day possible.\n\nOne of them had told us she didn't want to celebrate her birthday and just be at home. I used to listen to her other than when she was having hard times so she'd have someone to speak to because even though she was extremely extroverted, she didn't feel like sure could trust anyone. \n\nI told her about how the past birthdays don't matter. And how from now on she'll have amazing birthdays,  organised the party and made sure she had the time of her life.\n\nShe thanked everyone for coming and making the day special and was happy about it. And it made me happy that I was able to make someone start bring excited about their birthday.\n\n\nI had heard that is better not to be close to people whose defining trait is to be mean. And without a doubt, she's the person who's hurt the feeling of most people in our group. And everytime someone gets extremely hurt, she says , \" The only reason I'm even make fun of you guys is because I fell so close to you guys and I don't really mean way ever I just said\".\n\nI used to think, okay that was too mean but at least she has people now that she feels close to. \n\nA few months ago, she was angrily trash talking about something another person in the group had done. I brought told her about how he might have perceived the situation so it's not his fault. She got completely angry and told, \" I don't need you to be my friend ! \".\n\nI was pissed and walked away. I was pissed that she could even think of saying that. \n\nLater that night she called me up and told me she told that in the heat of the moment and didn't really mean that. \n\nShe has told me about how she doesn't like a girl in the group ( the mean girl's crush asked this girl out )\nAnd every time she talked so happily and hugged her, it was completely fake.\n\nAll I could think of was how in also just a fake friend and was apologising just so that she could tell everyone in the group she regretted telling that and apologised. Didn't actually mean it as I'm not really considered by her as a friend.\n\nOn that day I decided she's just an acquaintance I know, that's in our group. And didn't really talk to her much more that needed.\n\nHer next birthday was 5 days ago. I didn't plan anything and when everyone asked if I was going to get her a cake, I told I just do that for friends birthdays and not for acquaintances. (They know i only consider her as an acquaintance since that day)\n\nShe was all excited and dressed up, completely different from the mood of last year but ,everyone just wished her a happy birthday that day and we headed home after that. \n\nTL;DR: I made a friend's day on her birthday which she has bad past memories from. After she told me she doesn't need me to be her friend, I just considered her as an acquaintance I knew. I am the one who makes plans for birthdays in our group. Didn't do anything for her, just wished her like how an acquaintance would.",

      "description": "For about a year and a half, I had feelings for my friend from uni. We hung out a lot and did a lot of “couple things”, such as cuddle and hold hands and stuff, but never anything more. Anytime I would ask her out, she would decline and say she wasn’t looking for a relationship right now. Totally understandable.\n\nA month and a half ago, I met another girl and immediately fell for her. We started a relationship. During this time, me and my friend stopped talking as much. We would still run into each other at school and say hey and occasionally text but nothing like before. \n\nAbout a week ago she waited for me at my car and confronted me, asking me why I was avoiding her and not treating her how I used to. I told her the truth, that I was in a relationship now. She said something like “I thought you liked me?” And I told her that I did, but she never seemed interested so I backed off and moved on. She seemed to accept it and that was that, but then she texted me later in the day that she liked me a lot and that she didn’t expect me to just give up on her, etc. She said I should at least give us a chance before being with someone else.\n\nThe other day, she texted me and invited me to go out with her and some friends, and when she told me who was going, it sounded like it was like a triple date kind of thing, with us being the third couple. Not wanting to be paired off with the girl who rejected me for a year and a half and only suddenly showed interest in me when I’m no longer available, I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to go out with me and some friends, she said sure, so I texted back my friend that I’d be there. \n\nLast night was the outing and I showed up with my girlfriend. My friend was left being the odd man out and spent the entire night being clearly upset. She spent the night being pissy while looking at her phone. She texted me in the middle of dinner “I didn’t think you’d bring her. I invited you, not her”, but I didn’t care. It was shitty of her to try to force us into a date-like situation when she knows I’m taken now. \n\nWhen we were in the car to leave, my girlfriend called the situation before I could even say anything, and said I was an asshole for dragging her into it. She said I should’ve just declined the invite and that she felt bad for my friend because I embarrassed her in front of her friends. I didn’t think she’d side with a girl who was actively trying to make me leave her but she did. \n\nI really liked my friend. For a year and a half and she never seemed interested in me the way I was in her, which is fine. But now that I have someone else, she suddenly has feelings and wants me. It’s super shitty on her part. But now she’s mad, and my girlfriend’s mad, and yeah, it would’ve been more mature just to not go, but I don’t think what I did was that bad. What my friend is/was doing is much worse. \n\nSo, AITA? ",

She can’t understand this and says it’s a deal breaker for her. \n\nI feel as if she prioritises her friends online over me and she brought this up saying I don’t prioritise her or her feelings if she isn’t allowed to follow any of my social media and call her a drama queen for being upset that she isn’t allowed to. I said that’s untrue. It’s not a big deal at all. She said she understands that it’s ‘just social media’ but the fact that I outright refuse to let her follow me is strange. I disagree.

I frequently pay for my SO’s stuff, whether if it’s food when we go out or whatever it be, whenever I have a surplus amount of money to spend. A few nights ago for my friends birthday we all went to the beach to celebrate it, and towards the end of the night we decided to go on a ride at the pier. I had $30 to start off the night and spent $15 on the dinner and $5 on some dippin dots. With $10 remaining we all decided to go on a ride that costed $8. As we went to pay my SO proposed i pay $10 and she pay $6. She just celebrated a holiday where her family member had given her $300+. When she said that i didn’t really want to pay the extra $2 just for the fact that she had more than enough to pay for it, and since I don’t have a steady amount of money, i wanted to save as little money as possible to use later. I ended up paying the $2 as it wasn’t a big deal and I didn’t want to cause a scene, but now she is bringing it up saying that it’s just the principal that I should’ve paid and is calling me cheap.

      "description": "Back story wise it's pretty easy. We married young and have been married almost 5 years. Last year in January big changes happened in both of our lives for the good, mostly for her. She started to feel trapped with me and initiated the conversation of divorce. I was blind sided, a total wreck. Fast forward a year to us trying desperately to work things out and reconnect. I've done nearly everything I can think of. Therapy, new job (more money) and doing my absolute best to try and fix things relationship wise day to day. She has a done a lot too, make no mistake. A few weeks ago she breached the conversation of divorce again and this time, I agree. I think it's best. No one ever cheated no bad relationship really at all. We just drifted apart and as hard as she or I tried we were never able to reconnect. Now moving forward I feel free, totally relieved of the doing everything I can possibly think of to save our marriage mentality. I'm happier, finally losing weight, reconnecting with old friends. Trying to be my best me despite my circumstances. She on the other hand is a upset. She holds it together well enough around me currently but she makes a lot of quips about how everything is sad and things are taking a turn for the worse for her. I feel guilty and sad about the circumstances. But I'm trying to move forward, we both are. In my, very subjective opinion, I've done a lot more and worked a lot harder to try and fix things. Mostly because I was totally blindsided by the first conversation but now... I feel like I have done everything that I could. I did my very best and that wasn't enough, it's no one's fault, it just wasn't meant to be. that thought alone gives me hope and makes me feel better. But I sometimes hear her cry herself to sleep or talk about how she wishes things were different and I feel bad not feeling bad that things are finally over.",

      "description": "Me (28M) and my wife (26F) have been together for 3 years. When we first met, we were just hooking up and she told me the second night we hooked up that she sells naked photos of herself. I told her that’s fine. About 3 weeks into us hooking up, she told me she wanted to stop selling naked photos of herself because she wanted me to be the only person to see her naked. That was the starting off point for our relationship, it made me realize we actually really liked each other.\n\nThe fact that she sold naked pictures didn’t cross my mind for the first few months of us dating until I realized she’s still friends with some of the guys she sold pictures to. I told her I was uncomfortable with that, but she told me the ones she’s still friends with she was friends with before she sold naked pictures to them and she didn’t feel right ending a friendship with them just because they bought pictures from her and now she has a boyfriend. She also said that she doesn’t mind that I’m friends with girls I’ve hooked up with or wanted to hook up with, so what’s the difference. I think of it as different than someone she hooked up with, it’s like these guys were her customers. She’s not really close with any of them as friends, but they interact on various social media platforms here and there.\n\nThis is been an issue on and off in our relationship. I’ll forget about it for months and then I’ll think about it and it makes me uncomfortable. It always starts a fight between us because I’ll get really closed off/not affectionate when I think about it and she feels like I’m making her feel ashamed for the fact that she sold naked pictures of herself. I’ve tried to not think about it, but it still crosses my mind. \n\nWe’ve been having fights about it these last few days because I told her I don’t want her to talk to anyone she’s sold pictures to. I didn’t say she has to, but in an ideal world I would want her to not interact with them. She said she barely even talks to them, they just occasionally respond to an Instagram story she’ll post or like a tweet of hers. She said it would be rude to cut out her friends and, again, that I’m free to talk to girls I’ve hooked up with. All of this came to a head today when I said what it comes down to is that I’m embarrassed that she sold these kind of pictures. This upset and angered her. She said why did I tell her I was fine with it when we started hooking up, and I told her that truthfully I wasn’t really fine with it then either, I just didn’t want to seem uncool or judgmental. She’s hurt now and says she’s going to have a hard time getting over this because she feels like I’m shaming her. \n\nTLDR: my wife sold naked pictures of herself while we were just hooking up. she stopped before we started dating but it bothers me that she still interacts with guys who were her friends who bought pictures. today I told her I’m embarrassed that that she sold naked pics and she’s upset ",

I was sitting on a bench and was approached by a dude that just came out of nowhere. He was asking for me to hold a box that seemed to be from a store nearby. But it was so sudden and random that I refused to hold it for the guy. From many stories and posts that I read around reddit made me think of the worst possible scenarios if I played along to this. \n\nThe guy didn't seem bad but having a random person come up with a box(shoes, jewelry etc.) all of a sudden just raised so many flags in my head. Obviously the guy felt hurt and offended so he curse at me and whatever, I didn't respond to it. He went to the nails place and then got out and do whatever he was going to do later. \n\nHe kept calling me names as I waited but I didn't respond to it. I moved on. But I wanted to see what you guys think of this situation. Again the guy didn't seem bad I just played it safe as he could have asked a cashier to hold the item for him to get his girls keys or whatever. \n\nSo what do you think reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "(sorry but English is not my first language)\n\nSo basically I play bass, and it's really hard to come by a basists around here.  I joined up with a drummer and a guitarist 8 months ago who posted \"looking for a bassist who plays space rock/psychedelic rock.\" Which is exactly what I want! Things went well a few months, but then the past 2 months it has been pretty bad.\n\nThe drummer was a cool guy and we got along well, the guitarist is overall a nice dude but is very dogmatic in his music. So when we play something, it's usually made by him and he wants it his way. Usually I went along with it but then the style slowly began to sway away from psychedelic rhythms to pop and sometimes funk, which is nice to listen to, but is clearly not for me. It also gets worse because he would sometimes take my bass while we're jamming and show me a part to do, which I don't mind. But, whenever I tell him to do something in his guitar riffs, he tells me \"we only have 3 hours of studio time (which we rent), let's just go with it.\" And doesn't put much thought into my opinion, even though sometimes he takes my bass for as much as 10 minutes. This happened a few times and I was really annoyed.\n\nNot to mention, one time I told him to adjust a few riffs in a studio, we argued a few minutes but it died down, then in our break he told me \"you should lighten up and I'm a sale manager you're just not listening and only responding to what you want.\" Even though I'm the one SUGGESTING the opinion.\n\nSo I texted the guitarist and told him my concerns and that I was leaving the band, mainly due to the music shift and \"his dogmatic approach\" He told me I was an asshole and blocked me. The drummer also told me I was an asshole.\n\nAITA Reddit?\n\nTL;DR was in a band that shifted music into music I don't really like to play, guitarist was really dogmatic and didn't take my opinions ,told him I'm leaving, he told me I'm an asshole.",

      "description": "An acquaintance of mine recently got married and had a college mascot at his wedding. This isn't some small college either. This is a college that any football fan, even casual ones, would be familiar with. Everyone at the wedding thought it was cool, but I think it makes you seem like a douche. Even people who weren't at the wedding think it's neat that the mascot was there. From what I've gathered, the person who got married is friends with the person who is the mascot, and they asked them to do it. To me, it seems like a move to show that they are better than everyone else. Like shouting \"Oh, you can't have a college mascot at your wedding? You must be poor.\" The kids parents are really good people, but the kid is definitely the type to show his \"status\" as \"wealthy.\" Hint: they aren't wealthy, their parents are. I hope this is enough info to be judged. ",

Sometimes it’s all I can do to come home, eat supper, do laundry or anything to get ready for the next day and go to bed. For the last hour or two I have free time I would like to spend time with my husband. However, he plays video games with his friends which is basically ignoring me because I do not play video games. He’s a student currently and is home alone all day. In his defense, his friends also work and they can only play in the evenings together. In addition to not spending quality time together, I often feel I am left to typical household cleaning in my only spare time as he does not do any noticeable work on the house. Am I the asshole for feeling like this is a one-sided relationship? Asking because I know if I say anything husband is going to act like I’m being ridiculous, he will argue that he cleans the house and does things while I’m not here but that “I never seem to notice or appreciate anything he does.”   He will basically make me feel like a controlling micromanager if I mention anything about how I feel bad for not spending time together.",

      "title": "AITA for trying to plan a day of baking cookies with my father?",
      "description": "A little bit of background, I am 20 years old and my parents got divorced when I was 11. My dad got remarried almost immediately afterwards and our once close relationship has been rocky for many years due to the fact that his current wife and I can never seem to get along. \n\nOn my dad’s side of the family we have a traditional Christmas cookie recipe that everyone makes every year and my dad and I have been making them together every year pretty much since I was able to reach the counter. My brother, 18 (For the sake of the story we will call him S)  makes them with us most years too and since my dad got remarried my stepsister, 15 (for the sake of the story we will call her A) has joined in with us on this tradition.  Also my stepmom has two sons J who lives in another state with A and T who lives with my dad and stepmom. \n\nToday was thanksgiving so my brother (S) and I went over to my dad and stepmom’s house. My stepsister (A) is also visiting for the holiday and staying through the weekend (she usually lives in another state with her father). The last time I saw all of them was back in August so I was a bit worried I’d get the usual complaints of not seeing them enough but that didn’t really happen this time. We actually had a really really good time. We had dinner and played games, two of T’s friends came over since they had nowhere to go. It was awesome, probably one of the best thanksgivings we have had yet. We tried to take a family picture for Christmas cards but we couldn’t get food enough light since it was already dark out so my stepmom decided to make a plan for S and I to come over Saturday morning so we could do the picture and she and my dad would make us breakfast. Sounded good to me, we agreed all went on. \n\nEverything was good except my dad and stepmom kept going into their bedroom to our liquor in their drinks because they told everyone else it would be a dry event (but they are never sober so it really doesn’t surprise me that they were sneaking liquor). Not too out of the ordinary though. Everything was pretty normal and good. \n\nThen T left to bring his friends home. With the friends out of the house things seemed to quickly change. S and I were about to head out but we stopped and talked to my dad in the kitchen and I asked him if there would be any weekends between now and Christmas that he wasn’t traveling for work so I could come over and we could have a Christmas cookie day. He told me which days he’d be out of town and I was like alright I’ll see which of the other days I can get off work and we can do that. He told me he probably wouldn’t bring any to work this year since he doesn’t actually have an office with his new job but he was joking about how he could mail cookies to his coworkers and I started joking about how I could bring some in to my internship to try and butter them up so they will hire me next year. It was all pretty normal conversation but then it got a little confusing. \n\nA came up and was jokingly being offended that we were going to make cookies without her and my dad told her he already has the stuff so she can make them this weekend while she’s here and she asked if I was going to come make cookies this weekend then and my stepmom reminded her that I had to work all weekend. A suggested Saturday when I’m here for the pictures but I told her I could help in the morning but only a little bit since I have to work at 2. Then my stepmom was trying to say I’d have to be here much earlier on Saturday to help with cookies and I explained “I wasn’t planning to come early I was just saying I will help if I have time. I still have to work all weekend and would like to have another cookie day sometime closer to Christmas when I don’t have to work.” Somehow this led to my stepmom raising her voice and getting angry about how I only want to see them when I need something and that this is why I never see them and I tried to argue back and defend myself saying no this isn’t because I need something, it’s because I want to make cookies with you guys, I’m trying to make a plan here to see you guys.” And it was very clear it was about to turn into a big fight but then S got angry and stormed out the door so I just stopped and said “I guess S says it’s time to go” and then turned and followed him. A stopped me by the door and said goodbye and then told me to tell S she says goodbye too. She was the only one I said goodbye too. Both S and I messaged her after we left and apologized for storming out and she said she understands. We love hanging out with A and obviously we want to get to see my dad but it feels like my stepmom makes it so hard sometimes. \n\nWas she right though? Am I the asshole in this situation??? I really just don’t even know anymore. She just makes me question everything about myself sometimes. ",

      "description": "First off, I *feel* like the asshole looking back, but I only meant it in jest. \n\nMy coworker has been through a lot lately. Divorce, living on their friend's couch, working their ass off to save for a cellphone and a car (after everything that's happened, they have neither; they either use a coworker's phone or their friend's car). We're friendly enough with each other, \"work buddies\", if you will, and usually go on break together.\n\nThe only problem is that they smoke, all the fucking time. Take breaks every hour to smoke, come back smelling like ass, and make the entire locker area smell like cigarettes, including everyone's jackets. Somehow, despite being really broke (and always emphasizing how broke they are) they manage to afford a pack a day. It started to really grind my nerves because I have kid family members at home, and I don't want them to breath it in when I hold them. Also - I'm pretty sure they mentioned having a couple little daughters at some point, but I'm not sure. \n\nSo while we were on break, they lit up a cigarette and sort of blew it in my direction while talking to me. I let it slide a couple times (reluctant to leave them alone outside when they know I have no reason to go inside) and tried not to breathe, but finally I said, \"You should put that shit out.\" I didn't mean it totally seriously, but I felt they were being a little dickish. \n\nThey said something to the effect of, \"Go inside if you don't like it, I get headaches if I don't smoke.\"\n\nSo I replied, \"Dude, you're going to get worse headaches in chemotherapy.\" I should note that I'm pretty sarcastic anyway, but I joke a lot when I'm uncomfortable. I didn't mean it *like that*, I was pretty much just fucking around in hopes they'd stop. They just looked at me for a second and then went back inside. They wouldn't talk to me for the rest of the shift. Later, our manager took me aside and asked me to be more respectful, especially to them, because they're going through some shit right now. I immediately felt super embarrassed. \n\nAITA in this situation, and should I apologize? ",

      "description": "I (M20) was talking with my girlfriend (F18) and the subject of an ex of her’s came up and I made  a rude comment about him and she didn’t take it very well.\n\nFor some background we’ve known each other since before middle school, grown up together and officially started dating about 10 months ago. She’s amazing and I love her and being with her. In our social group there isn’t much dating or many actual relationships so the subject of past relationships is a little more sensitive for us. She was in love with this guy a long time ago,  when she was around 14 IIRC, he lived in another country so she’d visit and see him but I never met him or knew much about him. On my side of things I’ve been in a couple past relationships and in particular there was this one girl that I was crushing on pretty hard for a while before I was interested in my current girlfriend, my current GF was my go to to talk about stuff like this so she heard a lot about her, to an extent it’s a little embarrassing now. I never got in a relationship with this girl, she has a reputation for being on the provocative side of things and would always play with guys, definitely not a good girl to be interested in. \n\nIn any case it’s occasional for my current GF to bring up this girl (who she hasn’t met before) and talk really bad about her, calling her a slut, saying she hates her, etc. \nShe really doesn’t like her and I understand it to an extent because she’s protective of me and in a way I love that she is so it doesn’t really bother me.\n\nToday however we were talking about types of guys she’s attracted to and as she was describing her type this guy who we’ll call Mark comes up in conversation, Mark isn’t exactly the most attractive guy, very odd looking and not what you’d generally call attractive. I have nothing wrong with him personally whatsoever, their relationship was a long time ago. \n\nSo jokingly I tell her that there’s no way she likes this guy for her looks, she says he’s cute and this is where I might’ve messed up, I asked if he was all there, which I definitely could’ve worded better. I didn’t want to say anything bad if there was something, so she tells me he’s all there, he used to be blind but he can see now. I then messed up and made a dumb joke and said something along the lines of  “Did he go blind looking in the mirror?” And some other quip I don’t remember about his forehead... oops that was probably uncalled for. We make jokes pretty frequently about other people but not mean-spirited, except for when she talks about my Ex. Anyways girlfriend goes dead silent and didn’t say anything for a bit, then we get into a big discussion about what’s okay and what’s not. I told her I was joking and didn’t mean anything bad towards him. The conversation ended with her really upset with me and me getting the impression she might have feelings for this guy who she still occasionally sees when she visits his area. \n\nGreat.\n\nWhat do you think Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "My (M23) gf of four years (F22) and I are still living at home (we both go to university in my town, she lives in a city an hour away). I have no problems at home, but my gf's family is quite disfunctional. Her dad is a borderline alcoholic and im not sure about her mom, but from what my gf tells me, she has something like BPD, they are constantly fighting.  My gf has previously asked them if she could move in with friends, but the won't let her move out.\n\nNow the thing is, I've considered moving out as well to be more independent, so right now I'm considering renting a flat and asking my gf to move in with me. Even if her parents don't want to let her go, they can only exert financial pressure, so if I take that away, what can they do? She could technically even sue them for housing/food/study costs, but if she doesn't want to, I could cover it for her until we're both out of university. \n\nStill, that would basically mean starting a fight with her family and I'm not sure if it's the right thing to do. Also, I wonder if this would put too much pressure on her/make her feel indebted. I am serious about this relationship and I'm not afraid to take responsibility, but I also don't want her to feel like she owes me. WIBTA if I offer her to move in with me?",

      "description": "So my mom got me an Xbox one for Christmas which is a really nice thoughtful gift. The thing is that I already have an Xbox one, but mine is slightly damaged. Some backstory to it is that my friends and I went on a ski trip over spring break and brought our Xbox’s. Apparently we didn’t pack well enough and when we opened the back of the car my Xbox fell out and now none of the buttons on the front work so I can’t get my game out or put new ones in. Other than that it works perfectly, and this doesn’t really bother me since most of my games are downloaded. But my mom knew it was broken and decided to get me a new one, which I appreciate and understand why she did, but I feel like it’s a useless gift since I already have one. I started thinking about selling it and getting a switch instead so I talked to my girlfriend about it and she told me it was a bad idea and that I’d seem ungrateful. I then talked to my dad and he said it’d be fine and that it made sense for me to do that. So I finally brought it up with my mom and it didn’t go over well. She took offense and was upset that I would want to sell her gift. I explained my reasoning and she said i can do whatever I want with it since it’s my gift but I know that she’s still upset about it. I haven’t sold or done anything with it, so would I be an asshole if I sold it?",

The role was a mismatch, and I was immediately disappointed after joining. I spoke with my immediate manager about it and he said he’d do his best to change my role.\n\nAnd this escalated to my unit head and he also told me the same. Fast forward a month later, we have a new up and coming, very prestigious software to be developed and everyone in the team looked forward to switching to that team. The unit head called me up and told me I’m going to be the first one to be drafted to that team - meaning he very well kept his word. He mentioned that it’s a litmus test for our whole unit, as the company is pouring investments for this “market shaker” product and he needs totally committed people, to which I responded that I’m up for it.\n\nThe catch is - the product is into a new technology and a new language- which I’m not right now interested to switch. And I got several exciting offers from startups as well which I’m considering.\n\nWhen my boss spoke with me, I had given my word that I’m happy to be moved to the new product- I couldn’t tell him that I have other offers in my hand.\n\nSo AITA if I go tomorrow and hit him with a resignation?

      "description": "I (29) am severely visually impaired, to the point that I can never legally drive a car. \n\nIn 2006, after a lot of hard work to prove that I was a responsible teenager, I got a guide dog when I was two years younger than the minimum age the guide dog school set for applicants. I want a perfect handler but I took great pride in maintaining an excellent level of training, care, and trust with the animal that was my best friend and hero. Over the course of nearly a decade together, I had to deal with people who didn't understand the rules of service dogs and overcome lots of other struggles on top of managing a disability.\n\nLast August, my wife and I had to put him to sleep. he enjoyed 4 good years of retirement in luxury after he was unable to work, but it was still a traumatic experience.\n\nBefore my dog retired, my sister (38) with bipolar disorder saw the attention and praise and support my dog and I got as a result of our high standards of care and teamwork. I know firsthand how helpful a dog can be, and since she suffers from anxiety and.ptsd, I understood the benefit she could gain from a dog. But I also cant help but think her decision to get a dog was primarily driven by a desire for attention.\n\nMy sister adopted a shelter dog with severe behavior issues and did not achieve much in the way of obedience training. She tried to claim this was a Service Dog but it was not trained to provide any service based on any disability she has. At best, he was an emotional support dog by only the loosest definition. He is aggressive, barks at any movement he sees outside, and doesn't follow any commands. \n\nThe month my dog died, my sister got a third noise complaint from her landlord about her dog's barking. She was told to get rid of him or be evicted. On top of that, she refused to be there for me when we were putting my dog down because of a stupid argument she was having with my parents.\n\nTwo weeks after my dog was gone, she have hers to my parents. It made me feel betrayed, like my dogs passing meant nothing to her. my parents are in their 60s and can't handle the 80lb wolfhound mix so he just barks and they can't do anything about it and they don't want to get rid of him.\n\nI am currently visiting family for the holidays and the last week has been very irritating. The dog barks constantly, has jumped on me and my wife, snapped at me for bumping into me, and other stuff that is just wearing me down.\n\nI don't like this dog. It represents the bullshit my sister pulled and that my parents are letting it slide. It is 80lbs of proof that my sister was just trying to get attention. It is also just irritating to be startled by barking every 10 minutes. He has sweet moments, but  only between moments of being aggressive.\n\nMy parents, however, adore this dog. They are empty nesters and are willing to overlook his aggression because they paid his adoption fee for my sister at the shelter. Part of me also thinks they are using the new dog to cope with the loss of mine, who lived with them for a while after he retired since my building doesn't allow dogs and the Americans with Disabilities act doesn't cover service dogs after retirement.\n\nToday we are visiting my sister and her boyfriend and I am not thrilled to be expected to pretend things are all fine and dandy again. My dog dying and her dumping hers on my parents has been the last straw. I love dogs, but not this one.",

      "description": "To start off, I'm an introvert. A massive introvert. I don't enjoy many social interactions, so my two very close friends are the only ones I hang out with. They're similar. When we hang out we hang out at my house, because i have the nicest house out of all of us and my parents are rarely home. We'll call my one friend M and the other A. So that's the set up. \n\nLast time we hung out, M and A dragged me to a movie I didn't want to see, I paid for them M because she doesn't have much money and I drove us all there and back. After that they spent the night at my house and M would not stop insisting that we watch Charmed. I hate that show and told her so, but M literally took the remote from me and would not compromise until I finally gave in because she made me feel like a dick. I had a terrible time that night but didn't say anything to avoid conflict.\n\nThen just yesterday they came to hang out again. I thought we would have fun. Instead they came over, M insisted I buy them milkshakes downtown. I do. Then we come back to my place, and we sit down on the couch. A really likes the Umbrella Academy. I watched the show previously because she asked me to. I hated it, it was so boring to me. So we're sitting there going through Netflix and M sees the show and is like \"Lets watch it!\". I say no, because again, I hate the show and both me and A have already seen it. A starts begging to watch it too. I still say no. They say we should rock paper scissors it. I say no because it's my house, and suggest they go hang out at one of their own houses and watch it there. They look at me like I've just said their mom's are whores. I feel bad and do the rock paper scissors. I lose. So I go lay on my bed while they watch it. They don't care.\n\nAfter a while I hear movement and see they've gone into my sister's room (she's at our Dad's house) and taken her blankets to use in the living room. I don't say anything although they can see I'm annoyed by it. \n\nI cone back to the living room to just sit there and  hope they'll be done with the show soon. M suggests they stay the night and before I can help myself I say no. They're both like \"Why???\" And I spill to them that I'm not having fun when I'm hanging out with them and haven't been having fun these past few times, and I say that if this keeps happening I don't want to hang out anymore. I thought that was the honest, right thing to do, so I told them and they looked at me again like I was the biggest bitch in the world. \n\nThey both look annoyed and disgusted and just roll their eyes so before anything else can be said i tell them i think they should go home. We then share a very awkward car ride to their houses and M calls me a bitch as she gets out of the car.\n\nAm I the asshole? I dont think so, but my sister and dad both say that I should have compromised and put up with it because that's what being a good host means. I'd rather just be a bad host than not enjoy myself though honestly. Thoughts? Advice? Anything. ",

It's extremely small, and the only reason it's still going is because one of the teachers is a player, and doesn't want to stop. As with last year (in which I was a player), we have just enough people to run two campaigns. Traditionally, both campaigns have been set in the same world at the same time, with the two parties occasionally meeting. That being said, here's my problem.\n\nI am one DM, and the other DM is supposed to be my friend, who I'll call J. I've known J for a few years, and he's a pretty cool guy, if a bit extreme at times. He was one of my fellow players from the previous two years. I have a little bit of experience DMing a game, and he has none, but we have a solid grasp on what to do. On top of the school club, he's also planning on running a game at his house on weekends. He seems dedicated, right? Well, I'm starting to doubt that. I've been planning out this campaign for the past few weeks. We already have a detailed world map, a bunch of locations,  history dating back several hundred in-game years, and a possible plot hook. And how much of that has J made?\n\n*None*. I've asked him for help multiple times, and he's done nothing. Although, he *did* work with me on a world map in the first week back at school, but he failed to tell me it was for his personal game (and not the one we're supposed to run together) until it was already completed. When I found that out, I was pretty annoyed. \n\nTomorrow I plan on confronting J about the situation. My plan is to be civil, but to essentially tell him that I've asked him multiple times to help, and the fact that he's done nothing at all is not only getting on my nerves, but tells me that he doesn't really care about running the game.\n\n On top of that, a mutual friend of ours is not only willing to run a game, but has previous experience DMing, and I would rather he run the other campaign. I'll also mention that to J.\n\n  \nTL,DR: Friend wants to run school D&amp;D Club alongside me with a joint campaign, but then contributes absolutely nothing to planning out the game or world setting. I have another friend who is willing to replace him, and I'd much rather that guy do it than the first friend.\n\n  \nSo, WIBTA for telling him he can't run the game?",

      "description": "*(Throwaway account) This is long- the background is in italics.*\n\n*My family came together for a religious service- the family is only able to come together every few years. I'm taking advantage of the situation and hanging out w/ my cousins.*\n\n*The 2 people that I traveled with were my brother (Z) and my dad. Dad babies Z who is in high school to a ridiculous extent. I am 18 F.  We shared 1 hotel room.*\n\n*Anyway: I'm hanging out at this gathering and my cousins and I are talking. We actively tried to engage my brother multiple times and he kept shrugging us off and playing with his phone so we figure he doesn't want to talk to us.*\n\n*The group was going to explore a local mall and it was an open invitation to everyone in our family from 13+. Apparently he didn't realize that he was invited and ended up leaving the party early b/c he thought that we were trying to exclude him- he actually almost ended up missing a ceremony for one of my cousins and she was rightfully upset with him and made a comment.*\n\n*He leaves again to sit in room and dad was comforts him. My dad now thinks that my cousins and I were excluding him* *and it was all my fault.*\n\n*I come back in the room to get something and he asks if he can come- I say of course.*\n\n*We go to the mall.* \n\n*We go to my relative's house where I sat at the kitchen table most of the evening until one of my younger cousins asked me to help her w/ something. While helping her Zack and Dad are leaving and I ask them if they're going to \\*city\\* b/c if so I want to go with them. They say no so I opt to stay and help my cousin. I leave the house at 11:00 w/ my cousins.*\n\n*I get back to the room and Z and Dad are gone; I call them and Z yells into the phone that they're in \\*local city\\* so I'm upset.* \n\nThe 2 of them walk in after 1:00 AM in the morning. I made a remark to them about not inviting me and my Dad goes off on me so I end up getting wound up (please note: I am always keeping my feelings under wraps so it got kind of loud). He tries to intimidate me w/ his size (6'3 vs 5'1) takes 2 fingers to my forehead and shoves me. I have PTSD due to abuse from my mother so this triggers me.I yell at him that I am 18 and that I will never let him or anyone treat me like that again. His kicks me out of the room. \n\nWe get up in the morning to check out and he tries to instigate. I leave and sit in the lobby until it's time to go.\n\nHe sends me a LONG text this morning as to why my Z had a shitty time at the reunion is my fault (which explains everything above)- b/c I didn't cater the conversation to him, apparently avoided him, etc. I checked with my cousin and she confirmed we tried to talk to him and he simply wasn't interested.We apparently also didn't invite him to the mall. My dad then said that he could treat me however he wanted because I was his child and that he is putting me through school. He did not apologize for pushing me and then kicking me out. Apparently protesting was out of line.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So my good friend Kim and I are both in the same age range (late 20s), live close to eachother, and spend a lot of time with eachother because we share a lot of interests. We both have jobs, and although I'm far from being rich, she seems to struggle with money more than I do. \n\nBecause of that, I often lend her money (yes, I know the rule about \"don't lend money if you really need it back, I'm okay with that), and even pay for some of her stuff when we go shopping. \n\nThe problem is: Kim really doesn't seem to care about her stuff. In the past year, she's been in several minor car accidents, and now her car is inoperable. At one point, her dad fixed her car for her after finding replacement parts, and she crashed it a few days later. \n\nShe had a book of mine for a while, and when I got it back the pages were obviously damaged with water. \n\nIn the last year, she's also destroyed her phone several times. She dropped one in a toilet. Her mother gave her another phone, and she dropped it in a water pitcher (hooooow). So then I said I could give her my somewhat old phone that still worked (with minor problems like a shitty battery). She offered to pay for it, but I said she could just give it back to me when she gets a new phone. \n\nIt took like 10 days before the phone was annihilated. When I saw her last night, she had removed the case, and the screen was destroyed, with little glass left around the home button. \n\nI get that some people are more clumsy, but at this point, I'm getting irritated by how she clearly disregards her and other people's objects. I don't feel like helping her anymore, because even if I give her money, she'd probably buy something and then destroy it soon after. At the same time, I know it's not all about material stuff, and I've broken my fair share of objects throughout my life. \n\n\n\n",

Lately we have been getting into arguments because I feel like I've been doing all the chores, cleaning up all the clothes she leaves on the floor, washing all of our dishes, taking care of our cats, putting all of her notebooks and textbooks and utensils away that she leaves out, and it's starting to drive me nuts. I work full time and when I get back from work I no longer have any time to relax and chill anymore because i have to re-clean the house. I talked to her about putting in more work or just maintaining the upkeep by like, putting clothes in the hamper instead of on the floor or rinsing dishes right away instead of leaving them in the sink for hours until I get home. She said she was offended that I would expect her to do all these things when she goes to school all day and then comes home and has to do homework and she can't clean and work on academics at the same time. I asked her why not work on homework at her coffee shop because there's not a ton of constant foot traffic but she said that's the time when she hangs out with friends. \n\nI'm starting to feel really overwhelmed by my situation, but I know that getting a degree takes a lot of work and can be really stressful.

      "description": "Asked MIL if she'd be comfortable with us paying for an Uber to take her to the airport (used that wording). She's an able-bodied woman in her late 50's. There's a huge snow storm and the airport is about an hour away. I explained we'd pay for the Uber (even using one of the higher upgrade options), they'd pick her up from our house, and drop her at the same place my husband would. The difference is my husband wouldn't be spending 3+ hours driving (round trip) in dangerous conditions, and the Uber would likely have 4-wheel drive unlike our minivan. Last month I was hit by a distracted driver and injured pretty badly, so I'm extra sensitive right now about something happening to him on the drive. When asked if she'd be willing to be driven by an Uber, and having all those details explained, she ran out of the room crying and locked herself in my son's room for 30+ minutes. Husband went in and talked to her and the plan is he's driving her to the airport (in the storm that's now rolled in) and I'm supposed to drop it.",

      "description": "Almost two years ago my grandfather had a debilitating stroke. While in the ER and surgeries, his four daughters were arguing passive aggressively in the room with him, all out yelling in the waiting room. Stressful, so there's some room for understanding there. A couple times there were some hard decisions to make, intubate or not, amputate or not etc. In those moments, the daughters, if not fighting, would dissapear. I held power of attorney and even though my grandma was ok, she was too overwhelmed to make a decision and asked me to. So I did.\n\nAfter months of hospital and nursing recovery, my grandfather comes home, but needs round the clock care for hygiene, etc. Their house needed renovating and updating for wheelchair access and 1 of the 4 showed up to help. Otherwise I got help from other friends to change flooring, update bathrooms, and renovate their rental house behind them.\n\nPaid caretaking costs ~$15/hr and not something they can afford. I tried getting them enrolled in supplemental help or programs with paid caretaking, but they were denied multiple times because they showed too many assets on paper as they were on the mortgage and title to one of their daughters houses. She also had another car they lent her they wanted to sign their names off of. She ignored every attempt we made at contacting her.\n\nAs I was doing majority of the caretaking, renovating, errands, appts etc., I reached out to all the sisters multiple times to coordinate the help. I made a calendar and asked that they cover just 1 weekend a month or pay to have it covered. One came for about a year, and covered weekday mornings, but left to get a job. Through the whole thing I lost my business and don't have time for a job or even back to school other than some online courses I take late at night.\n\nRecently, my grandmother and I had a discussion about her involving her daughters directly. She said she can't force anyone to do anything and feels bad interrupting their careers and lives. I think in effort to get her daughters attention, she's been telling people I don't allow her daughters over. \n\nAITA if I walk away from this situation completely to recover my life and leave it between my grandparents and their daughters to figure out?",

My class (about 60% Caucasian, 30% African American, and 10% Hispanic) is reading a book that utilizes the n-word frequently. I know that it is inappropriate to say the n-word in my class; however, there are passages containing it that I wanted to read aloud in class for discussion purposes.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy solution was to ask my African American colleague, who is a math teacher at the school to come in and read those passages aloud.

No students have complained about that class, but other faculty over heard our planning and have told me that I should have not taught the book at all. I think that is disingenuous to my students as the book was part of american history and that I (hopefully) avoided making my African American students uncomfortable by not reading the word aloud myself.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "There’s this person, who ill call F, he has been in our school for about 3-4 years, almost as much as me. Everyone at our school, excluding me and some other people, have know each other since KG. But they’re all very nice and welcoming people. F has repeatedly tried to make friends, but due to his rude/obnoxious personality, everyone dislikes him (except one new person). Anyway, the first years of him being at our school, I felt bad that everyone disliked him, so I’ve tried to stay as friendly as possible. (Btw, our school is very small, so everyone knows each other). This current year, as i have more classes with him, he’s been talking to me more, which i dislike. He does things such as “playfully” slapping me (repeatedly), calling her friends, which he met online, in front of us (sometimes while having a conversation with us, as a group). He’s also very rude sometimes, and tries to push her opinions on to you, while being not willing to listen to other opinions. Every time someone tells him that he’s being annoying or rude, he calls them homophobic or transphobic, since he’s a part of the LGBT+.But, since recently he thinks of me as a close friend. \n\nDuring one of my other friends birthday parties, which he intruded, (we did it at school) he stated that she doesn’t want us to throw he one.  We weren’t planning on throwing him one. He makes me extremely uncomfortable around him and is very clingy. His birthday is coming up, and he seems to think ill be giving him something, since he bought a bookmark for me and some other girls. I don’t know if i should buy him one, which would solidify our “friendship”. I also feel like i should be friends with him since everyone else hates him. \n\nWe’ve had a couple arguments lately, and i really don’t want him to continue thinking of us as friends. So I’m trying to kind of ignore him..? But he has no one to talk to (maybe caused by his actions) but he’s never mean. He’s just unknowingly rude, and I’ve tried to tell F multiple times, but he never listened, and then interrupted me to respond to his other friend over the phone (the argument was about how i felt it was rude to speak to have a conversation with someone over the phone, not on speaker, and with a group of people simultaneously. I find it rude, and it shows where her attention lies.) \n\nAITA to stop our “friendship” and not give him a gift?",

      "description": "Confusing title, I know, but I'm gonna try to keep it somewhat vague, because they both use Reddit. Okay, so there's this super awesome movie franchise(I'll call it ABC) that I have been a fan of since I was a little boy. My best friend and my boyfriend are also equally in love with it, both long time fans. I met my best friend about 6 years ago and since then, we've watched these movies in theaters right when they come out. It's just one of those things we do together. We have other movie series, TV series, and video games that are \"our things,\" so this isn't the only thing we do together.\n\nAbout 7 months ago, I met my boyfriend. He showed me all of his collections of different things regarding ABC, so I know he loves it as much as I do. Recently, he took me to the movies to see a movie connected to it(but not as connected as the rest) and there was a preview of an upcoming movie(also connected) and he said he wants to take me to see it. I said okay, because I want to see it with him, too.\n\nNow, here's the problem. Movie 1 I watched with my boyfriend because my best friend had already watched it with his other friends(because they're all huge fans, too). Movie 2 is the preview we saw and Movie 3 is another upcoming movie, all tied into ABC. I'm betting most of you know which one I'm talking about. Movie 3 is the biggest, probably most important of the story, so I figured I could save that to watch with my best friend, and watch Movie 2 with my boyfriend.\n\nI told my best friend that my boyfriend wants to take me to see Movie 2 and he got mad at me. He said that these movies are *our thing* and he wants to see them with me. I asked \"what about Movie 3?\" He got even more mad, saying \"especially not that one.\" So, basically, I can't watch either of these movies with my boyfriend because my best friend wants to see them with me.\n\nAfter this conversation, he was still mad and saying shit under his breath, I couldn't hear it. Then he followed with \"do whatever you want, you don't fucking care, so I don't care either.\" Now he's pissed and won't talk to me.\n\nI hope this isn't too confusing to follow, if I need to clarify, let me know. So, am I the asshole here?",

Listening to his bland pitches is beyond irritating.

In addition, he drives 3+ hours round trip for work 5 days a week, so he's a bit burnt out from driving. Whenever we go out, I tend to drive because I live farther from the other neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Manhattan and I don't want to take the subway. He's perfectly fine with the train. I will usually pick him up and drop him off. He's only a 15 min drive from me but it's still out of the way usually. He doesn't want to drive because he spends so much time in the car during the week and finding parking near home is a nightmare. I don't mind driving but sometimes I want to feel like the girl and be picked up and driven around instead of the other way around. Frankly, I feel like he's being a little bitch.\n\nTldr; I always pick up and drive my boyfriend places even though he has his own car.

      "description": "Ok so Ive had pain in my stomach for the passed 4 months and I just found out I did something stupid during the time I've been medicating and that is that I haven't been eating before I take my painkillers. Apparently this could be a reason for my nausea so I stopped. My BF told me last night that we'd eat at our favorite Indian restaurant for lunch the next day and so I said OK but it's gotta be lunch(if I don't take my pills after 4.5 hours my stomach starts going insane). He was quite tired and said fine. So I called him this morning to make sure he would wake up in time so we could get lunch together, since I gotta eat at 12 so I can take my pills and not be in pain. He wakes up and says \n\"last night I told you I was planning on leaving at 12\" which he didn't but then I said OK but that it would be passed lunch so if he could leave at 10 instead it'd be better(he lives about 2 hours away). I called after half an hour because I thought I could go there early and start eating in that case and he could come later. I call again and he doesn't answer. I call half an hour after that because I was getting worried and it turns out he still wasn't planning on getting out of bed. My alarm goes off and I decide fine no lunch at our favorite place. I ate sandwiches and felt disappointed but that honestly I should've expected this because he's always late(not a problem to me usually since we usually make night plans so that he doesn't have to stress). At 1.30 he texts me that he's on the bus. Around 1.5 hours later he asks if I've already eaten. I explain that yeah of course I have since the doctor told me to reduce the nausea I gotta eat with my pills and then asks if he should bring anything. So the Indian place is amazing. It tastes great, the ingredients are spicy, however if you leave the food for like half an hour it starts to taste bad(as in not tasty, still OK to eat) and heating it up again makes it worse. He says that he's still going to OUR Indian place without me and stopping there before coming to me. I... I feel so incredibly hurt. Like I was already hurt that he's late and he missed so that we could eat together but now he says he's going anyways???\n\nNow if you're asking why I don't just go there and sit while he eats, it takes a lot of me to go to the restuenag because it's quite far away and I'd rather exercise or go for a walk at night. I would've been fine with going there for dinner instead but if he's already been there for lunch then he doesn't want to go for dinner.\n\nSo now he's upset that I'm obviously upset. He got a printer out picture of us for our wallets which is admittedly cute but I'm not in the mood to put it in my wallet. Not because I don't love him but because I'm upset and it just hurt that I'd do that. \n\nI just need to know am I the butthole for being obviously upset?? \nI felt that I was before he decided to lunch without me but now i feel like I'm justified to be angry.

      "description": "So here's the situation: I've just recently started working out (2 months). The gym I go is excellent, everyone is super friendly and I'm genuinely enjoying it. But, about half the time I go there, I go at the same time of a lady (around 35yo) goes - and she brings her 8ish yo son along. \n\nThe gym has a special place for children, but the place is ridiculously small and there's nothing to do in there. From what I gathered the kid has no phone, so has resorted to *playing around with the gym equipment*. \n\nHe runs up and down the gym, twirling around bech presses, gym equipment and people. He jumps rope, he uses the \"trampoline\". He punches the punching bag and climbs the stretching bars. \n\nI've talked to him, asked him not to run around, and he ignored me, as kids do. I've talked to the gym instructor and he made light of it. Everyone seems to enjoy the kid, but me. \n\nAnd then last week I was trying to stretch on the stretching area, but the kid was using it as a playing field and kicking a ball around - using a huge amount of space. I asked the gym instructor to please ask the kid to move around, and instead he dictated me to go stretch somewhere else (but he wasn't rude or anything, more in a \"let the kid play\" vibe).\n\nBut I got pissed off, so when I left I formally complained on the administration, and explained that I was genuinely afraid the kid would eventually get hurt (which I am, but I'm actually more annoyed than anything).  The administration lady seemed completely utterly fake when she agreed with me. \n\nI felt like a super asshole, but there has been no kid around since that day.",

      "description": "There is not much backstory needed except aparently he was homeless and living in hotels before we started dating and we moved way to fast in hindsight. (Relizing that was due to him being homeless) \n\nWe started dating 3 months ago and instantly clicked as far as interests and goals ect. He had originally told me he was inbetween places due to his job no longer needing him to travel back and forth between our home state and TX. My roomie and I were looking to fill our 3rd room so i impulsively offered the idea of chatting with my roomie about it. They said sure. \n\nHe stayed in his room for about all of 2 days before he knocked on my door and asked for help moving the rest of his stuff in. The first few bags went into his room, then he started saying \"o well you can use this... Or o this would be better kept in your room we wont use it in mine..\" (Dvds,game console ect the tv is in my room) Well by the end of it he was pretty much moved into my room with his room being a rather expensive closet. \n\nAfter 1 month of paying for 2 rooms we made an arrangment to pay a bit more for just the one and keep looking to fill the 3rd. Everything was great and i didnt see any issue.... \n\nThen BOOM he is blowing up my phone while im at work constantly, like if i didnt answer his text in 4 mins or less he would text again and then call. That would go on all shift. Then he started telling me to \"keep my stress about work at work\" but keep bringing his home and get mad when i ask him to do the same. He wanted to know where i was 100% of the time and would even show up to my work unannounced almost like he was checking that i was not lieing. (I never did or give him reason to think so) It was just such an emotional drain and 180 flip that i couldn't do it anymore. I was already thinking about asking him to move back to the 3rd room. \n\nThen last night happened. \n\nI worked 6-2 at another property as a favor. He did his normal blow up right as my office got busy so i just put my phone on silent. Well that made me miss a call from my boss (im an assistant manager in a hotel) and i 100% cannot miss calls from her. So not ok. She was only calling me to ask if i would cover another property, as that properties manager had forgoten to schedule someone for that shift. I said sure cant say no to some good OT! That ment i had to go back to work at 6pm-10 (split it with someone else). Problem was that she gave me a property number not the name, so i had planned to leave early and run by my location to look it up. He wanted to know where i was going to be working and didnt like that i could not give him an answer right then, but asked me to text when i had time. \n\nYou guessed it. I never had the time until the last 30 mins of my shift. I kept trying to tell him when i declined his calls that i had a lady in my lobby shooting up and i was talking to police. Even tried again when he kept texting me, but i was not even reading his messages, only trying to let him know i saw the message and i was busy atm. \n\nHe got all sorts of pissy. Sending me messages like this: where? Are ? You? Working? Or just a plain '?' Kinda ticked me off so i told him so and said i didnt want to text about it and i would talk with him when i had some time. \n\nI get home. He is not there. I crash out hard. Like dreaming before my head hit the pillow hard. (As of right now i have had 8 hours split up in 3 sessions of sleep in 48 hours [yes 100% addicted to OT]) He called aparently, but had no clue. And the rest of this long drawn out speel (sp?) happens all under 1 hour (i know this because at the end of it all my phone says i missed his call by 1 hour.) \n\nHe comes in drunk. Has his gun. And has been driving. I didn't look when he came in but it sounded like he was unloading it. He tries to kiss me and pretend that he wasnt out looking to try and catch me not at work and flex his pistol. \n\nIm pissed even more and ask him to leave me alone. I dont have alot of time to sleep before my 6am start time and well i was mad AF. He starts talking hella drunk shit calling me a bitch. Then he says \"and i dont even have confirmation of where you were tonight. Hope you had fun\" \n\nBoy i flipped around super fast and calmly as i could say \" im an adult. I dont need to check in with you. If you dont like that there is the door.\" \n\nHe thought about it. Mumbled some more shit. Then left. Stating that he would show me how to use a door and that it will not be a revolving one. I guess meaning that if i called to beg him back (i didnt) that he wouldn't, but he was in my room on the floor when i woke up. Suprise. Now he is messaging me trying to guilt trip me and saying im acting like a child. \n\nI dont want to reply and i dont really want to go home if he is still in there. \n\nSo how about it? AITA (or child lol) \n",

      "description": "Ok some background first:\nIn my school I have a group of friends I usually hang out with. Last year a kid (whom I'll call Jerry) joined the class. For most of that year myself and my friends never really talked to him. Then eventually we felt bad because he didn't really have no other friends. So, we decide to kind of add Jerry to the group. He seems happy enough and things were going fine until I added him to our group chat. That's when all hell broke loose. First, we had to add him to a separate one because one of my friends (whom I'll call Kat) HATED him. Whenever Jerry and her were together she would just not be for it. So, after Jerry and Kat are separate group chats we realized that Jerry cannot take a joke for his life. So, we have to be literal with everything that we say (which is hard because we all are sarcastic). Once again, it wasn't much of a big deal until Jerry says one day (when for some reason he and Kat were in the same chat) \"Hey Kat I like your ass.\" We were all shocked because he was still new and stuff. Of course we all take offense to this because we've known Kat for longer and we thought he was serious. Then my other friend (we'll call Jub) starts trying to defend him until he says \"Jub I like your ass\" and \"I look at Jub and Kat ass.\" Yeah Jerry was kicked soon after. Jub tried to defend him but the rest of us agreed that he went way too far. Now fast forward to the next school year. Kat had left the school so now there's an open spot at our table for 4 (the rest of the group was spread throughout different classes). Jerry decides to take it. Here comes part two. We notice that Jerry tends to stare... In the wrong places. In a group of 80% girls this is a problem. On top of that he doesn't do his work (a problem for a group of people who do their work) and is a constant distraction. He also starts to be VERY annoying. He will constantly try to peek into others conversations, fake a throw or hit to you and swap pencils. All of us start to become very annoyed. Even Jub, who at first defended him wanted to cut him off. I wanted to give him one last chance however. So we kept him. Now here's the final straw. He starts to hangout with this group of boys we call \"roaches.\" They are loud, disrespectful, and just all around annoying. So now, Jerry's attracting the wrong people over here and we're all over it. My two other friends in the class have already cut him off but I'm hesitant to. So, Jerry constantly is around me doing the same stuff. I've tried to subtly cut him off but he's too dense to realize the hints. He's also recently said things about my girlfriends ass and I didn't like that. \n\nLong story short: Am I the Asshole if I cut off a person who is a pervert, constantly being annoying and distracting, and said perveted things about my girlfriend?\n\n",

      "description": "Backstory is that I haven’t seen this group of friends for around a year. And they’ve been off doing their own things and hanging out amongst themselves without me, because it was awkward between me and another person in that group, and that person made it clear that if I was going, he wouldn’t go (which I think is fair, because he can’t stop them from asking me to go, but he doesn’t want to put himself in an awkward situation). \n\nI just don’t get good feelings because I feel like they made a choice, which while I don’t blame them for, has definitely affected the way I feel towards them. \n\nThe last time I met them, it was because that person was finally no longer awkward, but when I went, I felt really left out (which I Guess was to be expected, given that I hadn’t seen them in a long time). \n\nSo this time, I got added into a group to arrange a meetup. I didn’t speak at all, and never put my name under any days to indicate availability (they were asking), and neither did I vote for any of the choices for what to eat. \n\nI thought it was pretty safe to assume I wasn’t going, but now it looks like from what one of the guys are saying, I’m going. \n\nTo be frank, I honestly don’t feel like I owe them an explanation, but I was wondering if I’m being an asshole about this whole thing and if not turning up without notice would make me an asshole.

      "description": "So a little back history of us.. My boyfriend and I have been together a few years now and have a son on the way. Sex has always been a touchy subject for me as right before we met, I was sexually assaulted. I’m incredibly grateful that he stuck it through while I dealt it when he could have made a run for the door after finding out. He was patient with me when I had any panic attacks or if I needed to stop when we were having sex. Because of all this we’ve always tried to be as open as possible with each other. \n\nWhen we started dating he told me about the kind of porn he likes to watch and how often he would watch it. It wasn’t a big deal, I thought it was normal. However lately I’ve been getting a little irritated at the fact that sometimes right after sex I’ll catch him watching videos or looking at pictures on his phone while he masturbates. He’s told me before that he does it when he’s bored or tired and even though I never really understood that it was okay. He will even watch it during breaks at work and stuff. It’s not like he’s ever hiding it, if I ask about it he’s completely open with me about it. So maybe I’m being extra sensitive since I’m pregnant but it’s starting to bother me now. We have sex a few times a week, mostly during the weekends since our schedules aren’t always in sync. \n\nHe’s told me before he feels like his relationship with porn wasn’t always healthy because he was exposed to it at a very young age. His sex drive has always been a bit higher than mine, (I mentioned the assault earlier) so I try to be understanding as well. But now I’m starting to feel insecure like I was in the beginning of our relationship. Yesterday we had a long but enjoyable day and when we were settling down in bed together he tried to make a move but I was just so exhausted from the day that it was hard to get in the mood and he got a bit frustrated about it and we went to bed. Today, I felt better and we had sex and had breakfast afterwards. He said he wanted to lay down for a bit while I took care of some things around the house. About forty minutes later, I went inside the room and he shuffled around a bit.. I asked what he was doing and he said he was getting aroused looking at pictures of fit girls on Instagram and it hurt my feelings a bit and I told him that it upset me and I walked out. \n\nAm I being the asshole for just now starting to get angry at the fact that he’s looking at porn when it wasn’t a problem before? I feel like I don’t know what to think and that my emotions might be out of control because of the pregnancy. ",

      "description": "First time every posting so sorry if it’s a mess.\n\nSo my friend and I were on a cross country train and after moving a couple times due to carriage changes we got to these seats for like half an hour. \n\nWe were just listening to music together and remembered that we had weird conversations with our ex music teacher and decided to look back through them. We were 16 at the time while he was 35 when they started and went on sporadically for about a year. He talked about getting me and my friend ‘wankered’ and more. we were discussing how young we were and had no idea how creepy all the kinds of stuff he was saying to us was and discussing if this was ok. I don’t know how loud it was to others but we weren’t whispering I’d say like normal conversation tone which may be weird for a busy train but at this point there’s like one person every 10 empty seats and no one is opposite us. Then this guy from a table next to us speaks up and says ‘I don’t think that’s a very appropriate conversation to be having on a train’. We were so embarrassed as he called us out loudly and me and my friend DONT do confrontation. We were shocked because he had headphones in and made a point of disdainfully removing them to y’all to us. honestly we were quite unaware of anyone else around us being uncomfortable. \n\nWe get he could have been triggered but also we feel like it was an asshole thing and we’d like opinions (please be gentle we mean no harm and just want to know if we fucked up)\n\nAre we the assholes for having this conversation on a train or was it weird for this guy to butt in?

      "description": "Hear me out. My boyfriend and I are away this weekend. We have five pets who are very dear to us - two cats, two dogs and our iguana. \n\nWe have a pet cam that I use to check up on them every so often while I’m away or at work. I also use it for security reasons, but that’s a different story. It sends notifications to my phone when significant movement is detected, such as someone walking in or out of the door. \n\nAnyway, we asked his friend to watch our pets for us while we were gone. We offered $200 for the weekend and he said it was fine. \n\nWe keep the dogs in a crate when we’re not home. We left at about 7:30 that morning. My camera showed me that my bfs friend didn’t get to the house until well after 9pm. My poor dogs were locked up all day. I was irritated, but let it go because I figured he had to work or something. But when I checked in again, not even an hour later...the dogs were back in the crate and the house was dark. He left. We agreed for him to stay there and that was why we were paying him that amount of money. We wanted someone to stay at the house so that they wouldn’t have to be locked up. \n\nAt this point I’m furious. I am an eight hour drive away from home and I’m watching my poor dogs being locked up all day. I never even saw his friend go back to the house this morning to let them out, and there’s nothing I can do about it. \n\nMy boyfriend is saying I’m being ridiculous by spying on his friend and that everything is fine, but I can’t even have a good time knowing that my pets aren’t being properly taken care of. We’re not going home until Sunday. \n\nAm I being a Bitch here? Because he swears I am. ",

      "description": "A bit of background, my former best friend and I have become estranged in the past year. We used to be inseparable, we talked and talked every day about most random stuff, and now we only send each other a meme or something every 2 or 3 days to keep the communication from dying. I don't really know what's going on in her life, and she doesn't seem to care about my life either. Our friendship is now just a shadow of what it used to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, her birthday is today, and as usual I called her a little after midnight to congratulate her and wish her all the best. She was out on some kind of party (not her party, to be clear) and promised she will call me later today to tell me when and where she will celebrate her birthday. The party was supposed to be tonight, and I only learned about it last night when I called her, so less than 24 hours in advance. Now, I'm not sure if she forgot about her promise, but it's almost 4 pm where I live and I still haven't received her call or message with details about her birthday. I don't feel comfortable calling her to ask, because I feel like I'm inviting myself somewhere I'm not welcome. I also don't really have a gift for her, and it's Sunday and all the shops are closed here, so how the hell am I supposed to go to a birthday without a gift?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI talked to a mutual friend who was also supposed to be invited and I told him my point of view. We are not organizing a casual meetup, so I believe it's only right to wait for an invitation to attend one's birthday. He tells me I shouldn't overthink this too much, that she intended to invite me but most probably forgot to call. I still feel uncomfortable and unwanted though, and I really consider not going to the birthday even if she calls me later to officially invite me. Would I be the asshole if I just excuse myself from this conundrum? ",

She also brags about the $2,000 bottles of tequila she loves *\"and I drink allllloottttt of that tequillllaaaaaa!\"*. So she likes to brag and remind you how poor you are. Shes horrid tbh.\n\nI have found out this company is manufactured in a province of China that uses child labour. Ive also found out they have a poor environmental record. I feel like I should say something as these are things I find abhorrent.\n\nShould I mention this in conversation at this event? (which will be the only time I see her until the next Christmas party.)\n\nSo will I be the asshole for doing this?\nShould I confront her?",

      "title": "AITA for denying my wife a new kitchen?",
      "description": " \n\nMarried for 8 years. 3 kids - aged 3 to 8. We live in a large 1980's house. When we bought it the plan and my promise was to completely refurbish. We've done about half the house - thoroughly, but not too much in the last years b/c of lots of work, small kids.\n\nMy wife now insists we refurbish the kitchen. The kitchen is now over 30 years old, originally very expensive but now shows its age. It is totally usable though, and in my eyes it's not that bad, though I agree it's not what we really want. But I don't want to fix the kitchen, not unconditionally.\n\nShe has a low income job, I'm high income. She works 70%, I work well above 150%, many evenings, weekends. I pay 90% of our bills from my salary. The new kitchen will cost $100k+. This will be all up to me to pay. We've had a few rounds of redecorations earlier, with contractors, and even though we didn't do much of the actual work ourselves - all the things like making plans and detailed decisions, dealing with contractors, buying materials, etc - I had to do it. She prefers to distance herself from these projects, just wants to \"get it done\" but doesn't want to be very involved in the \"doing\".\n\nFurthermore, I've developed this feeling that she doesn't really deserve a new kitchen. She has no real interest in cooking dinner - and thinks that I should be the designated \"gourmet chef\" in the house. Dinner is usually just thrown together in 15 minutes. She has recently turned vegetarian, which I - a meat lover- is decidedly unhappy with. But even these new veggie meals are usually just the same goop as before - minus the meat. I can hardly remember 2 occacions where she made a well-planned and tasty meat meal for me. Otherwise, her dinner priorities is it has to be quick, for the kids, for her, and I just have to eat with my mouth shut.\n\nSo I've told her that she's not getting a new kitchen unless something changes. I want her to gain interest in cooking. I want at least once a week a meal of my liking. I want the purpose for a new kitchen to get better food, not just something to show visitors. I want her to more involved in the project itself, not just showing me pictures from magazines. Things like editing work plans, find serial numbers for items I must buy, and actually talk to contractors herself and not just through me.\n\nShe oppose this. Says I owe her and promised her this kitchen. She does most of the cooking anyway (I make dinner 2 times a week), and if I'm not happy I can just cook more myself. She must have something in return for all working nights and weekends where she has been left with the kids alone, and that I act like a Scrooge. She feels unempowered since I have veto on major decisions. Since I'm paying this and has to see it through, I feel it must be done on my terms. \n\nWe have a decent marriage, but this kitchen conflict has become sort of locked.\n\nAITA here?",

In the draft, the better players(ones that can score more points than others) are drafted early, so every team has a few good players on them. \n\nTwo weeks ago, we found out that one of the people in group, we'll call Greg, raped a girl who's also a close friend to all of us (we confronted him about it, he admitted to it), and we stopped associating with him entirely afterwards, since he moved out of state. Unfortunately, he is in the fantasy league, and we can't kick him out of the league, which has another 16 weeks until it ends. I have been taking his good players out of his team(I am league manager so i have powers to do so) and giving his players to other people in the league. Am I the asshole in this situation? ",

I saw a dude walking towards me with his kid and his dog, so I moved as far right as I could and slowed down (there was enough room for us to pass each other). He continued to walk straight down the middle of the sidewalk, and when he got close enough that I stopped completely, he pointed at the bike lane next to us (going down the wrong side of the road) and said in a condescending tone \"You know, they have the bike lanes for a reason\" or something to that effect. I didn't really know what to do with this so I just said \"OK\" and started pedaling again. He then proceeded past me and kicked my back wheel decently hard.\n\nI'm relatively sure he wasn't justified, but was there anything I could or should have done differently in the situation?",

      "description": "Back in mid summer, I met a wonderful guy. Educated, kind, everything I could want in a man. From the get go he told me his job meant he would be away for 6 months every year until his contract runs out. We went on 4-5 amazing dates, never slept with eachother or stated we were in a relationship. But we both know we adore eachother. Before he left, we both promised that we'd wait for eachother - meaning, we will both stay single until he gets back, and we'll continue dating and get into a serious relationship.\n\nI have a very high sex drive, higher than any other person I've met. I've been in relationships where we've been having sex upwards of 8 times a day. He's been gone for 2 months. We can't talk every day because of the signal where he works, sometimes we won't talk for 2 weeks. \n\nI've been going absolutely mad, I've never been  without sex for this long in years. I feel so guilty even thinking about having a 1 night stand, I don't even reply to guys that message me because it makes me feel as if I'm betraying him. I think if I ever did have sex with anyone else in this time, I'd feel sick to my stomach afterwards. I've even stopped going on nights out so I'm not tempted -the last time I went on a night out, I got really really drunk and I kissed someone. I've reasoned that we aren't even really together,but I feel as if that's shitty reasoning, and I'm still an asshole.\n\nMaybe I'm an asshole for putting my life on hold, but I don't want to throw away a diamond standard guy for a bunch of rocks in tin foil.

      "description": "So, a minor bit of history, I'm a teacher at a college.  We are mandatory state reporters of child abuse AFAIK.    \nI was standing in line at a store waiting to get paint and I see the family in front of me.  When I first walked up, the teenage girl had a red mark along the side of her forehead, but it didn't really look anything worrisome.    \nI'm standing behind her and her family and while the mother is talking about paint colors the husband grabs the girl by the back of the neck leans in close and starts whispering.  I was only able to hear because I was behind them, but he was saying \"is that makeup I see?\" over and over while squeezing.  Eventually, she said \"It hurts\" and punched him in the chest once.  I hoped he would release her so I could ask her if she needed help, but he kept holding down the back of her neck and said \"We'll discuss this at home\".  When they went to leave I asked her if she was OK or if she needed help.  I could immediately smell the alcohol from the father right then.  I said I was a teacher and I am a mandatory state reporter and if she felt in danger or needed help, she could tell me.  She looked at him (with his hand still on her neck) and he said \"Go ahead, tell him\" and she said \"no\".   The mother said it was how they \"played\" and the mother said it was just them roughhousing.    \nI dismissed it, as he became very quickly belligerent demanding all my information and my place of work.  I wrote down my name and place of work as he wanted to make a complaint.  The wife took it and explained that it was how the two of them normally interacted.  I apologized for the mistake (which, I'm not even sure was a mistake but I was too concerned about losing my job to press the situation because our school isn't the most supportive of staff at the moment, and he was also getting increasingly loud).    \nHonestly, I may have approached a bit strong, but I've never actually had to approach someone before like this and my former Army \"Directness\" sort of took control.  I've seem some screwed up stuff, but I couldn't just stand and watch him squeeze the pressure point on the back of her neck like that and had to speak up.    \nAm I the asshole?  ",

So come to my stop I left the bus and they ask me if I want to talk, I reply \"Okay\" then they pull the car, introduce themselves and start asking some questions about my job. I work making ammunation so they asked me a few questions such as: \"Don't you feel regret or guilty conscience\", \"that weapons are for this country or  they go to another country\", \"how many people work there\", stuff like this. \n\nI gave them my opinion and some info but nothing too important, they diden't record me or anything so no problem there, we say goodbye and I go to my house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe day passes and I go to sleep, and then to work like everyday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI diden't tell anyone but I guess my coworkers in the bus saw me talking with them and today I feel really harassed, my coworkers constantly asking me \"what did you tell them?\", \"you are going to have problems for that\" and making my anxious because I don't want to talk about that and I don't see it as something bad.

First of all I diden't signed any confidenciallity agreement and everyone know what we do here, they even have a web page, and I think everything I do outside my work is my personal life and I can say whatever I want, at least that's my opinion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what do you think?

      "description": "For context, about 8 months ago I was in a long-distance relationship with a guy I knew online. It lasted a month, and we met a couple of times, but he dumped me and we didn’t speak for months.\nOn New Year’s Eve, he messaged me out of nowhere, presumably slightly drunk judging by his friendliness. I thought nothing of it and just went along with it, but he then continued messaging me the next morning. Over that day, he started being very romantic towards me, and I was pulled in by it, because he was charming and I hadn’t had a relationship since he left me 8 months prior. Early the next day, he mentioned that he’s seeing a guy he really likes in a day (we’ll call this guy Joey) but continued to be equally as flirty towards me, and he seemed extremely interested in a relationship. On the morning he was supposed to meet Joey, I asked him about it and he answered with short, vague messages, before telling me to stop talking about it; I presumed it’d fell through, he wasn’t meeting Joey after all, and it’d put him in a bad mood, an assumption that was further proved by him spending the rest of the day and night playing video games. I cautiously tried to be flirty with him later in the day in an attempt to cheer him up but told him I’d stop if he wasn’t in the mood; unsurprisingly, he sent a very vague message saying that he didn’t want to. I took this to mean that he just didn’t want to on that day, due to his failed meetup with Joey earlier, and assumed that he’d be more like his usual self the next day.\nI began messaging him that next morning, and he seemed a bit more distant; I was always starting conversations and he took a while to respond, but otherwise he seemed his usual self as a whole, making me think that he’d be romantic again (by this point I was interested in him, so I wanted him to be romantic). I sent him a single flirty message later in the day, and he unexpectedly flipped out; he claimed that we’d agreed to stop (I assume he was referring to the message the day before, which I mistakenly thought only referred to that day). That was followed by the revelation that his boyfriend (presumably Joey) was sitting right next to him and read the message; I wasn’t told that he’d got a boyfriend, yet my ex went on a tirade about boundaries, and pushed all the blame onto me. A few minutes later Joey sent me an angry snapchat message, telling me that my ex – who had been flirting me a day prior – was ‘his’, and that I upset him (I assume my ex told him my snapchat name, because I sure as hell didn’t). Following that, I apologised profusely and distanced myself from my ex, realising that he’d manipulated me. AITA?",

      "description": "Context: My mom is one of the top dog obedience handlers in the country. She trains and shows springer spaniels, and I grew up with 3-5 springers in the house at any given time. When I was 12, she bought me a springer, Luna, to show and train and I spent a good portion of my high school years in the obedience ring. Luna passed away five years ago, and I haven't had a dog since.\n\nMy husband and I have been planning to get a dog for more than a year. The reason we've waited so long is because my mom occasionally breeds litters to further her line of springers. She currently has one bitch that can be bred who was supposed to come into season in August. She still hasn't come into season eight months later, and we're getting to the point where we can't wait forever. We are planning to start trying for a baby this fall, and since I'm going to be the one training our dog, I'd like to get puppy settled and house trained before I'm potentially dealing with morning sickness, etc..\n\nMy husband and I talked this over and we decided that if my mom's dog isn't pregnant by June, we will get a different dog. I would love nothing more than to have one of my mom's springers, but it's more important to me to just get a dog than to get a dog from my mom's line. \n\nI would still prefer to get a springer. I know this breed like the back of my hand, and I plan to train the dog in obedience and potentially agility. I want an outgoing, high-energy working dog. This dog would be a companion first, but would also be my partner in this sport. It's important to me to get a puppy so I can properly socialize it, especially by bringing it around my friends' kids so it's used to children by the time we have our own. \n\nI've talked through the dog situation with a few friends, and have told them my plans to get a springer even if my mom's litter doesn't pan out. I had a few people recommend shelters where they got their dogs. I am open to looking at rescue puppies, but I'm leaning much more heavily toward getting a springer from a reputable breeder. \n\nPretty much everyone I've told about my plans to get a purebred have been judgmental and unsupportive. I've been scolded with the \"adopt, don't shop\" mantra and asked why I would buy a purebred when so many shelter dogs need loving homes. I think rescuing a dog is a wonderful thing, and I give people who choose that option a lot of credit. But I don't agree with this idea that shelters are the ONLY morally acceptable option for getting a dog. \n\nI'm sorry, but I do not want a dog with built in behavioral issues. Shelter dogs are a toss up in terms of temperament, potential health issues, and how the puppy was socialized early on. I do not want an abused dog that will be fearful or potentially aggressive. \n\nWIBTA if I get a purebred dog?\n \n\n",

      "description": "**Long**\nAbout 2 weeks ago, my roommate texted me asking if her boyfriend can stay over for a couple of days. I replied, \"Yes, long distance suck and it's no problem (he lived and worked 2 hours away)!\" On about day 3, I grew suspicious due to subliminal messages. He told me he lost his job and looking for a new one. The next day, he was talking to a friend outside and I walked passed and he my roommate is out here. I knew had a bad feeling. That same day, he said, \"we are getting a TV in here.\" I said we? and he ignored me. Worst of all, he would not give me space for the first week. He would come to talk while I was in my bedroom with my door closed. If I am on the phone, he would put himself in my conversation.\n\nBy day 6, I text my roommate \"how long is he staying because it's been a couple of days, is everything okay?\" She replied, \" I wanted to talk about that, is it okay if he lives here? It would lower the rent.\" After collecting my thoughts, I said I would rather move out if he can take my lease. The next day Rent was due so I said if he plans on staying, he needs to pay a third. She didn't reply for two days so I had to confront her about it Monday (Day 8). I asked her what is going on? He said he has been looking for a job but couldn't find one. She asked what would I prefer. I said I would prefer him not living here and if he plans to stay he needs to pay a third of the rent. She said she needs a couple of days to think.\n\nI gave her 3 days and asked what are the updates? No reply, so I texted her the next day. I asked, \"Can you please tell me what's going on. I want things figured out by Monday and I plan on talking to the leasing office if things aren't sorted. She replied, \" I need time to find a solution, it's hard to find someplace else to live but I'm working on it.\" I replied, \"No disrespect but I have to talk to the leasing office if he's still here and he needs to pay. I feel used but I know you meant no harm.\" She said she understands and will pay his third if need be.\n\nI don't think it's mean that I want him gone but my friends do. They said he might be on the streets and my issues are minor. I think it's unfair that I have to take in a stranger whom I know nothing about and help pay rent/utilities when I am still buying household items and have other bills. Also, there's not much trust anymore.\n\nDo y'all think I am being mean? Also, do y'all think I should tell my leasing office what is going on Monday (that will be 2 weeks officially).\n\nSome background: *I didn't know he was planning to live here until after a week.\n*After he came, they started eating my food but I confronted them about it twice (in person and text) and it didn't happen again\n*His roommate kicked him out so that's why he's here\n* My leasing office said if a person lives here for 2 weeks, he must be on the lease, and I don't want to mess my lease up\n* I am a 24y/o young professional, my first apartment in a city I'm not from, my roommate works too.\n*People says I should let him stay because he's homeless, but I seriously can't afford letting him stay here free and there's too many red flags\n*I LOVE my privacy and quietness\n*They're nice, but they weren't honest with me and avoided communicating with me until I confronted them\n\n**UPDATE** She left the apartment and took all of her belongings. Since we shared the lease, I am left to pay for the rent/utilities, and she didn't pay her half this month. She won't respond to me and I don't know where she currently lives. Luckily, the leasing office is allowing me to find another roommate. I am preparing for legal action.",

      "description": " Player did a creative but stupid kill plan, I killed him, he got upset and told me I was a dickhead after game, AITA? \n\nSo small background: I've been a dungeon master for about 4 years now. This is my 3rd campaign I've been running, and I've just had an odd issue with one of my players.\n\nThis session, the party had arrived in a small military outpost, and were supposed to find some way to get the leading military figure there to help the party reach a certain location (keeping it vague for simplicity's sake). One of my players, let's call him L, decided that he wanted to try and kill the figure. No big deal, right? Well, his idea was to plant stupid amounts of explosives (this was a steampunk-esque game, so he had access to explosives) in the figure's private quarters. I had established that this figure what both powerful, ruthless, and a bit of a recluse. So when he busted into the room and attempted to place bombs, only to get shot by the figure &amp; cause a major security alert, he got really upset.\n\nHe didn't seem to expect them figure to be there, for whatever reason (he didn't make any checks to see if he was there or not, just assumed), and got a lot more annoyed when his lv5 monk got dropped in 1 turn, before he could do anything. He stayed quiet for the rest of the session, and later messaged me that I was being an asshole for shutting down his plan. AITA?",

I message her later over insta and she says she was just kinda drunk because she's been depressed and stressed about personal stuff.\n\nSo just a bit of background, I'm not a big movie guy, and when I went to a networking event there was a booth offering the chance for free tickets for your business card. So I put it in since it was a company I wouldn't mind an internship with them anyways. I won the vouchers and they've been sitting in my email box for 4 months.\n\nI'm not close enough to her to address that it was kinda strange she's drunk in class, and I didn't know enough about the situation to sympathize or empathize with her. So I thought that it would be a good opportunity to say \"If you are looking to do something to get your mind off things, I have two vouchers for amc I got for free and don't plan on using them. If you want them their yours\" she replied \"I'd love to buy I have class at 7 lmao\", I was confused and said \"oh...their just coupons for free tickets u use them whenever, Im not a movie person and don't need them, and it sounded like you would appreciate them with the week you've had\".\n\nShe doesn't respond and when I try to say hi in class the next day she ignores me, and rather than sitting next to me like she usually does she sits on the other side of the room.\n\nNow the conversation is verbatim so if it was something I messaged let me know. If I'm overstepping somehow, I'm open to it. ",

      "description": "Basically what has been going on for the past \\~3 years is that I have done all the chores for my brothers. Be it laundry, dishes, cleaning stuff, walking the dog etc., I am the first person called and when she calls for all of us I am the only one that comes (I don't know if they ignore her or if they actually don't hear her).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI usually do it without complaint, because you know, chores. However, in the past 2 months, I've been putting some resistance to it, and ask her to have my brothers do it. She says she will and then never follows up on it, and the next day I'm doing everything again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day I make sure they come. I ask \"Maybe brother should walk the dog.\" She says he can do another chore and I put my foot down and make her call him down, cause I've walked the dog twice that day, and she goes back to her office to work. Fucker says \"so which one of us are going? I have to get back to my game.\" so I just say no I got it, and go walk the dog. When I get back I have another chore to do and I flip the fuck out on my mom. This was basically the interaction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMo: Hey sheckle's, can you do the washer?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM: No\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMo: Why? I don't want to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM: Well I just think I'm doing everything and I constantly tell you what I do and why I think my brothers should do it, you say you will fix it by making them do the chores and they still don't come down, so you call me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMo: Oh my god sheckles, stop worrying about your brothers, they are fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM: Little brother hasn't even walked the dog in a week!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMo: 4 years ago you were just like him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM: Does that mean he should continue to be lazy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMo: Sheckles stop being so petty, I tell you to do it because you do it the best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM: What the fuck does that mean? I do it the best because I'm the only one that does anything! Maybe you should teach them how to do chores and make them get off their games to help me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMo: Stop being rude! I'm not talking about this with you anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that point I went to my room and I haven't left. It's morning and school is in a bit, and I'm not exactly excited to go down. I feel like I'm in the right, but I don't know. am I really being that petty? Should I just do the chores?\n\nI rarely fight with my mom so this is a very big deal for me and I don't know how she reacted.\n\nTL;DR: I'm putting my foot down about doing chores around the house and I got into a fight with my mom.

Well our TV was moved because we are letting her little brother borrow it, we don’t rely on it. However my SO then moved her essential oils diffuser thing and put it on that shelf, we don’t have a lot of space in the room and I shit you not there is nowhere else for my books to go, the shelf is filled with the babies books, toys and whatnot- her desk is covered in her college stuff, and the dresser is occupied by both our things. She usually has her diffuser up in the window sill. Now before you say “why not put the books there” they are big books and her diffuser is about half the width and she commonly occupies it with her food and drink which I also didn’t want to risk spilling on the books.\n\nNow I figured she’d have moved it back, i had told her I would not like it as the vapours falling around my books would warp the pages. She said they would not and continued to use the diffuser there. She only ever turns it on when I’m not around anyways because I cant stand the oils but I had assumed she would have moved it. Having not I put it back on the window sill and later she had moved it back, being busy with work and so-on it kind of faded from my mind until I picked up my books to see all 3 of them with warped wavy pages. This made me upset and I told my SO and she does not understand why I am so upset “It’s just a book it still works stop being a dick about it” is what I usually got. I know the book isn’t like destroyed but the wavy pages bother me and some may/may not understand but it’s just not pleasant.\n\nAITA for being upset at her, or are they “just books”?",

      "description": "This sounds really petty and boring but it ends with me getting sour milk thrown at me while I was at work and I'm still mad about it to this day.\n\nSo when I was 16 I worked at a local newsagents which also sold general corner shop items, like milk. I was left in there on my own for 9 hour shifts on a Saturday, and the owner of the shop only used to come in at the end of my shift to pay me The owner had told me to start being stricter with customers, since I often gave in to complaints and gave refunds for things like late newspaper deliveries etc. and I was losing him money.\n\nOne day this man comes in and says that the milk he bought at the shop yesterday was out of date and asked if he could swap it for another carton. When I checked the sell-by date, it was yesterday's date, as in it was in-date when we sold it yesterday, but overnight it passed its sell-by and was now gross. So remembering what my boss told me I told the guy no, I wouldn't let him take a new carton, since we never actually sold out-of-date milk. He then got furious, called me a \"fucking dickhead\" for being trying to rip him off and for petty about a £1 carton of milk and as he left the shop he threw the carton of milk over his shoulder at me. It didn't hit me but it did burst open over the floor behind the till and I had to clean it up and it smelt absolutely vile. When my boss comes in to do some paperwork he asks me about the smell and I tell him the story, to which he angrily replies \"you should have just given him a new carton, you've now lost me a loyal customer\". I'm not over this 5 years later. Was I an arsehole for not refunding the out of date milk? ",

She said sorry several times but I never fully forgave her for the nasty things she said. What she said really hurt and still effects me to today BTW. Anyways, some years pass leading to now and I just stopped talking to her because I got really fed up.

      "description": "Yesterday, I got on a plane for a 6 hour flight across the US. Traveling is usually not too bad for me, because I'm like 5'0, 90lbs, despite being a 15 year old boy, so leg room is never an issue.\n\nMy flight was under booked, so there was only gonna be one other person in my row of three. I settle into the window seat (which was on my ticket) and wait. Finally, a woman shows up, she's about 25 and very tall, like maybe 5'11 or 6'0. She sits down in the aisle seat leaving a gap between us cause why not.\n\nShe makes friendly conversation with me, talking about her work and stuff, and I politely smile and listen, I don't mind any of that. Then she asks, because she's so tall, if she can have the window seat so she can stretch her legs without blocking the aisle. I happily say yes and switch with her and there's no problem. \n\nA bit into the flight, she starts putting her stuff on the middle seat; her bag, her laptop - just for extra storage. I truly don't mind, I wouldn't have used it anyway. But then, she tells me that she's feeling really cramped, and needs more leg room. My legs barely touch the floor, so I offered to sit criss cross so she could stretch her legs across all three seats. \n\nThings are fine for a while, I figure this won't be for the whole flight, but I notice her getting comfortable when she takers her shoes off. Twenty minutes later she fell asleep, still completely spread out, with her headphones in.\n\nI'm the absolute worst at confrontation, and I couldn't bring myself to say anything to her. When the drink cart came around, I got a ginger ale, but didn't wake her up for anything. I then decided that I had enough of her sitting like this, so I \"accidentally\" spilled some soda onto her legs. She woke up, and I apologized saying it was an accident. She smiled and said it was all okay and moved her legs. I had my leg room for the rest of the flight.\n\nI honestly feel really bad about doing it, part of me feels like she was being respectful the whole time and that I was the one out of place, but part of me also feels like she shouldn't have done that. Was I an asshole?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

All friends I know/have met/people he grew up with.  Some are married, some have kids, some hate SOs, some like sports, some just like making fun... Blah blah blah.\n\nLately it seems that when his phone 'pings', he'll drop what he doing- talking with me, helping the boys with homework, chores... Blah blah blah to read and respond.\n\nLately, I've quit talking if he does this. Then when he ask what I said, I say I forgot.\n\nIt annoys me. I tried to explain, but he gets defensive and then gets mad like ITAH.\n\nAm I?\n\n\n\n",

H is gf's best friend of 14 years, and I have known H first for about half an year, and met my gf about a month ago. \n\nSo recently, H has been using my gf's phone to text me, mainly to tease and joke. She claims she can do it because I only know her for a month, and that they are friends of 14years. Now, I dare say that I am a very outgoing and big man, so I'm pretty alright with joking and playing around. \n\nHowever, in the past they would let me know when H takes over the phone and is using her phone to text me, but now, they are just inter changing between them without letting me know, and I'm honestly getting freaked out by thinking that my gf has a split personality or she is just plain out saying bs. (Note, this is my first relationship, so I tend to be more careful)\n\nNow, I am not sure if H is the one behind the phone talking sh*t to me, or if its my gf. So far I've been replying to my gf, knowing that it might be H behind. I've said some quite nasty things. So I've been thinking\n\nWIBTA if i go straight to H and talk to her about it and asked her to stop, even though I'm not sure if its her, and without talking to my gf first?",

      "description": "Or trying to, atleast.\n\nSo, Ill start off by saying that I am currently out of the united states, about 7000 miles away from home. Im in the army and deployed so theres little in my realm of control when it comes to shit back home.\n\nMy wife is getting the new house we will move into, prepped and ready for me to come home. She lives currently 40 minutes away from my parents house, and she drove up there to grab a pair of shoes she left there a few weeks back. She has a key to the house, and has been explicitly told that she is free to come by when she pleases. \n\nWhen she went to my parents home, no one was home, and my mother left her shoes sitting on the porch. I then told my wife to go inside and grab my ps4 so she could take it down to the new house. I then texted my mother that she was doing so, so that she would not be alarmed.\n\nMy mother ends up texting me a few minutes later and asked which one she grabbed. I told her it was the one in my room. She proceeded to tell me that the one in my room was my fathers ps4, and the one in the living room was my ps4. Still not sure why, but thats besides the point. \n\nCome to find out she grabbed the wrong ps4 because of this mix up, which could have easily not happened, but it did. So i tell my wife to go back and switch them out. Thus, ensues the paragraphed text messages from my father. \n\nMy father proceeds to tell me that she had no right to take anything out of his home without his knowledge and permission. I get that, if it was his property. But the ps4 that was meant to be taken was mine, that i paid for with my own money. \n\nI understand that it was all mixed up, but not even 5 minutes later, that problem was resolved. He then goes off telling me that he needs my ps4 and my wife doesnt need it right now anyway so she cant have it. \n\nI then argue with my father for 3 hours about how it was ridiculous how upset he was getting, and that it was my property and my idea in the first place. I stated that he had told her she was free to do these things. I also stated that if i wasnt in a fucking 3rd world country right now, i would have done it myself. \n\nHe basically goes off saying im ungrateful for everything that hes ever done for me, and that i dont appreciate all the money he spent on me while i was growing up and didnt have a job. The argument gets so heated, that he states that if i were in front of him, he would punch me in the face. He just guilt trips me for basically everything ive ever done that has ever inconvenienced him. \n\nIm in a super stressful inviroment right now and to be arguing with my father about a fucking ps4 is ridiculous. My wife ended up jusy leaving my ps4 there, and obviously leaving theirs aswell, and plugged it back up. ",

      "description": "Okay, so I(M24) have what my be an irrational dislike for a guy I know (around the same age, a year or two younger than me) and I honestly just want some outside opinions. I'll try to keep it short. He and I are both actors (not big time or anything close) and the area we live/work in has a very small film industry, you run into/work with a lot of the same people. My dislike for him comes from a few things. Every audition/character of his I've seen is exactly the same, he plays every character like they're a tough guy even if they're not written that way, which makes me think he just wants to look like Mr. CoolGuy onscreen and that's why he's acting. He posts stuff from all his shoots with hashtags like #actorlife and lame shit like that. Just recently, I noticed that the only roles he gets that are sizable are in projects produced by people he's friends with. Aside from that, he seems to only do extra gigs, the kind where you just show up and stand in the background, no audition necessary. He responds to some casting posts to argue with the poster that they haven't given enough information, and then will be the first comment saying \"Submitted!\" on another one that gives even less. Everything he does just strikes me as really disingenuous and I think he's a kiss-ass. I don't know though. I'm not jealous of or intimidated by him unless it's something I've suppressed or something, he's a shit actor anyway (I've had others agree with me on that). Not to sound all hoity-toity but I majored in theatre in college and met a lot of people who were in acting because they liked the attention, not the art. This guy feels kind of like that to me. I don't know, man. Maybe we just don't jive as people. Is this me? ",

I’ve never been in a proper wedding before - friends have gotten married before but it’s always been very casual! - so I wasn’t totally sure what was expected of me in terms of ‘duties’. I like all the other bridesmaids and did lots of planning with them for the bachelorette, did a speech at the bachelorette that was nice and sentimental (I thought, although the bride was too drunk at the point to remember it), did the dress fitting and was enthusiastic about the choice, responded to all the whatsapps about the plans… was early for the rehearsal, stayed over night and did all the getting ready stuff in the morning, bought her a card, chatted with her family all night, sent flowers after the wedding. All the things I imagined you were meant to do, But she’s just given me feedback that she was disappointed by me at the wedding. \n\nThree of my school friends (who I’d not seen for ages) were there and did get quite drunk. I hung out with them for some of the dancing but distanced myself when they started being really raucous and obnoxious. She told me I was ‘tainted by association’. Then she told me the other bridesmaids were always there when she need a wee or a drink and I wasn’t. And I definitely wasn't! I just didn't even think to be. \n\nI realise looking back that I probably didn’t check in with her as much as she would have liked during the reception, or been as aware of the stress that she was feeling and or dealing with but I just thought I should take a back seat and let it be about her and her family and the groom? She shared all this with me at another friend’s christmas party after what was a normal friendly chat. She always wants to be honest and “tell it like it is” - if it was me I don’t think I would have said anything because what difference can I make now? \n\nI’ve lived out of state for a while so I think she thought when I moved back that it would be right back to how it used to be when we left school, when we’d hang out all the time. And I want that, but we’re also were different now and lives are busy and it’s not that easy. I'm finding it exhausting to feel like I'm not living up to what I think are quite arbitrary friendship standards. \n\nAm I the asshole? I have a tendency to get on my high horse about stuff like this so I definitely could be. ",

      "description": "Me and this friend were talking when I mentioned eyeliner and how annoying it is to apply and wash off (normal makeup wipes don’t work u g h) when he suddenly says I can have my mum help apply it. I was about to reply that she sucks at makeup when he jokingly said «or dad :)» and my mood instantly dropped. \n\nMy father is the worst human I have ever had to deal with. He has given me anxiety attacks several times and hardly ever apologizes. On one occation an anxiety attack had me screaming at the top of my lungs for him to get out of my room and then it took days before I was back to normal. Can you guess why? He started shouting and berating at me because I refused to eat and clean a pizza he dropped in *my* room... Yah. Btw DON’T give advice on my dad, okay? Please. \n\n So I instantly reply «my dad is a fucking asshole and I wish he was dead» (100% true) and I immideately apologize. I say «Sorry. I just hate him.» hoping to not make it too awkward while also obvious that I don’t wanna talk about him. He says «wow rude» and theeeen we go back and forth a lot. He continues to call me rude and I finally snap and say «I will fucking block you if you ever tell me I’m rude to my dad again. I’m fucking serious.» I even warned him beforehand and said «You have no idea what you’re delving yourself into.» (seriously talking about my dad to me is dangerous if you wanna stay on my good side) \n\nSo he finally stops calling me rude but says I hurt him by threatening to block him. I know I did. I really feel bad for that, but it’s 1 am and I was really really not in the mood to talk about him, especially when someone who doesn’t know anything about our relationship calls me rude for hating my father. I don’t know if I would’ve blocked him, it was more of a half threat to show how I can get pissed very easily if you talk about my father. \n\nAITA? Or is he? Or is no one?",

      "description": "Let me start by saying, I am not a medical professional, nor do I really know how the American Hospital System works. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in a long-distant relationship with my girlfriend for a year now She's turning 2.. We talk usually 6-8 hours a day on video call, we visit monthly. She lives at home while we are saving for her to move. \n\nFor the last 2 weeks she has been sick to where she has felt she has needed to miss work. She missed 5 straight days last week after being the whole weekend prior, had Monday off or MLK  Jr. day, worked Tuesday and Wednesday. During the week she missed work, she was encouraged by myself and her parents to make an appointment with her doctor or go to the hospital if it gets bad. \n\nShe went into a clinic on Friday where she was told she will need to get some tests done and to book an appointment at a facility where they can be done. On Monday, she said she went to her appointment but was told they wont do the tests and to wait and see if it gets worse. She was feeling semi-better on Tuesday and Wednesday and went to work for a 4 and 6 hour shift (snow days. \n\nToday, she woke up at 3AM in pain, but still went to work at 9. By 11 she was on the floor, thowing up, unable to move. She said her stomach, sides, and back hurt to a point she could barely move. I told her she needs to go to the hospital if she feels like she needs to leave work. She said she would, then she sent me a message saying she went home to get the original papers from the appointment on Friday and she would go in. She also messaged me that her Dad was going to take her to the hospital when she got home. \n\nHer mom told her to go see her family doctor instead of going to the hospital, which she did, which kind of annoyed, but okay, at least shes doing something. When I called her on my lunch, she said she was at home laying down because the nurse said her doctor wasn't available. the tests didn't need to be done right away, and she can make an appointment for tomorrow. I later found out it was the receptionist that said that, not the nurse. This bugged me too. \n\nShe then said shes in a lot of pain and cant move and it feels like shes getting worse. After finding out she hasn't seen a doctor today,  I started to tell her she really should go into the hospital, because it sounds like it could be something serious. Her mom even thinks it could be her gall bladder. She said her parents don't think she should go to the hospital, I told her she needs to be an adult and take care of herself. Not wait for Mom and Dad to decide, I had frustration in her voice. She messaged her mom again and said I really think she should go in, to which her Mom called her and said \"the hospital staff wont do anything for you until you see your Primary Doctor so they know what their dealing with, the only thing they will do is give you a shot for the pain\" I said that doesnt make sense because what if its something serious like appendicitis, are you going to wait a day to see your PCD before going to the hospital which is something serious,\n\nAt this point, my voice has a lot of frustration in it and I could tell she was on the verge of crying. So I backed off and explained that I am just worried about her and it doesnt seem like she is taking it seriously when it could be something bigger. We've done that wait and see and obviously something is wrong if your having to miss work. and can now barely move. If thats how things work going to the hospital will at the least get her something for the pain, but if  your not going to go to the hospital, go to another clinic, take care of yourself, find out whats wrong.  I then had to go back to work at this point and already went over. IDK, I just feel like an ass for getting frustrated with her, but i also think she should take the initiative herself. So Am I an Asshole? ",

      "description": "Long time lurker, but throwaway because I know some of my family members/friends are redditors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (28) have been together with my boyfriend (28) for about 5+ years. Talking about our future plans, we had a discussion about our potential wedding. My boyfriend is ambivalent to having his brother/sister to be a part of the wedding party (bridesmaid, groomsmen, MOH, BM, etc.), mostly because his siblings don't really care too much about being a part of that stuff. The decision to have any siblings in the wedding party is pretty much riding on whether to include my sister. I know **traditionally**, the siblings and future siblings-in-law should be included in the wedding party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, if it was straightforward, I wouldn't be asking you all. So here's some backstory to this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister and I were never really close. She's a few years older than me but has always been stirring up trouble. She is a recovering drug addict but has relapsed numerous times just in the past six months alone. She's been struggling with her addiction for more than a decade and (from the looks of it) does not plan to take her addiction seriously. She also has some mental health issues that she refuses to address. Although it seems cold at times, I keep her at an arm's length because of this. Addiction is a crippling disease and it has taken a toll not only on my sister, but the rest of my family as well. The one lesson I've learned these past ten years is that I cannot cure my sister.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not ashamed of my sister. I'm actually deeply saddened that I don't feel close enough with her, like most siblings should. I want to support her as much as I can, but only if she wants to change. I'm planning on inviting her to the actual wedding, but I don't want her to be a part of my wedding party. Simply put, I just don't think she fits my perspective on what those roles should symbolically represent. But I also know that tradition dictates that she should be a part of the wedding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, let's hear your verdit. WIBTA if I didn't ask my sister to be a part of the wedding party?",

      "description": "A little bit of back story: I am a broke college student who decided to take a job dog watching over break to make some extra cash. The dates of the dog sitting happened to include that of new years eve. All my friends and I had previously discussed of having a get together in the town over where most of us attend college, about an hour away from where I was dog sitting. These dogs are on a strict schedule of up by 6am to feed, and if they are not fed around that time, they get \"barky\" and annoying, so I try to follow the schedule pretty closely. I was pretty disappointed because it didn't sound like I was going to make it. However, friend A, really wanted us to be there (Us being me and my girlfriend who were both dog sitting), offering to drive us down at 530, just after we put up the dogs for the night, and then back before 6am the next morning so we can feed them, recognizing that we have responsibility to these dogs. Of course we agree, if he's willing to do all the leg work of driving down and back, we would love to go, so the plan stands, as of the Sunday the 30th, that we will drive down and back all before the dogs need attention. \n\nWake up the morning of the 31st, low and behold, light dusting of snow and temperatures that aren't going to break the 10's, causing me to be wary. The weather continues on for most of the day, I decide to invite friend A over for lunch to discuss the plan, because I am cautious of going when the roads are going to be bad, weather advisories have already been called for some of the surrounding highways, and the temperatures are going to be deadly low. He comes over and I soon mention that I dont think it makes sense to go tonight, due to mainly the road conditions and our responsibility to the dogs. Mind you, the roads were indeed slick, I had just been to the grocery store and had experienced icy patches already. He immediately gets irate, saying that we always seem to have an excuse, demanding a rational for why we didn't want to go beyond just not feeling comfortable being in a car at these conditions. He kept saying that he got new snow tires and it would be fine, to which I responded saying Ice doesn't give a shit if you have new snow tires. He then followed up with saying \"Your decision not to come really says something about where your priorities are at\" and \"This may be the last time we see all of our friends in one place\" which most certainly isn't true (Everyone is in town till at the latest, the 12th). His arguments seemed to revolve heavily around guilt-tripping and a peer pressuring tactic, mentioning how everyone will be pissed with us if we bail. Our overarching reason for not wanting to go was not wanting to be on the roads when the conditions are shitty and our driver will be tired, however, we were the assholes for bailing on them because of our previous responsibilities. While we may of talked about throwing a party for new years eve, I was unaware of what the dog sitting would entail nor what the road conditions would be, yet he took it very personally, like we didn't want to hang out with him of the rest of our friends, when we tried to make it as clear as possible that it had everything to do with us being responsible for these dogs but more importantly not wanting to be on the unnecessarily. Does this make me the asshole?",

      "description": "First off, this is not about not dating her (now way that would ever be YTA), but about my reasons for not dating her.\n\nThis is a bit older, but I still wonder what this sub thinks about it. There was a girl (calling her Lisa here) I had liked for a long time. Note: one of my best friends (Alex) is also good friends with her. But Lisa got a bf (and two more after that) and I thought that was it and startet forgetting getting close to her. As it turned out, she was only together with her first bf for three months, then dumped him for bf 2. Can't say anything about him though, never met him. Now, she dumped that guy AGAIN and started dating bf 3 two weeks later (coincidence? I think not). That guy was (and still is afaik) an unemployed wannabe thug with no basic education. He later cheated on her, she stayed with him, cheated again and then she left him. \n\nI learned about this when I met her for a cup of coffee later, where she told me about how big of an asshole he was. I couldn't help but be abit amused, I mean come on, who would have thought that a guy whose main hobby it is to lurk around and smoke pot at the train station would be an asshole. Still, the conversation was actually quite good and so we met again a few days later for another coffee and in then asked me if I wanted to come home with her (a lot more suggestive than it appears here in text). I told her I don't and I'd rather keep this platonic. Lisa asked me why and told me that Alex had told her that I liked her. I thought it would be hurtful to tell her the truth, so I just said I don't feel like that anymore and then said goodbye and left. \n\nIMO she has shown me enough proof that her dating choices aren't that good, and I don't feel like being the next guy that she dumps for guy X+1. At the same time I feel bad because apart from that she is a really nice person. Does my reasoning make me TA? ",

I know snitches get stitches but I really want to text our landlord and tell them what's going on. AITA?",

She baby sits sometimes and does go to work. A lot of the time im hit with the, \"sorry i was sleeping\" or shes tired and wants to take a nap. I think shes going through a depression right now. I tried to be the understanding boyfriend and give her time and space. But the neglect is slowly overbearing.\n\nWe've talked before about this and she told me her side. She says that sometimes she feels pressured, so i try to lay off a little bit. She has anxiety and depression so i try to comfort her and say thinks that wouldnt make her feel anxoius. She says shes new to relationships and doesnt know how to handle it. So i try to give it time and let her adjust. Compliments and trying to be happy for us and all that good stuff is what im trying to do. But sometimes i feel like i need to blow up and let it all out about how i really feel. I dont want to hurt her feelings though. But im conflicted on what i should do. WIBTA if i told her i will end things if nothing changes?",

My mean demeanor hurt her feelings. She was very much looking forward to seeing me and didn't know I had a migraine. When she rushed to be at my side, turning on the light my room (a big migraine no-no) and approached loudly, I said something like \"get away from me and turn off the light!\".\n\nI feel seeing me fully clothed under the blankets and in bad shape should've been enough for her to put 2 and 2 together.  She stayed angry even after realizing I was in pain. Thought I should've been considerate and polite.\n\nLet's say for argument's sake that I had a broken leg instead. I believe she would've instantly understood and tried to help me. Because migraines are invisible, it's perceived differently to others.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

Now I wish I’d got out of car right then. Earlier he’d mentioned that I’d need to wait at B’s house with the kids because he needed to pick B up from the pub and we wouldn’t all fit in the car (I assumed he just didn’t want to drive with the kids in the car but was ok with just B).\n\nSo we got to B’s house, I got out with the kids, A said he wouldn’t be long and drove off. He ended up taking nearly an hour, it was pretty clear that he was having a drink at the pub with B. I sat on B’s porch getting more and more pissed off because I never agreed to that situation, I really wanted to leave but couldn’t leave B’s kids there alone.\n\nWhen A and B got back, I told A that it was a really shitty thing to do just leaving me there without asking me if I could babysit. He said it was no big deal, he’d had one drink and had tried to call me but I didn’t have my phone with me (I didn’t think I’d need it I thought we were getting B and her kids home and coming straight back).\n\nI told A I needed space and my son and I walked back to A’s house while he drove. When we got here he told me I was being ridiculous and a dickhead, said I’d only been there for 10 minutes. I said I was angry that he hadn’t asked me to babysit, so I hadn’t been able to agree to it, he’d just left me in a situation that I couldn’t leave. He said there was nothing to ask because it wasn’t planned, and that I’d been staying with him for two weeks so I shouldn’t complain that I’d had to stay at B’s house for 10 minutes. There was some yelling.\n\nHe could have taken the kids with him to the pub if all he was doing was picking her up and wasn’t planning to stay for a drink, so it seems to me like it was planned. When I asked him why he didn’t do that he said he didn’t think that me waiting with the kids was a big deal.",

      "description": "Hi. So, me and my husband have been married for six years, two years after dating. I made a mistake last Friday, and I need some help, \n\n\"Greg\" is a good guy. But, he can be a little frustrating, and that morning, he was complaining that he had work all day and that he wouldn't be able to unwind at home. I told him it's going to be fine, but he didn't reply. Maybe he didn't hear me, but he didn't even ask what I was saying. He kept going on, and then started complaining about our bank account.\n\nLast Friday me and some friends went out for a drink, since one of them is getting married and we wanted to give her a night to remember. My husband was okay with me having some time for myself. After a couple of drinks a group of guys get close and begins to talk to us. One, let’s call him “James” sits next to me and he begins talking about his job, he’s the director Of a small company, and he talks with such ambition that it makes me more interested in what he's saying. The night goes on and I've been drinking quite a bit. I can't really remember much, but I remember hooking up with “James”.\n\nThe next morning my phone is ringing like crazy, I go check it and I have a couple loss calls from my husband. When I pick it up I just tell him I stay at my friends place and that my phone had run out of battery. He seems to understand, and asks me if I’m going home anytime soon, I say yes. Then “James” wakes up, and when I ask him about last night, he just said I insisted in not using protection... I rush back to my place, trying to leave this one night stand behind me, but I can't forget this guy.\n\nMaybe I felt in love with him, the way he talks, and he being a young man that as control over his life. I remember feeling the same way about my husband before we married but now he has mostly giving up in life, constantly working and with no ambition. His dreams seems to have faded away, and now he spends most of the time working instead. When he arrives home he ignores me most of the time, and just spends his free time watching sports or playing video games like a child, with eating habits to match.\n\nAlso his sexual appetite seems to been though the floor, I tell him it’s okay if he can’t perform and that I don’t blame him, and I really don’t. I try to be supportive the most I can, but... sometimes that, gets to me.\n\nIs there any way i can save my marriage?\n\nTL;DR\n\nMe and my husband have been married for 6 years but lately we have been having issues, cheated on him friday night while drunk and now I'm afraid i felt in love with my one night stand.",

      "description": "A couple months ago a friend of mine came to me because he was uncomfortable with where he was in the relationship with his girlfriend of 9 months. She wanted to move in together because she was living with her father and didn't want to be there anymore. My friend has his own place. When she presented it to him, it was basically make or break time. Either they move in together or they break up. He wasn't ready for cohabitation so he agreed to end it. \n\nShe threw a temper tantrum, sobbing, bawling, and guilted him in to staying. He agreed to give it a little more time and see what happens. \n\nA couple more weeks went by and nothing changed. He had the conversation once more to end it. Again she threw a tantrum, and he caved. \n\nThe following weekend he told her once again that he was done and that was it. She threw a tantrum, but he held strong. \n\nSo she calls him to pick up his stuff. I warned him he was walking into another guilt trip, and lo and behold, he does.\n\nFinally, she shows up at his house with no warning to drop stuff off, complains that this whole thing has put her in therapy (after 9 months, are you kidding??), again guilt trips the hell out of him, and ends up seducing him on top of it. \n\nThis chick has no interest in him or what's best for them, it's completely about what she wants/needs. She can't be alone, so she does whatever she has to to keep him around.\n\nIn just a few months, my friend went from a confident, fun, secure, charming person to an insecure, second guessing, self doubting person. He's not the same person at all and it's heart breaking.\n\nHe came to me because he wasn't sure what to do about his relationship. When he told me about her and their relationship she sounded manipulative and controlling. He said he felt relieved when he finally broke it off with her, and so was I. \n\nI was hoping to get him back to the awesome, confident, charming guy he once was. I figured he just needed some time.\n\nBut last night he told me she came over, they slept together, and he agreed to continue to talk to her. After 2 months of him trying to get away, he ended up going back.\n\nSo I told him I couldn't support him anymore. I can't sit back and watch him become who she's turning him in to. It's. Heartbreaking.\n\nHere's why I feel like an asshole - \n\nI feel like she's manipulative af and I feel like he needs someone to keep his head above water. He's completely a shell of who he once was. He was my best friend for a long time, which is why he came to me for advice, so I feel partially responsible for the situation. \n\nAt the same time, he's a grown man and can make his own decisions. \n\nReddit, AITA??\n",

We are not wealthy by any means. \nWe got engaged last February, and started planning our wedding for summer 2020. Now, like most females, i have a dream wedding. Nothing too immaculate or over the top, but i know we can't afford it. Both of our families have told us they're not able to help us financially with our wedding, and that's fine. I don't expect anyone else to pay for my dream wedding, but i also don't want to settle when it comes to my big day.\n\nMy fiance and I decided that we would use our income tax to plan a little getaway to vegas and get married there with basically whoever out of our close friends and family wants to come, then have a little party at home for whoever cant make it. My sisters and parents are all paying their own way, but we know my fiance's mom won't be able to afford the trip, so we offered to pay for her ticket so she can come, but her boyfriend would have to pay for his ticket.\n\nMy mother in law suffers greatly from anxiety, she has her whole life. She skips kids birthday parties, holidays and other events because she doesnt do well in crowds. She does not want to come to vegas and wants us to get married here basically just so she doesnt have to make the trip. She hasnt said anything about them not being able to afford her boyfriend's ticket, and i am so torn. I see her side but at the same time, its one day. She's free to leave after the wedding or even have her own little vacation with her boyfriend away from the crowd. \n\nSo reddit, Am I the Asshole for wanting to get married with or without her? ",

We recently moved in together but there's one problem, she brought her dog with her. \n\nThis dog is a chihuahua/shihtzu mix and is basically a demon in dog form. He is always mean towards me, he will pee on everything without control, etc. I feel like this has taken away from the joy from living with my gf, as everything else has been amazing. It got to a point where I couldnt take it anymore, so next time I drove home (about 4 hours away), and my GF wasnt around, I took the dog with me. I gave it away to an acquaintance who I knew would provide a good home for it so I wouldnt feel too guilty. I covered for myself by telling my GF that the dog probably escaped from our apartment when one of us accidentally left the door open too long. \n\nMy GF has been super distraught over this, crying and not getting out of bed, but I think she'll eventually get over it. But the bright side is that our home environment is now so much better without the dog around. AITA?",

      "description": "I was at work and my girlfriend texted me that she just totaled her car, I went outside during a rush at work(I work in a kitchen), called her and asked her if she was okay, and she said she was, but just a little shaken up still, and that she had to go because she was talking to police officers about the accident. I went back into work and wanted to arrange for her to get a ride to my house from my grandma, who lives an hour and a half from where her accident was. I work 2 and a half hours away from where she got into an accident so it would’ve been a while for me to get there and comfort her, so I thought this was the best option because without my grandma picking her up, she’d have to go to her house and be alone because I’m not allowed to drive past midnight due to a DUI. So I finished my shift at work, all the while we were texting and I was trying to get her to get a ride from my grandma which she refused because she felt bad. then she got really hurt and distant because I didn’t leave work and come comfort her and said that she wants to be with someone who would do that for her, and it just keeps making me feel like garbage for not dropping everything I was doing and coming to see her even though she said she was fine. So am I the asshole for not realizing how serious of an emergency totalling your car is and not leaving work early to come see her? I’ve already told her I’m so sorry and I feel so bad that I didn’t come, I just thought I was doing the best that I knew to do in that situation, but she’s still upset and keeps reminding me of how she has higher expectations of me than that and I guess I just don’t match up to her expectations and I just feel like dirt right now.",

      "description": "We started off the night with a drinking game. Knowing that i am alcohol intolerant, one of my friends , Bob directed the game in such way in which made the chances of me drinking higher than anyone else.\n\nAfter the game ended I became a bit drunk. I began chatting with people and joked around, although I remember what I was doing I wasnt myself. eg. Came over to people and call them husband+wife, or take my shoe in front of them and asked them if they like my socks. Everyone played along.\n\nSally saw that I was drunk and asked me to come to her. She ordered me to sit down and would not let me go and get another can unless I drank a cup of water. I agreed and decided to drink it, however every time I would take a sip and place the cup on the table, she would pour more water into the cup behind my back while the rest of my friends would distract me. Everyone was laughing as they thought I was so drunk to not notice this. I played along the whole time. 10 min in, I got pissed and drank the whole cup in one go.\n\nI joined into the conversation and heard Sally talk negative things about people with glasses. It hurt my \"drunk me\", so I decided to say to her \"shut the f\\*\\*k up\". That enraged her. She screamed at my face and pointed fingers at me. I got my straight face on and said to her chill as i didnt do anything wrong. I didnt think she wouldve taken that so seriously.\n\nBob and another guy, saw that I was \"drunk\" and forced me to go to sleep by not letting me get out of the room we were sleeping in.\n\nI woke up on Saturday and no one had any grudges against me. I asked Sally's friend, Ann how did she enjoy the night and all she said was that I was very drunk.\n\nI arrive Monday morning to school and try to have a conversation with Ann. However she ignores me and then tells me how sorry I should be about what I said to Sally and my behavior that night. I look very puzzled.\n\nI decide to avoid the group until I rethink what I did wrong.\n\nOn Wednesday I go over to Sally, Ann and Bob and apologize for what I said to Sally. Ann demands that I apologize not only to Sally for the thing I said to her but to everyone that was there for my behavior. I refuse to do that and I stand my ground stating my point that: they knew I was alcohol intolerant and they knew that setting up that drinking game against me wont turn out good in the end.\n\nBob was pissed off at my because he had to \"mind\" me during that night but was the one to setup the rules of the drinking game against me.\n\nThursday comes and I casually try to talk to the rest of the friend group that wasnt on the trip. However they ignore me? I realize that Sally, Ann, Bob told them to isolate me from the group\n\nI wanted to fix this all so I decide to buy chocolate bars to give to everyone as an apology. Friday comes and i come over to Bob, Ann and Sally with the chocolate bars to apologize for EVERYTHING and all they do is ignore my request to talk to me continuing the convo they had. I leave",

      "description": "My ex-girlfriend (22F) and I (22M) dated for 4 years. About 2 months leading to our break up, she went home for 2 weeks to visit her family. Normally, she would constantly call or text anytime she’s away. So I found it strange that she only called twice and halfheartedly texted the entire time but I chalked it up to our fight a few days prior. She later admitted that during the visit, she hooked up with another guy, let's call him Josh. Josh (28M) is her family friend. He had a fiancé of 1 year, dated for 6 years. We had a double date when I visited her family a few years ago. I broke up with my ex, left to stay at a friend's place and told her that I'll pick up my stuff in a few days. When I returned to get my stuff, she apologized that she was very emotional because of our fight and Josh comforted her and one thing led to another. She didn't want to cheat on me and asked me to stay. Eventually, I caved in. I told her that my trust for her is completely broken and to make this works, she has to cut all contact with Josh, directly and indirectly (through her family) even if it means blocking his number/social media. I gave her a day to finish any business left with him and after that, I would use any means necessary, even if that incudes invading her privacy (which we didn't have any while dating) to make sure she holds up her end. She agreed to all that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week after, I found out that she was talking with Josh behind my back. He said things along the line that I’m not mature enough to appreciate her like he does and that he is not that insecure to control who she talks to. I was enraged at this point. Who is he to take the moral high ground? I picked up the phone and called Josh: For someone your age, it’s a dick move to dump your fiancé a month before the wedding to hook up with someone else in a long-term relationship. Do you even use the space between your ears for anything than growing plants? You should be ashamed of yourself, jerk. I then hanged up and broke up with my ex. A few weeks ago, the story came up when I was pressed by my friends and family on the topic of dating and why I broke up with my ex. Everyone called me out on the phone call with Josh that what happened between him and my ex is their business. He doesn’t owe me anything, so he will do whatever benefits him and I should not get involved. So, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for telling someone why they couldn't see and save my art?",
      "description": "TL;DR someone asked me if they could save my art (in a particularly odd manner). Bluntly told them why I wouldn't let them and they did their own AITA in the general chat. Chaos ensued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go on many public Discord servers purely to share and discuss art that I or others have made. It's absolute bliss to know that people appreciate and would love to get art from me.\n\nHowever, one specific server that I had joined recently irked me. I wasn't particularly in with the general userbase and not very many were involved with the art community and the general etiquette. Regardless, I posted a work in progress of my art, hoping for a few bits of appreciation or discussion.\n\nOne user (let's call him Poe) comes in and tells me minutes after that my art was cool. Poe likes it, and wants to save it. Normally I'd be fine if it were a trustworthy server, but something about Poe's approach just really... creeped me out. It's quite hard to describe it without sounding hostile. It gave out red flags that I'd noted down as the general characteristics of an art thief. Deciding it's better safe than sorry, I left him hanging, deleted my art, and left the server altogether (also due to how ticked off I got with the userbase.) As an artist who's had to bust art thieves, it feels awful to just think about being in that situation.\n\nWhile I was done with directly interacting with that server, my friends (who still were inside just to watch how things went down) kept sending screenshots of daily events they found funny. Over the course of the next two or so days the occasional Poe-asking-to-do-X-with-art screenshot came up. Examples included Poe asking artists if he could digitalize their art (in the same creepy manner), which only reaffirmed my paranoia. Today, my friends told of how some people gave a user some critique on their art. Poe had basically told them their opinion was invalid because they weren't artists.\n\nThat was the last straw.\n\nI wanted to give my two cents on his statement, so I joined again, never intending to post any media. I told Poe that the mentality he had doesn't hold up logically. No one needs to be a chef to know that they're being served a bowl of literal piss, right?\n\nPoe missed the entire point.\n\nHe asked me to show my art. I told him, word for word:\n\n\"you’ve seen it before\n\ni’m not posting them again because the way you asked to save mine in the past was creepy and suspicious\n\ni don’t know you, based on your behaviour i can’t trust you (easily), therefore i’m not taking any risks for my property to be stolen\"\n\nPoe was confused about this. I explained who he initially knew me as. Poe then proceeded to do his own AITA in the general chat, acting as if I couldn't see him.\n\nIn the moment I went to explain my side, he was explaining that he was just trying to be nice and respectful to the artist (again, creepily.) I told him that while he might have been genuinely trying to be nice, it horrendously backfired on him. Poe then goes into complete damage control and says it was a joke, and to not be triggered. (I'm not quite sure how responding calmly is being triggered either.)\n\nSoon enough, it turned into a full scale argument. Poe's friends argued points that seemed real iffy to me. Meanwhile, some other guy argued that they weren't seeing it from my side. Poe was still trying to say \"it was joke!!!\" Either way, it was an absolute mess.",

Apparently, on the way home they found a dead dear on a ditch, and my sister saw it out the window. When they got home she was crying and angry at my parents for not trying to save it, even though it was already dead. Because of this she went vegetarian which I understand and dont mind. But she kept trying to guilt trip my family to not kill any animals, and we butcher chickens about once a year. She wouldn't stop being depressed and crying for days until I eventually told her to just get over it. I might not have been very gentle, but it wasn't right for her to keep guilt tripping us and I wasnt going vegetarian for anyone. AITA?",

      "description": " Yes, the title is as dumb as it sounds, but it goes kind of deep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have this friend. We'll call her Jill. Jill and I have only been friends since the beginning of the current school year (\\~August 2018). I'd say we're pretty close but, having known her for less than a year, she definitely isn't one of my top friends, even though we hang out and talk a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway we have each other added on Snapchat and every day she sends anywhere from 3 to 10 \"Snapchat memes\" from people like \"FIRE MEMES\" or \"WEED COMEDY\" (drugs make me uncomfortable and she knows that; this is important later on). Around Christmas of 2018 there was one night where I literally could not sleep because my phone kept lighting up with notifications (she sent maybe 30 memes in total). I confronted her about it and it went a little like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Hey Jill can you stop sending me those, please? I'm trying to sleep and it's kind of annoying because it keeps lighting up my notifications.\n\nJill: Fine, I guess I'll go hurt myself since you don't appreciate these.\n\nMe: It's not that at all... I'm just trying to sleep and I can't when you keep sending me those memes. Plus they're not even really that funny. (Over half of them belong on [r/ComedyCemetery](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComedyCemetery), in my honest opinion.)\n\nJill: Well your sense of humor is in TikTok and hentai.\n\nMe: Yep, we all have different senses of humor. Now please stop sending me those.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5 minutes later my phone blazes with 3 new notifications. I ignore it, power down my phone, and talk about it with her in the morning since I was too tired to deal with her shit. Apparently she had been crying that night because I told her to stop sending them. Whether that's true or not it sounds more like a \"her\" problem to me. I felt like I was nice and fair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo keep the rest of this concise, from then until now she sent a few every day and I occasionally reminded her not to send them (with no response) but today was the straw that broke the camel's back. She sent one of those WEED COMEDY memes and I broke down (I recently learned one of my 13 year old friends was a huge druggie so I've been much more sensitive to that as of late). I told her that she really needed to stop because I hate those memes and she should know I do. She, once again, replied that she was going to hurt herself and that she felt underappreciated and that I needed to \"cut my shit\". Now she's been pretty much ignoring me but I don't feel like I'm in the wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I wrap this up I should mention that I texted my closest friend about this to get some insight. She said that Jill more than likely was \"into me\" (which, comparing us, I don't see how that could be; she's way out of my league) and that me saying that stuff to her could have impacted her more than I intended.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

He tries to make it out like I'm the villain. As if I'm the sweaty, smelly shit rag who's walking into peoples houses, stinking up the place. God I realize how much of an asshole that makes me sound when typing it out but those are just passive thoughts. \n\nI love him to pieces but am overly irritated to the point of avoiding him. I swear he knows I'm not just making up this smell shit on my own and is at least somewhat aware of his oder. I guess maybe he is nose blind and can't smell himself which I'm fully understanding of cause I live in a dorm where half the people smell just as bad, if not worse. \n\nAITA for being pissed at my brother and attempting to make him more aware of his smell in not so subtle ways?

      "description": "I need a moral judgement on this that’s coming from somewhere other than my own head because I’m talking myself in circles here. \n\nFor background, I’m a 22 year old trans man.  I’m independent from my family with the exception of health insurance (which I could get through my employer but my parents pay for the family plan anyway since I have siblings). I do live near my family and we definitely have a family culture of close relationships and being very open. My mom has a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer that not much is known about - a diagnosis is a death sentence, it’s just a question of when. She has now made it two and a half years since Stage 4 diagnosis (she was originally told that she had 18 months at best). She now has no evidence of disease and although she has to remain on medications and deals with side effects, her life has very much gone back to normal with the caveat that when (not if) her cancer comes back, she’s going to die very quickly. As such, I feel obligated to protect/help/take care of her as much as possible. \n\nAt this point, I’m in therapy and planning to start testosterone in the near future, and I love my mom and want to be able to share things about my life with her so I feel I should tell her. We get along well and have a seemingly close relationship except for the fact that my end of it has to be 100% faked because she is obsessed with me being her daughter (a pressure she doesn’t place on my younger sister at all). We’re talking “how’s my girl?” as the first thing she says when she calls, a sparkly pink “BIRTHDAY GIRL” card on my 22nd birthday, etc. I’ve hinted at the fact that I’m not a woman as much as I can without coming out, but I know that she’ll be shocked and feel heartbroken, like she’s lost a daughter. She knows me as a lesbian, is kind, caring and respectful to my trans friends and the trans community in general, and I’m 100% sure she will love and accept me after her initial shock. \n\nTLDR: I’m a trans man with a sick mom and it feels selfish and morally icky to me to tell her and add to her stress/force her to deal with the loss of a daughter, WIBTA for coming out?",

      "description": "This girl was a really close friend to me and my friend group but sometime last year, she left our group chat (for reasons she kept changing). So naturally, we slowly drifted apart because she wasn't part of our jokes or conversations. And every time any one of us would mention the group chat, she would give another reason of why she left and got really mad. \n\nAfter school started we didn't have much classes with her so we talked less. When we would talk, she would constantly call us annoying and acted like we were causing her trouble. In addition, she would touch us kinda sexually and make us clearly uncomfortable. When we would invite her to places, she got mad at us for giving late notice and yelled at us that she needed at least two weeks to think about it. But when we made last minute plans and didn't invite her, she would get even more mad at us and told us that 2 days notice isn't late notice. She always vented to us about her being depressed (which is okay) but every time we tried to vent to her, she would try to one-up us that her depression was worse. She would blame her depression on her rough childhood but her family is really supportive and sweet so idk what she was trying to say. She also took her music way too seriously. Once, she pushed my friend out of her lunch seat and ran across the cafeteria just because my friend said something negative about her music. She did this while constantly making fun of our music. \n\nSo recently, we made a pact to not talk to her and cut her off. She soon realized that we were ignoring her and confronted us. When she did this, she was being really dramatic and said the same thing to everyone. (Later, she sent all of us a voicemail of her crying). She was getting really desperate so we gave her a second chance to fix her act. (During this we were nice as possible and really reasonable). She didn't talk to us after we gave her a second chance which makes no sense because she was so emotional over us cutting her off. \n\nSince she didn't even try to make an effort to be our friend again, she started to cut herself off. Now, she's telling everyone rumors about us being mean to her. EVERYONE. To people she doesn't even know...",

      "description": "So around the beginning of last year my best friend started a relationship with a girl we went to school with, I liked her from around the same time, but I really didn't want to compete with him and let him try to start something with her. To my knowledge he only went on a few dates with her, and they were only really a couple for a few weeks, and I eventually learned from my now girlfriend that she never really felt a connection to him, it seems like he put a lot of value in that relationship that wasn't shared, she doesn't even consider it a romantic relationship. He did some stuff he shouldn't have that wasn't respectful to her and they split up. \n\nI never really moved on from her but also never really made any moves with her until she started talking to me over the summer, eventually we hooked up, and have been together for close to 8 months now. \n\nI told most of my other friends before the one who had been with my gf, and I never planned on keeping it a secret from him I just wanted to tell him when I felt it was right, but was forced into doing it when he was transfering back to our school, he said he was okay with it then, but I later found out he really wasn't. He's really uncomfortable around her, and me being in a relationship with her has put a lot of stress on our friendship, I didn't want to lose him as a friend, but I'm not willing to break up with my gf either, I love her.\n\nFrom what he says, he thinks it's scummy that I started something with her after he had something. I think he considers her as an ex girlfriend, but it seems my gf was clear with him while they were dating that they weren't there yet, he feels that makes her off limits now, at least to his friends.\n\nFor me I feel like what they had was so minor it couldn't be considered a relationship, especially since she feels the same way. I feel like he feels something that wasn't there, and they broke up because he asked her for nudes after a week, then made a diss track on her after she said no, and stopped talking to him. \n\n",

      "description": "TLDR as a haiku: \n\nBrother has disease\n\nOur bathroom is filled with shit\n\nI don't like his shit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for context me \\[18m\\] and my brother \\[21m\\] still live at home with my parents. This means we have to share a bathroom as my parents end up claiming 2 of them (one for both of them and another for my mom who loves makeup). My brother is a complete slob when it comes to bathroom use and he never ends up cleaning so I have to do it because I hate having a dirty bathroom. even when i complain to him or my parents he never does it (he's a little bit of a favourite). But thats besides the point, my issue is that he was diagnosed with chron's disease (which is a bowel disease which basically makes your gut uncontrollable at times) for which he takes medication. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso anyways here's the real problem pepare for a bit of grossness (sorry). Evertime I go to our bathroom I have to clean off our toilet seat because somehow he gets faeces on it and who wants to sit or even look at that shit? (literally). Not only that but sometimes the faeces will end up around the toilet. Not only that but on one occassion he somehow got some on my pants in the laundry basket (low to the floor) which I then yelled at him for and got yelled at by my parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn any case I complained to him first and he claimed it was out of his control and that he cant stop his problem. I was not to happy with the state of our bathroom and so I complained to my parents about it since he wasn't having any of it. They basically said the same thing of just try to accept it, he can't control it. I constantly get into fights with them about it because it happens non stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking that my 21 year old brother should be able to control himself a little bit more properly despite his condition especially since he takes medication for it?",

      "description": "My friend (20F) has a naturally flirty personality and is very attractive, so wherever we go out without a doubt as least one guys will hit on her. \nI really dont mind at all this happens and at this point, I like to just sit back and watch it happen sometimes because I get a kick out of it and she does to. \n\nHowever, I condone this type of behavior, while she was single. She got into a new monogamous relationship maybe a month or two ago and I think morally its wrong for her to continuously let guys come on to her(letting them hug her for extended periods of time, taking down their instagrams getting up close and personal with them). Its not like this is all in my head either. I’ve had acquaintances come up to me and be confused and ask me “wait isnt she in a relationship?”. \n\nDo whatever you want when you’re single but when you’re dating you have to respect your significant other. Or else you shouldnt be in a relationship. \n\nI voiced my opinions to her and basically just said “if you’re in a relationship, you can’t let guys keep flirting with you like that”. and she got very defensive. I later found out that she ranted to one of our mutual friends taking about how I said something that was “so hurtful” and “what about compassion and understanding?”. I was voicing my opinion for something I thought was wrong but she made it out to seem like I had killed her best friend or something. Was I really the asshole for expressing my feelings about this?\n\nAlso i’m not saying its her fault guys come up to her and approach her, but I dont think she should be getting numbers and taking instas. In one instance one guy comes up to her from behind and hugs her and grind on her and puts his face into her neck. And she just let it happen. \n\nTl:dr: my friend is in a new relationship but still lets guys flirt with her and take down their instas, am I the asshole for telling her to stop this behavior because she has a boyfriend?",

My sister (18F) and I (18M) decided to put a little wager on who got the lower score, $10 to the winner.\n\nOn the very first hole I got a 2, which was the par for hole 1. My sister who went after me wasn’t able to get it past the single barrier for that hole in 3 strokes. Our dad decided to tell her to reset and try the hole from the beginning which my sister did. She proceed to shoot a hole in 1 which my mom recorded on the score sheet.\n\nAfter a few more times of this happening (my parents moving her ball ahead for time-sake) and me calling her a cheater, the game was over. After we tallied up the score sheet my sister had won by 11 points. If she hadn’tve gotten all of those pity restarts she would have definitely lost.\n\nCut to the car ride home and my sister tells me to pay up. I tell her that the competition was invalid because of the fact that she didn’t play the game correctly and had been given so many retrys. My parents said that if a deal was made I should pay up because she technically won the game. I think I shouldn’t have to pay because she didn’t play the game fairly and she’s upset that I’m not paying up.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My mom had a stroke 2 years ago and I'm really uncomfortable being in the room with her while she slurs her words and chews her food, it's hard to see anyone you care about change into that but that's not the real issue.. .I also just dont respect her much as a human and the meds shes on make it harder to put up with her. She also needs my help after a small surgery... I dont live nearby and I just really want her to ask someone else. I technically can drop everything and help her but I dont want to.  \nI already know I'm an asshole.. but let me explain.   I dont care for my family, they're all backwards hicks and I hate being on the phone or going to lunch... I have a mom and a brother.  My bro is 6 years older and my mom was a single mom... she spent more time at work than home which was respectable until I turned 11, my bro moved out, my mom was sick of *doing everything* and I was sent off to the country to live with her abusive redneck drinking buddies. I lived with (different) other people from 11 to 17 (including a bf from 14 to 17)  then dropped out of school and ran off to 3 other states before finding a home in California for 12 years. My mom visited often, she became a truck driver to follow her dreams when she sent me off... I got homesick sometimes because it was 12 years and I forgave my mom for a while, she was someone I'd go out of my way to meet and i included her in xmas stuff. \nThen she had her stroke, wiped out the right half of her mobility, shes in pain, the meds make her emotional and... rude.  I was so worried in California, every phone call sounded like she was being tortured by everyone trying to help her... I felt horrible so I actually give up my job and home in cali and made my daughter leave her world to come live with and help my mom.   Now I had to get a job, then an apartment, and I got both quickly but maybe only because my mom called 6 times a day for status reports and asking what the hold up is.  I arrived in October and had an apartment by xmas. Moved her in, and became her fucking slave.  She treated my daughter like crap, acted like everything in the world revolved around her stroke, brings up politics and god entirely too much, cried daily over how unfair it all was... but mostly I couldn't leave my 12 year daughter alone with her, she was so mean and on xmas told my daughter she would always be a horrible person... yeah my baby cried and shes not horrible, I blame the meds, my mom changed after this stroke. She will admit she was a beast, so I swear I'm not exaggerating.  Anyway, she got sick of ME and decided to move back to the place I *saved* her from and by then I was done... I maxed out all my credit cards to get to Texas and help her and she lasted 2 months in my care.. I dont call, I hate her voice, and on top of just being uncomfortable seeing my mom in this condition I'm really angry that she would insist I spend so much time and money to help her then not need me... describe me to people as a selfish punk.   I really wish I just never came back to help in the first place. I ruined my life, it's been 7 months since she had someone pick her and her things up. I couldn't afford nor wanted to keep that place or job so I quit everything and moved in with my travelling bf, my daughter is already homeschooled so we are always on the road now and it's been better than Texas but I'm still pissed that I did so much for my mom and it was just a total disaster..  so that's where I'm coming from, sorry of that's long.  ANYWAY she has a blockage in her leg and I assume it's an angioplasty coming up and she called me asking of I could come (currently in utah but maybe heading back to TX in a few weeks) because she needs help for a few days after the procedure.   I just... I honestly feel like when she dies it will be sad but a relief and that makes me feel like shit... I also dont know if these feelings are justified or if I'm just horrible now.  Should I do it?  I havent told her how I feel.  Also she wants help with money and I'm not finding work on the road for extra cash and I wont be asking my bf for money to help her... she sounds so miserable on the phone but I hesitate to feel sorry for her.  I really dont have much family, I dont want to hate them, but 3 or 4 days with her might be too much for me.  I'm kind of looking for justifiable reasons not to feel obligated to ever help her again.   ",

It’s really helping and I’m feeling better since I’ve started it!\n\nNow, two days ago my friend and I were studying for exams and I said ‘I’m feeling really nervous about it, I don’t know how I’ll go’ and she loudly exclaimed ‘That’s why you’re on so many meds!’. I felt really embarrassed because lots of people overheard and than started approaching me outside of that study period asking why I was taking medication and what was wrong with me and it was an extremely uncomfortable experience.\n\n Later that day I told we that it upset me because it wasn’t fair to say that, especially around so many people. And that even if they weren’t there, I still would feel upset because it isn’t something to joke about. She than accused me of being overly sensitive, making a big deal out of nothing, overreacting and saying that I can’t take her Koen because that’s all it was.\n\nAm I the asshole for being upset at what she did?",

There’s this girl, let’s call her Ally. Ally has a notorious reputation and Bob is new to school this year and didn’t know much about how people are. Ally has fucked one of the most racist and awful people I know in 7th grade and has a record of cheating in every relationship she’s been in, including my friend who we’ll call Carl. Ally has cheated on Carl three times and Carl kept going back to her because he’s stupid. Ally is an extreme alcoholic and also has a cocaine habit and has spread false rumors about me that almost led to me getting arrested. I’ve experienced her face to face and kept a close eye on her relationship patterns. Anyways I launched my own little investigation to see if she’s cheating on Bob and using his cancer to her advantage for pity. I have found a bit of evidence and talked to many people and I’m wholeheartedly convinced she’s cheating so yesterday I lost my shit and called her a fucking skank who cheats on kids with cancer and many people heard this and Ally played dumb and then once she knew she might be fucked she cried for the next hour. Bob later asked me what happened and I told him everything. Many people suspect she’s been doing this but nobody wanted to tell Bob because of his current condition but when I told him he says he’s sick of the pity and thanked me many many times. So AITA for this?\n\nTL;DR: Girl has a habit of cheating in every relationship and cheats on a kid with cancer during his chemo treatments so I call her a whore in public and tell her boyfriend who is also my friend.

      "description": "Giving a bit of a back story to my actions. I work at a big airport with one of the biggest contracted company. We just went through training where they tell you to look for anything/anyone suspicious and to act on it to prevent anything from happening. The practice has been also been loosely mentioned over the two years I've been here.\n\nFrom previous experiences around my work site, we've had unknown personnels roaming as well as other workers from the same company but different department roam my area in an attempt to hide from work and get free money. My awareness around work has been up there because I just don't want a repeat of dumb shit around here.\n\nSo this is what happened yesterday. I was coming into work later than usual. I have to catch a bus to get into the airport and get dropped off at the first terminal. It's easier and faster to get off there, walk across the parking lot, and to terminal 6. While on the bus, the guy sitting across from me is wearing the company uniform, at least half of it. Wasn't in full attire, literally just had his work pants on with a t-shirt, windbreaker, and non-work compliance boots. I couldn't recognize him and in the back of my head, thought he worked at the other department. Throughout the short bus ride, he just acting off, nervous twitch here and there, talking under his breath a lot, even glancing at me back and forth. We get to the first terminal and we both proceed to get off. I'm still thinking, this guy doesn't work on my side does he? Both of us start walking in the same direction, he's just a few more paces in front of me. I'm trying to mind my own business at this point and think he's coming in for some overtime maybe. We get halfway through the parking lot when Mr. Suspicious gives me one last glare before he books the fuck out of it. He played Frogger with some light traffic and ran full sprint to my work site. When that happened, I get on the phone with my coworkers to warn them of a guy that might be coming in for unknown reasons, even though he's half dressed for work.\n\n I proceed to an access tunnel that we have that takes me straight to the office and here is where I run into him again, only this time he's running towards me. To me, that's just another red flag amongst the other little things he did earlier. I stop him, first by putting my hands up in a stop motion then gently held him. I challenge him for his badge to which he refuse and exclaim that he need to go now. I get more assertive in my voice and demand to see his badge to now he complies while yelling at me that he needs to go. I ask him why is he here and who did he work under. He's getting more angry with me just from his facial expressions and name-drops a morning supervisor but doesn't tell me why he's here. I couldn't believe him because he's not giving me enough information to run on so I escort him to the office. Now he's extremely mad and saying that he needs to go and doesn't have to explain himself to me because we don't work together. I make it very clear for him that he looks suspicious and that I have a right to know who is here on my shift and why the hell is he running away from the work site.\n\nWe make it to the break room that leads to our office and now we're smack right in the middle of of the room with the full workforce all open-eyes and closed-mouths. Myself and the guy get really heated to which he says I \"aggressively\" handled him and had we been in the streets, he would of killed me. I ignore the the death threat and I keep reiterating my point of how sketchy he looked with no badge and was running full speed down the tunnel. \n\nI realized during the exchange  that he definitely works for us but for the morning shift. I can hear my coworkers telling me that he's good and they just talked to him, but we're both going at it still.  My general manager steps in between the both of us and sends the guy on his way and me into the office. \n\nI feel like I acted appropriately given with all the crazy shit that happens at airports, I was following procedure and made a quick judgement call. On top of that, I can't stand lazy workers who tries to work the system by thinking they could hide and get away from it. Let me know if I acted out of line or whatever, I'm still racking my brain back and forth on this.",

      "description": "I work for a small company (\\~23 employees) that has a HEAVY family feel to it. I love it; it's very much a found-family situation after having no relationship with my blood family. As a result we're really open with each other and a lot of our staff meetings are basically just hangouts. I feel like people will hone in on this part instead of the actual point of the post, so I have to say: yes, it is abnormal for a company to operate this way and yes, many corps will have \"family-feel\" only to manipulate you, but due to our size and culture we are honestly all very close.\n\nThere's one coworker in particular who everyone looks up to. He's a morning shift manager and he's honestly the kindest, most genuine person I've ever met. His wife is just as fantastic: kind, hilarious, beautiful. Think prom king and queen all grown up.\n\nPer the title, it came to light that he and another coworker have been *dating* for about half a year. This was incredibly shocking since I highly respected them. When gossip started to fly around, the owners called a staff meeting so that they could come clean and the facts would be out in the open. They gave some pretty bad excuses: she just rambled about how she didn't recognize herself these days and he said he's been really depressed but, don't you worry, his feelings for her are true. I had to fight to keep my face neutral because it sounded like bullshit and I wasn't interested in hearing more, but the owner opened it up for us to voice feelings at the end. To my surprise, mostly everyone was saying stuff like \"we've all made mistakes\" and \"it was really brave of you to be so vulnerable.\" IMO they got caught and were forced to come clean, so no bravery here, and this is not your typical \"oops\" mistake. This is a BIG mistake that I find morally reprehensible (I realized that just last month he brought his wife to his girlfriend's \"just got my masters!\" party...like, c'mon dude).\n\nNormally this would be a fire-able offense, as per our handbook, but because we're trying to grow the company still the owners decided not to fire them. There will also be no further discipline (like loss of leadership) besides the \"really hard\" meeting because that was \"hard enough for them.\" We ended with hugs of support and encouragement.\n\nA few days out from the event and I'm still pretty sour, but everyone else is moving on like nothing happened. These two are still getting put on pedestals for being amazing people yet I can barely look at them. On one hand I know this doesn't really effect me, so maybe I don't have a right to be this upset, but on the other I feel somewhat...betrayed and disgusted? I can't rally behind them like the rest of coworkers seem to have no problem doing, which makes me feel like I might be the one in the wrong. I only feel sorry for his wife.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, please help: AITA for not forgiving and forgetting my coworkers for their affair?",

      "description": "I live in an apartment building [which has tandem parking with two spaces per per apartment](https://i.imgur.com/EVJncQ3.png), and access to the parking levels (1-5) are done via a locked automatic roller door which people can only get through if they have a remote for it (or sneak through behind someone else). I only have a single car, and sometimes I let my friends park in the space in front of my car if they give me notice, so I generally park at the back of the double space (plus it's easier for my neighbours who have two cars).\n\nEarlier this year a random car began parking in front of mine on Friday afternoons, meaning I couldn't go out with my car on Friday nights, annoying, but not the biggest issue when you live super close to the city. This continued nearly every week over about 5 weeks when I didn't park my car at the front of the bay (which I began doing), but times I planned to leave the space free for friends coming over or whatever, the car appeared again. I made repeated attempts to stop this behaviour by leaving notes, which escalated into leaving print outs of a photo of the car with the license plate clearly visible and an explanation that if it happened again I'd press charges and/or have the vehicle towed.\n\nIt happened again and this time it was still there Saturday afternoon when I had been planning on going away with a group of my mates. My guess is, someone went out on Friday, got drunk, and decided to pick up the car \"later\", not concerning themselves with the inconvenience it caused anyone else. It clearly hadn't moved, as my aggressive note telling them to fuck off was still there sitting limply under their wiper blades.\n\nI figured enough was enough, it was time to have the vehicle towed, so I called building management and eventually calling a towing company, who refused to help because the space was on the third floor, and they can't get any trucks up to that level because of the height and space restrictions. I had previously called the police when other vehicles had blocked me in and the response was some variation of \"Unless it's been there for long enough to be considered abandoned there's nothing they can do, however I am welcome to have it removed sooner.\".\n\nFortunately for me however, my parents only live 30 minutes away, and have a garage where I work on one of my cars that's getting at the tail end of a minor restoration. One of the things I use pretty often is a set of [Vehicle Positioning Jacks](https://www.kincrome.com.au/vehicle-posi-jack-300mm-5pc), to jam my project car right up against the wall of the garage to minimize the space it takes up. [For anyone that doesn't know, Vehicle Positioning Jacks are basically devices that slot under each wheel, then lift the car up on hydraulics so you can free wheel it in any direction.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=its2Kh-HKi8) Whilst I hadn't originally gone to retrieve them, when I had to take my project car off them, a bright idea came to my head.\n\nNone of my mates minded spending an extra hour to screw someone over that had interfered with us, so we grabbed the jacks, and went back, propped the car up, and wheeled it out. Six guys can easily move around a small hatchback, so we pushed across the level slowly and carefully, to an area where there isn't parking, but is a load supporting pillar with space enough for a car behind it, in a little section of the garage where it isn't lit and is completely out of the way. Typically there's a guy on my level that parks a motor bike there, but he isn't meant to, and I doubted he minded. We dumped it between the pillar and the wall, with the nose pointing towards the wall, I took back my angry note, the jacks, and we left to enjoy our weekend. [This is how the car ended up positioned.](https://i.imgur.com/x7S2B2T.gifv)\n\nWhen he came back Monday afternoon after the long weekend the car was still there, which was no real surprise considering there was only about a foot of space for movement between the pillar and car, and another foot or so between the car and the wall. From the fact the front wheels had changed we're guessing they did try to get it out, unsuccessfully. It eventually went later in the week, though I'm not exactly sure how they managed it.\n\nAm I the asshole for moving his car away from mine, and putting it in a position where it wouldn't inconvenience anyone else?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR:** Jackass repeatedly blocked in my car by illegally parking in my private space, including over a long weekend when I had plans to go away  with a group of mates. We used vehicle positioning jacks to move the car and place it between a pillar and a wall making it extremely hard to  get out, from a secluded, dark and out of the way corner of the parking  level where most people wouldn't have thought to look but also didn't significantly impact any other tenant.

He also knows that I’ve dealt with depression in the past, but that I’m doing better now. I think what caused him to ask this was last Saturday (when I was drunk to the point of not remembering what I said) when he said I talked about some things that he thought were worrying. So this morning, he sent me this:\n\n[Text Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/UVvfndy)\n\nI felt really weird that he asked this and somewhat angry that he thinks I have mental problems just because of one night where I was drunk, and a few other times when I wasn’t feeling great. I haven’t explicitly told him how I’m annoyed, but I didn’t talk to him very much today. \n\nAm I wrong to be upset? Is he just trying to look out for me? Any judgement is appreciated.",

The thing is, one time we were in an elevator together and he had a bad odour then too. Aside from those two moments we haven’t had much close physical interaction, though we are on pleasant speaking terms at work.\n\nI thought about it at home and figured if I smelled bad at work, no one would probably tell me so I would appreciate if someone did to avoid any embarrassment I may receive from further ignorance of my odour. The next day I sent him a private message in our work IM software, saying I noticed a bad smell around him and that it was probably just his nice dress shirt worn more than once or something. He sent me a sole 😢 emoji in response.\n\nAfter I told my gf and she says I was really rude and basically an asshole for doing so because there could have been plenty of reasonable explanations and it could have really hurt his feelings. She says it was unconstructive criticism. To be fair, two smelly moments isn’t very many so I overstepped professional bounds however I felt sincere in my intention that I was trying to let him know something that he probably wasn’t aware of and could hurt his rep around the office. It was a private message and I haven’t mentioned it to anyone around the office. \n\nAm I the Asshole? ",

No problems so Far.\nBut then, the buyer came into contact with me, because I send the wrong product.\nI mean I took Fotos of the Headphone. He could have seen which one he is bidding on. But turns out it was a Bose quietcomfort 3.\nI thought to my self: well my bad. Better buy him a Refund Postal-stamp.\nBut then I realized that I did not only have to refund the amount of money he paid for the Headphone, but also the shipping fee. Which I think is really unfair since I already paid the shipping fee. The money is used.\nWhich is why I send him a message saying: Tl,dr : my bad sorry, you`ll get a postal stamp to send it back, and a refund. But I cant pay you back the shipping fee because I have already used it to ship the product to you.\nHe then said:\nIt is simple, you have to pay me back (shortened version, he elaborated on that)\nall the money I payed, since it was your fault I bid on the wrong product.\nOtherwise ill contact the Ebay team to resolve this conflict.\nI really dont know if what im doing is right.\nShould I give him a refund ?\nWhat should I do ?\n\nBTW, I live in Germany",

      "description": "I got my IUD replaced in December. Before having an IUD I had an incredibly irregular period but I was incredibly lucky with symptoms - little to no cramping or other inconvenience. \nI do not have any memory of the adjustment period when I first got an IUD 5 years ago - all I know is I deemed it well worth the inconvenience to have 5 ensuing years of safety.\n\nSo renewal time comes up. I'm now with a different partner than last time. I go in for the appt. During replacement, I endure some serious pain despite being pre-medicated by prescribed preventative meds, but still consider it worth the pain.  \n\nA week later, we leave for vacation. And throughout the vacation I'm plagued with intermittent cramps. Not just normal day-to-day cramps. Cramps so painful I cant think, and so painful in my abdomen that the pain actually radiates down my legs and causes involuntary leg spasms.\n\nYeah, having a uterus is fun, guys! \n\nOf course this is very hit-and-miss. Some days I only experience minimal pain. Some days I cant sleep at night because 4 ibuprofen aren't even touching the pain. \n\nWe get back from vacation so it's time for me to re-commence my workout routine: 4 crossfit classes per week. \n\nFirst day back. It hurts like hell. I make a decision that seems obvious: I cant function or perform, so I will skip my workout that day.\n\nCommence lecture about how willpower overrides discomfort, shame about how I wouldn't be able to make up for it later that week due to schedule complications, how \"that shit didnt stop you from an adventure attempt on vacation\"\n(Referring to when we went on a 2 day hiking/kayaking adventure during vacation, during which I didnt have any pain during day 1 and on day 2, on our way out, I had such severe cramps that I could barely stand, but toughed it out while carrying my 50lb pack)\n\nSo, OBVIOUSLY this is a one-sided story, and I dont like that. But that's why I'm posting here: I'm having trouble separating myself from my viewpoint and I want to know if I'm really being a mamby pamby pansy, or if it's a real thing that menstrual cramps can cause pain to a level that exercise is temporarily not a realistic undergoing. \n\n\nP.s. I have googled cramps in relation to exercise and all I can get the internet to say is \"oh yes exercising helps cramps feel better!!!\" Which is why I am (a)looking for firsthand opinions and (b) having second thoughts on my instincts.

      "description": "My husband and I are originally from the same area and for the past ten years have lived about twenty hours away from our family. \n\nWe love our jobs and our friends, but as we think about the long term have always wanted to return to the general region where we grew up as it’s cheaper to buy a home, would love to be able to see people for holidays, and as we are having a baby this year, just want our family to experience the same sort of childhood we had. \n\nAfter years of talking about it, my husband finally got a transfer for work and we are making it a reality. It’s been very exciting and despite the hardships of leaving, we’ll be about an hour from my siblings and parents who are a huge part of our lives. We are pretty private people, and the distance is exactly what we hoped for — close enough to see regularly and support our family more often, but not feel so pressured every day. \n\nMy in-laws also moved away several years ago and currently live four hours from us. We don’t see them often as they are pretty toxic people. My husband was very open and conscious about his relationship with them in the time we’ve been together, and while we communicate and visit them a couple times a year, we don’t involve them greatly in our lives. They are very narrow minded, weirdly obsessed with online shopping, offensively racist, and don’t listen.  They have incredibly poor health and do little besides watch tv. When we went for a walk to see the flowers in bloom in their neighborhood, we had to stop every five minutes so they could sit. They aren’t that old but do not take care of themselves. \n\nWhen we went to visit them last weekend as we are gearing up to move and probably won’t see them again for awhile, they shared that they too applied for jobs in the same town and are going to move back. My heart stopped.\n\nWe chose the city we did as it gives us the space we want with the closeness so we can be there more often for our family. I know we don’t own the city, but the thought of them also living there makes me so angry. \n\n\nI don’t want them there. I know we will end up having to care for them and support them and frankly that has never been our long term plan. We don’t want them so involved in our child’s life which I know sounds awful, but I am nervous about their negative impact.\n\nI have been excited about this move and having a baby and starting a new life for ages, and now I’m riddled with anxiety knowing his parents are going to be there, too. Can I tell them not to come? Do I have a right? \n\nTL;DR My in-laws are the worst and want to move to the same town as us. WIBTA if we told them no?",

He later called me to ask me to give him a  ride from his place to the shop about 10 miles away in order to pick up his car. Even though it was inconvenient for me and I told him that I ended up taking him there. It turned out that he just didn't have their number and thought they would be done, so I drove us to a mall nearby to spend the next hour. About 3 weeks ago he asked me for money to get a monitor so we can play games together. I lent him some money and he promised to pay me back within 2 weeks. To this day I still haven't gotten a single dollat back. \nWhat really made me do what I did is what happened today. I had to take my car to the shop( mine is a different one, almost 1 mile away from his place) so I asked him to pick me up from the shop and get food or go to best buy (around 1 mile away from my shop) so I didn't have to wait. He said no and asked me to pay him $20 for gas and his time. I was dumbfounded that he said that after all the favors I gave him. \nIt was then that I remembered that he had forgotten something he made at my place, now this item is worth about 2 times what he owns me for the monitor ( less than $100) so considering all I've done for him and in a moment of anger I decided to sell it. \n\nAm I the asshole for this?

      "description": " I'm currently 7 months pregnant with our second child, and I feel tired and miserable. This pregnancy is doing all sorts of patently unsexy things to my body  I also have diagnosed anxiety with is currently unmedicated because of potential risk to the baby. It's triggered in particular by anything money related. What I would like to do right now, is lie on the sofa binge-watching the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe in time for End Game. \n\n  \nHowever, I don't have time for that. Instead, I do about 60% of all household chores, take care of our son (though he's in preschool and my husband certainly helps), and work full-time for the company we run together.   \n \n\nI'm wondering if IATA for doing all that in a less than enthusiastic way.   \n\n\nAs for our company, my husband's job is to take care of our \"cash cow\", which is rather pleasant work. Clients/money come in about twice a week almost automatically, more if you actually put some effort in. On it's own, the company can survive off this alone, though it wouldn't be sustainable in the long run. I take care of virtually everything else: the overhead, the website design and maintenance, administration (including making the invoices for \"cash cow\", since he hasn't bothered to learn our billing software – which I've also created entirely from scratch myself), and developing our \"rising star\" service.   \n\n\nThe latter is rather frustrating work, it consumes a lot of time &amp; effort but will (hopefully) bring in a larger profit in the future. Right now though, it's just a lot of work without any direct reward in sight. Last year, we succeeded in concluding one big project, but that alone accounted for 30% of our yearly revenue. Still, it's only one \"win\" per year, compared to his “cash cow” successes twice a week. For every signed contract, there's 10 that slip us through the fingers, often for reasons beyond our control. It takes time to build a name in this industry and develop this service, I know that, but right now, it isn't very validating work.   \n\n\nMy husband however seems to have taken to this narrative of me not pulling my weight in our business/marriage. I get it, his contribution is directly measurable in the money flow from “cash cow”, while my work is largely invisible (except from the growing babybump...), and is actually “costing us money”. For instance, I'm the one paying our companies' bills, taxes etc. Not that we have any choice is the matter, but my work makes the bank account go down, while his makes it go up.   \n    \nHe keeps telling me stuff like:   \n “Why don't you bring in a large “rising star” project already, we'll need it if we want to make this business profitable. I don't know how we're going to pay the bills otherwise.” (We've managed for 10 years already, so I guess we'll manage this year. Also, thanks for adding this to the already growing pile of anxiety I deal with.)   \n \n\n“What are you doing? Don't we pay our accountant for that?” (No, we pay our accountant for a lot of things, still, I need to actually provide her with the right info before she can do anything with it).     \n \n\n“What you're doing is a waste of time, why don't you help me with \\[cash cow related project\\] instead?”  (Because I believe it's an irrelevant prestige project that will be more trouble than it's worth and you have no idea how much work what you're asking me to do actually is. Also, the “waste of time” is a legal obligation we must comply with, even though it is admittedly inane.)   \n  \n\nThe latest was “Well, are you sure you even sent it out?” (This was after we got a letter back from a government agency, since they apparently lost the very detailed paperwork I included in the letter. As if I'd spend half a work day compiling and filling in 10 pages of official documents, only to then toss them in the trash and just mail out the cover letter instead.)   \n\n\nI could make a similar list when it comes to home life and shores, but I guess you get the gist of it.   \n  \n\nYes, I've been doing everything with less enthusiasm than I should, but it's like if I don't work with a big smile, the work isn't done in his eyes. I know I'm miserable right now, and not the loving, sexy partner he married, but I'm still trying my best, while growing a tiny human. So is it so much to ask that he actually give me that massage he offered 3 days ago, and that he stops complaining about how hard it is living with a pregnant wife?   \n\n\nAm I really the asshole here?   \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  ",

She had her first child when I was 15, she was 22 and I did dedicate a lot of time to helping with her first child. I gave up my bedroom for her, woke up extra early, didn't go out with friends and put off doing important school work to help her out. But now I'm 25, getting married and pregnant with my own first child. My sister has had a second child and is no longer a single mum, but her partner works a lot (they're saving to buy a home while living with my mum), so I still feel bad. I'm lucky enough not to have to work as my partner earns enough for both of us, but I'm having a really difficult pregnancy. I have had joint issues for a long time and this has just gotten worse with pregnancy, plus my nephew is in nursery and always sick! I feel like I've helped my sister enough, I did sacrifice a lot and she hasn't always treated me well or been grateful. But my parents keep telling me how much she's struggling and how I need to feel more sympathy for her and help her more. I don't want to get sick and use up all my limited energy on helping my sister right now. AITA?\n\n\n",

My company, well my former company, recently went through a round of layoffs and presented multiple departments with a voluntary severance package.

I am not sure what got into me that day, but upon seeing the offer, I jumped right on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that being in a marriage is to be part of a team, and that important life decisions like this deserve to be communicated with each other. Like i said, not sure what got into me, but being offered \\~$60k to quit was quite the rush. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this was about a month ago. Money isn't tight given I received this upfront. Problem is, I never told my wife and have been \"going to work\" each morning business as usual. I plan to get back into the workforce and have been applying to jobs, fully expecting to have an offer within a few months. I leave for \"work\" each morning as I typically had, but now usually spend my day at the local indian casino, gym in another city, or sometimes just go for hikes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: AITA for not discussing a quitting my job?",

No plans for kids.\n\nI need to know what people think of this scenario.\n\nLet me first say I literally worship the ground my wife walks on. I'm obsessed with her and she knows it. There's nothing I wouldn't do for her. I'm always trying to show affection in any way I can to let her know how much I care about her. I'm constantly making her dinner (almost daily even though I work), taking her on SURPRISE vacations to tropical places (her fav type), and just always trying to make sure she has anything she could ever want or need.\n\nWife will not put out. At all. I'm talking once a month IF IM LUCKY. And I have to beg for it. I've tried asking her why and she just says she doesn't want to or doesn't care.\n\nI've asked her to visit relationship coaches/therapists with me that could maybe help us with this issue, maybe talk through why she doesn't have any sex drive. She will not do it. Whenever I bring it up she just gets mad and says I need to just deal with it.\n\nI don't feel desired or attracted to at all. It never used to be this way. She jokes that \"Well i'm not trying to impress you anymore, we are already married\" but I don't find it funny.\n\nAs a male I have needs. I've told her if she doesn't put out I will just go get it somewhere else. I can't help but feel like an asshole for that, but I don't want to be in a sexless relationship.\n\nAnd for those who think Im the asshole...please help! I genuinely mean that. I Need advice!!",

Another shopper ran over to help him up but the employee wasn't doing much so I decided to try again, and my dad got angry and told me to not put my hands on him and told me to just help him finish up the shopping since an employee was there to help. When we were away from that ail he then explained to me that if I tried to help him and something happened or he got injured further I could be held liable so it wasn't smart to do.\n\nI told him that I couldn't understand why he would think an old man would want to do such a thing, and that if it happened to him he would want help from other people, but he just gave me the whole \"I'm older than you and know how this world works, just listen\". After this we got into an argument and I called him heartless and selfish.\n\nAm I the asshole here?

He constantly asks me for food whenever I'm cooking lunch and dinner. I don't mind feeding him, but he will demand it sometimes so I refuse. Like earlier today, I was cooking lunch and he asked me for a dish. He ate earlier so I refused to give him a dish until later. He grew angry and told me I was being disrespectful and rude. He proclaimed that I was starving him to death and that I was supposed to a pride and joy that he can be proud of. I admit that I yelled at him to shut up and that I refused to make him food. He called me an ungrateful child and said while he worked, he would slave all day in the office, getting shit on and that he paid everything for me and that I never appreciate the way he handled stress everyday. \n\nHe said \"you don't see what I do for you each day and how unfair it is to add more things to deal with in my life. But it's not your fault. It's my own fault that I chose to have you.\" Then he went back to watching his shows and told me to stay quiet.\n\nI admit, I do feel guilty about what happened and I was wrong for lashing out. I just fucking hate how he never does what he's told. He just watches TV and asks me to turn on a show for him, fix the remote, then he just sits on the sofa, eyes glazed over.

      "description": " I’ve (20F) been with my boyfriend (20M) for about 3 months now and he’s so amazing! I’ve been on cloud nine ever since we started dating. The only source of conflict so far is that he refuses to let me pay for dinner when we go out, every single time.\n\nThe thing is, I come from a wealthy family and am extremely fortunate to have my parents pay for tuition, groceries, et cetera, and he is aware of this. My parents do not mind the idea of me treating him to dinner regularly at all. Comparatively, he doesn’t have as much and works very hard for what he does have. I want him to save his money towards more important things rather than spend it on me.\n\nHowever, we’ve discussed it several times and he flat-out refuses to let me pay, and is unwilling to compromise on the issue. He doesn’t even want us to take turns. AITA for insisting on paying and hurting his pride (?) when he’s made it clear he doesn’t want me to? Also, AITA for wanting to spend my parent’s money instead of him spending his hard earned cash? I sort of feel like an asshole since I am insisting  that I spend someone else’s money.\n\nTl;dr I want to pay for dates with my boyfriend using my parents’ money because we’re very well off financially, but my boyfriend refuses every single time.",

      "description": "Okay I know I already sound like an asshole but I promise I didn’t want it to end this way.\n\nOkay so my ex broke up with me this past weekend. It was out of the blue, completely unexpected, we haven’t argued in months and he just wanted to end it. We were dating for almost two years. I lived with him and his family at their house, his mother, sister, his sisters fiancé and then him and I lived there. \nThis past Monday an old friend of mine contacted me saying she saw him on tinder. I was really taken aback because his main reason for breaking up with me was that he needed to be alone and single to “grow”and that he couldn’t grow with anyone else in his life. I was also very angry because he used pictures of him and my dog as bait “I love dogs, look how cute mine is” pictures on his profile (she was our dog but he said he didn’t want her so I took her with me.) I sent him the screenshots my friend had taken and asked why he had an account if he wanted to be alone. He grew very defensive saying that he had every right, which I agree with, but it doesn’t make sense with his reasoning for breaking up with me. He avoided all my questions about if he cheated on me or not and asking him to take the pictures of my dog off his profile. I was going to his house to pack my things this same day... After the tinder conversation, my ex randomly asked if I was bringing any of my family to help me pack my things later that day, and I replied I was because I had some heavy furniture I couldn’t carry myself. After hearing this he began sending me all sorts of “If you (my name) step foot on my property or if any of your family does, it will be considered trespassing and I won’t hesitate to call the cops.”. After he sent about 6 more texts asking if I understood that I wasn’t allowed on his property and that he would leave my things outside by the door ( it was raining that day too) I stopped replying. I instead contacted his mother, who owns the house, and after telling her about our breakup (he hadn’t told her yet apparently) and how her son was acting, she welcomed me and my family into the house to pack my things. While I was in the house, his mother was receiving constant calls from my ex saying to throw us out and that we weren’t allowed there to which she replied it was her house and her decision. He said I was being volatile and unnecessarily hostile toward him, was therefore a threat and that I was being an asshole for not just coming by myself to get my things. AITA??",

Am I being an asshole or am I justified?\n\nBackground: I've always been closer to my friends than my family. My brother died young, and that tragedy really split up my family. Only living family I have (my mom) is basically estranged from me. My friends are my family and I'm okay with that. Maybe that's why this bothers me so much.\n\nFriend (32m) and I grew up together. We met in elementary school, became best friends and have stayed in touch ever since. I was in his wedding two years ago. That wedding was in Australia and it was a pretty big commitment to go. I took a week off of work, blew a ton of money on flights and then spent 40 miserable hours on an economy flight to the other side of the damn planet. But I didn't complain because like I said, friends are my family. \n\nFriend isn't coming to my wedding in six months. His reason? He doesn't want to upset his boss. Friend would be missing either a Friday or a Monday to attend my wedding because he lives in another state. Friend's boss says it's a really busy time for the business. Friend didn't ask twice. Friend didn't try to arrange coverage or hand off work to someone else. Friend did not try to book a red eye flight or arrange different travel plans. Friend just texted me to say he can't make it.  \nMy soon-to-be wife says I'm not being an asshole because this is one of the biggest days of our lives. A different friend says I'm being dramatic because \"it's just a big expensive party.\" I feel betrayed and sick to my stomach about the whole thing. To me, this is incredibly important. If Friend can't be bothered to make it out on one of the most important days for me then he's not my friend anymore. ",

We've recently been recommended to use Tinder by a friend and we're talking about setting up our profiles. \n\nI thought of something that to me sounded like it would be funny: We can use each other's pictures for our profiles. Since we're identical, same physical shape included (she has slightly shorter hair and some tattoos, but the tattoos aren't visible), I thought it would be harmless. If someone messaged us seriously, we'd send them our own pictures and be able to let them in on the joke. I also thought it would be a good way to see who enjoys it and has the same sense of humor as us, too.\n\nAnother friend didn't think it was that funny, though. He says it's catfishing and we shouldn't be doing that kind of stuff, because even if we're identical twins, we aren't the same person. He says we'll still be lying to people. Any amount of pretending to be someone else is wrong, no matter how 'harmless' we might think it is.\n\nI'll admit, we brushed him off at first, but I've been sitting here thinking about it now for a little and I see his point. I've seen all the stuff about catfishing going around and guys get stung by it a lot. \n\nI don't want to be that kind of person...but I also don't think this will make me that kind of person. Obviously if conversations go beyond bland hookup requests, we'll come clean.\n\nWIBTA for going through with it?",

      "description": "*I'm sorry if there are any mistakes english is not my first language.\n\nI always had a lot of self-esteem issues, so about two months ago I started dieting. Unfortunately the diet ended up bringing back an eating disorder I had a long time ago and I had to stop for the sake of my own health. \n\nMy mom was not very happy with this, and kept insisting that I should keep doing it, I kept telling her that I was uncomfortable with all the nagging so she gave up trying to convince me after some time. This was until a week before her best friend birthday party, she was invited about a week beforehand and asked me if I wanted to go with her. I'm not a big fan of socializing but I decided to go with her to the party because she told me she would be happy if I tagged. Everything started after I agreed to attend the party. She asked me if I could start the diet again, just so I would look pretty in a dress. I told her that I'd rather not and explained that it made me really uncomfortable and that if I ended up not losing any weight, it would be very bad for my self-esteem. She told me it was ok and that she understood that I didn't want to do it.\n\nAbout 3 days before the birthday party, my mom arrived home with a bag full of dresses for me to try on. When I opened the bag I noticed that almost all the dresses were about 3 sizes smaller than mine and told her that she must've gotten them wrong. She then, proceeded to tell me that I shouldn't worry about that and that If anything didn't fit I'd still have time to get thinner. I told her that I had already decided what I wanted to wear to the party and that she didn't need to buy anything new.\n\nShe became very angry and told me that she didn't wanted her daughter to go around looking like a hobo (the dress that I chose was almost new, and also one of my favourites). I decided to try the dresses on just to make her happy, it couldn't be that bad right? Wrong. I was forced to try on every single dress in the bag, and had to stand in front of a huge mirror staring at myself while I heard my mom making comments about my weight. Things like \"You would look so much prettier if you lost weight\" and \"I don't understand why you have to each like a pig all the time, such a pretty girl\". She went on about it for some time but I ended up exploding. It is a very sensitive topic for me and I had asked her to stop a lot of times. When I wasn't able to take it and told her that I wasn't feeling so good about the party and didn't want to go anymore, she started to freak out. She told me that I was ruining her weekend and that I should be ashamed of myself for not taking her feelings in consideration. She also said that all she wanted was a pretty daughter and that I was ruining everything for her.  I ended up deciding to not go to the party after that, but I still fell bad for ruining it for my mom. ",

      "description": "Okay so this happened a few months back but I have been wondering about it a lot recently. \n\nI was living with two other girls when I had an unexpected job offer I couldn't refuse in another state, requiring me to move even though I still had a good two months on my current lease. My relocation money covered the remaining rent amounts which I paid on time every month. I for all other intents and purposes had moved out though. I gave my keys to my family because they offered to make sure my room and the apartment in general were not trashed and then return the keys once the lease was up. \n\nFast forward to the end of the lease and I asked my family if they had returned the keys yet. They said no because they were still planning on stopping by to check on the place. Cool. I thanked them for being such a big help since I travel a ton for work and wouldn't be able to make it in time.\n\nA few days later I get woken up by a text from my ex roommate chewing me out for not warning them that my family was going to show up. And how they were really frightened by the whole situation. It was 2 people, my brother (who they had met on several occasions) and my grandma. I immediately reached out to my brother to get his side of the situation. He told me that no one was there when they first got there but when someone did show up, he immediately explained why they were there (clean, get pictures in case the apartment complex tried to hold my security deposit, and make sure nothing was left behind). And that they seemed fine.\n\nSome background: both of them frequently had people over without any warning while I was living there. At one point one of the boyfriends was basically living with us. I said nothing at the time.\n\nI can see how a heads up would have been nice but I don't think it was necessary or that I \"owed\" it to them. I think she was being a little over the top with her message about being terrified someone was in the apartment. It was not at all in a rough neighborhood and it is near impossible to break into that building. \n\nI told her I was sorry she felt that way but that there was nothing I could do to fix it at that point and that it wasn't done with malicious intent. I honestly didn't even think about them until that text, I just wanted to secure my deposit. So AITA for not giving a heads up?",

At first, I thought she was just talking shit and told her “yeah right, if you smack me I will smack you back just as hard as you hit me”. She stepped up to me and said “you won’t hit a girl”. I realized she was actually serious and looked her dead in the eye and said, “ if you hit me, I will hit you back”. Boom, she smacked the shit out of me and knocked the glasses off my face. So, boom I slapped the shit out of her right back. She started crying and ran in and told her friend and they made it a big deal and yelled at me and left. \n\nI felt really bad. I know I’m stronger and should’ve held back, but she slapped the shit out of me. So I gave it right back to her. AITA?",

This dude was once organising an event with a friend of mine, and during the planning of the event, he made jokes of sexual nature (for example, he texted her: \"we should do this in the bedroom. \\*ballroom\"), among other things. After a string of these remarks, my friend started ignoring him. He then told her that she needed him to organise this event, and that he would cancel this event if she didn't respond. Later, he reached out to my friend, apologised to her, and released a joint statement with her, announcing the cancellation of the event.\n\nWhen I saw Eugene at the gathering, I refused to shake his hand, and didn't walk to talk to him. He was confused, and repeatedly asked me to tell him why I was being cold and refused to greet him. Initially, I told him I didn't want to get into it, because there were other people at the event and I didn't want to ruin it for them. However, later on, I blurted out \"you're disgusting. That shit you pulled with Lily was disgusting, and I hope everyone here agrees with me.\"\n\nOne of my friends (who will remain unnamed) told me that it wasn't any of my business to call Eugene out on on that, because I had nothing to do with the incident, the issue was already resolved between Eugene and Lily, Eugene already apologised, and it wasn't \"fair\" for me to call out Eugene in front of everyone, especially after he already \"showed remorse\" and \"owned up to what he did.\"\n\nWas I being the asshole?

      "description": "An ex and I started talking after over seven years.\n\nHe asked me to play a game with him, so I bought it.  He got a server for us - it’s an open world thing and I offered to split the cost.\n\nIt was a lot of fun. I have a ton of stress right now between sick parents and lovely, but needy, little kids.  This game and friend were like oxygen. I played mostly when the kids were asleep.\n\nAfter a few weeks he invited two friends.  I was happy and asked if they were okay with me.  He doubted that they remembered me. They did. \n\nThey wouldn’t play with me. One was his ex and wouldn’t do group calls if I was on. The other would if the other girl wasn’t there. \n\nTurns out I said some mean things to her during the break up. I don’t remember. It was a rough time- I don’t blame her for holding a grudge. \n\nMy friend said it wouldn’t help to apologize, everyone has people they won’t forgive, and that it is normal.\n\nI blame my friend for not telling her I was playing before she joined and for not managing the situation when it was clear I was now the odd pariah out in a group of four. (He knew how she felt about me.)\n\nMore and more, I’d log on to the three of them playing and couldn’t join. My friend was building stuff in their area. The map wasn’t huge and I felt like I couldn’t go there.\n\nI told him I was done with the game. I felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. I didn’t have enough free time to spend it feeling sad.\n\nHe said that there were times when they wanted to play but he was playing with me. \n\nI’m too old for this Springer nonsense. \n\nHe said he would let the subscription die out because he’d gotten it to play with me.  Then he offered to copy the server so they could exit ours and have their own. I paid half like I’d offered before- I tried to pay all of it. \n\nAfter working on it, he mistakenly moved my stuff to the new server.  \n\nHe’s been on the original a fair bit since then. \n\nI putz alone on the new one.  I could ask him to play but that’s awkward when he’s already in another server.\n\nI don’t get jealous if he plays other games with other friends.\n\nHowever, I felt left out, childish, embarrassed, and a bit ashamed that she hates me after so much time has passed.\n\nI hate that he let them join what was such a needed escape for me.  They play so many other games. Why did they have to do this one when I already put a ton of hours into it?\n\nAm I the asshole? Overreacting?\n\nHe’s a good friend, otherwise. He’s flawed, like I am, but kind. He is interested in my interests and life, and I am his.\n\nWe live on other ends of the Earth, so we don’t have much overlapping time to play. \n\nAm I an asshole for letting this friendship go because of a computer game? \n\n",

I've known her for about 13 years, and over the years we've occasionally fallen out of touch. These days, we talk fairly frequently. About all the issues she's facing now, about just about anything. And here's the problem:\n\nEvery single conversation we have seems to turn into her talking about her son. I don't know the kid, I've never met the kid, hell, I'm not 100% sure I've ever seen a picture of him. It sorta came to a head today. She was talking to me about how expensive her new apartment is, and I suggested she take on someone to share expenses. She says she doesn't want a stranger around her son (she doesn't have many, if any, other friends). Ugh. So I drop that and ask her about her progress on a TV show we both watch. She says she canceled Netflix because she had to cut her expenses, to save for a bigger place... you guessed it... so her son would have somewhere to sleep when he's with her. I stopped talking altogether and started making my dinner. She texts me about an hour later, and surprise, guess what the subject was?\n\nI told her to stop. As politely as I possibly could, over text, I told her I was tired of all our conversations being about her son, that if she wants to talk to me, she needs to find something else to say. I got no response to that.\n\nAm I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "\nThis is my first time posting I hope it makes sense. \n\nSo me and my husband have been married for a year now. We decided to skip the whole wedding and just elope as my father passed away that year. I don’t have any extended family but he comes from a very big and close knit family. (All of whom live in a different country except his Aunty and uncle) \nI only met them once before we got married and immediately I realised she didn’t want him to get married. \n\nAfter we got married he was supposed to move in with me but he kept making excuses that he didn’t just want to leave his auntys house that quickly because it would be rude. I agreed just to make things easy. \nFast forward a few months he finally moved in. I thought this would be the beginning for us to spend more time together. We picked one day out of the week to be together usually a Wednesday which is his day off. Usually when the day comes his Aunty and uncle call atleast 15 times telling him to come over and every single time he blows off any plans he has with me to go to them. \n\nI tried to be understanding that they are the only close family he has here but I never get to spend any quality time with him. \nHe always makes excuses when he hasn’t seen them for a few days. \n\nEven when he talks to them on the phone he gives them undivided attention. There has been occasions that she or her husband call him while we are in bed and he’ll get up to talk to them sometimes even leaving the room\nbut when his talking to me about something important  his always on his phone or watching something and barely listens. This always results in a fight. \n\n\nI grew up with family dinners so I tried to keep that tradition so I make sure that we have dinner together every night. His Aunty has since started sending him food in the day so that when he comes home he has food to eat. He stopped eating what I made because she makes him traditional back home meals. \n\nOur marriage broke down fast he stopped caring for me. When I found out I couldn’t have kids after years of trying he left me crying in bed and was busy dealing with his auntys drama. \n\nI asked to separate a few weeks ago and he moved out. We have started talking again but he refuses to acknowledge how priorities his aunt over his life with me. \n\nI have never had any aunts or uncles he keeps telling me it’s normal to be that close to your family. I don’t know if I’m making a big deal about nothing \n\nAITA for being jealous of his close relationship with his aunt? \n",

      "description": "(throwaway account)  OK so some backstory, I have a 10 year old German Shepard named Gibby who is a retired police dog. He's incredibly shy and timid from what I understand to be dog-ptsd from the force.  Anyway, even though he's still shy and whatnot his police dog training hasn't left him and he still reacts aggressively to aggressive behavior, which is fine because he makes a good guard dog and never attacks or barks at anyone who isn't being an asshole essentially.\n\nSo cut to two weeks ago, my mom and her new husband (B)  came over and were having a few drinks,  when B started getting rowdy my mom tried to calm him down to no avail, the whole ordeal became a screaming match.  Gibby didn't like that and started barking at B, like he usually does in these situations, and B decided to hit Gibby with his empty beer bottle to \"shut him up\".\n\nThis resulted in B getting his hand bit, there was no serious damage that a few stitches and a few weeks wouldn't heal, but Gibby needed to get a couple of X rays and scans to make sure there is no brain damage from what was very much a serious head bludgeoning. (he's OK BTW) \n\nNow the problem is, I never went to the ER for B but I rushed Gibby to the vet,  which my mom and B saw as me caring about Gibby more, and now they refuse to talk to me and are now vauge posting about my \"dangerous dog\"  and how it \"viciously mauled B\", and are even trying to get him put down. (which isn't working at all) \n\nI can definitely see how I could be an asshole for caring about an animal more than a family member, but AITA here? \n\n",

I work, I go to college and have tons of responsibilities, so I don’t think I have the time to take care of a 3rd dog. \n\nMy mom and I spoke to my step-dad and told him we weren’t going to take care of my step-sisters dog and that he would have to take that responsibility.

      "description": "I'm feeling very conflicted about this so I thought I'd ask you guys for an opinion...\n\nSome background my brother is 14 years my junior. He's 18, I'm 32. Due to our age difference he will come to me for advice and help. We're very close, but there are definitely times when I have acted as a stand in parent. As an example, I had \"the sex talk\" with him because he didn't want to have it with our parents. He started at a big state university last semester.\n\nLast semester he told me he got a Minor in Possession of alcohol (MIP). Rather than do the court mandated class he skipped it. So the court put out a bench warrant.\n\nCome to early this semester he calls me from jail saying that he got another MIP while drinking with a girl in her dorm. Because he didn't do the class from his previous MIP he got arrested and put in jail because of his warrant.\n\nHe got arrested on a Friday and was being held with a $535 bail and called me. I told him that he should call our parents and have them sort this out.\n\nHe begged me not to tell them and said that if we posted bail he'd come work off the debt on his Spring break. I told him that I'd have to talk to my wife about the situation, but that he was spending at least one night in jail for being dumbass and not dealing with the court mandated stuff. He agreed that this was fair. The time he spend in county was eye opening for him.\n\nMy wife and I talked about it. We were both mad at him, but come Saturday morning, we bailed him out and agreed to not tell my parents. Our reasoning being that he's 18 and if he wants to tell them it's his choice.\n\nHere's where my conflict comes in. Our dad is a Fed. It is very likely that he will find out. Even if it doesn't come out that way, he is asking me to keep a big secret from our parents that has the potential to create a rift in my relationship with them. I know that he's 18 and that he's an adult. If my parents find out they will be mad at us for not telling them.\n\nAll this being said, our parents are not the most reasonable people. If they found out they would likely pull him from university and make him go to a community college in the deep south. He and I both hate it there. I haven't told my parents in confidence, because I know that they would lose their minds.\n\nMy mother has become suspicious for the reason of visit. He had plans with friends, but cancelled them to come help my wife and I work on our home. She's been doing some probing, \"Why did your brother cancel plans with his friends to come work on your house? What did he do? Does he owe you money?\" I don't lie, but I had to lie and omit the truth in this case. I told her, \"He wanted to come and visit. We offered to pay him to help us out.\" I *HATE* lying. I felt like shit after lying for my brother and I've had to do it several times now.\n\nReddit, AITA?\n",

      "description": "For background’s sake, I’ve been dating my boyfriend for around 4 months now and ever since then he’s been calling me Fatty as a nickname (I’m 5’6” and 150 pounds). I hate this nickname so I asked him to call me by another nickname or to call me by my first name. \n\nHe opted to call me “Hihi”, which coincidentally is the slang for “asshole” for young people from my city (shoutout to Hong Kong peeps). He’s 14 years older than me (he’s 38 and I’m 24) so I can’t say for sure that he knows this term. I told him that it’s a rude word and don’t call me that. He persisted. AITA for getting mad even though he might not know what it means? ",

      "description": "So, my gf and I are together for 1,5 years now.\n\nShe just tends to throw something like \"dumbie\" at me from time to time, she just tends to find it funny, but I just ignore it usually and write it of as just some stupid playful banter.\n\nHowever, today we had a talk about something which is actually not too important at all. I then sent her a statistic which proved my point and she called me naive for believing in this. You should know that I am working in a job in the MINT field, and I am usually trying to argue only with things that are scientifically proven, so I was really pissed by that. What got me way more was the fact that she called me naive. \n\nI usually walk through life in a very suspicious way and barely believe what people tell me right away, while she, still living at home, is basically the opposite, and barely ever had to deal with any situations which you might be called naive for falling for something.\n\nSo basically, I was super pissed at her at that point. I sent her a voicemail stating that this is just bullshit, and that she really hurt me with saying this to me. I then proceeded to ask her why she was doing this in the first place. She knows that things like these piss me off, and the only winner here would be her ego for some time, while the tradeoff is me being angry at her, so I don't even get the reasoning why you would say this to your partner in a relationship.\n\nShe got angry as well, stating that she does not understand the commotion, and when I asked her to just say sorry and we get over with this she mentioned that she doesn't see the problem with me getting hurt, I just shouldn't handle this in such a way and deal with it.\n\nSo, AITA for being angry at my gf and getting in a fight for something rather mundane and her calling me naive?",

      "description": "A bit of background information. She’s 17, I’m 16m. I suffer with quite severe depression and anxiety, amongst other things. We are in a long distance relationship. We live a 5 hour drive apart, yet none of can drive. I often go up to visit every 2-3 weeks on the bus, because I have family there too, so it makes sense for me to go to her.\n\nIn between my visits, we normally text and call a lot. Over the past few times, I’ve started replying to her less. This is because my depression got extremely bad, I’d lay in bed all day, watching YouTube or laying in the dark and maybe scrolling through reddit. In these times, I rarely talk to people. I feel like shit, and anybody who suffers with depression that you don’t have the energy to hold a conversation that often. You just want to be left alone. She knows this, she knows I’m depressed and I’m on meds for this, so it hurt me more when this happened.\n\nI still went up to visit her, even though my depression was bad. Because I love her.\n\nBut on my recent visit up there, she kept on dropping hints about how I don’t answer her texts, and I’m just ignoring her all the time.\nThis gets worsened when I answer other people’s texts around her. Once I’m out of my bedroom, it’s different. I can answer texts because I’m already out, so a couple texts arnt too bad. It worsened after this. I’ve explained it to her why I do this, but she still goes on, giving me the almost silent treatment. I feel really guilty about it. I almost don’t wanna talk to her anymore because she doesn’t understand me \n",

One of my friends asks if he can have a sour patch to which I reply no since we are are waiting to get to the top and then we can all sit down and enjoy everything together. This stops him dead in his tracks. It’s split 3v3 half saying give him a candy so he stops bitching the other half telling him to stop being a bitch. This goes on to the point where we just give up and eat the candy maybe half way up the trail and at that point we are to lazy to finish the hike so we just walk back.  We wake up the next morning laughing about how stupid we all were only to realize that both sides are laughing about how stupid the other side is and nothing changed after sobering up. This was three months ago and we still can’t come to a solution, are my friends just idiots or am I in the wrong? (Extra info I did buy a majority of the snacks including sour patch if that means anything) \n\nTLDR : friend wants me to open sour patch bag half way through hike, but we are trying to finish the hike  to get to a look out first",

      "description": " \n\nThis is the first time I’ve posted here so I’m sorry if I’m not doing it right.\n\nBasically there was a room free in our house at the beginning of the rental year (last August), one of my housemates friends moved into the room (this was fine by all of us). So there’s this new housemate and she’s fine, a little annoying but fine. All of a sudden her MS starts getting bad and all of us have to start caring for her a tiny bit (nothing ridiculous, just getting her water or cooking chicken nuggets etc), even though we don’t know her that well and are busy with university stuff. One day she’s taken away in an ambulance and has to stay at hospital, this is where she starts really bothering us all. While she’s in hospital she’s let her dad move into her bedroom (he came over from another country to be with her), she didn’t really ask if it was ok but just said it was happening and “is that ok”, and we can’t just say no cause we’d all seem like assholes and also she’s already arranged it. So a few weeks later she comes back from the hospital and I’m sort of trying to not be around her cause I know she’ll waste my time (I study and work!) telling me all about it and I’ll have to stand there and agree. After a few days I’m face to face with her and needless to say she bothers me with all her talking (even trying to make me feel sorry for her by saying “you’re lucky you don’t have MS”) when I’ve clearly got my hands full and trying to get into my room. Additionally now she’s got a load of medical chairs and frames all over the house and since she’s still unwell she’s always in the living room (where the fridge is) making it uncomfortable for me to go in there when I want to make food). So anyway she’s just gone BACK to the hospital (which I hate to say it but was a convenience to me- I realise that I’m definitely the asshole at that moment) but then she messages us all saying that her dads gonna be staying here again. I only say him briefly last time she was in hospital but knowing there’s a stranger here is really uncomfortable and I find myself limited in my own house as I’m trying to avoid him.\n\nSorry for the long post but I feel as though I had to explain everything fully.\n\n📷**ReplyForward** ",

I hae to split my free time with a ton of extracurricular activities, including chess, robotics, and , as will be important later, spelling bee. Every Wenesday, Monday, and Friday after school i practice spelling words with my grandma for at least 40 minutes on Mondays and Wednesdays, and an hour on Fridays. My parents recently got mad at me for \"not studying enough for the spelling bee\" (I had been keeping up with the aforementioned studying schedule for almost the whole school year) and have thus deleted all my games, which i paid for, and are putting me on an even more extreme practice schedule. Once i fit in all the other things i have to practice and study, I am going to have almost no free time after this change, not like i would be able to do anything after over $200 of games have been deleted.

      "description": "so my mom had me when she was 17 almost 18. my dad was about 20 at the time. they split when i was about 4 and i lived with both of them about 50 50. my dad has never been the most responsible guy (kicked out of schools, bad grades, pothead/drugdealer, kinda sexist, etc.).  i have early childhood memories of him handing me bags of weed and telling me to smell them and he would get mad if i didnt like it and he would make me help him rip up my moms clothes when he got mad at her. he would spank me if i ever stepped out of line. he was a very masculine guy and wanted me to be super masculine too but being the gay i am i always hated doing anything that a stereotypical masculine young boy  would enjoy. anyways he had a girlfriend when i was 7 who was living with us and he took me home after school one day and they started fighting and things got physical. he was then arrested and deported to mexico but i never really understood how wrong he was until later on. anyways he got out of prison when i was about 10 and i flew to mexico to stay with him for 10 weeks. he told me that what he did was ok because she was cheating and stealing from him. over the few years after that, i started to realize what a shitty guy he was. he now has 3 different kids (that i know of) with 3 different women that he has no relation to anymore. i maintained a close relationship with my grandma (on my dads side) and she would always call him and make me talk to him. he would always ask why i never called him and tell me that i dont care about him (like uhhh hi im like 12 and youre my dad who fucked up so who should be calling who here? lol). anyways as time went on i started talking to him less and less until i was about 14 when my grandma made me fly out to see him again with her. i wasnt the happiest there but im too nice of a person to be rude to my dad but he could tell i wasnt the same oblivious child that i used to be. he cried to my grandma because he knew that i needed a dad and he couldnt give that to me and he knew how i felt. he always said he would come back to america one day and be back in my life but i always knew that would never happen, the last i talked to him was saying goodbye to him at the airport in mexico when i was 14. my grandma always called him whenever i was at her house and she would ask me to talk to him and i always told her i didnt want to. im now 18 and i recently heard news  a few months ago that he got himself into prison again. he has never been there for me and always been toxic but i cant shake the fact that he's my dad and i cant help but to feel guilty cutting him out completely. i want to give him more chances but i know he wont change anytime soon and the part of my life where i desperately needed him is over but part of me still hates myself for cutting out the only dad i have.",

      "title": "AITA for giving the father of my unborn baby an ultimatum?",
      "description": "Baby's father will not give me an honest answer about the role he wants to play in baby's life. I found out I was pregnant after returning home to my country in August. I found out fairly early, around 4 or 5 weeks, and told him immediately so we could discuss our options. He said he wished to support me either way and did not want to push me into a decision, but was hoping that I would have an abortion. I struggled for a long time with my decision but ultimately decided to keep the baby. I told him he did not have to be involved if that was what he wanted and that I wouldn't ask him for anything, but he needed to let me know. I'm now about to enter my sixth month of pregnancy and still can't get an answer out of him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that it's a tough decision being that we're on two different continents and are no longer seeing each other. I'm not delusional and I realize we aren't going to be a traditional family and I made my decision knowing full well that I would be taking the brunt of the responsibility, but I do believe that there are ways to make it work if he wants to have a relationship with his son and I do want to give him an opportunity to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe did meet in person to chat about a month ago and he admitted that he was resentful of the situation and felt that it was something he was being forced into, but that he felt it was strange to have some little creature running around in the world and not know them. He said he won't come for the birth, but will visit sometime next year. He left, and I flew home and took some time to digest what he had said before reaching out to him again. I told him that we could consider him not having anything to do with it and he didn't seem to like that. He said he would prefer not to register anything or sign the birth certificate unless it seems really important or stupid not to, but that he doesn't know what those reasons would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said that generally wanting to be a decent person and acknowledge your child would be reason enough. I told him that I was really just tired of discussing it and dragging it out for so long and that he basically had two options: one, establish paternity with the intention of knowing his son and get the gears in motion instead of just half-heartedly saying he'll visit eventually; two, don't establish paternity, which he has every right to do, but he should know the implications of that decision—I 100% won't allow him access to the baby should he ever have any desire to meet him. He can establish his rights through the courts. I told him that isn't a threat, but I can't allow him to keep the child on standby for X amount of time just in case he one day decides he fits neatly into his life. Either he's in or he's out, but there's no in between. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe responded saying that I leave him speechless when I go completely mental like that. He said we have different views of what being a decent person means: to him, it's about taking responsibility and only putting life on earth when you are qualified to do so and can offer a good childhood. He said if I want to keep going on with my insane with-us-or-against-us strategy, he also doesn't want anything to do with me. He says that he just hopes I will wake up one day and realize that life is not just black and white, and that I'm basically just telling him to piss off and \"that's what it is.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him that I am only broaching the subject because he said that he felt it was something being forced on him. I haven't changed my mind about anything, but wanted him to know that I'm not forcing him into anything and he can choose not to have anything to do with the baby, but he needs to know what that decision means. He told me it's an ultimatum regardless of what I want to call it, and that I'm telling him he needs to be a full-on father or never ever. He says that isn't giving him a choice since I already know that full-on father isn't an option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI responded that I'm not asking him to be a full-on father, but that I didn't understand why he wouldn't sign the birth certificate if he did want some sort of involvement. I told him that if it's a question of paternity or him trying to protect himself financially then I understand, but obviously I don't expect him to sign a birth certificate for a child he isn't 100% certain about, and I honestly have about a million other things to worry about and not one of those things is fighting for an international child support order. I'm not interested in his money, I simply want my child to know his father if it's at all a possibility. I said that I don't want to be an asshole or make the situation any worse than it is, but children deserve black and white. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe says he doesn't fear the financial part, but does generally feel like protecting himself from something he doesn't know the consequences of. If there's some good reason for him to sign it that he's unaware of then he would be up for it, but in that case he would need to talk to a lawyer and have it confirmed that it's his child. I told him that's a good idea, and reiterated that it's nothing to do with giving him an ultimatum or punishing him, but that I know how it feels to be the child in this situation and I want more for my own child. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe responded that he thinks he deserves that too and if I find someone who maybe even wants to legally adopt him, that would probably be a lot easier if he didn't sign. I agreed that it would be easier, but that what is easier or more convenient for me doesn't really matter anymore, and that could always be dealt with when and if the time came. I told him that he should speak to a lawyer in his country and that I will talk to someone here as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was weeks ago, and I reached out today to ask if he'd had a chance to speak with a lawyer yet. He left this message on read, and a few hours later I sent what I guess is probably my final message to him at this point: \"Look, I don't like having to communicate with you either and I've told you since the beginning that I'll gladly cut all ties with you if you don't want anything to do with this but you need to stop with the whole hedging your bets/shoddy communication thing and just give me a straight answer about where you're at. I really don't want to be put in the position of having to be the bad guy and make this decision because it's a big one that will ultimately affect the baby's life the most but this can't continue on indefinitely. You've had twice the amount of time that I had to figure it out and I've tried to be patient but it just isn't fair now. I'm not going to reach out again after this so if I don't hear back from you then I guess that's that.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't heard back yet, but right now I'm just attributing that to the time zone difference. I'm sure he probably will respond and try to gaslight me and say I'm crazy and make me out to be the asshole. It's painfully obvious he wants nothing to do with the baby and at this point I think our son is better off without him, but in some way I feel as though if I call the shots and make this decision for him that I'm the reason they don't have a relationship, and that should be a weight that he carries for the rest of his life, not me. I think I will feel guilty if I cut all ties to him without him explicitly admitting that's what he wants, even though I don't believe there is a reason for me to feel guilty at this point. I don't want to harass him or attack him if he wants nothing to do with it. I believe he has every right to decide he doesn't want to be a father. But if he isn't willing to take on that responsibility, he should at least be willing to be honest about it and admit it. Our son deserves someone who is capable of loving him and I want to be able to provide him with that and have the assurance that he won't come crawling out of his hole someday when he inevitably feels regretful and ruin that for us. If he isn't capable of being a father, I think he just needs to accept that he may one day regret it and give us the opportunity to move on. I don't believe I'm an asshole for that, but I guess I'm second guessing myself, so... AITA? ",

      "description": "So basically a couple years or so ago, my mum made this new friend called Johanna (fake name for privacy reasons). Now Johanna's a decent person, in my opinion, nothing more to say on the matter. She even has a son, which is okay I guess.  \n\n\nNow let me say, and this is important, I have autism and so does he. His mum says he has it worse than me, which in my opinion, is utter bullshit. He doesn't seem worse than me at that age.  \n\n\nSo with that being said, I understand he may throw tantrums and be bratty. Hell, I was at that age, and let me remind you that I don't think he has worse autism than me. He constantly cries when things don't go his way, does it when you won't let him see what you're doing and when you won't let him play on your system. Why am I complaining exactly?  \n\n\nWell, at that age I was the same really. Except I threw worse tantrums. But the thing is: I never did it at anyone else's house. I did it at home sure, I may have even done it in public or in a store. But I NEVER did it in another persons home. If I was at my grandparents, I'd be nice and abide by their rules. I wouldn't think anything in that house was mine if they didn't say it was.  \n\n\nHell, even when my Dad tagged me along for his side job (which is irrelevant so I won't explain what it is) which requires him to go into strangers homes, I always kept to myself and never stirred up anything.  \n\n\nSo if at that age I was polite with people who I didn't even KNOW and respected my blood families house rules, why does this little brat think he can come in and act like everything's his.  \n\n\nIf I'm on my DS, he'll start asking if he can play or look over to see what I'm doing (which I don't want him doing) and if I tell him no or move the DS away so he can't see, I'll get yelled at and to be nice. If I'm playing on my N64 and he asks if he can play, and I tell him that no, it's a singleplayer game, he'll start crying and to let him play or I get yelled at to put in a multiplayer game when I don't want to (which side rant, it's MY system Mum, I decide what I want to play not you)  \n\n\nI don't know why I just hate him. My brother said it could be because I'm jealous because he's the center of attention when he comes over and they take his side in everything, which could be a possibility.  \n\n\nSo basically, AITA for hating this kid?",

I help around and do other jobs on top of cleaning the kitchen.\n\nSometimes I'm not at home (away for a couple of days or more) and when I come back, the kitchen has not been touched after it's been used. I can't even describe the state I've seen it in, it can be that bad. I spoke to my family about it and asked them to please clean it if I'm not at home or even just to get my siblings (ages 7 and 10) to do it. \n\nMy dad works full time on weekdays and sometimes has to make calls after work and my mum works casually (sometimes working 2 shifts on 1 day) and cooks so I can understand that sometimes they're just too busy or want to rest. However as I stated earlier, I have 2 other siblings who could do it *plus* a dishwasher which most of the time doesn't get filled when I'm away.\n\nEvery time I come back to a messy kitchen I feel like it's always expected of me to tidy it up despite the times I've expressed someone else to do it while I'm away.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm being ungrateful in this situation or if I'm justified. I'll leave it up for you guys to decide.\n\nTL,DR: main job is to clean kitchen but when I'm away no one does it and I'm the one that has to clean it when I come back.

      "description": "So a little information, my sister (who is an adult) only likes food when it’s plain. She’s a very picky eater, and will only eat chicken nuggets and plain cheese pizza at restaurants. I’ve always thought it’s kind of childish that she doesn’t eat anything adventurous but I guess she likes what she likes. So last night I was at dinner at a nice restaurant for my aunts birthday, and the menu had a lot of exotic items on it and nothing plain enough to satisfy my sisters palate. She started complaining loudly to the rest of my family about the lack of other options, and even went as far as to single some people out and ask if they could ask the server for more plain options. She is fully grown, and should be capable of doing this herself,  But that’s besides the point. Onto the AITA. She keeps complaining and saying we should leave and go to a different restaurant, and I snapped and said “Maybe try something not drenched in cheese or deep fried, who knows you might like it.” She started yelling at me, and the rest of dinner was awkward for the rest of the family. My father told me I was out of line but I think everyone was thinking the same as me. So AITA?",

      "description": "Basically I want out of this WhatsApp group with 5 other women. These women were my best and really, only friends for about 25+ years but after a series of non-incidents over the last few years I finally decided to give up trying to be friends with each of them and therefore as a group. \n\nI regret nothing. \n\nIt was time and I was generally more often angry, hurt and annoyed by their individual incidents of making plans to break plans, mansplaining, judginess, prioritising everyone else over our plans, non-arrangements, pointless secretiveness and other banal shite. The friendships weren't toxic but they weren't fulfilling. There was no confrontation. I proposed and organised bookclubs, things to do with our kids, brunches, a collective 40th trip over the last few years all to be met with degrees of immediate enthusiasm and replaced with meh. (They are in varying degrees the same with each other.)\n\nAbout 6 months ago, after one of them bailed on her own birthday drinks, where one said she was going out with other friends the next day anyway (at the last minute), one said her kid might be getting a cold so she didn't want to leave her and one never responded at all to the invite but was generally acknowledged as the just turning type, I decided that I'd had enough and stopped proposing any more individual stuff and became a lurker in the WhatsApp group.\n\nI don't want to be a lurker. I want out but I don't want drama. This hasn't been a test if their friendship or attentiveness. I'm not looking to make a statement or get their attention.  I've been working on making other friends, up for work socialising, hanging out with my family, reconnecting with college friends so I'm good. I feel creepy seeing their exchanges and constantly archiving or muting the chats without reading them but it keeps popping up. I don't check them to see if they're directed at me or chime in on stuff but they may well think I'm just cooling off and we'll all be friends again after I blow off some steam. I haven't reached out to any of them. There's one whose kid is friends with my kid and we see each other at the school gate and bring the kids for coffee occasionally we don't talk about the group and I wouldn't make a plan with her unless she's standing in front of me. \n\nI just want to not be in the group but AITA if I don't offer an explanation to these people?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have a 6 mo old baby. When I was pregnant I told him we needed to move as we currently were in a 1-bedroom apartment and the baby needed her own  room. When we were viewing a 2-bedroom apartment, he mentioned that perhaps sometimes his son (who is 18 and at the time unemployed) could come stay with us sometimes. I told him we could think about it AFTER we moved and the baby came, once I saw how I adjusted to the baby. I never planned on having children and, honestly, when we got together I thought I would never have to deal with his son coming to stay since he is overage and lived with his mother. I figured he would stay a couple nights with us sometimes, this is what I was told.\n\nSo, I have had the baby and my bfs has not got a new job or a better apartment for us. We make it work because we have to. But now he wants his son to come stay with us at times because he is having disagreements with his stepfather and the mother won't step in. This was one thing when he stayed a night or two. Lately he comes to stay indefinitely, this last time with literally 10 mins notice. My boyfriend will not tell me when he's leaving, he just says \"He'll want to go home soon anyways\" because (since we don't have a spare bedroom) he has to sleep on our living room futon and we have to keep our 3 cats in the living room now since the baby is in the bedroom. \n\nHere is where my big problem comes in. We have one working car ATM and I can't drive it bc it's a manual. I am stuck in the house with the baby all day. I love my baby, but I never planned on having kids and it takes a lot out of me. The ONLY thing I have for myself right now is playing video games. It is the only thing keeping me sane some days. Our old TV took a shit right after we bought a new one and now the new TV is out in the living room. It is too big to bring back into our bedroom and since my bf sleeps in all the time he doesn't want it there anyways. \n\nI only get early mornings to myself, the rest of the day is full of the baby. She will only sleep with me bc I breastfeed (we are trying to fix this), if we are out of milk I have to bring out the boob and through the day pump for bottles. So this leaves me quarantined in our bedroom all day. I have to go back there to feed the baby and pump bc my bf is so weird about me having my boobs out in front of anyone. I have to go back to put her down to nap. I'm ALWAYS with her back there since she's always eating and napping. So my solution before was in the early morning when I'm awake from feeding the baby, I would play games in the living room and the baby stayed asleep with him in the bedroom. But since his son came to stay, now he says it's not fair for me to go into the living room to play games and wake his son up at 7-10 AM. I feel like these are totally reasonable times, my bf says \"Not if he went to bed at 3 pm!\" I went to bed at 3 PM too and I'm awake. I feel like I'm not asking for him to wake up at 4 AM, it's a reasonable time and if he wants to stay here he can get up when I do or figure out how to sleep through it. I would never stay on someone's couch and expect them to hide in their bedroom until noon bc I stayed up late. \n\nThis morning I got up and went out to play at 6:30 AM. The baby started waking and I went back to settle her. I got back up and went back out at 7, Stepson had exited my paused game to turn on SpongeBob (which he leaves running all night), turned the fan back on in our already freezing house that I had turned off, and gone back to sleep.\n\nReddit, AITA for thinking his son should work around our schedule and I shouldn't have to be sequestered in my bedroom all day bc my bf thinks his 18-year-old son should be able to sleep until noon?",

      "description": "So this happened over the course of the apst 12 or 13 hours and it just ended (hopefully), obligatory thro[w]away.\n\nSo context, my friend was asking me for some background info regarding my ex, who he has became pretty close with these past few months, to see if he should date her.  I give him the info and he says he was considering to make a move pretty soon.  So, as we actually were pretty close friends before we dated but had grown apart but we had still talked a little semi-recently, I figured we were still mediocre friends.  I then offered to be a middle man for my friend.  To which he said if he needs me he'll let me know.\n\nSo the following day, being earlier this morning, when he said soon I guessed he meant something like today or maybe this weekend.  However, I guessed wrong.  Long story short me and my ex's convo consisted of \"do you like ___?\" Then her thinking i was being controlling over her still (we dated over a year ago and for 2 weeks or so(yikes)), and then me attempting to back-pedal but stating my position as a middleman, which I now believe with my friend that I shouldn't have used those words, and then saying I respected her decision not to tell me.\n\nSeveral hours later, she asks why I care.  Now, I didn't want to really deal with this so I told said friend as I felt obligated to do so, and I asked him what to say.  He told me exactly what he said and I did.  She responded saying she didn't want to seem like a bitch, but told me to stay out of her love life as I have no control over her anymore and we were never really friends and to stay out of her life in a very passive-aggressive tone.\n\nMe and him are chill however as we both think that she doesn't think he likes her and he felt bad for not wanting to burn any bridges but I said it was fine and we laughed it off.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'll preface this by saying that I have moderately low self-esteem, and I have struggled with the idea that I won't be successful for a long time. I didn't come from a well off family like most of my college friends did, and I often feel, whether justly or unjustly, that I have not been afforded the same opportunities that they have throughout our lives.\n\nI was talking with a friend earlier, and I found out that one of her parents is a high level executive at a HUGE company, one of those companies that everybody has heard of. This is, unfortunately, quite common among my friends, because we went to a pretty wealthy school that I was only able to attend because of a hefty scholarship and tens of thousands of dollars of debt to repay.\n\nThis, admittedly, makes me feel rather insignificant, because nobody in my family has ever been in that kind of position, or had that kind of money, but many of my friends have lived this way for all or most of their lives.\n\nMy friend knows how I feel about this. It's not really a secret. I was already feeling a bit down and I said \"Wow, I'd really love to have a position like that. I'm just not sure I'll ever be able to do it... Do you think I'll ever get there?\"\n\nShe replied \"I don't know,\" and that was it. Nothing about \"if you work hard...\" or \"I think you could,\" or even \"if you play your cards right.\" Just \"I don't know.\" I asked what she meant and she just said \"nobody can see the future. I'm not going to lie and say that I think you'll make it\"\n\nOkay? In my mind, this is a clear opportunity to try to encourage me when I'm feeling like a complete nobody, and she turned it around to say \"ehh you might make, it you might not, who cares?\"\n\nWas she being brutally honest and I just need to accept it?\n\nTL;DR I'm in a much worse financial situation than my friend, which makes me sad. I asked if she ever thinks I could be in a position that would give me a good financial situation, and she said she didn't know because nobody can see the future.",

On mobile and so on..\nSo I kind of waver between feeling like an asshole and feeling like I'm justified in my feelings so your opinions would be greatly appreciated! Maybe I just need some more insight.\nRecently my husband has been interested in his family tree. He found an old tree his grandmother had drawn up going back to 1980s. She did this on her own without telling anyone and now that hes found it the family is shocked. She had so much information and it was pretty detailed according to what info she could get. But she died before my husband was married so his exwifes name isnt filled in. Now I figured this is a historic piece meant to record their genealogy, fill her name (ex wife) and my(new wife) name in and our kids accordingly to maintain accuracy. I didnt have any issue nor did I think I should have a say as this was his family tree not mine. \nHowever then he says he wants make a new tree of his own with only going a few generations back and have it framed and placed in our living room as a centre peice. I asked if he would include his exwifes name on there and he said it has to because that's the way his grandmother did it so it needs to be that way. So it would look like husbands name on the very top then exwife under him and would get a 1.name and I would get a 2.name under her. I told him if her name is on it. It's not going up in the living room.\nI dont really know this woman I have no issues with her but damn I feel like I should get to be the one beside him on a plac inside our home? I dont really understand why ours has to include her when it's just for decoration while there is an accurate one being held for their family. ",

      "description": "Right after Thanksgiving, I (15 M) was added to an Instagram group chat by my long-distance best friend, Olivia (16 F), containing her hometown friends. I hit it off with all of them unbelievably quickly, and soon, this group chat began to take up almost all of my free time - I would send memes, make FaceTime calls, and spend hours discussing similar interests with these people. Being added to the group chat came at a good time: I go to a small high school, and I didn't honestly feel like I fit in with all of my friends. This group chat made me feel like I had met people that were exactly like me, so I devoted just about all of my time towards them and made plans with my parents to visit them in their hometown. Over time, more and more people were added - about 25 at the peak. Two of the people I felt the closest with was a boy named James (16 M) and a girl named Allie (16 F).\n\nOne day, in mid-December, Olivia told me a little bit about James' past. I found out that he had feelings for Allie - feelings that had been going on for years and years. They had spent just about every waking moment of the summer together, but they never established their relationship to be anything more than a close friendship. As the summer ended, Allie fell head-over-heels for someone else and began a relationship with them, leaving James feeling heartbroken and confused. Allie broke up with her new boyfriend shortly after for unrelated reasons, but the damage had already been done to their friendship.\n\nFast-forward to last month: Allie and I start talking privately, and we become very close very quickly. After three or so weeks of talking into the early hours of the morning, Allie's best friend Sarah realizes that we both have feelings for one another, and confronts us about it. We decide to start dating - we determine that we like each other so much that it's worth giving a try despite the fact that we live so far away. I ask both Allie and Sarah if I should talk to James about the relationship, but they tell me that it would be best to wait until he's gotten over Allie. Because they know him better than I do, I take their advice and don't talk to him about it.\n\nEventually, James finds out and promptly leaves the group chat. I ask Allie and Sarah again if I should talk to him, but they reaffirm that it would be too upsetting for him to discuss things with me, so I don't. Soon thereafter, Olivia finds out about James and is furious that I hadn't said anything to him. I realized my mistake and profusely apologized but it was too late, and he ignored me. Since then, I've left the group chat, Olivia hasn't talked to me in a month, James has blocked me on Instagram, and a large number of his close friends have done the same. Olivia said that the friend group was crumbling because of me and I honestly don't know if it's my fault or not. AITA?\n\n**TLDR:** I started long-distance dating a girl, a friend that liked her found out, so now everyone is angry at me.",

      "description": "TL;DR My friends didn't want my boyfriend to join us on a vacation although he hangs out with us regularly. Although I knew this hurt my boyfriend's feelings, I went on the vacation with them. Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo celebrate our college graduation last year, four of my friends and I planned to go on a week-long trip to Denmark (right next door for us). We would rent out a vacation home, play silly college kid games and just have a good time before a couple of us moved out of town to pursue grad school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past 2-3 years, we had all been friends who regularly hung out together. Other people from our classes would occasionally join us, but we five were the 'core' group of friends who all studied the same subject. For the last year or so before the trip, my boyfriend (then of nearly 6 years) would also more often than not join in. My friends made it clear that he was always invited to things we did together. Whenever my friend Max's long-term girlfriend was in town, she would come too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when my friends and I first started discussing the trip, I asked if it would be alright for my guy to come along. I assumed it would be fine but to my surprise, my friends didn't want him to come.  What particularly surprised me was that they *unanimously* were against him coming. The reasoning they gave was that they wanted it to be only people from our university class (my boyfriend was also a student, but different major). I thought this was kind of silly and argued against it. Here is roughly the discussion that followed: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said that I would be fine with it if anyone else brought their SOs, and there was no reason to exclude someone who hung out with us regularly. Max said his girlfriend couldn't come anyway, plus he didn't want couples to be \"canoodling on holiday.\" This despite the fact that two members of our friend group were dating and definitely canoodled at one point or another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then argued that the house had plenty of room for another person (which it did) and would be cheaper for everyone with a 6th person. Max countered that there was no room in the car we were taking for 6 people. This made sense, but when I told my boyfriend, he offered to make his own way to Denmark and just meet us. My friends weren't okay with that either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then pointed out that it would really hurt his feelings if I went without him, since he wanted to go so badly and would miss out on fun. My friends said that we are adults and should be capable of spending time apart from each other once in a while. Honestly I was shocked at this - my boyfriend and I are both perfectly capable of going to things alone and we are by no means joined at the hip. But I found it mean to not invite him to this large and fun event. I couldn't budge them on it, and although I wasn't satisfied with their reasoning, I was outvoted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was really a mystery to me. My boyfriend and I are not the type to be all over each other when with friends, so I don't think the problem was really potentially \"canoodling on holiday\". I had the impression that there was something else not being said, like maybe they just don't like him for some reason? But there had never really been strife between my boyfriend and my uni friends, apart from the occasional drunken spat with Max which was made up for later - and that doesn't explain the unanimous vote against. I really could not understand why they all wanted him left out when he hung out with us so often already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, this whole thing hurt my boyfriend's feelings a lot and I felt like I was in a really tough position. My boyfriend and I love to travel together and I felt like my friends were either being silly or not telling the whole truth about why they didn't want him. Then again, I did want to spend some time with them before I moved away. I seriously considered not going on the trip at all in protest, but ultimately decided to go. My boyfriend is a sweetheart and never asked me not to go - he understood my dilemma - but I know it hurt his feelings that I went with them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the trip I still am not sure I did the best thing. So, am I the asshole for going on that vacation? ",

      "description": "Hi, im 19, M from Eastern europe.\n\nMy parents own a restaurant that isnt doing too well in the recent 6-7 years and since i graduated high school i started going there as bartender/manager to help because the person that was doing this quit. We have debt to further hold us back so i'm happy to help and work there for less money so we can save up instead of paying more to a stranger.  \nI've been there for 2 months , first one was ok. The second month things started going downhill for me. With my (probably chronic) insomnia i started feeling worse rapidly, working 5 days straight for 12-14 hours and 3 days off. I sleep way less than needed to stay healthy and its reflecting on my mental state a lot. My last streak of 5 workdays was extremely stressful with average of 4-6 hours of sleep and 3 workdays that exceeded 14 hours.\n\nI mentioned this to my mother on the 3rd day and i asked her if i could get 2 extra hours of sleep the next day and take only half the money i would otherwise because i genuinely dont feel good and i've been almost falling asleep several times a day recently. She escalated it into an argument and said how i was lazy and very irresponsible and all that type of stuff i've been listening to all my life. Interestingly i'm the most average of average dudes on earth. I got tired of all the insults and them always wanting more from me, while getting paid less even tho my main intentions are just to help and not be a burden.\n\nI told her i quit the job. My first day of i woke up in the afternoon and prepared to go out with friends when she burst in and tried to guilt force me to continue working because \"i have to\" and they have nobody to put in my place. I told her that i simply physically and mentally cannot continue and i need a schedule with either less workhours or more evenly spread workdays and days off. The reply was to find a job and move out ASAP. I said a quiet okay, finished getting ready went out and had a mental breakdown, complete with the yelling and punching the closest thing to me (a tree, ouch). \n\nIt hurt me so much to feel so unwanted in this family for so long and always being indirectly told that im just this huge weight and burden to them. I've been through hell with that sort of stuff and i think i've had enough. I'm moving out and finding a new job really soon and i won't care as much as i did 5 days ago about my parents, that fucking restaurant or anything that has to do with them.  \nAITA?",

She told me she bought a bus ticket.\n\nShe asked if I could take her back. I told her I could if I stayed at my sister's place or if she could get a ride to Long Island. She said to let her know. The day before thanksgiving I told her I wasn't staying at my sister's. She says \"I have the flu\" along with stuff like \"I didn't want to take the expensive bus but I guess I'm going to\". I texted her saying she could always get a ride to LI or somewhere near the highway. No reply.

I wanted to tell her she's being an entitled little kid but instead told her it was silly to be angry because I told her the two options she had if she wanted a ride back but she kept telling me how she asked other peoples opinions and said it made no sense to drive to Long Island to have me pick her up. \n\nShe comes from the rich part of Bronx and her family has money so I'm going to assume she's an entitled brat.

      "title": "AITA for being angry at my wife",
      "description": "My wife was diagnosed with BPD about a year and a half after we got married. I had no idea she struggled with her mental health while we were dating or the beginning of our marriage. The signs started to show after we signed on our house.\n\nFast forward to 2 years later. I’m pissed. She started getting worse mentally, no amount of therapy/treatment was helping. Her needs were impossible to meet. She was having temper tantrums constantly, going between telling me she hates me and I’m the worst thing ever to telling me how good I am to her and how lucky she is. Finally after one night of being woken up at 3 am to her erratic shit, I told her I couldn’t do this anymore and I wanted to move out. She left the room, came back, threw back a bottle of pills and swallowed. I called 911. She never showed any symptoms of overdose. Later, she told me and her doctor that there were only 3 pills in the bottle, she didn’t actually want to die, she knew three pills wouldn’t hurt her, she was just acting out for attention. It was an act of manipulation. \n\nThat was two months ago. She he’s been in residential treatment center for about a month now, she has two months left. I’m so angry that she couldn’t pull it the fuck together. I’m at home with our two young kids alone, drowning between taking care of them and keeping my job, while she’s “learning to cope” with life.\n\nShe has it made. I make good money. She doesn’t work. The kids are in daycare full time. We have a housekeeper. I treated her like gold, she had my constant attention, affection, and got anything she wanted. What the fuck does she need help coping with?\n\nThe coordinator of her care sends me messages about what her days consist of. Therapy, yoga sessions, meditation, activities like arts and crafts, evening group outings to the movies. She’s on an insanely expensive vacation because she’s too weak minded to handle life as an adult and I’m fucking angry about it. \n\nI’m not being nice to her right now. I’m not being mean either, I’m mostly ignoring her. It’s not great for her treatment but I don’t give a fuck about that right now. I spent years coddling, spoiling, and placating her I’m done. I can’t handle speaking to her. I’m disgusted by her at this point.\n\nI want to move out, but I can’t because of the kids. Since my wife is too crazy to deal with her own self that makes me the sole caretaker for our kids, so I need to stay in the house. I want for her to go somewhere else when she gets out of her treatment, I don’t want her to come back here. The coordinators of her care/her doctor don’t like that idea. They told me that she’s not ready to know I’m mad at her, they will need to pull in a family therapist to mediate that. They told me I need to have compassion when talking to her, so I stopped talking to her. My wife is so off that I can’t tell her that I’m angry with her for her terrible, adolescent behavior without a third party present to make her “feel okay about it.” She’s pathetic.\n\nAITA",

A few days ago at lunch, one of my friends, Eli (18M) was complaining about how he has two Ds right now.\n\nThe thing is, he never does his homework. He often complains about doing homework and either forgets or chooses not to do it. He likes to copy other people's homework and take credit for it as if it were his own work. He has no learning disabilities, so seems to be choosing not to make much of an effort in school.\n\nWIBTA if I were to tell him that his grades are his own fault and that he could easily fix them? I'm sick of having him mooch off of other people's work (especially mine) and then complain that the grade he received wasn't good enough when he, quite frankly, doesn't deserve a better grade because he doesn't even try.

I said I'm fine with that part, but I'm annoyed that it's just an expectation that we have to pay out of pocket every time we do it.

      "description": "I’ve been out of contact with my friend, A, for a handful of months now but I have been reflecting on it lately and want your opinion.\n\nFirst a little history. “A” had been my best friend for 10+ years, but never really hit it off with my husband. “B” has been my husbands best friend for 10+ years, and is also a close friend of mine. B and I have been close since my husband and I started dating 8 years ago, and he was the one who we credit with giving my husband the confidence to ask me on our first date. To add a bit of spice to the story, A and B briefly dated in high school. It ended pretty badly, but they have since reconciled and remained in contact. Both are your stereotypical “Type A” personalities. \n\nSo, let’s get started. In 2017, A planned her wedding for July 31st of 2019. She decided not to have any bridesmaids as her fiancé has social anxiety and doesn’t really have any friends, and she didn’t want to put him in an uncomfortable position (I think this was sweet of her). Fast forward 1 year to 2018 and B has planned his wedding for, you guessed it, July 31st of 2019. He was aware of A’s date but this date is significant in his family (his sister, mom, grandma, etc all were married on this date). \n\nMy husband was asked to be the best man in B’s wedding, and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was torn, because I love them both and wanted to go to both weddings. I wanted to stand in B’s wedding, but knew that this meant I’d miss all of A’s, something I was unwilling to do. (It helps to add here that B’s fiancé has been very sweet and understanding about the situation). My husband had never been close with A, and since he was asked to be best man he would have stayed at B’s wedding for the duration, but supported me and would have stood by whatever decision I made.\n\nI considered my decision for a long time, and decided that I would turn down B’s fiancé, and do my best to attend as much of both weddings as I could. I knew I would have to miss a portion of one or the other, but that seemed to be the best solution. Having decided this, before making anything official, I went to A for advice. When I brought the dilemma to her, before I could even get any part of my decision out, she hit me with an ultimatum. “All or none”. I stay for her whole wedding and skip B’s, or I don’t go at all. I chose none, and we haven’t spoken since. AITA?\n\n",

I take really really good care of it and would like it to stay nice for as long as possible cause it’s kinda my baby.  \n\nSo I made a few rules right when I bought it one of them being never to eat in it. My boyfriend got offended that I made this rule and while he (mostly) respects it, he gets kinda annoyed every time I bring it up. His main argument is that “he’s not a child” and knows how to eat without spilling anything, and that it’s inconvenient not to eat in it when we get fast food (it gets cold) or go on long road trips etc.  (I’ll add that my old car was a junker that we ate in all the time. We also ride together a good bit so this IS a change.) I know he respects my car and would clean anything up if he DID spill, but AITA for continuing to enforce this rule?",

      "description": "Now, when I say \"health\" I mean my skin. I have issues that a doctor is yet to find the reason of. My skin, especially on my face will go bright red, sore and will swell up so there's no real hiding it. I don't go outside and I don't like seeing anybody while my skin messes up like this. It's embarrassing and it just kinda messes with me a little. It annoys me a lot and I take it out on people because I feel like it's not fair, even though it's no one's fault.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months now. He knows about my skin issues and they don't bother him but I ask him to not come visit me. This basically means we rarely see each other because I don't want him around while I'm like this. He is very clingy. He wants my constant attention and when we're together in person, he always has to be right next to me and almost always touching me (holding hands, having an arm around me etc.) And I can't stand it. I don't want to be touched but he does it anyway.\n\nAs I said, we rarely see each other and I know he hates not being able to see me. I feel awful for it but I can't help not wanting anyone around. I feel like if I broke up with him, he wouldn't be on his own every day with hope that he'll be able to come over soon when I don't want him here. \n\nTyping this out and reading back on it, I know it probably sounds really dumb or maybe I'm not clear on a few things but WIBTA if I broke up with my boyfriend so I could try and focus on getting myself better without feeling bad that I'm ignoring my him all the time?",

      "description": "The past two months have been pretty drama-filled among me and my various friend groups, sides have been taken, all that petty bs. All of it stemmed from my actions coming out of a relationship. This girl (19f) and I (20m) were together for about a year and a half. Things were great for the first year or so, but then we started to have some issues that ultimately ended in her breaking it off with me. Both of us knew it's probably what was best, but she was the one to make the final decision, and we ended things rather amicably.\n\nThat being said, I struggled initially as I had grown quite accustomed to the relationship and was at a loss now that it wasn't there anymore. My emotional state was probably the worst it's ever been, and my doctor put me on Xanax when needed for about a week and a half immediately following the initial onset. After the first week of having my emotions regulated and viewing the situation from mostly a logical standpoint, I came to grips with the fact that we had a *very* unhealthy relationship. My life improved, I had more motivation to do things for myself, etc. I made a tinder a few weeks after we broke up, and matched with this girl I had had an English class with a year or so ago. On our first date, it turns out that this new girl (NG) had recently met with my ex through a mutual friend, and they were now part of a friend group. They weren't really friends, more like acquaintances, at least according to what NG told me. I figured it wasn't a big deal since my ex broke up with me, and they weren't good friends. We continued going on dates periodically, and we eventually decided that neither of us really wanted to get into a *serious* relationship right now as we were both fresh out of long-term relationships. And then it got out that we were \"seeing\" each other, and that's when things went south.\n\nMy ex refused to talk to me for a few days, and was very upset with me, claiming that what I did was disrespectful to our relationship, and proved to her that the time I spent with her meant nothing. This obviously isn't the case; I loved this girl so much, but things just didn't work out and I was okay with that. This led into a few weeks of drama consisting of their friend group telling NG to just stop talking with me, and them eventually just straight up not talking with NG anymore. \n\nJump ahead about two weeks, and it gets out that NG and I had made out w each other after one of our dates a few weeks prior. Everything had started to calm down, but this really just made everything flare up again. It's something I regret as I think it was something I did just because I missed the physical intimacy of a relationship, and wouldn't do it again if I was given the chance. \n\nThat being said, I believe that my actions weren't asshole-y as she was the one to end the relationship. Isn't it my choice as to when I'm over the relationship and ready to move on?",

      "description": "My bf and I have been together for 3 years. He was in pretty good shape when we met, but shortly after getting together he let himself go. Which I know is normal since you're getting comfortable around your partner, really didn't mind it the first year. But now he reached a point where I'm like...please please please, get back in shape. And he agrees. And he does want to get back in shape!\n\nHowever, he lacks of consistency and discipline, which is indeed the hardest part in any fitness journey, took me a while as well. But since we've been together I learned a lot about nutrition and working out, and I got in good shape over time. So yea, opposites and stuff.\n\nAnyways, my thought process here is that I'm actually able to help to get him back in shape. But it feels like he got an excuse everytime for having another cheat day or skipping the workout once again. Patience and sympathy only last so long before you start getting frustrated.\n\nIn fact, all those empty promises of 'finally starting to get back in shape' started to make me being so mean towards him, to a point where I can be a huge fkin bitch...or behave like a full fledged mother, being all like \"you can't do that, you can't eat this etc\". \n\nOf course that started to make him more frustrated as well. Like when he says \"I want to have some beers tonight, so I'll workout tommorow instead of today (like scheduled)\" on like a Wednesday, it drives me near insanity because I know that if I let him have those beers, he still won't do the workout tommorow, and he will most certainly have another excuse the next day, till it's the weekend where I try not to say anything.\n\nHe also usually complains that all I do is restrict him of having fun in his life and I see his point. It's his life not mine, and he's an adult, not a teenager. I shouldn't mother him like that, yet I want to...like downright force him to stop being so godamn inconsistent and get him finally, like for real finally back in shape.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for being like that towards him?",

      "description": " \n\nNow before I start I just wanna say I am very social and I do talk to people even if I know very little about them. However, with two jobs and school; I keep my circle small for the sake that I do not have a lot of time. Being that I do not have a lot of time I try to invest the little time I have into a couple good friends around me.\n\nAfter high-school we all kinda have the same story right? We try to keep up with people we kinda know but with school and work they eventually fade and only the people you are really close with stay. That is how it is for my one friend, who will be known as Steve for this story. Me and Steve go way back and have been able to build a bond as close as brothers. One day me and Steve were chilling and we see our high-school friend who will be known as George. George was cool with everyone but we were not really close,he kinda annoyed me sometimes because of his tendency to roast people for no reason. I do not really get angry at people roasting me it's just that sometimes I wanna chill and relax without having to think of a comeback for your stupid jokes. This is probably the reason I did not really keep up with him after high-school.\n\nTo continue, we met up with George at the mall and Steve and I said what-sup. Just for context Steve and George use to work at a local shoe store, but Steve is an immigrant and something went wrong with his paperwork so he could not work at the place. George still works there and was on break for that very shoe store so Steve asked if we could tag along so he could ask managers if he could come back because his papers were up to date again. I hang out with him and it was all good and fun but he starts roasting my shoes, my dress style, and even how much weight I gained. I don't really care and I just take it on the chin and just move on. He convinces Steve for all of us to chill another day ,so I go with it.\n\nSteve planned to chill really early however he had to drive his family everywhere because he is the only one who could drive in his home. So George wants to chill but I do not wanna be an asshole so I gave him a chance. I pick him up and he is listening to music in my car which I find pretty rude but hey it is his life. I ask if he wants lunch and he recommends a chicken place so we go. I ordered after him and he grabs a seat and I have no clue where he is. After 5 minutes of looking around I finally find him. He is kinda sitting there with a annoyed look on his face. I ask whats wrong and he constantly keeps repeating how Steve bailed on the plans. I kinda just shrug it off then I get my food and George food does not come. He is getting really impatient but I wait it out because my family raised me on waiting for the other person to eat first. He gets so angry with me and keeps saying \"EAT YOUR FOOD\" I reject it because I wanna wait. He keeps yelling and even yells at the chicken store employees. He gets his food and gets another free meal which he uses. I usually offer a bit of my food to other people whether it be fries or a piece of my cookie. This man ate two meals all by himself. Fast forward to the night and Steve finally meets up with us. George and Steve are hitting it off and they suggest on George Birthday to go to Vegas. Im like ehh Vegas not for me. I get a stone face looked from George. To continue I am kinda distant with Steve because I feel like I have to hang out with George and I do not feel like being forced to hang out with someone is a fun day.\n\nSo reddit what should I do? Am I an asshole? Or am I just over reacting?",

I dont know if its the rose coloured glasses syndrome but I am starting to see that my bf lacks general life skills (washes dishes in cold water, no idea what a credit score is, does things half assed, etc). We have argued about it many times. The last time was over him half assing a few chores and I re-did the chores (this isnt a case of \"my way or the highway\" but right v wrong). He said some things that made me rethink my being with him.\n\nHis first defense \"I didnt have to do those chores\" (we dont live together). \n\nSure. What about when we live together? Its still not ok to half-ass chores so that dishes are left greasy and the dogs mess still reeks after he \"cleaned\" them. \n\nHe then said \"sometimes i forget how to wash dishes, ok?\". I was dumbfounded and the only thing i could say was \"how old are you\"? He told me that me saying this hurt his feelings. I just dont get it. He acts like a spoiled child. \n\nHowever, after the argument he admitted he was indeed a brat. He has been trying to grow up. I cant deny it.

      "description": "I currently live with two roommates, A and B in a really crappy apartment. We’re all girls in STEM in our early 20’s, I’m a chemist whose job keeps me out of the house 6:30am-4:00pm, A is a master’s student who has to be in lab 9:00am-6:00pm, and B is a second-year med school student. I primarily take care of the apartment since my work doesn’t follow me home so I’m the sole cleaner of the living areas, bathroom, and I’ll do a deep clean in the kitchen every once in a while since my roommates generally clean up after themselves there. I overall don’t mind this role much, if I had my own place I would have to clean these areas anyway, and living with roommates is a lot cheaper.\n\nOur apartment has a bad mice infestation (I’ve had one crawl up my leg sitting on the couch, the most we’ve seen out at once is 6, mouse poop everywhere). We can’t control the heat and even though the landlord says it’s at 72F it sits around 60F, our electricity is horrible; our lights flicker daily at 7:00 pm and whenever we use any other electricity, and if we use the microwave or dishwasher with anything else there’ll be a power out. This past month we found out there’s no certificate of occupancy for this apartment and when confronting the landlord about it, she said she can’t fix and agreed to break the lease. B had the condition that she could only move if it’s after her exam on (Monday) December 17th, and before late January because it’ll be too close to her STEP exam in June. A can’t move after December 19th because she is flying across the country to see her family until mid-January, and once she comes back, can’t move until after late January because she has her MCAT exam.  My roommates had no time to find a new place therefore it was my job to find one, and again, I didn’t mind because I would be looking for a place regardless. I toured a bunch of houses, picked the top two, and asked my roommates when they would want to see them to set up the times. B ended up not being able to make it but said she trusts us to pick out a house. A and I both loved one of the houses, it’s on the first floor (which is nice compared to our 3rd floor walkup) and is $100 cheaper each per month.\n\nThe plan was for my dad and brother to drive 6 hours up to help move us, rent a truck, and fix anything needed in our new apartment. We planned on moving the 17th rights after B’s test. However, this plan fell apart last week when I realized that I couldn’t take that day off work and neither could my brother or A, so we could only move after 6:00pm with only me, A, B, and my boyfriend. We are definitely not strong enough to carry the furniture down three flights so we would have to hire movers which we cannot afford. B was freaking out about a different test that was coming up in 3 days to the point where she could not drop off the rental application, contact her cosigner, or sign the agreement breaking the lease. Whatever, we dropped it off for her and waited till after for her to sign and contact. During this time, A’s two guy friend offered to lend us their truck and help move us out on (Saturday) the 15th (they can’t during the week because they work and use the truck), my dad and brother can come up, and A and I both are free all day. We told B after her test that this was the new plan, and since she’ll be studying all day we can either pack, mover her stuff, and unpack for her (in one day, so she would wake up and leave one house and come home to a different house and go to sleep), or she can move herself after her test. All the living room and dining room furniture in the house is mine so I take responsibility for that, and we also have to move our bedroom furniture as well.\n\nB completely freaked out on us. She said it was her only request to not move before the 17th, we don’t understand how stressful her tests are, and we are not being considerate of the position she’s in. She said she won’t be moving on the 15th but she’s coming to the house we’re moving into to choose which room she wants so it will be suitable for her to study in (um no). She said she had to drop $100’s on STEP and she can’t afford time or money to move in the first place, and said if she knew we were going to do this to her he would get a studio (which go for about $200 more a month). We continuously explained that she doesn’t have to move anything if she doesn’t want to, she’ll be saving $700 for the remainder of our lease in rent money, and all the help we are getting is free (compared to renting a truck and hiring people). Or if she doesn’t want any of her stuff moved till after her test she can move herself once she’s done. Still, B is pissed that we lied to her (unintentionally) and are not following her one request. She also brought up that I had friends over the night before a test on Halloween (she didn’t tell us she had a test until I asked if my roommates wanted to go out with me and 4 friends that came over prior. They were only over for an hour beforehand to eat pizza and walk to the bar. B stayed at her aunt’s house that night regardless) even though she had 3 dinner parties with 10+ people without telling us at all beforehand and didn’t cleanup for over a month until we started cleaning up her stuff for her. \n\nAITA for not sticking to the original move date and not following my roommate’s request?",

      "description": "My dog has a habit of mostly only wanting to poop on bushes. When this happens I don’t pick up the poop for two reasons. \n\n1) it goes to the bottom of bush and I don’t want to stick my hand in there because of spiders and it’s hard to reach \n2) when it does stay on top, part of the poop ends up falling a little lower and in my attempt to get it I get poop on my hand from the leaves that have poop on them\n\nBecause of this, I’ve resorted to just leaving the poop when he does on a bush. I feel like an asshole and that any day a neighbor will see me, report me, and I’ll get fined. My fiancée says I am not, that she does the same thing. So Am I am asshole for not picking up my dog’s poop when it’s on a bush?",

My teams turnover rate is quite high (we've had 4 people fired because they just can't do the job and 2 walk out because they're young and cba with a full time job) so basically about 2 months a girl joined our team.\n\nAt the start I didn't really mind her because there was 3 other girls besides me and her so we would all sit together on lunch and stuff but now two have left and one walked out so it's just me and her and because I was moved, I sit closer to her so I'm not so excluded from the other guys. \n\nSo basically where the whole avoiding thing comes in is that, she talks a lot. I have nothing against people that talk a lot  but it's what she talks about. \n\nWe have very different interests and while I was open to discussing the things she likes, it's gotten to the point where I really can't listen to the same thing 800 times. \n\nSo examples are the new marvel movie is coming out and she doesn't stop talking about and no one in our team really like superhero stuff that much. \n\nShe talks about comic books all the time and tries to find a way to bring up at any point. Like she'll stand at her desk and read them so everyone can see.\n\nShe's going on holidays and I know about every single one, where's going, how long, what she's doing, who's she's meeting etc\n\nShe talks about how she lived away in this certain country and whenever someone even mentions it, she's immediately butting into the conversation\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I leave later for work so I can avoid having to walk up a hill with her because it's ten minutes of her just talking at me and her not even asking me about anything in my life. \n\nA few other members of the team and I now take our lunch later so we can avoid her and when she talks to me, I don't really acknowledge her. I think she is a nice girl but I also think it's kinda rude how she is and how everything needs to get brought back to her. \n\nI basically know her whole life story and I don't think she's ever even asked me one question about myself. \n\nIdk AITA though?",

She says \"this is racist\" (because it was) but I was an idiot and  tried to defend the movie trying to say \"It's ok because XYZ\" (to a  fucking Japanese person who said it was racist.) The problem is I don't  know if it's right or not to apologize because 1.) It was like, 15 years  ago. 2.) I'm not super close with this person, we're FB friends but I  haven't seen her much since graduation. 3.) Maybe I'm just being selfish/more racist by wanting to apologize to make myself feel better when it would  just be weird and awkward for her? I also have no idea how I would bring  it up with her without sounding like a crazy person. I feel like it's probably best to accept that I fucked  up and try to do better, but I keep thinking about this. If I  apologized, am I the asshole? ",

The shirt I got was of much lower quality, it looked like the design on the shirt turned into a PNG and put on the middle of a shirt of similar color. The real shirt has the design completely filling the shirt, it's all the same color, there's a little easter egg inside the shirt, and is made out of better material. After asking, she revealed she got someone else to take the image (through a process she calls \"buying the vinyl\", which allegedly details calling the company to purchase a copy of the image, giving the printer the rights to use the image wherever, which I have found no proof of existing) and put it onto a shirt. This subsequently started a fight between us about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like that she did this, because (unless \"buying the vinyl\" is a real thing) the original creator of the game (a small indie game, so it's not like this is some massive corporation or anything) isn't getting any money from it. This game is important to me and I want to support them for making it, though I realize it may have been unfair of me to not want the shirt. ",

She also suffers from chronic asthma and now depression due to her sickness.\n\nI pay the rent and utilities and food, and some of her medical bills. To be blunt she is bleeding me dry. I work 6 days a week, generally 50-60 hours in order to pay for everything. We cant stay in a cheaper apartment because she \"needs\" to live on the first floor (she lived on second story apartments for years, just doesnt want to deal with stairs). We sleep on a full twin adjustable bed that she complains about all the time, she wants me to spend 3k on an adjustable queen size. She \"needs\" the air kept at 72 degrees (in florida) for her asthma and it jacks up our utilities (not to mention she leaves fans, lights, TVs, and computers on all day). \n\nEverytime I complain about how much crap and craft supplies she hordes and leaves everywhere she cries and plays the mental illness card. It's getting real old, shes home all day and we constantly look like we just moved in. Top it all off with an almost completely dead bedroom and you can see why I am unhappy.\n\nBut then I think about how just about all of it is caused by her chronic illness. How it is very little that she can control and how little choice she has in her circumstances. \n\nI don't want to break up but my happiness is almost non existant since I have to work all the time and spend very little time in the apartment I pay out the nose for. But if I broke up with her, WIBTA? I dont want to get to the point that she can claim common law marriage.\n\n",

I don't drink often (maybe once a month) and there have been occasions where I would go to parties with my boyfriend and get super wasted and throw up. The last time I drank with him was on my 21st birthday and I threw up all over his car. He thinks I don't know my drinking limits and can't control myself when I'm drunk, however, when I'm out drinking with friends I never have this problem and am never wasted.  \n\nFor Thanksgiving break, my friends and I have planned a girls' trip to Vegas and my boyfriend is only letting me have one drink every night that i'm there. We made a deal that depending on how I did on my 21st birthday, he would let me drink more.  Well, since I got wasted on my twenty first, he says he doesn't think I should be allowed to drink because he thinks I'm going to get too drunk and do something stupid at the club. I know I should keep my end of the deal but I don't think it's fair that my first trip to Vegas will have to be sober while my friends get to be drunk.

      "description": "So my mom has always had a lot of pretty jewelry that my dad has bought her over the years. I’ve always admired her jewelry. She would occasionally let me look at it growing up but she never really wears the jewelry. Some mother/daughter relationships are like “hey can I borrow that necklace?” And the mom/daughter doesn’t care if they borrow it. That’s never really been our relationship though. The only time she has ever let me wear her jewelry  was on my wedding day and she made sure I gave it back to her before the reception was over. It was a nice piece of jewelry so I get it. \n\nAnyways she got to talking to me about how her and my dad just recently updated their will and how I should make a will, etc. I flat out asked if I was going to get her jewelry. I know this is probably an insensitive question, but I wanted to know what her plans were. I don’t want her jewelry because of the monetary value or anything like that. Obviously I think the jewelry is pretty and I figure it’ll be something of my mom’s that I will cherish. Keep in mind, I’m the only daughter also. If I had other sisters I would totally expect her to split it up between us. \n\nShe tells me “well, probably not.” And I was kinda hurt and asked what she planned on doing with it. She said “well, now I have granddaughters to think about, too.” And I said that all her grandchildren have moms of their own that will probably be passing their jewelry along to them. She basically thinks I’m just asking for her jewelry in a selfish way and not in a keepsake way. I asked if she was going to give some to her DILs and she said no because she doesn’t trust them with the jewelry. \n\nI ended up saying that there were a few pieces I really loved growing up and if she decides to give me any jewelry then I’d love those pieces (especially the one I wore to my wedding). \n\nIt’s been an odd relationship between us at times. One year I was having a tough year due to a break up and my dad bought me some nice earrings for Christmas. This was the first time my parents ever bought me nice jewelry. My mom basically told me flat out that she didn’t agree with him for buying me nice earrings and the next day she went out and bought a pair that looked almost identical to the earrings I got. So I guess I shouldn’t be shocked that she doesn’t want to give me her jewelry.\n\nBut I’m wondering if maybe I am the asshole and being entitled for even expecting to receive it in the first place...

      "description": "It's Thanksgiving on my mom's side of the family.  My uncle (late 30s) is in a bad manic phase, going through the house, starting random projects. After my grandma (who made all the food) says something, he goes into a rage, curses her out, then leaves. He comes back hours later with a 16 year old kid he just met. This feels wrong, so I convince him into letting me take this kid home. I do, and in the process of all of this, miss the other side of my family's Thanksgiving. \n\nThe next day, he comes to my restaurant for the first time with the rest of my family. He leaves to buy cigs. This usually means he'll be gone for hours. Now I'm nervous because this is in a small town, you can't act like that here, someone will call the cops, and I don't want him being associated with my business.\n\nWhen he comes back, it's dinner rush, and he's following me around uncomfortably closely, talking a lot, and then goes in the kitchen to \"help\". He gets in the way, makes staff uncomfortable, and makes more of a mess.\n\nI'm visibly annoyed at this point and he gets in my face, asking me over and over what I'm mad about and why I'm mad at him. Finally I yell \" I'm working! I'm AT WORK. Leave me alone!\"\n\nThe sets him off, and then he goes to the streets, raging and talking to himself. Since I couldn't leave, I asked a friend to basically babysit him all night until they left town so he doesn't get arrested or ruin our business's reputation.\n\nI know he's sick and was just excited so I feel bad for yelling. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr\nMy bipolar manic uncle ruined thanksgiving, came to my restaurant where I yelled at him and then had a friend follow him around and babysit him until he left.

      "description": "Slight background so basically I have these neighbours that have 2 cars both my house and theirs are full of students. We don't own a car but casually borrow a friend's and park it in our driveway. It began one night at 2am when they had a visitor parked way up the joint driveway, we had just gotten a ride back to our house (from the friend with the car we casually borrow and it was in our driveway) so the of the neighbors presumed boyfriends was the one parked way up the driveway and blocked in. He came knocking on our door at 2 am and asked us to move, I was not happy but my friends insisted on moving for him even though he was blocked in by the cars of the house he was at, nevertheless here's the current situation. \n\nI live in Canada and we get a lot of snow and snowplows plow the roads causing big humps at the end of our driveway. If this isn't shoveled and just driven over it becomes hard to shovel. One day one of my roommates shoveled it for the neighbours and passed them on the way in and no thank was given so we decided to not do it for them because of the ignorance. So today I came to my house with the borrowed car and realized I would have to shovel the end of the driveway because the plow had gone by ( both actual driveways have been shoveled just not the end). So I go to shovel and realize the neighbours just pushed through the snow in the middle of the shared driveway so I decided to shovel my half and park at the end so they needed to shovel their side to get in. The neighbour came to the door upset she could not get into her side of the driveway yet my car was not blocking her driveway at all. So am I the asshole for making them shovel theirs?\n\nTLDR: I only shoveled my half of the driveway and made it so they have to shovel theirs\n\nI also have a picture of the driveway and where my car is parked I will post in the comments ",

      "description": "In high school, I was good friends with this girl, who I'll call Tiffany. College rolled around and we went to opposite sides of the country, and essentially lost touch, aside for meeting up for a day in junior summer. She was fine when we met up - she had gotten into the party scene, which she was always into in high school, and had some dramatic stories about her roommates. Normal stuff, but after junior year, our correspondences fell off to a series of intermittent texts.\n\nHowever, these texts were bleak. It seemed like Tiffany's life wasn't going well - she got into some heavy things, and went to jail. I would hear about this in snatches, and whenever I responded, there would be a long period of nothing before she would respond - sometimes weeks, but more usually, months or half a year. It got to the point where our texts would be along the lines of, 'how's it going?' and then a year would pass and she would respond 'wow sorry for taking so long to respond!! how're things going with you?' Soon, these texts dwindled to nothing. \n\nSo, it's been about two years since I last heard from her, but I've started getting texts from her again. They sound disjointed and worrisome, and they don't entirely make sense. She's claimed to have stayed awake for an entire week, that she's been having dreams about us, and that she's been having rollicking fevers. She's claimed that special people have effects from drinking water overseas, and that 'they' communicate to us in Morse code. She also asked for my address so that she could send me something.\n\nI start checking her Facebook, as it's the only social media contact of her's that I know about. The last thing she posted was six months ago, a long post about how she's been getting help and how she has support. It got a decent chunk of likes. I wasn't sure how to respond to her message, so I didn't respond. A few hours later, I get another message - another request for my address.\n\nAITA for not wanting to give her my address? I feel bad, but it's been so long since I've seen her. I'm also pretty freaked out. I don't know who to contact about this. We live on opposite sides of the country. I don't even know how to respond.\n\n\nTL;DR: Old high school friend slowly disappears from my life. Recently starts texting me disjointed texts about special people, morse code, and effects of drinking water, and keeps asking for my address. I feel uncomfortable giving it to her, and talking to her. AITA?",

      "description": "Okay so some context: me and my boyfriend have been together for around two and a half years now and his birthday isn't for a few months but his mother has already started to plan a surprise party for him and his step brother to share (who will be turning 21) the 21 year old likes Anime and my boyfriend likes Pokémon(however his mother is convinced that he also likes Anime) so she themed the party 'Pokémon Anime and everything japanese' which itself is a bit cringy and people are going to be cos playing from Pokémon and Anime of they wish.\n\nNow the other day she told me she was making him an outfit for the party and to be clear this boy has never shown an interest in dressing up, even for Halloween he didn't want to dress up. I was starting to get worried so I messaged my boyfriends bother as he knows my boyfriend well enough to know its not something he'd like, but get hit back with a lot of aggression saying that I was being negative and that if we can't have fun it's more of a reflection on our personalities rather than the party (I never said anything about fun I was saying that my bf wouldn't like being forced to dress up) and thus that conversation swiftly ends.\n\nFast-forward to the next day and my boyfriend joins my party on Xbox when he gets back from work and tells me I'm not in his mums good books and I find out that she told him about the surprise party just because of what I said and because I was in her bad books? Which I thought was kind of immature as she could have messaged me herself but I'll let it slide. So my boyfriend then questions why I would ask his bother as 'I should know that once his mum is convinced of something, no one can change her mind'. I still don't understand what I did wrong. \n\nAITA? ",

I didnt even drink much but it was my first time drinking in a hot minute so my tolerance was shit. \n\nSo apparently my friends and I had a whole conversation about sex &amp; kinks. My friend, Josh brought it up the following weekend while we were hanging out with other friends. I was like, wtf are you talking about? He's like, yeah there was a whole conversation. So I wanted to know how that conversation started and who said what. He said no. We were yelling back and forth at each other about this for a few minutes. I was internally freaking out because theres some shit my friends dont need to know about me in regards to the bedroom (I was molested as a kid, so my mind went straight to that). Josh was freaking out cause how I was asking (yelling) and that he didnt want to put his business out there in front of all our other friends. So I said that's fine, tell me what *I* said. He still said no. We continued arguing for a couple minutes. \n\nI asked the other people that were there for our conversation. And they were no help either. As of right now, I still don't know what I said. Josh would be the only person that could help with that. \n\nJosh is mad at me for freaking out at him. I'm mad at him for not telling me what I said while I was blackout, and what is, IMO, an uncalled for attitude towards me. I dont care about what other people said, I want to know what I said. But all I got out of him was that I didnt say much. ",

However, lately it's been getting worse and worse. \n\nTwo weeks ago Drunky started hitting her head against the wall at 2 in the morning, causing our neighbors to call the cops for a noise complaint. It took me and my other roommate physically lifting her up and carrying her to her bed to make her stop. We explained the situation to the cop, he recommended she didn't get that drunk again, and he left. \n\nLast weekend, Drunky came back from the bar claiming to only have had 3 drinks and wanted to drink more. She poured herself a big glass of wine and took it into her room. She came back out about a half hour later for another one, and repeated that until the bottle was gone. Probably 4 more times. My other roommate and I were sitting on the couch watching tv when Drunky stumbles out of her room, lays down on the floor, and vomits all over herself and the couch. My roommate and I clean her up, mop up the vomit, take her to the toilet, and tell her to throw up in there if she needs to again. Drunky ends up falling asleep in the bathroom and my other roommate has to drive her to work the next day because she was still drunk. \n\nLast night, Drunky and I are the only ones in the apartment as my other roommates had gone home for winter break. Drunky gets home from the bar at 3:30. She's with a guy who I assume is spending the night, so I go to sleep. At 4:30, I'm woken up by the fire alarm. The kitchen is filled with smoke. I'm still sleepy, so before finding the source of the smoke, I go make sure Drunky is awake and getting ready to evacuate. She's still asleep, so I nudge her to wake her up and she slaps my had away and tells me to leave her alone. \nFiguring she was up now, I grab my fire extinguisher, go back to the kitchen, and find the stove on high with a pot of noodles billowing smoke but not on fire. I grab the pot, take it outside, and prop the door open to clear the air. After once again checking on Drunky, I go back to sleep. \n\nTurns out Drunky's friend had left, so she decided to make some noodles. Everything was fine until she had to puke. She made it to the toilet but forgot she had made noodles so she went to bed. \n\nWhen she woke up this morning, I talked to her and the conversation didn't go well. I told her she needed to see a therapist or psychiatrist because she has a drinking problem. I didn't say anything before because she's a senior in college and can make her own decisions, but now she's put the safety of our entire apartment complex at risk because of her bad decisions. She got mad and left. Drunky texted our roommate and told her that she was mad at me because I overstepped my boundries. \n\nSo AITA here or was I justified in confronting her? \n\nTL;DR: Roommate is mad at me because I didn't let her burn out apartment complex down.

      "description": "So I (male) ran into the office this morning quickly to pick up some samples before I had to go to an off-site meeting.  I met with two of my co-workers (one male and one female) to get the samples. We were gathering samples and that's when I first noticed that the female co-worker had jeans on with their zipper wide open.  They were high-waisted jeans and she also had a shirt tucked in so it was quite obvious when she was standing straight up. My first instinct was to tell her but we were rushed and in front of another male coworker, and I thought she might feel embarrassed if I said that to her in front of the other male coworker. \n\n Note,  I don't know her very well - we've only been in a few meetings together over the last few months, and I'm also probably about 20 years older than her. My fear also is/was that she might have thought that I was looking at her inappropriately so I just ignored it.   I was in a rush and asked them to help me get the samples (multiple boxes) down to the car so she offered to grab a cart and meet me on the first floor while I pulled my car up.  \n\nMy Hope was she noticed it and fixed it before I saw her next but when she was pushing the cart out to my car I didn't noticed that it was wide open.   I thought again to tell her,  but then it was just the two of us and again my fear was that she might have thought it was inappropriate, or be embarrassed in front of me in the future.\n\nAITA for not telling an \"aquaintance\" female coworker that her zipper was wide open??",

      "description": "I love my fiancé, and I have generally spoiled her with pretty nice gifts through the years for numerous Holidays (New Television, Apple Watch, Ipad, jewelry, etc). This year we finally decided that we would purchase a home together. Throughout the process though we discovered that her credit was much worse than I thought due to some credit card debt from when she was in college. We make good money and she is nearly debt free its just that enough time hasn't passed for the bad stuff to fall off of her report.\n\nThis led to me being the only one purchasing the home. The entire loan, down payment, income verification, pretty much everything was ran solely through myself. If you've ever purchased a home you'll understand that since she isn't going to be on the loan from the bank I cannot use any of the money she makes for the house, only my own money. This has made things a bit awkward, with me asking her to cover almost all of our expenses lately as I tuck away the majority of my paycheck to go into the house fund. She has been very accommodating in this regard.\n\nThe issue arose over the weekend when she asked about Valentine's Day. She mentioned wanting to do a nice dinner and what not, and made a comment about how she was \"excited to see what I got her this year\". I felt really bad because I love spoiling her and she is always so grateful. But I responded and told her that with the house purchase and everything I hadn't planned on getting her anything. She kind of had a look of surprise and I said \"come on I thought the house was going to be your gift.\" \n\nShe immediately turned red and I could tell that she was embarrassed and a little upset. She kept saying \"no its fine\" and \"that makes sense I wasn't thinking\" and similar anecdotes but her reaction has really stuck with me. I feel like I went about it all wrong and can't help but think I should have tried to be more thoughtful and, even if I couldn't get her something extravagant, I could have at least said I was getting her something small but saving something big that we could get together when we move in (we close February 28). \n\nOnce we are in the house she will be splitting everything with me 50/50 and I'm relying on her. She can't help her credit situation at this point and has been super helpful along the way. Though I feel like my reasoning for not getting her anything has merit I also feel like I may have handled it improperly.\n\nTL;DR: Buying a house for us that only I am spending down payment on, told her I wasn't getting her anything for Valentine's Day, she got upset. AITA?",

Well yesterday, I was washing my car when I noticed an older lady (50's maybe?)  Let her dog poop by our mailbox, then causally stroll away. I asked her if she intended on cleaning it. She yells at me that where the dog pooped was public property and she didn't have to. I calmly explained her that we have a toddler that plays in our yard, and public property or not, shes responsible for cleaning it. \n\nThen she tells me that she takes immunosuppressants, and isn't supposed to handle dog poop. Keep in mind she was also smoking during this exchange. \n\nAgain, calmly, I tell her that if she doesn't pick it up, I will be reporting her to the HOA and she will be fined. At this point I offered her poop bags and she picked it up and left in a huff. \n\nAbout  20 min later, her adult daughter is banging on my door. She asks how dare I expose her mother to germs by making her pick up her dogs poop. She's livid and also reeks of cigarettes. I just tell her to leave or I'm calling the police, and to stay off our property. \n\nAITA? If shes that immunosuppressed, she shouldn't even be handling a dog or smoking. ",

I'll refer to my gf as \"C\", the mom as \"A\" and the step dad as \"M\".\n\nIt's been around 10-11 years now and he's definitely shown his character. He's called my girlfriend a loser who will never amount to anything (to her face), he beat his son as a method of discipline, gets extremely defensive at the slightest thing (quick example : my gf's sister's boyfriend made a comment like \"Oh yeah I saw a study saying listening to Christmas music on repeat can negatively effect your mental health\" to which M replied \"Well what college did you go to?\" and basically dismissed C's sister's boyfriend's comment because he didn't go to college) puts down A with comments like \"I don't think your emotionally strong enough to deal with things\" and that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe thing is, any time C tells A she thinks that M is acting badly and should apologize A makes excuses and refuses to confront him about these things because she's worried he'll leave her. As a side note, she's entirely financially dependent on him. He also condemns homosexuality (C is bisexual), thinks physical discipline for children is ok, and has never apologized for anything in his life as far as I'm aware.\n\nSo since A makes excuses for him and doesn't hold him accountable I think C and I should cut them out of our lives. If A isn't willing to defend anyone against M then I see that as being ok with his actions. Any time C attempts to confront A about this, A basically either dismissed the conversation or hangs up if it's a phone call. C and A have always been very close but I don't think it's fair for A to ask C and I to just put up with M.\n\nSo AITA for wanting to cut them out or should I just deal with it since C wants to have a relationship with A?\n\ntl;dr Girlfriend wants to have a relationship with her mom who is married to an asshole and won't stand up to his asshole-ness.

      "description": "Last semester I worked a few hours in a lab helping seniors with their research projects. I spent six hours total with one senior on multiple days helping her facilitate the experiment. It wasn’t hard, but it took up my time. I got experience from it but it wasn’t like it was only for my benefit. I helped the senior with a fundamental part of her project. \n\nSimilarly, I spent five hours in one day helping two other seniors on their project. This was grueling just because I was there for a long time and I was extracting adrenal and spleen tissue from mice, so it wasn’t exactly pleasant. Out of all the other volunteers they had, I stayed there the longest to help them out, but there were other volunteers who stopped in and helped too. \n\nI wasn’t expecting anything in return. \n\nThis semester, the seniors are preparing to present their results. We have the same research advisor and he required the juniors (me and others) to be present for a preliminary run-through of the seniors’ powerpoints, in which they present their results. \n\nAt the end, they included a thank-you slide, with the names of everyone who helped. Everyone but me. \n\nI didn’t react negatively, I wasn’t angry, just disappointed that they seemed to not appreciate my help enough to put it on the slide, or that they forgot about me. It would have been nice to get my name out there, especially since their results will be published (though I don’t know if they will have included everyone’s name in the published results). \n\nI just feel like it would have been nice if they included me since I did help them, just as much if not more than the others they thanked. \n\n I know it is petty. I don’t know why they didn’t include me. I had only ever talked to them much during lab, and I don’t think I ever said anything mean or anything so I don’t know why both people neglected to put me in the thank you. \n\nI know I will never ask for this. It would be rude. But i have a strong desire to do so. Would I be the asshole if I asked to be put on the thank you?\n\n",

I go to a very culturally diverse school with tons of different races and ethnicities.\n\nAnyway, today I was in my junior year Literature class, and we were discussing a book (I don't remember which one) that had the N word in the first chapter we read. Our teacher skipped over it (even though she was reading off things like shit and fuck) and as expected me and a few friends cracked some jokes about it. I then casually mentioned that I think it shouldn't be a big deal to say it if you're just reading it aloud straight from the text. I was met with disagreement, and not wanting to back down I kept arguing my point. I was trying to be respectful, but people kept interrupting me by pointing out that there's a history behind the word, just saying it is racist, while I was trying to say that there's nothing inherently wrong with the word so long as you're not trying to use it in a derogotory sense, and that just reading it from a book that was assigned for class wouldn't be a big deal since it's literally in the book, why would a word be in a book if you weren't meant to read it? Things escalated to the point where one student was yelling over me every time I tried to talk, everyone was calling me a racist, and that same student was willing to fight me over the issue.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hi everyone, i just need people's opinions on an issue i have been having.\n \nJust a little backstory- I live a couple hundred miles from my family. My roommate, Mason is who i consider my family here in ct. Though his family is only one state over, we have both put each other as emergency contacts that way if something happens, the other person can find out what's going on and relay it to each other's family. I am also in a new relationship with John and we have been together for 5 months and it's going well. Mason and i are 100% platonic and John and him have no problems with each other.\n\nSo for the past couple of weeks, i have been very ill and i thought it was a cold but it wasn't going away. Everything hurt and i was just so tired all of the time to the point that i would go to work, come home and go to sleep. Eventually i collapsed at work. I was taken to the hospital and i found out i had pneumonia. I don't remember alot of this because i was out of it but my emergency contact, Mason was called. He called my family and John and let them know what was going on. When i woke up a couple hours later, i had been given fluids and antibiotics and i was alone. The nurse informed me that Mason had been there and would be back.\n\nI called Mason, who called John and since i was awake and coherent, he came to the hospital to see me. Fast forward a week, im back at home and doing well and John brings up the hospital. He said that he was really annoyed that he wasn't allowed to see me and that he had to get the information from Mason since he wasn't an emergency contact. He asked if i could put him as an emergency contact and i said no. I told him that i think it's too early in the relationship for me to do that. This started a massive argument about why i would allow a roommate but not my bf to be on there. For the record, i have known Mason for three years, i have met his family and vice versa. He's family to me and not just a roommate.\n\nI took a couple days and i really thought about it from his perspective. It would annoy me to be sitting in a hospital visting room for hours and not be allowed to get an update or see him if he was hurt. I decided to add him. I showed him that i added him and he was still ticked off because he's number 3 on my contact list while Mason is #1, my mom is the second. Mason's #1 cuz he lives with me while my mom is far away. I told him he was being ridiculous. He was pressuring me to put him as the first contact or even just above Mason and wouldnt let the issue go for days so i just removed him again. \n\nI don't see the big deal about who's on the list and what number they are. I don't see why he's being like this. I didn't want to add him in the first place because i feel like our relationship is still new and i feel like he's making an issue out of nothing. I want people's opinions. Please don't just say breakup with him because this is legitimately the only issue we have had unless you're seeing red flags that im not seeing. I just want advice. Am i the asshole when it comes to this? How can i fix it if i am? ",

His outlook on life has really gone downhill and he is always miserable. All of Greg's old interests he has since dropped. Me and my SO(his roommate) are really worried for him as friends. We have tried to help him by getting him out of the house or encouraging him to do things with us, but he just refuses.\n\nGreg quit his job two month ago simply because he was tired of going to it. He told my SO and I that his parents pay for all his food, housing, and spending money under one condition: that he has a job. He has been lying to his parents about having a job. My SO and I have been considering informing his parents he quit his job. I think that if his parents found out he quit his job they might make him move back in with them which would motivate him to find a job, or give him the kick in the pants to actually get out of this hole he is in.

      "description": "Im a 16 YO and was raised Catholic by my single mum, our family used to go church mostly every single week when I was younger, because my family were really religious. As I got older I started to feel like going to church was inconsequential and a waste of time as I realised that I wasn't religious anymore, and complained every time I was forced to go, and also alter serve.(I stopped doing that a few years ago)\n\nOkay, now last week I got into a heated argument with my mum when she told me to get ready for church, I said I don't want to. I kept telling her that I don't believe in God, and asked her SO MANY TIMES, why exactly I should go church even if i don't care about it. She doesn't even give me a rational answer, just saying that I live in her house, so I have to go church. I forgot what mostly happened, but i remember her hitting me, for talking back, i was sorta provoking her too, because I was so angry cuz she doesn't understand that making me go church isn't gonna change anything and make me resent the concept of religion because I have to be 'forced' into a religion without her bothering to care about how i feel. Well reluctantly, I ended up going. She even told me to get out of the house and I was like yeah, I can't wait and I probably wont miss you. \n\nWell, right now it's Saturday which is church day -\\_- so a while ago my mum came in the room and took my phone cuz i refused to go church again. We started arguing again in front of 2 of my cousins and my older brother (my mum doesn't even try to get him to go church). I kept asking her why I HAVE to go church all she said was cuz your catholic. I got so angry, and said no, I'm not and said that if she wants to go to church, then go by herself, I don't have a problem but don't force me to go and that she doesn't have the right to make me believe in a God. That didn't work. She starting harassing me with a coat hanger and slapped me in the back of my head sooo hard 2 times (My head still sorta hurts). She left the room later, I provoked her which I shouldn't have done i know, saying sarcastically 'YEAH, go to church yourself you fat bitch'  My mum didn't do anything, so i assumed  so didn't hear that. She then turned off the router, and took my laptop. OH WAIT, i forgot to mention that i was literally studying while all this happened, which pissed me off even more. \n\nSo essentially she left me at home without my phone and computer totally disrupting me while was alone studying just cuz i refused to go church. The fact that she tries to force me to  go to church to this extent, just changes my whole perspective on religion, making me hate the concept even more, but she just doesn't understand. Btw i don't have a problem with people believing in God, it's just that I personally don't prefer to get involved in those sort of things. \n\nAm I really the asshole for refusing to go church?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Bit of context. This cousin is known for being a brat. She whines and her parents give her whatever she wants. I'm known as the cousin who brings the peace, is calm, hates confrontation, and overall is welcomed. (Except another time but that's another story)\n\n One day we start playing a game and of course as we are children, we make a mess. We soon lose interest in the game and inform her to help me clean up since she played.\n\n I told others who played to help. My sister helps and the brat, who I'll call janet, stands off to the side with candy.\n\nMe: janet, cousin, its time to clean up. \n\nJanet: I tried to clean up but no one was moving so I stopped\n\nMe: help me clean up\n\nJanet: i already did\n\nMe: no you didn't. The cards are still spread out\n\nRandom Cousin: I won so I dont have to clean up (the game had no end so we created an end and he still didn't win)\n\nJanet: I'm on a candy break *slowly eats cotton candy*\n\n I was just about almost done with creating all the cards in stacks (the cards were the game but there were at least 5 stacks of cards cause we were playing the meme game) and she is almost done eating her candy.\n\nI decide to throw all the cards and they scatter everywhere, under the couch, to another room, etc. I stand up smoothly and dust myself off, slowly saying.\n\nMe: now IM off to my candy break!\n\nI swiftly moved to go outside and sit with my dad. I stayed there until I felt they finally cleaned up and was met with Janet's older sister who I'll call jo \n\nJo:what you did was not cool\n\nMe: I know\n\nI left it at that. Nothing else happened. All was solved and randbows and butterflies until later on when janet started to annoy me.\n\nShed whisper things under her breath when we would call her out for being rude and obnoxious.\n\nJanet: not as rude as throwing all the cards.\n\nI had finally had enough and snapped and yelled at her.\n\nMe: at least I'm not a lazy bitch!!\n\nThis shut her up and unlike other times, she did not fight back. I think she understood that I was really mad since I avoid cursing in front of little kids and shes 4 years younger.\n\nJanet: ....I heard you\n\nMe: yeah you were supposed to.\n\n\n\nI later apologized to her dad and he scolded me saying how family is important and I dont get to choose family and I shouldn't have said that. How  I should respect her and that family is family \n\n He knows shes a brat and can't control her and on separate occasions, bad mouth and belittled my family. \n\nI only apologized because it was morally the right thing to do. Also. This is not the only time she has tried to pull crap to get out of doing something, it's just the only time I've fought back. \n\n\n\n",

We’re generally responsible, tax-paying adults and all that, but every year for St. Patrick’s day we revert to total degenerates. It’s a wild time. \n\nOne of my friends just discovered that she’s pregnant and we’re all pretty thrilled, but some people in the group don’t know yet because it’s so early. I didn’t invite her to the crawl. For one, I didn’t want her to be backed into a corner if people who don’t know she’s pregnant ask why she isn’t drinking and for two, she’s pregnant and it’s a rowdy bar crawl. I just assumed she would have no interest. \n\nShe found out, however, and was pretty upset. She said that she felt left out because of her pregnancy. I never meant to cut her out and we still invite her to everything else we do, even going out to bars at night, but she rarely comes to that anymore so I assumed she just didn’t want to be around alcohol. She told me I was incredibly rude to invite everyone but her, but I assumed that a pregnant woman wouldn’t want to deal with a city full of drunk people and bar crawls. \n\nAITA for not inviting her?",

      "description": " I'm a university student with a part-time job working at a shoe store, which I've had for two years now. It's not a big store - there is one manager and six employees. One of the other employees, Sarah, goes to the same university as me. She's a bit of a loud, gregarious sort of person and a bit of a party girl, while I'm pretty quiet and reserved. I spend a fair bit of time listening to her stories/gossip about going out on weekends, but otherwise we get on fairly well.\n\nThis past Saturday Sarah was scheduled to open the store at 9 a.m. and work to 5 p.m. (close) and then I was initially scheduled to work from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. On Friday, for some reason my manager asked me to start at 9 on Saturday too. It was a long weekend where I am (Family Day), so perhaps he thought it was going to be busier.\n\nI got there around quarter to and started to open the store. Sarah arrived around 9 and was surprised that I was there. She had clearly been out the night before and said that she was pretty hungover. However, after a little while it started to become clear she was more than just hungover - she was still pretty drunk. She was a bit unsteady on her feet (albeit, wearing heels), giggly etc. I'm not great at confrontation, so I mostly just left her at the desk and helped the very few customers we had. She told me it was her friend's birthday and they had all drunk far more than they usually would. It was an annoying morning, because I had to do everything on my own, plus make sure she didn't do anything stupid. Later on, she was clearly not feeling well and I told her she should go home sick and I'd finish the day on my own.\n\nBefore close, my manager stopped in unexpectedly. When he stopped in he asked where Sarah was and caught me offguard. I was still feeling pretty annoyed at her, so I just sort of blurted out that she had a rough hangover and went home sick. He followed up asking if she had been there to open the store on time, and been working. I gave a sort of wishy-washy answer, and I think he could tell I wasn't being completely honest, so he persisted. I ended up telling him that it seemed she was still kind of drunk that morning. He didn't really say anything other than that he'd have to talk to her about it.\n\nI've now found out that he let her go when they met this week. I feel awful that she's now lost a decent paying job, which I know she needed to help pay for schooling. My roommates think I should have just covered for her as a fellow university student. I know it was her own decisions that led to this, but I also think if the scenario was reversed, she would have covered for me, which leaves me feeling a bit like a tattletale of sorts. And from her perspective, I told her she could go home and I would cover for her, then told our manager all about it, she lost her job, and now I'm going to get some of her (better) shifts.\n\nThoughts?",

      "description": "Some background.. \n\nMy husband and I have been together for 9 years, married for one year. He plays World of Warcraft. At the beginning, this wasn't an issue for me - I like games myself. However, with time, it started becoming a problem and the reason for many fights. To be clear, we don't fight often. But when we fight it's more often than not about his gaming. The pattern is always the same: After an argument, he reduces his gaming significantly. Then it gets more and more until we fight again.  \n\nIt often gets to the point where he spends all his free time gaming. By that I mean getting out of bed and play for 1-2 hours before going to work. Then coming home and get back to gaming again. When he works from home he even games during lunch breaks. When he's in one of these phases where he games a lot I often feel like I have to 'force' hime to spend time with me, in the sense that he only does it because I ask and he's afraid saying no will start a fight. \n\nAbout six months ago I started developing a depression. I asked him to spend more time with me, go outside and do stuff, as I thought that would help. Which he did one or two times, but then started gaming a lot again and that was when we stopped doing anything at all during weekends and basically started spending all our free time at home. \n\nI've always been a patient person, almost never raising my voice during fights. But his gaming started making me aggressive. Just seeing him sitting in front of the PC playing WoW made me angry. I could physically feel my anger, like breathing fast and could feel my heart beating. That was very out of character for me. I explained that to him. He suggested we agree on certain \"WoW times\" when he's allowed to game, and that he will only game during these agreed times. I agreed. There was no negotiating, I just accepted his first suggestion about what these \"WoW times\" would be. (Also, this wasn't about gaming in general, he can play on the Playstation as much as he wants. It was really just about WoW where I feel he has no control.)\n\nThis agreement was two months ago. In these two months he played WoW outside of the agreed times three times. I know because he didn't try to hide it. I came home from work and he was gaming. He says there is nothing wrong with it, because it shouldn't bother me if I'm not at home. I say gaming became an issue in our relationship and all I'm asking is that he sticks to the agreement. \nAITA for not wanting him to play WoW even when I'm not at home?",

She doesn’t shower often and doesn’t use deodorant often, to the point when she gets in my car I have to roll down all the windows even if it’s cold outside because it just stinks.\nI’m one of her only friends (she’s rather awkward, not very good at meeting people, and tends to isolate herself) so she puts a lot of pressure in having me hang out with her, but lately I just can’t stand her stench because it gives me a headache, I also feel embarrassed when I’m walking around with her and I can see people walk away from us cause she stinks. Lately I’ve been refusing hugs or simply saying goodbye from a distance because I hate going near her. When I told my other friend this, she said it was an asshole move and I should still hang out with her. My friend has also been subtly commenting that I walk in front of her a lot or I’m always in another aisle, she’s also noticed I haven’t been replying to her requests to hang out lately. I’ve tried to tell her / encourage her subtly to..”clean up” before we leave for the mall or whatever, but she’ll just gargle mouthwash or put her hair in a bun and go.

      "description": "So there is a lot of context to this one, and I mean a lot, but I don't want it to be too personally identifiable, so I'm gonna try to trim the fat.\n\nBasically I had a friend, we will call him (1), I have known (1) for 10 years. about 4 years ago when I bought my home, (1) and I used to have dinner parties at a 3rd friends home who is no longer relevant, but I used to cook. \n\nOnce I got my new home, (1) and I came up with the idea to host dinner parties at my new place. over the years guests came and went. however (1) remained. me and (1) shared many hobbies. golf, and model trains and stuff like that. He invited two other friends, who have been coming to mine for dinner with (1) for 3 years or so. we will call them (2) and (3).\n\n(2) and (3) were (1)'s friends from golf but we had shared interests (3) was very insecure, or at least it looked like that to me. he would lie a lot, war stories, \"jobs\" talking about guns, in a country where guns are illegal and only the military have them. \n\nI was going to talk to (3) when I first met him, and tell him he didn't need to lie around us, we liked him for him, not his stories. but not wanting to damage the guys already fragile ego I left it be. \n\nI thought, what harm, they just make him feel better about himself, that doesn't hurt anyone.  but this guy was full tier Mall Ninja if anyone ever read the original material about the guy wanting 2 Armour plates for his mall security job to stop 50cal's. \n\nJust so everyone knows, everyone chipped in for the dinners I cooked, I wasn't hosting for free, it started from a pizza and beer night, and I noticed the guys complain about bad food while spending 20$ on it, so I offered to cook. 5$ a head and I'd do dinner and either a desert or starter. Soup and pasta kinda deal.\n\n**context over**\n\nSo cut to recently, I find out (3) has been making up shit about me for the last year, negative things, I guess because I made him insecure or something. Like saying my food gave him food poisoning, twisting things I said to make me look bad or himself favorable. Telling my partner and others after an incident that I should have stood up for her, and he would have had he been there (spoilers he was and didn't make a peep).\n\nI didn't think it mattered or was as bad as it was, until i found out. All I wanted was him to admit it, stop doing it and apoligise. he said sorry maybe 100 times but constantly denied doing it, which made me furious as I had texts and such documented and proof. \n\n(1) and (2) basically said they are staying out of it and it wasn't their business. \n\nAt first I removed (3) from being welcome in my home, and after thinking about it canceled the dinner evenings entirely. which effected several other people entirely unrelated to the issue. \n\nWhile (3) was a liar, I could understand his insecurity and motivations, but his actions were still bad and I felt (1) and (2) should acknowledge that rather than just staying out of it.\n\nAfter a time, I gave (1) and (2) and ultimatum. I personally hate Ultimatums, I would tell Me to fuck off on sheer principal.\n\nHowever I had reasoned, that while they still talk to (3) socially, (3) still talks to them, and that it caused several things to happen. \n\n* First, (3) would hear about my life\n* Second (3) would continue to lie about me\n* and Third, that in \"staying out of it\" (1)&amp; (2) were not telling me if and when or the full depth of (3)'s lies in order minimize drama...thus not staying out of it, but in fact taking (3)'s side.\n\nI didn't want to give an ultimatum, but sometimes when the foot is septic you cut the leg off at the knee. I felt (1) and (2) were adults and should at least know what and why they were being convicted of, even if they weren't guilty of any action themselves.\n\nIt wen't down about as well as expected. both saying they wern't going to choose. \n\nRecently, (1) heard about a new dinner party I am hosting with new friends, and I told him, he wasn't welcome and why. Similarly (2) wanted to talk about stuff and I gave him similar sentiment.\n\nFunnily enough, (1) went straight to (3) to complain, and tell him about the ultimatum. (which is fine, it includes the guy and he should know whats going on)\n\nLater (2) came to me, saying I gave (1) the ultimatum to cut (3)&amp;(2) out, asking me what was up. I clarified that again this was a lie, again (3) was lying about me to his favour and (1) confirmed (3) was again lying. (3) claimed to them, it was a misunderstanding, and they once again gave him a free pass. \n\nI have been quite frustrated, angry and short tempered in all of this, I'm not with out fault.\n\nBut am I wrong to give people an ultimatum in this instance? am I wrong to cut them out of my life just because they won't agree with me? am I an asshole because I won't drop the issue and constantly bring it up when anyone related to it talks to me about it?\n\nI know cutting people out of your life because you don't fit, isn't really an asshole thing to do, but what about the ultimatums? \n\n\nTLDR: AITA for giving friends an ultimatum between be and another friend, because that friend continues to act toxic towards me?",

Also, there are also some extra steps to check if the formula works as intended (is there a hidden apostrophe? Is there a double slash between numbers?). So you can't just put it in and get the results.\n\nSo today, I've modified the table to make it easier to use and inform the girl I'm working with that there's a change. To make sure if she doesn't any important steps, I asked her with a serious tone: \"Do you still remember the steps that I've shown you?\". She got annoyed and said: \"It only applying the formulas to the table like always, right? It's easy? There's no need to teach me again\". I got quite irritated and say, \"Okay, then go ahead?\". 5 minutes later, she turned to me and asked that \"There's something wrong with the formulas\".\n\nMe: What's wrong?\n\nHer: The number doesn't change.\n\nMe: Did you use \"text to column\"?\n\nHer: But you didn't tell me about that!\n\nMe: Yes I did. After I shown you the steps to put the formulas, I also reminded you at the end of our talk that you should use \"text to column\" first to make sure everything works correctly.\n\nHer: I don't remember it.\n\nThen I had a serious talk (angry voice) with her about when someone help her by giving instruction, don't act displeased or not willing to listen. She then said:\n\nHer: It's just because of the way you asked me. You sounded like a teacher who tried to ask if the student still remember what he was taught.\n\nShe then made comments about how people working in the same environment should be supportive, not being bossy or hard to others etc...\n\nAm I the asshole in this case?\n",

      "description": "Hello fellow judges,\n\nmy wife and I have a 3 year old son and we live in a small house. Our son (let's call him John) never was that great in sleeping through the night, but we made progress and the normal thing was, that he felt asleep in his own bed in his room and often would crawl in our bed sometime between midnight and 3 AM. Then winter came and we all took turns in being sick, because of that he often was very whiny and my wife would put him in our bed to make it easier for him to fall asleep. Now it's very hard to get him to sleep in his own room again and I guess we gave up too often and now he still often falls asleep in our bed or comes over very early, often so early that I am not even in bed yet (my wife goes to bed a bit earlier). \n\nJohn is a very agile sleeper. Best case he just tosses and turns, worst case is a perfectly executed roundhouse kick in my face. I don't care much about that once I reached my deep sleep phase (except the roundhouse kick), but I don't fall asleep easily. That's why I didn't really care if he came over in the middle in the night. So I started to sleep in our guest room. It's comfy, it's quiet, I can turn on some audio book or just some sleep sounds, can fall asleep easily and sleep through the night.\n\nMy wife falls asleep rather easily and my son tends to have his face close to my wife, so she usually doesn't get the kick of the thousand diapers executed on her. She didn't complain, other than that she would prefer me to be sleeping in the same bed again. She also made the suggestion to put the old baby bed with have back in our sleeping room, so that John can sleep with us in the same room, but not in the same bed. I don't want that, because my goal is to get him to sleep in his own room and that just feels like a step back.\n\nNow AITA for preferring to sleep in the guest room right now? My wife didn't complain, but I just feel a bit like abandoning her.",

I met these older guys (old enough to be my dad) both seemed very nice and I had decent &amp; non creepy conversation. I was pretty drunk so I venture off with one of them to another bar (I let my friends know exactly where I was and when I should be back by). At said bar he asks me if I want anything and I say water. I was already pretty drunk and just did not need anything else to drink. He comes back and “accidentally” orders me another drink. I think it was meant to be a nice gesture, but I was already sauced. I pour the drink out on the floor when he leaves for a moment. He asks me if I poured it out and I lied saying I drank it (he could probably tell I did pour it out, but I lied anyways). We don’t stay for long and I get returned to my friends safely. \n\nI wanna know am I the asshole for pouring the drink out? I didn’t think he drugged it or anything but i just know my limits. I could have just told him I didn’t need it, but in my drunken state I just poured it out on the floor. ",

      "description": "Ok, so this might be a long one, but here goes. Recently, i discovered the profile of a girl i used to know in middle school. Not gonna lie, i used to pick on her some. So, i decided to chat her up. I just told her i was really sorry for what i did and that i was stupid back then. \n\nWe talked some, i mostly asked about how life was and if she had a boyfriend or anything. She said no and i just brought up that we should meet for coffee. Needless to say, she actually said yes. \n\nWe met up, she told me how hurtful what i did was. I apologized again, and she became a little flustered. Her cheeks blushed, so i told her how beautiful she'd become since then. She got even more flustered, so i continued sweet talking her and eventually sat beside her. I told her \"I was just a stupid kid then, but now i'm a man. A big strong man, a man who wants to make it up to you.\" and started rubbing her thigh. She was kind of receptive, she started touching me back. I started escalating a bit and she didn't stop me and i offered to take her home.\n\nWe got back to her house and kind of continued. Long story short, we were intimate that afternoon. Also, she didn't say anything about using protection, so i just did it without. Which made it much more thrilling. \n\nThe act was great, but what happened afterwords was unpleasant to say the least. She tried cuddling with me but i ignored her and started getting dressed. She started asking me all kinds of weird questions, but i told her i wanted this to be a one time thing. She wasn't happy and started screaming at me. She claims i just used her for sex. So i just left.\n\nIt's been a couple days, and she has been ringing my phone off the hook. Leaving crying messages on my voicemail and angry messages. She's been posting horrible things about me being \"An inhumane monster\" all over Facebook. I've been ignoring her. But we've only hooked up once and now she's completely obsessed with me.\n\n\nSo, am i the asshole for completely ignoring this girl?",

      "description": "I'll try to keep this as objective as possible for you to make a solid judgment.\n\nBasically, when I was 13, this girl A received alot of anon hate on social media. \n\nI did not know her personally at this point. One day I was just screwing around, when I saw her reply to a hate question that went something like \"you are lame\". her response was:\n\n\"HAHAHAHA you are lamer, i'm just going to ignore you hater, you are so desperate i know who you are, clearly you've been following me for quite some time huh you're *insert name* aren't you, SUCK ON THAT.\"\n\nI knew for a fact that it wasn't the person she named who sent in the hate. I sent this message to her, WITHOUT anon:\n\n\"ok but can you stop saying \"i know who you are\" in response to anon hate bc when you guess wrong it's rly cringy\"\n\nAfter that, I forgot about it. Fast forward to 2-3 years later, when I was 15. All of a sudden, A started to tell everyone I was the person she hated the most in the entire school, and would post on her insta about how much she hated me. Multiple people would ask me what I did. I did not have any form of interaction with her in these 2-3 years. By this point, I had forgotten what I did, so I just went up to her and basically confronted her.\n\nShe wouldn't give me a straight answer except that it had to do with what I said back then. \n\nI had a friend (B) with me then who happened to be there, and she chimed in and supported A. Take note that she did not know A at all. A was GLEEFUL that B was supporting her, when B was supposed to be my friend, and said something along the lines of \"You should listen to your friend more.\"\n\nThat kinda set me off and I went into a full argument with A about how what I said didn't warrant her going around telling everyone about how she hated me so much especially since it was so long ago. \n\nBut with B, my supposed friend defending A, this argument was quickly lost. Later, I realized as stupid as it was, I was the one who stirred this shit up. So I swallowed my pride and apologized to A, which she accepted. \n\nToday, approximately half a year after the apology, B brought up the whole event again and \"how stupid I was\". I agreed but I commented that it was kind of weird for B to hold a grudge with me for so long for something so small without saying anything, then suddenly bringing it up years later.\n\nB got mad at me, defended A again, and said (proudly) that after she defended A, A was super nice to her (once again, A is known for being rude). She then told me to stop talking about it, and called me stupid a few more times re: how I handled the situation. I got annoyed, but didn't say anything.\n\nI found it weird that B was and is completely on A's side. Am I the asshole in this case for getting annoyed at B for taking A's side? Was I the asshole for thinking it was petty of A to tell everyone how much she hated me over such a small matter, so long after it happened? I'm super confused right now. \n",

I mean I kinda also think some religions are crazy, but I don’t judge the people who believe in them.   I don’t know if it’s the same thing or not.  Maybe it’s just like his version of religion and I should butt out.   I’m don’t know what I should do.  \n",

      "description": "This story starts over two years ago, when my uni friends and I decided to make a Discord server to play games together. Players in this story are me, 'Ron', 'James', and 'Mike' (fake names for privacy). \n\nWe created this server whilst sitting in the kitchen of the flat of Ron and Mike. We're computer scientists, so we all have laptops, but as Ron's is closest we use his to create the server. Ron doesn't know much about Discord so he gives me, James and Mike administrator permissions. We do all the setting up and the server is simple, but functional.\n\nAs time goes on, we start adding friends that we knew from before, and the server grows somewhat. We start queueing in games in medium to large stacks more frequently, and on one of these nights we make friends with a teammate and I invite them to the server. This becomes the norm and as the months pass I recruit nearly every player I've had a positive experience with. The server grows dramatically and starts to shape into a community. People make friends, invite their own, and form interpersonal connections.\n\nDue to this growth, there becomes a necessity for the admins to take more responsibility and moderate where before there had been nothing to worry about. There became a need for more features on the server. Until now it had been extremely barebones, one voice channel and one text channel. I had experience with Discord, so I frequently suggested changes that I believed were positive. Categorised text channels, multiple voice channels, a set of rules displayed prominently. This is where the disagreements began. \n\nRon and I had different philosophies surrounding the way the server should be handled. He believed that less moderation was better. He was against the idea of having rules in the first place, but ceded when James sided with me and said that they would be necessary. He wouldn't allow more than two or three rules, and they had to be personally vetted by him. I wanted to implement roles to organise the server, but he would only allow one for the admins and one for the bots. See, as his had been the account to create the server, he had the 'owner' priveledges. This meant that he could overrule everything, and gave him the leverage to veto any decisions made. Despite this server being an undertaking that we made together, he maintained that his word was law and any changes that weren't explicitly run through him would be quickly reversed. \n\nAs the server grew, I spent more of my time interacting with the community. I organised events, games nights, movie nights and meetups. I also tried my best to make myself available for support, talking to any individuals that approached me looking for advice or simply for someone to listen, and directing them to resources that could help them further. Between this and the fact that I was the primary route by which people joined the server, the community began to see me as a spiritual leader. I was active as often as I was able, whilst Ron was rarely around, and as all of the admins were listed as one role it was understandable why people would conclude that I was in charge. \n\nRon, Mike, James, two other friends, and I move in together for our second year of university. The server is still active and still growing, experiencing a plethora of shifts throughout the year. I won't get bogged down with the details, but will touch on the ones most important to the story. Early on in the year, there is an idea to have a secondary moderator role, and this is agreed upon by all. Three mods are recruited, and everything proceeds as normal until a week later, when Rob removes both the moderator role and the administrator role. He claims that moderation was never needed in the first place, and that this will be a better solution. None of the admins were notified or consulted before this happened.\n\nOne day later, Rob has created an admin role again and given Mike and James back their titles. I've still yet to be given a role, but I don't say anything. It isn't until James asks Rob another day later that my position is returned. Around this point, I introduce my closest friend to the server and, after visiting the house we live in, she begins to date Mike. I also become close friends with Maya, who is James' long-term partner. \n\nPartway through this second year, there are a number of notable instances where the community had asked for something to be provided, and Rob had stopped it from happening. In some cases, I would voice what people were asking to Rob and Rob would either tell me no or that it was unnecessary to begin with. In other cases, I would make the change and Rob would go back and delete what I had done. This happened so frequently that many of the core members of the server approached me and told me that, were I to leave, they would happily follow. Every time this happened, I responded with a definite 'no', saying that Rob was in charge and I was happy with the way things were. \n\nThe second year ends, and over the summer, the server goes through a small lull. I was unable to perform my usual role due to internet issues and being employed, so the server responsibilities fell to the other admins. To their credit, partway through July they did indeed increase community engagement and spent more time playing together with the members of the server. Even Rob, who until now had only appeared a handful of times, started showing up more often. Around this time, Ron and James also create an NSFW channel and start posting copious amounts of rule34 and rendered porn. As we did not have roles, however, this was not an opt-in channel. I had to manually go through the server and restrict users who were underage from being able to access the channel using an override. Despite a number of users voicing their discomfort at this channel, Rob decided that it was funny so it stayed.\n\nThen, one day near the end of July, as I left work and checked Discord on my phone, I received a barrage of notifications. At my work, I had no access to Discord, and so I returned to find dozens of messages waiting for me. Whilst I had been away, a new role had been created, titled \"furry trash\". One user had been given this role, and they were highlighted in red and in a separate category in the sidebar. When I checked the role's permissions, I found out that they weren't able to interact with the server in any way. They couldn't message in text channels or speak in voice channels. The messages I had received were from people confused and asking what this was about, and whether I had been aware of it. I immediately messaged Rob and said that this was over the line and that it needed to go. Thankfully, he did remove the role from that user and I then deleted it altogether. \n\nSadly, the damage from this had already been done. One of the very first members to join the server, a pillar of the community, had left the server and messaged me their reasoning in private. They felt that they did not associate with the direction that the server was heading in and no longer felt comfortable there. They had felt this way for a while, but this incident had been the last straw. I was distraught, and asked them if there was any way for this to go forward without losing them. We talked about how we felt regarding the server, and came to realise that we both had very similar views. So we decided to try creating a server of our own, to see if what we envisioned could work.\n\nOver the next two days, we worked on making a server with our goals in mind. There were a robust set of rules, user-controlled customisation using the \"Reaction Role\" bot, proper categorisation and a dedicated support channel. A support channel was one of the attempted changes I made to the first server after numerous requests, but that Rob deleted. On the new server, we felt that it was an extremely important inclusion. \n\nWhilst testing out these features, we invited a couple of our friends from the original server to help. One of these friends was Maya. I forgot to mention to her that this was not common knowledge yet, and so she accidentally mentioned to James that I had created a second server. Upon finding this out, Rob removed me from the original server and James began removing users whom he felt were \"inactive\". This all happened while I was at work, so when I returned at the end of the day I had panicked messages from members of the server asking what was going on. I had disappeared and other people were being removed from the server one by one. \n\nI messaged a friend of mine, 'Tim', who was still on the first server and asked him to send everyone who was disappearing or still on the server invite links to the second server.  My first concern was in making sure no-one disappeared for good, as not everyone was on the friends list of another user. As it turns out, a half dozen to a dozen people were lost during this transition and deletion.\n\nDuring this all, Rob had blocked me and I had received an angry message from Mike asking me why I had done this. Tim and I were good friends, but Tim had known Mike for years before we had ever met, so I asked Tim to help mediate the discussion between us. He collected James, Mike, and me into a call and we talked about what had happened. A compromise was reached, of me being given access to the original server as a standard user and of James and Mike gaining administrator roles on the second server. Rob wanted no part of the second server. The friend who co-founded the second server with me, Tim, and one other friend also became administrators on the second server. \n\nMuch of the community was confused by what was going on during this phase, but soon the dust settled and things were back to normal. However, almost everyone was using the second server. The only ones regularly using the first server were Rob, James and Mik",

      "description": "Let me start from the beginning. I met a girl that I considered a friend at one time. She decided to become my friend because she thought I was funny at first. As our relationship became stronger, she told me she was depressed, however I believed she wasn’t. She always said it and always told me constantly, to the point where it was only for attention. As a good friend, I payed attention to her and try to give her emotional support. I tried to establish a relationship with her once or twice, but it didn’t work. Along the way, I would tell her my thoughts on improving myself, but she would claim that I was acting selfish, when I was simply pointing out that I would have to start hanging out with her and her friends less due to me starting to lift at the gym and telling her that I needed to start caring about myself over everyone else first. A lot of this ended with her threatening to kill herself and telling me we couldn’t be friends if this happened. And it continued. However, she snapped at me because she and her boyfriend were acting extra flirty when I was around. She claims she didn’t do it on purpose, but she always acted extra intimate around him while I was near. Small flirting and kissing would turn into asking for sex from one another. When I asked them to stop as politely as I could, she started getting all pissy with me and asked me if I was jealous. I wasn’t, due to me being in another relationship and still retaining friendship. And I told her such, but she wouldn’t talk to me until about an hour later. She confronted me about this, and I told her that I thought it was annoying and that I was not jealous. She kept pushing until she started with the excuses again. I called her out on the bullshit and she said she was never talking to me again due to me wanting to care about myself first over others. I told her that I was simply doing what I had to do and then she blocked me on all social media, deleted my phone number, and hasn’t talked to me in a week. Am I the asshole In this situation?",

      "description": "So a few years ago I was visiting my parents from university (where, admittedly, I’d gone soft and was quite offended by a lot of things). We were about to watch a movie and my dad went to the kitchen to get some snacks. He brought back some liquorice candies that are somewhat shaped like humans and asked if I wanted a “nigger baby”. \n\nNaturally I was quite shocked by a white guy using a historically brutal word in such a casual way, so I said something along the lines of, “Good god, could you please not use that word?” \n\nMy parents found this really amusing and explained that this is the name they called the candies when they were children and it wasn’t a big deal. I tried to explain my point, but they laughed it off and kept calling the candies by the name they prefer. \n\nOver the years they still refer to the candies by that term and I’ve taken to ignoring them since they just want a rise out of me, but recently I had a great idea. I’ve spent a lot of time around Aussies and have become really desensitized to the word “cunt”. (We’re North American so this is the holy grail of curse words.) \n\nSo when I was visiting my parents this time and my dad asked me if I wanted some n-word babies I said, “Yeah, I’d like some of those tasty cunts.” \n\nMy stepmom’s jaw dropped and my dad quickly admonished me, saying he didn’t raise his daughter to use that language. I said it was just a word, hoping they’d notice the parallels to their use of a word I don’t like, but man were they rattled. We watched a movie and I tried to make awkward small-talk before bed without much luck. \n\nEverything is normal now and it hasn’t been brought up again, but now I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for using a word I know my parents hate to prove a point?

P was awful. he touched me, sexually harassed and at one point grabbed my ass, would stalk me and control me, and lots of other things. i stopped being his friend and had the confidence to get out of the friendship when i started dating my current boyfriend who we'll call S (M17). when i stopped being P's friend he got extremely upset (he also harassed us and tried to manipulate us into sex). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nonto the next person, i'm sorry i'm not sure how to word this whole situation. there are two parts. my friend A (19M) was my online friend for about 6 years or so. when i started dating S i did start to fall out of contact with him, not just because of my relationship but because i was trying to become more social with people irl. A and i got in a big fight starting when i was drunk and mentioned i was thinking about killing myself. he contacted P asking for my mom's info to let my mom know what was happening, and instead of being mad at A i was mad at P for giving away my information. A knew all the things that P has done, but decided to stop being friends with me and go to P's side. i'm not sure if P manipulated him into becoming his friend, but that doesn't matter. A is known for using hard drugs. my boyfriend threatened to turn him into the police (even after i said not to) due to this because of all the times he has upset me. when i mentioned that i was trying to stop him to do that A got mad at me because i wasn't trying \"hard enough\" to protect him. long story short, i was told i'm a manipulative snake who cares about no one but myself for deciding to no longer be friends with A (i sent him a message telling him we should break off the friendship, to which he responded saying how i'm manipulative)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'm honestly really confused with this situation and how i'm being called the manipulative asshole and a snake. P is saying i was worse than he ever was and that i'm awful and i'm honestly really confused??? i'll update and try and get more info\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: stopped being someone's friend and ex friend left me for abusive ex friend. idk how to summarize this ",

During the summer, they can kind of get smelly due to heat, but mostly they’re just an eyesore. I don’t have a problem with it, but my parents want to leave a note asking the neighbours to kindly move the bins into their garage/backyard/away from our porch. My mom especially is a really neat person, and the smell and sight of them just really bugs her. They’re wondering if a note would come off as passive aggressive, or a petty thing to do since it isn’t a HUGE deal. They definitely do not want to offend the neighbours and the garbage cans are technically not on our property. \n\n\n\n",

Sorry not sorry, that’s the rule, we win that round again, then they scratch on the break. Ball in hand again, we shoot around, they were gonna win but they bank the 8 ball across the table without calling a pocket, we insist that a shot like that needs to be called (I wouldn’t have cared honestly if the shot was obviously meant for that pocket, but there was a lot of bouncing around rails, i’m gonna need you to call that.) so he fouled on the 8 ball, that’s a loss. Then he gets mad calls us ass holes and says he’s not playing for beer anymore but he’ll still play with us if we stop being sticklers about the rules. Are we the ass holes for treating it like a professional game of pool when we’re just shooting around at a hole in the wall bar?

      "description": "I was playing basketball today at my local rec center and we had just divided up teams. There we 10 players, enough for a 5v5 game. There were also a few young women in the other side from us as we organized who were shooting the ball. Now normally once the game starts the other people shooting around move off to the other courts but today all the courts are full. These two gals did not move. We played a 20 minute game of basketball with 2 moving picks on one end.  Wouldn't even move off the court while we were down that end, instead standing and shooting their ball at the free throw line or Snapchatting or talking on the phone while play went on around them.\n\nHere's where my question comes in. I felt this was super rude and disrespectful of us and the rules of the gym. These rules are posted on the wall, no half court is to be played when  there are 10 or more participants. No one else wanted to ask these ladies to move off our court so I decided to go have a chat with the staff about to rule enforcement. The gentleman I spoke to dealt with the situation and we moved on with the game but the girls said things to us and made hand gestures as they went to do something else. Am I the asshole for making them move?\n",

      "title": "AITA for being a loser and not going to ikea with my wife?",
      "description": "I’ll try to be brief and objective but that’s likely not possible. Also, apologies for the clickbaity title. And before I continue, I want to make it clear that I do love my wife and truly believe she is a great, beautiful, &amp; wonderful person, which only adds on the internal guilt I have about all this. \n\n\nMy wife and I have been married for 1.5 years now. We did a quick courthouse marriage because we moved to Europe (from the US) suddenly after she got accepted for a masters program in her field, and free tuition was too tempting to refuse. It was also her dream to do this since before we met, so I understood this was inevitable. I was very apprehensive because I’m terrified of leaving my comfort zone of family, friends, &amp; a good job...plus I don’t speak the language here but have been (lazily) studying to get better. \n\n\nAnyways, fast forward a year and a half, and we’re still making it work here. However, there’s an underlying animosity simmering between us that is occasionally released in the form of verbal fights and tantrums on both sides. She is doing well at school and easily making friends which I am incredibly proud of, especially considering she had difficulty with making friends in the states and was generally unhappy there. However, I am now ironically the unhappy one with no friends. Probably doesn’t help that I work from home. I am “friends” with all of her friends that we meet up with and I feel like they’re all good people who enjoy my company when I’m with them, but I can’t help feel like an outsider with not much in common. I have no drive to socialize or maintain good personal health &amp; hygiene (no regular haircuts, no doctor visits since the move, etc), and every outing with friends feels like a chore. My everyday routine is to feed our cats and clean their litter box, work, sometimes go to the gym, work more, vacuum/laundry/dishes, then watch Netflix while my brain turns off. Everyday I feel more and more like a loser and it is seriously depressing me. My wife notices when I’m feeling down and tries to reassure me that everything will be fine, but that somehow just depresses me further. She constantly wants to renovate and add/replace our furniture, which usually sparks an argument since I see no point in investing so much money when we’re planning to leave the country in a year or two. But I am a pushover so we usually make up by buying all the furniture anyways. Normally this would be fine since I understand her arguments that we need to make the home OUR home, and she does try to find affordable items when possible, but we only have one income between us so our budget is tight. \n\n\nMy wife gets upset easily but also forgives and moves on quickly. I’m almost the opposite, where most things aren’t upsetting but when I get mad, these emotions linger until I can get some time and space to myself and calm down. Our last argument was about going to ikea to grab some more items that were missing from our cabinet, among other things. She asked if we can go tomorrow, so I sigh and begrudgingly say ok but that I have a lot of work to finish. But my response upsets her because in her mind, she shouldn’t have to force me to do things like this that are meant for us. I agree, but she argues that this reminds her of all the other things that I’m lazy about and have given up on. I get mad and yell back that I have all this work to do and that I already said I’ll go. But deep down, I feel like she’s right and im just being overly defensive because I don’t see the point in doing much of anything these days. Like I mentioned, doing anything outside of my routine feels like a huge chore, but I hate feeling so lazy and useless. \n\n\nWriting all of this makes me realize that I am the asshole and am being unfair to her. Part of me feels so guilty about bringing her down when she’s been doing so well here. Part of me is resentful for even being here just to basically fund her European college experience while getting no appreciation for it, and for her not understanding how tough of a time I’m having here when she also had a similarly tough time when we were together in the states. Most of me just feels like a loser for regressing in life and being away from family. \n\n\nSo...foregone conclusion aside, AITA?\nAnd if so, is there any advice to help change my mindset so I can quit being one?",

      "description": "I work in a restaurant and recently we had a few people leave the kitchen and a few from the front. Now our owner, who also acts as manager and chef, is working a station on the line and still maintaining the kitchen prep and business while me and the one other cook left work our regular jobs and pick up the slack. We're also in a city where cooks are few and far between and the few interviews we've had don't show up to their first day. Seriously, like 5 people in a row. \n\nThing is, I hate my job and have for almost a solid year, but I stayed because the money is decent and I didn't have another job to go to. However, that just changed. My fiancee got a full time job and I just lined up another position somewhere with better hours that's generally a better fit for me. My job now feels toxic for me, my coworkers are mean and mock each other for fun, the work is stressful, long hours mean that I don't see my fiancee as much as I'd like and I'm always tired because I never get enough sleep.\n\nHowever, my chef is a good guy. He's a bit of a dick sometimes and he doesn't show me the kind of respect I feel I deserve, but he isn't an asshole and if I leave I might actually be the final nail in his restaurants coffin if he can't find people within a week of my leaving. He doesn't deserve to have his business destroyed is what I mean. Not to mention, I'm actually really close with the few of my coworkers that aren't jerks so leaving will completely ruin work for them, pumping up stress and generally ensuring nobody has a good time.\n\nI know that what's best for me is leaving and you have to look out for number 1, I just feel like such an asshole doing it right now. The timing couldn't be worse.\n\nSo am I the asshole for leaving during the most stressful time of the year both in season and situation to do what's better for me in the long run?",

      "description": "Sorry if this is a bit mundane. I feel like context is important even if it is just drama.\nToday, I was trying to make pasta for myself for dinner. I called my roommate over to clean a pot that he'd left dirty. Here's vaguely how the exchange went:\n\nMe: Hey, can you clean this pot you used?\n\nHim: But there's food left in it, and I'm saving it for later.\n\n(There wasn't even an eighth of a box of Mac and cheese in the pot, not enough to even justify reheating.)\n\nMe: You left it in the fridge uncovered. It's just going to get gross, please come clean it \n\nAfter some back and forth, he finally got to cleaning it, whining the whole time. I asked if I could get to the sink for like 10 seconds. He'd been complaining about having to actually clean up after himself the whole time, and I was pretty fed up at this point.\n\nHim: Why didn't you wait until you were done to make me come in here and clean this up? You're just getting in my way now.\n\nMe, annoyed at this point: Please. Just shut the fuck up.\n\nHim: Fine, I know you don't want me here anyways, I'm going to leave tomorrow. I'm not going to pay rent and I'm going to move my stuff out tomorrow. I'm going to kill myself, I'm going to leave and jump off the bridge into the river\n\nHe does this whenever something doesn't go his way, no matter how small. This is not an exaggeration.\n\nMe: Either do it, or shut the fuck up. Quit fucking scrounging for sympathy, it's not going to work on me. Fuck off.\n\nI then went to my room. Now, the issue I'm running into, is my friends who watched this exchange are pissed at me, because I 'told someone to kill themselves.' He does this literally every time he's told no, or I ask to be left alone, and I feel like I finally stood up to his threats, and I was met with harsh disapproval from my friends. Am I in the wrong here?",

Not extremely but enough to frown upon porn. She will have sex with me but she frowns upon prostitution and things like that.\n\nRecently one of my older videos reached the front page of a top porn site and revealed my face for a solid 15 seconds as part of a comp. Someone on facebook has messaged me about it, \"Are you cheating on (my gf)\".\n\nI blocked them immediately but now im worried and am thinking about telling my gf before this person possibly tells her.

      "description": "Using a throwaway because I’m not ready to share these feelings with anyone who knows me. \n\nA little background, I started dating my wife in high school and we have been together for 15 years and married for 7. My wife is the most beautiful, caring, kind hearted, and affectionate woman I have ever met.\n\nAbout 10 years ago she was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis, an Irritable Bowel Disease similar to Chrons Disease, except that it is isolated to the colon. After years of failed medications, we made the decision about a year ago to opt for surgery. \n\nSurgery entailed removing her entire colon (large intestine), creating a stoma, and attaching an ileostomy bag. With the surgery my wife is now symptom free and happier than I have ever seen her. \n\nThere is a follow up surgery called J-Pouch surgery, where they remove the stoma, create a sudo-colon by stretching the small intestine, and reattaching it to the anus. Our plan is too get this surgery, however, it affects the ability to get pregnant and we also want to start a family. So our plan with the surgeon was to have our kids, and then go for this surgery afterwards. \n\nThis is where the problem comes in. My wife’s biggest fear going into all of this was that I would no longer find her attractive. If I am being completely honest, I had a slight fear of this too, but to me her health was priority 1 and I didn’t want to see her suffer with her disease anymore. To me she was (and still is) the most beautiful woman in the world and nothing would change that. \n\nPost surgery, I am having a hard time being intimate with her. I do not find her stoma repulsive but it does make me uncomfortable, and things like going down on her (which I used to love) are unpleasant for me now. \n\nI’m worried that if I share my feelings with her, I will break her heart and strain our marriage, but I’m also not sure how long I can fake intimacy. Everything about our life and relationship post surgery has been exponentially better, minus our intimacy. \n\nAm I the asshole for no longer finding my wife sexually attractive and hiding those feelings from her?",

      "description": "My mother was with my stepdad for a long time. He physically and emotionally abused us, and sexually abused my sister before he finally got caught, arrested, and sent to prison, all while she stood by with her fingers in her ears because she “loves” him and refused to see the bad in him. I don’t think they’ve officially gotten divorced but they’ve since been separated and estranged. Since then she’s been dating. And they all look a lot like my ex stepdad, strangely enough. She goes through them pretty quickly, sees them for a couple months then on to the next dude. Well now she told me she’s been with this dude for 5 months so I looked him up. And of course the guy has a criminal history. Aggravated burglary, criminal damage, criminal trespassing, and domestic violence. Plus the dude doesn’t seem to know where his seat belt is since he has 3 separate seatbelt charges in as many years. So I told her and she got pissed, asking me if i didn’t trust her to pick a decent guy. Well no, I don’t, considering I was abused from the age of 3 to my early 20s while she stood by and allowed it to happen. I told her if she didn’t stop lying to herself about the men she’s dating, then I didn’t want to continue our relationship anymore. She’s always asking me to let the kids stay for a week or two over the summer and I just don’t trust her to take care of them, especially since I know how attached she gets to her men. If one of those guys touched my children while they were under her supervision I don’t think I could forgive myself. Anyway she basically called me a bitch and that I needed to stay out of her business. \n\nSo AITA for running a background search on her boyfriend?",

      "title": "AITA for singing the n-word in a song, accidentally pissing off my black roommate?",
      "description": "Hey guys please bear with me because this is my first Reddit post.\n\nI was a student who had just moved onto campus and was in the process of meeting my 5 other roommates for the first time. The first week living with them went fine and we seemed to get along well enough. However, during the second week we were chilling in the living room and someone decided to play music on the speaker that I had brought. I was looking at my phone, not really paying attention to the song, and started absentmindedly repeating the lyrics. I didn't know the song that was playing and accidentally repeat a part of the song that had the n word in it.\n\nI hadn't realize that I had said it until one of my roommates told me, \"Whoa, I'm not sure you can say that\". I should also mention that I'm asian and not black. Idiotic me thought that this would be a good opportunity to spark an interesting debate, so I said back to him, \"I didn't really mean it in a derogatory way. I was just singing along to the song. Shouldn't it be ok to sing if you just do it as a part of the music?\". Then my black roommate (let's call him Charlie) chimes in and says, \"But you're not black though so you can't say that!\" I say, \"Yeah but I wasn't trying to offend anyone I-\". He then cut me off again and said, \"But you can't say that because your not black\". The situation had gotten pretty tense, and with all the roommates being in the room chilling I didn't want to make a scene so I stayed quiet.\n\nHalf an hour later when he went back into the room, I followed him in and told him, \"Look I'm sorry for what I said. I don't want to make this awkward between u-\". He cut me off with a quick \"it's fine\" followed along with a scowl. From that point on he gave me the silent treatment for about a week, which made things intensely uncomfortable. Charlie would avoid making eye contact with me, and would sometimes leave the room when I walked into it. He would talk and joke around with the other roommates, but when I joined in he would drop out of that conversation.\n\nAt the end of the week I couldn't take it anymore and when we were alone I told him, \"I didn't mean what I said man. I'm sorry if I offended you. I'm not a racist and I don't want to make things weird between us, especially because we're going to be rooming together for the rest of the year\". He responded with, \"I'm not mad because you said n----, and I know that you're not a racist. I'm mad because you disrespected me when you talked back.\" I asked him if we could start over from the beginning and forget that it ever happened, but he said that he couldn't just forget what I did, and that if he did then he would just be \"bullshitting me\". From that point our relationship has been choppy. He no longer gives me the silent treatment, but we never could really have a conversation either. So I'm wondering...AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I accidentally sang the n-word in a song which pissed off my black roommate, I apologized and he gave me the silent treatment.",

      "description": "Okay, so I’m very close with my father’s side of the family, but not very close with my mother’s. My mother’s cousin is having a baby shower in April, and she really wants me to come. I told her I didn’t want to because I hardly know her, and she was really upset. She’s done this multiple other times when trying to bring me to family gatherings, and I hate being guilt tripped into it just because they’re “family.” I’ve tried to explain that I hardly know these people, and I would really prefer not to be thrown into an event where I’m supposed to know everyone. If I could meet them one at a time, I’d be fine, but she always tries to bring me to full on family gatherings. She won’t listen to me or even show that she understands where I’m coming from, because all she cares about is how “disgusting” I am for not wanting to spend time with her family even though I’ll spend time with my father’s.

      "description": "Alright so here is the back story, \nI always ride my bike to school and it's a nearly 24km ride there so I don't pay full attention the whole ride, Because it snowed that day the roads were kind of slippery. when I tried to take a sharp turn I fell, I was alright because the snow kind of softened my fall but my bikes lamp was totally destroyed. It was pretty dark each morning so I really needed my lamp fixed, I told my dad and the next dat we went to get my lamp fixed. \n\nMe= me ofc\nDad= my dad\nW1= the guy that fixed my bike\nW2= prob the boss there but I am not sure\nMe: dad please don't make a scene (I knew that my dad will say anything that is on his mind at that moment without hesitation).\nDad: alright, I will try. \n\n That was already a bad thing because my dad almost always gives a straight answer. I should also note that I have an e-bike so the lamp itself already around €70 to buy. \n\nI rode my bike into their garage so that W1 could mount the lamp and we enter the store, my dad and I noticed that W1 didn't really know how to mount the lamp because it had to be connected to the engine (not sure if that's what it is called), ofcourse he had some idea on how to mount it but he wasn't sure about it which already kind of ticked my dad off. They didn't tell us anything about the mounting price and if we would mount it at home we would lose our 2 year Guarantee on the bike. \nAfter 44 minutes W1 was done with mounting the lamp and my dad was ready to pay. \n\nW1: alright sir that is €125,- \nDad: excuse me, the lamp was €70 and there is no way that mounting it costs €55\nW1: sir it's €75 an hour on these bikes\nDad(who is pissed that he almost payed 2x the price): hey W2, is this real? €75 an hour? We have been going here for over 20 years, can't we have atleast a bit of a discount? \n\nNote: I think that it's a bit fair to get a discount if you have been buying all your bikes in that shop for 20+ years. My dad also went to an online shop to see how expensive the lamp was there and it was around €20, he googled that before buying so he already knew he was paying way to much. \n\nW2: sorry sir but it is what it is, we are kind of precise on the prices and it doesn't matter if you went here for 20+\nDad: alright so I'm paying €70 for a lamp that I can buy for €20 online and €55 for the mounting that I could've done myself with the help of Google in under 40 minutes, ofcourse I would lose some benefits that I have for my bike but I would save €105.\nW2: I see how it is sir you just want me to give it to you for free. \nMy dad absolutely riddled by this explanation: W-no? I just thought that I would atleast get a bit of a discount because I am paying 6x the amount that I could've spend, im happy to pay 110 for it which is still way more than I should be spending for this stuff. \nW2: that's not gonna happen\nDad: son just grab your bike I will pay 6x the normal amount. \n\nW1 opened the garage door with a tired look in his whole posture and I waited for about 6-8 minutes outside before I went back inside to get my still angry dad to stop talking to these people and go home. \n\n\n\nConclusion: I think that my dad is more in the wrong here even if he had been going to that store for 20+ years, it'd love to hear what you guys think tho.

      "description": "As college students, me and my group of friends were trying to set up a kickback in our large-ish room. Most of us had never gotten drunk with each other and wanted to do it with people we were good friends with. Just a few buds, ready to see what we are all like buzzed. However, one of my 3 roommates just said this the day after we all talked about having a kickback: \"Is it okay that I invited some (5) of my friends to the kickback?\" Of course we said yes to him, because he said \"invited\", but now we will end up having almost 15 people in a single room where we can sit 8-10 people and that's a bit much, so now we're considering making his friends come for a kickback a day later than our original kickback.\n\nNow, is that a dick move for us to do? The kickback is supposed to be tomorrow night, so is this too late to change the date?We never gave him permission to invite these friends, he asked if it was okay that he already had, and that we don't actually know ANY of these people. All of us are really insistent on the idea of only getting drunk around people we are comfortable friends with. This ends up violating this tendency that we haven't really discussed with him as well as not giving us a genuine chance to consider inviting them or not. Is it unfair of us to believe that we have the right to say that only those that all of us know are invited? Keep in mind all of the people in our friend group have NEVER seen or talked to a single one of these five people, whereas every other person is a good friend of everyone else in the group. I feel like these issues are very important and justifiably so but I would like to hear an outside perspective on this issue as I may be looking at it from an extremely biased view. Thanks for all of the help.  ",

My boyfriend and I have broken up at least ten times throughout the course of our relationship so he’s been in and out for about a year. Today was the final straw though. He’s always been mentally, verbally and physically abusive - but only when he drinks excessively - and I’ve taken him back numerous times with empty promises of “changing” and “never drinking liquor again”. He’s honestly the devil when he drinks and I’m literally terrified of him. He told me today, in a fit of anger, that he hated me, wanted me to die, would send a hit man to kill me and my family and also threatened my car (amongst other kind of useless things in comparison). It’s about -20 right now, we’re in Canada, his phone is dead and he has nowhere to go. I feel horrible cause he’s paid his share of rent and technically has every right to be here but I double checked all the locks, locked my own room and am just here crying silently in the dark on my bed thinking about everything. I know this was the right thing to do and this might be labelled a shit post but I have a crazy big heart and I feel like a total asshole right now. \n\nSide note: I did go running after him and poured my heart out and all he did was shout at me, vehemently deny what he said/did and didn’t even chase after me when I walked away from him (my place was less than a block away). \n\nWtf am I supposed to do and can someone please tell me I made the right decision cause I’m all sorts of conflicted right now and I would never call the cops on him cause he has a criminal record and he’s on probation but I really love him, his family, and know liquor for some reason just turns him into a person he really isn’t... he’s completely amazing otherwise though and we never fight if he doesn’t drink but gahhhh I just feel so lost and alone and I can’t really talk to my family about it cause we broke up on Christmas for a very similar reason and they all hated on me when I took him back last time.

I would call us acquaintances with some mutual friends until I hung out with her. \n\nI was meeting with a friend at his place and she was there. We had a nice, long and good conversation. No small talk. I thought at this point that she was really cool. I gave her my number, and we texted a little back &amp; forth but I’m not a big texter so I wouldn’t reply 99% of the time. She’d still message me a lot but I never minded. I’m pretty cool with that kind of stuff. \n\nSo, skip forward a week or two and we’re talking after class and I make a comment saying that I haven’t bought enough the textbook yet because I can’t afford it. I’m going to wait till I get paid. \n\nShe goes, I kid you not, “I’d be willing to buy it.” “Seriously? I can’t ask you to do that. No way,” and she just goes, “that okay, I really like you.” “I like you, too. I’m glad we’re talking now.” “No, I really like you. I think I even be in love with you.”\n\nI go “That’s funny?” and she’s like, “No seriously. Ever since we hung out that day and you told me about your parents and family I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you.” I’m such an asshole so I go, “Do you fall in love with everyone that casually tells you about their family problems?” She’s like, “No, but I felt we were really getting to know each other.” I said, “No. You felt wrong. You know next to anything about me - to say you’re in love is just completely ridiculous and insane. We’ve hung out one time, so it kinda feels like someone is playing a joke on me.” At this point she’s really embarrassed and she says something along the lines of me being an asshole and I go, “And you didn’t realize this before? Looks like you definitely don’t know me enough to say you’re in love with me.”\n\nI haven’t seen her since but a mutual friend said she was crying about it and really upset so I feel sort of shitty about being so rude. I fucked up, but to be fair she really sprung that out of nowhere. I knew she might be interested, potentially, but I had no clue she’d spring this on me. ",

      "description": "Ive been friends with benefits with this guy for over a year. Lately we’ve been a little more romantic. This semester hes living with his parents and going to school out there. This weekend I drove almost 2 hours to see him and meet his parents. They were very kind and I had a great time.\n\nI talk about my parents (mostly my mom) quite a bit and once he’s playfully mentioned he’d like to meet her. The thing is I’m not ready for that. The guy I’m talking to use to be addicted to heavy drugs. He cut out *most* of it but he still uses an opioid because he’s struggling with coming off completely. He’s so smart and a sweetheart but you know a “junkie” when\nyou see one. I hate that word and describing him that way but i couldn’t think of another word. My parents aren’t strict but they would question my judgement if I brought him home. As their daughter they expect more from me like not being associated with people who do drugs and have a long history of trouble.\n\nOn the outside you see an addict but on the inside is an intelligent and ambitious man who I’m growing very fond of. He hasn’t brought up meeting my parents but I feel like the conversation might happen soon. Am I the asshole for not wanting him to meet my parents while he’s actively using?",

      "description": "So I'm a student at university and I share a closet-sized room with another person. I always study in my room, because the library isn't close to where I live. This has worked out because my roommate usually goes to the library to study. I also have pretty severe ADHD, so I have tried going to the library but I can't get much done because of the people walking by/talking, and just the sound of typing makes it hard to focus. I can't listen to music while I'm trying to do homework/study because it's distracting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I had an exam in one of my classes. I had gotten up to study, anticipating that my roommate wouldn't be in the room because she usually leaves by the time I wake up. She did not leave, which was fine. When I got out of the shower she was on the phone. After making coffee and doing other morning things, I sat down at my desk to start studying. My roommate was still on the phone. I didn't say anything. For about forty-five minutes she was on the same call arguing with her boyfriend about something. I didn't say anything the entire time she was on this call, and it was pretty obvious that I was trying to study. She hangs up, and then makes another call. She was on this call for about 15 minutes, and my time before the exam was dwindling so I asked if she could wait until I had left to talk on the phone. She got incredibly pissed, and said \"You know, I'm never in the room, why don't you go to the library to study for once\", in an incredibly nasty tone. It's also worth noting that I'm pretty sick right now, so the only time I've left the room in the past few days was to go to class, otherwise I would've trekked my ass to the library before class, despite the decrease in productivity. My roommate knows this. She came back fifteen minutes later with her friend and they started smoking out of the window and talking. I didn't say anything. I did what I could, but at that point, it was too late to go anywhere to study and I had to leave to go to class. I've previously considered places where I could go, but I'm significantly more productive when I'm in my room, and there aren't many places on campus that aren't high traffic and quiet. My roommate has invited me to go to the library on numerous occasions and I've said every time that I appreciate the offer, but I can't get anything done there. She also knows that I have ADHD. This is also the first time I've ever asked her to be quiet/respect the fact that I'm studying in the room since we moved in in August. I'm going to buy noise-canceling headphones so this doesn't occur in the future, but I'm pretty upset that she responded the way she did, and I'm unsure if I'm wrong to be upset. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for asking her to talk on the phone later? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Roommate on phone for about an hour while I'm studying, after waiting for her to hang up, I finally asked her if she could wait till I left to talk on the phone, and she got angry that I asked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hey all,\nmy boyfriend and I talked about this yesterday. According to him I get attached and emotional over things that are slightly stupid. So here's the story.\n\nI met my boyfriend in April last year. We talked for a while on a dating site and very soon the fact that he was one of the leaders of a project came up. The sole purpose of this project was documenting the Second World War (and all things related to that). I thought it was kind of cool and signed myself up. I study German language and I am quite proficient in French aswell. Soon my work started to extend from translating signs, to also translating the user interface, looking up family trees, translating biographies and making articles of the foreign (English) news. Of all these things I enjoyed translating biographies the most, so that is what I ended up doing.\n\nI always made it a point to write long biographies. The writing process was right in my alley and I put a lot of time and heart into each biography that I translated. The other chefs were all content with my work. I got a lot of compliments. I am on the spectrum and previously I got a lot of negative attention for being so weird. Even had previous boyfriends tell me I was useless. So I enjoyed the attention that came with it.\n\nThere were also issues within this organisation: The guy I was officially working for did and does not put any effort into staying in touch with me. He once sent me a short mail thanking me after a few months working on everything. But that's it. My boyfriend also thinks I am too critical of the site. I don't want to reveal too much information, but I was highly critical of one feature. It's adjusted now. So it's fixed. \nAnother problem occurred yesterday. My boyfriend went to a staff meeting of this organisation and the topic of my biographies: they're too long. They take up too much attention on the page, which is wrong (the attention should go to the medals). They had to be made shorter.\n\nI am okay with that, but what happened after that broke my heart. I'm put in the CC of an email and see that my boyfriend is talking with another guy about my biographies. He complains that one of the guys I added to the site (and who was a rather important nazi) has a biography that's just way too long. I see my boyfriend reply that he edited it. He just cut off a huge part of the text without debating it with me.\nWhen I tell him that that hurt me and that he should have involved me in editing my texts. He replies that they're technically seen not my texts (true) and that I am just an 'individual' in the system. No one is special. Everyone can be replaced within the system.\n\nThat hurt. Maybe it's weird to get emotionally attached to a text, but I probably am. I told him that I want to quit that project a few hours later, because I no longer felt I was a good match with the organisation.\n\nSo tell me: Am I The Asshole for quitting said project? Did I put my own interests over the general good? ",

The main one is our personal and families financial backgrounds. She grew up in an middle-upper middle class suburb, parents both had stable jobs and money really wasn’t ever a worry. She wasn’t/isn’t the spoiled type, but she pretty much got most things that she wanted. \n\nI came from a lower income area, my dad was in and out of work due to injuries, and all my life my family was just scraping by with 6 kids. We were on food stamps multiple times and had many years where Christmas and birthdays were just not a thing due to not having enough money for them. \n\nWe’re both currently working and going to college full time and recently my s/o has been complaining a lot about how she needed to dip into her (quite substantial) savings to pay for her various expenses (rent mostly) as well as concerts and short trips that she takes, all the while claiming that she hates it because she’s “poor” now. I try my best to be sympathetic, but honestly I have very little sympathy about the situation. She never knew what it was like to grow up actually poor, and I take offense to it that she would claim such a thing when she really has no idea what it’s like. \n\nJust curious to see if I’m in the wrong here for thinking the way I do about this situation.

      "title": "AITA for using the unfiltered utterances of my narcissistic and now dementia-ridden mother to understand and heal my own CTPSD?",
      "description": "As the title says my mother who is nearly 80 is suffering from dementia. I feel deeply sorry for the physical limitations and the mental pain this is causing her. I try to spend more time with my parents now than I used to in the past, but I live 1000 miles away and have two jobs so this is not easy and limited to 3 weeks or so per year. \n\nI did not move so far away because I really wanted to, I needed the distance. In my early 20s, I was severely depressed, suffered from unhealthy compulsions and had occasional suicidal thoughts. I self-isolated from friends and other family and did not really have any close friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to leave home when I was 18, 20 and 23, but each time my parents managed to convince me that I'd be better off with a postgraduate degree, so financial needs meant I could not afford to move out. \n\nAfter leaving home and seeking therapy I gradually learned to understand that my desire for independence was natural and my (unconsciously self imposed) low contact with my parents (1-2 calls per month, 2 visits per year) were a natural response. \n\nI learned to understand that my upbringing had in many ways not been normal. Some examples: \n\n\\* My mother had tried to have a child for over 10 years before me. I was born on her birthday in her early 40s and she has often treated me as if she owned me.\n\n\\* I understand now that my mother was what is considered 'emotionally immature', She could not objectively say something like 'I don't like this sort of music, but you have to decide for yourself' Instead she would forbid me from listening to anything but classical music and force me to learn a classical string instrument.\n\n\\* She would also not allow me to play with a game boy or action figures, instead I had an old fashioned doll, was wearing leather shoes and a corduroy suit to school when everyone was wearing trainers, jeans and t-shirt. I was bullied in school a lot and the only thing she'd do (despite teacher's advice to be a bit more relaxed towards me) was to try and get the bullies expelled (without success).  \n\n\\* Some of her behaviours are also often described as emotional incest. For example, whenever my dad was on a business trip or came home an hour late from work she would be in my room and say things like \"You'll have to help me if something happened to dad.\"\n\nGoing through therapy and starting to accuse someone is a very difficult time. I honestly only ever wanted to understand why I have the demons that I carefully try to rid myself off. I've never been accusing my parents directly. I also believe that they dedicated a lot of time and effort to my upbringing. They (especially my mother) simply never understood the generation of children I grew up with and how it differed to their own childhood which was in post-WWII Germany. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter leaving home, my mother reacted very badly. She refused to speak to me or if she did, she would only talk to her dog (eg. \"This man has left us \\[dog's name\\]\") or my dad (\"It would seem that your son actually is happy to be in my company, but he refuses to stay after this week\"). \n\nI largely ignored this, gained confidence and independence. I got married, though my mother refuses to accept my wife. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the last 3 years, my mother has suffered from increasingly progressive dementia. I am genuinely sorry to see this woman suffer like this. But I don't feel I can do much to help her. I try to assist my father with advice, though it's very hard to do so as he has very much his own mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently discussed my mother with a friend of mine, whose mother also suffers from dementia. He is someone I've confided in for many years and who knows a lot about the demons I have fought in my past. What I never shared with him is the doubt that I often had. Was I fair in my judgement on how my mother's behaviour had affected me? \n\nI mentioned to him that the only good that has come from my mother's illness, is that she is far less filtered. Especially in the first few years, she sometimes said things like \"Knowing you'd only play with dolls/play the violin\" always made me so happy. \"I sometimes wondered if I enforced it too much, but you never put up any resistance\". \n\nTo me, this has been very helpful, absolving myself from the doubts that lingered. Yet my friend seemed very uneasy when I mentioned this. He has since ignored me, stopped to respond to messages and has excused himself from a regular social we both attend and then told some of the others that I had acted in a terrible way towards my mother. The only thing I've done is to talk to my mother who apparently had forgotten that long ago she had stopped talking to me and who also seemed to now express how emotions had influenced her decisions is the past rather than trying to back them up with 'logic'. \n\nSo I do wonder AITA for using what my mother says to discover more about my childhood and the traumas some of which still haunt me? And if so how (other than not talking to my mother at all) would I even be able to avoid doing so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She talked about how we exploit farm animals, I talked about the food chain and human evolution, yadda yadda... and eventually I agreed that humans could live solely on plants if we wanted to, and that it would be better for both our health and the environment if we did.\n\nShe then asked me \"So why aren't you vegan?\" and I responded with \"Because I don't want my friends and family to see me as a self-righteous snob.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly she was quite offended, so I told her all about the things PETA do, about about all the times I've been called 'murderer' for eating meat, about the sort of things that vegans have a reputation for (you all know what I'm talking about) and I also told her the story of that bride who wanted a vegan-only wedding which made the rounds on Reddit not long ago. My explaining failed to un-offend her, so I said that I would consider being vegan if veganism ever fixed its public image, and went to catch my train.\n\nThis was last weekend and I still feel like I was a bit too blunt with my answer...

Some lady walks her two huskies from across the place and around a partition over towards our table. When I saw her coming, I got up and stood in the way of her dogs and waited for her to catch up to them because they were on bungie leashes and could get quite far in front of her. \n\nThinking she got the message that I didn't want her dogs near my smaller dog, I then sat back down but she still let her dogs come up to mine. My friend picked my dog up off the floor and held her away from the strange dogs. After we explicitly asked her to remove her dogs from our table, she did. Then she came back without the dogs and asked why we didn't want the dogs to greet. We were pretty nice and gave rather bland answers about how we came to a brewery to eat and drink, not to a dog park for social hour. Not liking that answer, she specifically asked if my dog was aggressive, like that's the only plausible reason dogs wouldn't want to play with  her dogs. She was all offended and acted like we were assholes. What's going on here?",

      "description": "I've been driving a co worker to work for the past 6 months, he pays me 20$ every two weeks to drive him. We both started working at this place at the exact same time, and in that time I have bought myself a motorcycle and a car. He's done nothing for himself but smoke a ton of weed and call in sick 2-3 times a week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I work 40+ hours a week and I am a full time student, so I have classes 4 days a week, not to mention the time I spend doing assignments and studying. Needless to say I have VERY little personal time, basically no social life to speak of. I've recently started dating someone who lives 20 minutes away from my house but only a few minutes away from work. So in order to spend time with him I'm often having to go there before work, then drive back to my city to pick up this co worker and drive another 25 minutes back to work. Or I'll be planning my day around it so I end up not having social time, and back in the city to be able to drive him in. So it's been pretty inconvenient, but I've been managing. However, often times I'll plan my day around being in the city to drive this person, only to find out hes not going to work. I'll be driving back to the city to pick this co worker and receive a text from them saying they aren't going to work. Great, so now I've wasted gas and my time for nothing. Anyways this is really starting to annoy me so I told him this and that he needs to start looking for a new ride, he knew this was never a permanent arrangement anyways as I'll be riding my motorcycle as soon as it warms up. He's done nothing to find a new ride, and I planned on giving him a dead line of 2 weeks before I stop driving him. But yet again I planned my day around driving this guy in and he called in again. So would I be the asshole if I just tell him that I can't drive him anymore and not give him the courtesy of the 2 weeks notice? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I drive in a co worker and he often calls in sick to work which is inconveniencing me greatly. I want to just tell him to fuck off and not give him the 2 weeks notice I had originally planned to let him find a new ride. ",

      "description": "I'll go ahead and give some background before I start. I'm in my sophomore year of college and am in a pretty big organization on campus that organizes fun campus-wide events for students. The organization is pretty exclusive and is capped at 80 members at any time, and we're all in one big group chat that is very active. One of my friends in the organization loves to say controversial things in the group chat, but never maliciously. For example, the other day some people were discussing whether or not honey mustard is a good condiment (very riveting I know, but we're young and have fun talking about whatever), and my friend chimed in saying that it wasn't. Nothing malicious at all, just going against the grain to stir up some conversation, and that's the kind of comments that he makes a lot. \n\nSo that brings us to today. Today he posted another similar comment and I sent a meme in the chat with his name tagged. Some of you might have seen this meme before, but to summarize it's a picture of Funky Kong from the Donkey Kong games riding a surfboard throwing up a piece sign with a speech bubble that says \"ok retard.\" As soon as I sent it I thought about how I probably shouldn't have sent it to such a large group of people seeing as how some people might find it offensive. I'm the type of person that likes to avoid controversy and felt bad about sending it right after the deed was done. A few minutes later someone comments \"hey. we don't use the r word as an insult\" and I knew something like that was coming. To avoid any type of argument I responded by saying \"My apologies\" and that was the end of it.\n\nNow I'll go into my relationship with the word in question. The friend that this meme was intended for and I are the type of friends that are comfortable calling each other this word. We don't see the word as offensive when we say it to each other seeing as how when we were growing up, the word wasn't seen as much as offensive as it is now. I know it's a mean word and I have never used the word to demean someone who is mentally handicapped because I have handicapped family, and would be extremely upset to hear them called that. I grew up saying this word as a more harsh form of the word stupid and it's still a word that I use with some of my friends when we're together. Any time I think about inserting the word into one of my sentences, I make sure that the people around me are okay with it before I do. It seems that my want to use a meme in a relevant way clouded my judgement and I sent it before thinking of how it would be perceived by others. Now, I believe that I shouldn't have sent the meme, but I'm not sorry for saying that word to my friend. I know that he and I are not offended by it. I understand that I shouldn't have said it in a public forum and I regret sending it, but in general, I'm not sorry for my vocabulary. AITA?",

      "description": "Hi everyone, I live in a cul de sac neighborhood where everyone knows each other, except for one creepy weird man (who I have long suspected is a child molester) who lives alone with his small daughter (7ish years old).\n\nThis guy doesn’t talk to anyone. Never comes to any of our neighborhood get-togethers. Never smiles and waves or makes small y’all when he mows the lawn or takes out the trash.\n\nHe also is just really freaking creepy - he’s got a “rape stare” type look and he has what I believe is a swastika tattoo on his neck. It’s not a normal swastika but a variation, I suspect, so as to not attract too much attention.\n\nWhenever I have tried to say hi to his daughter. He grabs her and tries to hide her. It’s really freaking scary that he tries to hide his daughters from me and from our other neighbors.\n\nI called CPS on him because I’m truly afraid he might be abusing and/or molesting his daughter because of how creepy, reserved and protective he is.\n\nThis morning, I saw police at his house. Four cop cars intact. I’m not sure what happened but I doubt they would send that many cops cars or something.\n\nIf he’s not abusing or molesting his daughter then I would at least bet he has guns and Nazi memorabilia and other scary shit that maybe they found.\n\nAnother neighbor went around trying to figure out who might have reported them. I obviously denied it because I don’t want this crazy frickin guy coming after me and trying to kill me for “being nosy” or other shit that crazy child molesters often try to rationalize.\n\nBut that neighbor did say “I know the guy seems weird but seriously fuck whoever reported him. It’s not cool.”\n\nWhich got me thinking - am I the asshole for trying to look out for this young girl? And trying to get her out of a potentially abusive scenario?",

      "description": "Context: \nBoyfriend an I live together.\nI pay for the following:\nNetflix \nThe additional DVD plan \nAmazon Prime \n3 additional prime channels, one of them being HBO which is an extra $15 a month, because HE wanted it for Game of Thrones.\n\nI’ve had the DVD plan for 6 months. He and I both really enjoy horror films, and we watched horror movies all throughout October. After that, whenever I told him the next movie coming in was a horror film, he’d tell me straight up that he doesn’t want to watch it and that he’s sick of horror movies and needed a break. I was like, alright, sure. So, cause of that we didn’t watch any horror films for a month. I asked him specifically what movies we should get from his preferred genres. After this I really wanted to watch more horror films, especially since the ones I want aren’t able to be streamed on anything else that I have, so I can only see them through this plan. He again throws a hissy fit and says he doesn’t want to watch them, and that he wants a say in what kind of horror films we get since he doesn’t like the ones I choose sometimes. So, I went and filtered out all of the ones he didn’t have interest in. \n\nMid December my cat ended up damaging the return slip(s) and I wasn’t able to get to the post office for a while. 2 months without the DVD plan (while still paying for it tho). Finally, problem is fixed and I tell him the next movie is coming and he does his usual “I don’t wanna watch that.” \n\nI got fed up and told him “too bad, it’s coming and I’m going to watch it with or without you.” He told me he doesn’t think it’s fair that I get most of the control when it comes to which movies come in, and he barely has a say. I’m super annoyed so I say, “Yeah, and you know what? I pay for it, so you no longer have a say. I’m tired of filtering out movies I wanna see cause you’re being petty.” He looked upset and said “wow, okay then... if you wanna be an asshole about it.” \n\nKeep in mind whenever it’s his turn to pick a movie, I always have to suck it up and watch his damn super hero movies or western comedies or whatever he chooses, and I never complain about it. I also don’t know why he needs access to the DVD plan when he can choose something off of the other streams that we have (including Hulu that his friend let’s us use). \n\nTL:DR: I told my bf he no longer has a say in what movies we receive in a plan that I pay for, and he thinks I’m being an asshole ",

      "description": "My parents divorced back when I was 14. My mom told me she was cheated on by my dad and it was a final straw, so they ended it. I wasn't too affected by this at first. I just remember being hurt about the lack of time he spent with us. He would rarely see us once every two months, and the one time he had Christmas with us he only stayed for a few hours and then left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother eventually took him to court. She was fully supporting a household of four, and one of us (my older brother) was going through college.  She wanted more child support, so she fought for it.  We were winning by a landslide until she let him win. Apparently he was a blabbering fool, crying about how much he loved his kids but how he doesn't have the money to support us. Feeling bad, he gave him the case and he was able to pay less child support than before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom then on he was required to see us more. Though, that didn't stop him from canceling once every two months, maybe more. We (my sister and I) were now required to spend every other weekend with him, doing whatever he wanted. It kinda hurt that he only started seeing us after the court case, but whatever. It didn't matter. He would scream and yell, then text us how much he loves us the next day. Now I'm heading to university soon.  We have him paying half of everything my mom is paying. Recently, however, my mom was asked to sign off this asset that was said to be split 50/50 between them. When she asked for half of whatever he was getting from it, he sent her a nasty voicemail threatening to take away my florida prepaid college. (for those who don't know, florida prepaid is a system that allows parents to start paying off their child's college early. So, once they hit college, a good amount of their fees are paid off. According to our estimates, it would've cut my expenses by half, maybe even more. This excludes all scholarships as well.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n​\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was basically hearing my own father say, \"I would rather get this extra 5000 than see my daughter go to college\". I'm not a super smart girl. I'm not getting a free ride. I NEED that prepaid. To top it all off, my mother was in a phone call with him and he admitted to LYING in court and ACTING like he was crying in order to get to pay less child support. He was laughing, saying he just played her the whole time. My mother is a fucking saint.  She hates her boss, yet she works as many hours as she can just to give us the life we have, and to hear that my dad, who didn't even TRY to see us before the court old him to, faked cried just to fool my mother into giving in... well, I'm completely done with him. When graduation happens, I want to cut ties. I don't want this man in my life anymore. Maybe I'm overdramatic. As much as I said, he HAS been a good father in other ways. Idk. I know a HS graduation is a lot for some parents - it's a one time thing. But, I don't know if I can invite him anymore.",

      "description": "Obligatory apology for formatting, I’m on mobile. \n\nSo for context my sister is passionate about politics, she leans left, and always advocates for me to get involved in voting and stuff like that. She keeps up with a lot of political news, and all that jazz. I lean left, but am not as involved in politics as her. Every time I go to see her she brings something up out of nowhere, trying to lecture me about the current events. I’m at the point where I just nod and smile.\n\nNow I guess we’ve gotten to the point where the ok sign means white power to some people. I know it’s a 4chan prank to I just tend to ignore that and continue to harmlessly prank my friends by drawing their innocent eyes to my goin area and making an okay symbol. I know it’s immature but it still gets a laugh (or a slight puff of air from the nose) out of all parties involved every now and again. \n\nRecently I went to my girlfriends sorority formal with her, and she had me take lots of pictures with her, as is tradition. So I thought I’d slip the prank sign in one or two photos. The night ended, I posted the photos of us and at least one with the hand sign in it. Later on my sister texted me. The following part of the conversation. I’ll be me, she’ll be S\n\nS: White power symbol on your Facebook?????\n\nMe(already knowing where this convo is going): you should look up 4chan (in retrospect that was mean of me)\n\nS: I’m aware of it\n\nMe: Then you should know they fabricated the rumor that the universally accepted 👌 does not in fact have ties with white power, no matter how many people want to get offended by it\n\nS: So you did it knowing what the perception of it is? Because perception is reality. You don’t get to define what something means to everyone. \n\nMe: Do you think I’m racist?\n\nS: It is no longer “universally accepted”.  Bottom line. \nS: Do you think you’re *not* a racist?\n\nMe: That’s not what I asked, do you think I’m racist?\n\nS: That’s my answer. You don’t discuss anything with me. It’s “too political”. \n\nAt this point I went on a rant about how thinking I’m racist because of this photo is ridiculous. And told her where I stand politically, leaning more left, but I think the two party system is awful. I brought up how she randomly injects our interactions with politics every time I see here, and said how I don’t like it. I feel like it was a bit harsh but I was annoyed she made these baseless accusations because of a photo of the ok sign, which now in her mind means white power. So am I the asshole for her accusing me of being racist for doing a simple hand jester, which to most means nothing but okay?  ",

One such fight was when she wouldn't move her car so I could go meet a friend (the minivan I drive was blocked in by her car), and I had asked her to do so over an hour in advance, and she proceeded to cry saying she was upset and didn't feel like she could. During the end of the argument I did yell \"I feel like I've never had a real sister, you've never been a sister to me.\" because that was the truth, and I have felt like that for a long time. I've always been ignored by her and basically grew up on my own while my other two sister excluded me from everything. I wont lie I did have anger issues and say some shitty things as a kid but grew out of it over time. I don't feel bad for saying that, because i feel like she needed to hear it. For more context this has been a recurring problem over time where she won't listen to me when I politely ask for simple tasks, and still to this day pretty much ignores me.

      "description": "To start off I have a bad relationship my Dad and have had near zero contact with him since he and my Mom divorced when i was in my early teens(im 34 now) But he has been in a bad way for a couple of years and my sister was given guardianship over him. A couple of weeks ago, my Aunts started coming out of the woodwork second guessing my Sister's decisions on how my Dad should be taken care of, to the point of coming to where he is being treated and demanding certain treatment plans be tried or even trying to have him removed from his care facility. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite how I feel about him, I told my sister that I would help her if she needed, because I don't like that they are trying to team up on her and pressure her to give up guardianship so they can do what they want(my sister thinks its because they want his money but cant confirm that) I told her basically \"Don't give it up unless you are 100% done with the whole situation, because once you do, they will cut you out of any decision making process and they will never give the guardianship back.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of days ago I start getting phone calls from my Aunts and Uncles telling me that I am out of line and I haven't had anything to do with him for so long, who am I to jump in now and start telling my Sister what i think should be done and that I should stay out of it. My response to the whole situation was if you didn't want guardianship when my Dad needed help in the first place, you don't need it now now that it's convenient for you to want it. It doesn't matter how I feel about my  Dad, i'm not going to let my Sister be taken advantage of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "First of all, I’d admit that thanks to having an autoimmune that went undiagnosed for 27 years, I know I can be paranoid about catching diseases because I’ve always gotten the worst case scenarios health-wise. \n\nMy parents recently became very mistrustful of medical information after they discovered the anti-vaxx movement. I caught rubella &amp; mumps even after I got the MMR vaccine (compromised immune systems ftw!), so I seem to confirm their conspiracy theories. They don’t seem to believe I have an autoimmune either, so explaining that doesn’t work. \n\nAnyway, they just went on a big family trip to New Zealand, where they just had a measles outbreak. My mom is still there, while my dad just returned yesterday and we met up for dinner. I asked him which cities he traveled to because I only found out about the measles outbreak a few hours earlier when I mentioned to my friend I was having dinner with my dad, and she told me to be careful since I’m due to give birth in 7 days (high risk pregnancy so I know the exact date since they have to induce labour). \n\nWhen I asked my dad, he admitted they toured around the South island too, where the measles outbreak is. I asked him which cities specifically and he couldn’t remember. I asked him to check and he got annoyed and snapped, “Nowadays, they have medication if you get sick! It’s no big deal!”\n\nI told him newborns can die from measles, but he just ignored me. \n\nMy dad’s answer is making me even more paranoid and right now, I’m considering banning every family member who visited New Zealand from meeting me for 14 days after they’ve returned. That means they won’t be allowed to see the baby for at least a week after she’s born. \n\nWould that be an asshole move? She'll be my parents' first granddaughter, the first great-granddaughter from my dad's side and the first great-grandchild from my mom's side, so everyone wants to be there at her birth. \n",

      "description": "Me and my fiancé have been trying for a child for a year and a half. Thing is, I’ve never wanted to give birth. The thought alone terrifies me. I really want a child at some point but I want to adopt, I’ve always knew that since I was a child. My fiancé, on the other hand, says he wants to raise his own child that looks like me and him. So I agreed but every month when I get my period, I feel relieved. \n\nA year ago I got severe bleeding that continued for two weeks. According to my gynaecologist, that was a potential pregnancy that my body rejected. She said that it’s different than miscarriage because there has been no pregnancy. It’s confusing but I didn’t ask more questions because the truth is, I didn’t care. I was actually relieved. My fiancé always talks about how he can’t wait for me to get pregnant but I hate the idea. I’ve told him I feel the same way but I’m lying. I told him a few times I wanted to adopt a child at some point and he refused. I myself am adopted and I don’t think my parents don’t love me, quite the contrary - they’ve always given me everything to the point I became quite spoiled. They are the most amazing parents I know so I don’t know how my fiancé can claim that adopted children aren’t ‘your own’ and ‘you can’t love them the same way as if they were your own’.\n\nSince we’ve been trying for a child for quite some time and it’s not happening, he suggested we both go to a doctor and see what’s wrong. AITA for secretly hoping something really is wrong so I don’t have to bear a child? I feel so guilty and selfish but I did agree to carry his child. I just hope I’m physically unable to do it. ",

      "description": "Actually it's more AWTAs for not wanting him there. My girlfriend and I are getting married in May. We're having a very small, informal wedding. It's maybe one step up from eloping. We'll have personal friends, my Mom, Dad, brother, brother's fiance, my girlfriend's Mom, and her sister. Altogether, less than 15 people, all of whom we're close to. Hell, even the officiating minister is a personal friend! My girlfriend's mom and sister live across the country, as do some of the friends of ours that are coming. So, it's a big deal that they'll be here and we want it to be a good day of good memories, surrounded by those we love. All well and good. \n\nExcept her sister has this boyfriend. And she claims that oh, he's the one, he's super special. Just like all the others. The girl goes through boyfriends and fiances like most people go through underwear. We've never met this guy, never even talked to him on the phone. I've never even see a picture of him. I'm sure he's fine, despite the fact that he's also an addict. But we don't want someone we don't know at what is essentially a small family gathering with a wedding thrown in. Now, if we were having a big to-do with like 100 people in a rented public space, fine, whatever, she can bring the past 5 boyfriends plus the next prospective one if she likes. But, we don't think it's appropriate for this and we don't want him here. \n\nWhen my gf told her sister this, she was extremely upset and didn't talk to her for a while. Her sister and her don't always get along and have a shaky relationship at best, so this was not unforeseen, but still upsetting for my gf. But now, the sister has entered phase two of her plan to strong-arm the boyfriend into our wedding. She decided she and her boyfriend are going to make a trip of it, with our wedding being just one stop on their cross country journey. So, the guy is gonna be here, in town. And not at our wedding. This seems VERY shitty to me that the sister is putting both us AND her boyfriend in this situation, but, that's what she's doing. It is, quite obviously, a new tactic to making us let him come. I mean how cruel must we be to make him sit in his hotel room all by himself while we're having our wedding? Is what she is going for with this. \n\nFrankly, I'm impressed that she'd plan a road-trip out of spite. But, she did. Are we the assholes for not wanting him there in the first place and even more so for standing firm and letting the  boyfriend chill at his hotel while the sister attends our wedding?",

Your not a manager yet so I wouldn't go round saying it just yet. It's not even manager that you're getting it's supervisor isn't it.   Stop being a arrogant prick\".

      "description": "Friday a guy messaged my best friend (the father of my “godson”)  on facebook and let him know that he had sex twice with his “babymama” around the time the child was conceived and that she ignored him when he asked for a dna test. When we looked at pictures of the guy it was obvious that he was the father of the child. And it began to make sense why I was apparently the only one who could never see a resemblance between the child and my best friend despite everyone else trying to force it (especially the kid’s mother). My best friend thanked him, dropped off all the child’s things that was at his house to her, picked the child up from his mother, and did an at home paternity test. We’re waiting on the results but it’s extremely clear that he isn’t the father. The child just turned two last month. The child’s mother believes that nothing should change. She thinks that my best friend should still raise him and that I should still remain the godfather. My best friend told her that he can’t continue to raise him because he’s scared of not treating him the best he can do how upset he is with her. He was the one who chose me to be the godfather. \n\nWould I be the asshole for not continuing to be there for the child as his godfather? And is my best friend the asshole for not continuing to raise another man’s child?",

      "description": "I work for a large company in an office of around 600-700 people. Being a very corporate environment, most of the time politics is a sort of off-limits topic. Over the last 2-3 months my desk mates who sit near me (two women in their late 20s) have started to listen to a feminist podcast. They talk about this podcast all day it feels like, and routinely try to drag me into their conversations looking for a male perspective. \n\nOriginally I was okay with this, but the more they discussed this podcast and the longer they listened, the more hostile the discussions became. To the point where I felt like I was basically being used as a stand in for men in general, so they could gripe at me and tell me how awful men are. Eventually, after the 10th time being told I just can't understand because of my male privilege, and how men have it so easy, I chose to disengage completely. Over the course of 2-3 weeks I told them repeatedly that I didn't want to talk about that stuff at work anymore and that I feel uncomfortable with it. \n\nDespite this they just didn't let up and continued to make snide remarks about how I wouldn't engage them because of male fragility. Eventually, a line was crossed where they started to interrogate me about my personal life, and one of them looking me up online and discovered I'm gay, and started asking me about being gay and how I probably just don't 'get' the male/female relationship dynamic since I'm gay, and that is why I felt uncomfortable.\n\nAt this point I had enough, and went to HR asking for me seat to be moved. I tried not to explain why but they insisted or else they wouldn't move me, and when I explained why I wanted to move both of the women I had a problem with got written up and disciplined. Now my other coworkers who weren't involved but are also on my team (mostly women also) are treating me like a pariah and telling me how one of them is a single mother and how could I do that to someone trying to support a child on their own.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Should I have just kept ignoring them and not gone to HR?",

      "description": "Hey guys. This is my first post on AITA, and I came here because I can’t figure out if I’m the asshole in my upcoming story.\n\nSo for my 18th birthday, I had plans to go to brunch with my family at an upscale restaurant in a nearby city. These plans were cancelled because my twin brother had a last minute party the night before the brunch was supposed to happen, and he didn’t want to get up for brunch. This was fine, we all figured we would get dinner instead. In comes my mother.\n\nShe lets us all know last minute that she has plans at 6:30, for a church group that she has skipped in the past. Therefore, our dinner would have to be around 4:30 (instead of what I thought would have been 6:00-7:00) and instead of going to the restaurant in the city, we would have to choose somewhere in my hometown. All of this is told to me around 1:00 the day of. I was pissed off, but I didn’t want to tell my mom to change her plans, (the church group is one of the only times she really socializes) so I bit my tongue. \n\nMy mom asked me what restaurant I wanted to go, and I just told her to pick whatever she wanted, as I planned the whole brunch meal and it didn’t work out, and I didn’t feel like planning again. I said I wasn’t really happy about having to go earlier, but it was fine, brunch turning into dinner turning into early dinner isn’t that big of a deal.\n\nTHEN, my brother informs us that he has made plans to meet his girlfriend’s family for the first time, and could we push the dinner back a half hour to an hour? I got pissed again, say whatever, you guys do what you want, and leave. \n\nMy mom then comes talk to me again about an hour later, and ask what we’re doing and where I want to go for dinner. I say I don’t care, we don’t have to do anything at all. My brother hearing this, comes back again, and says that his girlfriends family cancelled and now he has invited her to our dinner.\n\nAt this point, I say I would prefer to cancel the dinner altogether. I wasn’t in the mood to spend time with anyone anymore, and it was way too complicated. I thought we should have made a plan and stuck with it, but everyone else’s business and last minute plans (that didn’t have to happen) got in way. In the end, my mom got pissed off at me, my brother and dad said nothing. \n\nSo Reddit, should I have just sucked it up and gone along with whatever ended up happening? Should I have agreed to continue to try to plan this dinner at my own expense, but for my family’s sake? Am I the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "We were having a casual chat about whatever and it came to answering the door to random people. She said she mostly never answers the door, which i knew immediately as bullshit as she always answers the door. I tell her that I know she always answers, and she thinks for a bit and says she does, and that she was just thinking about how she doest want to answer so she assumed real fast she never did answer. I said “so you lied”.\n“No”\n“you just said you never answered the door, but now you’re saying you almost always do”\n“i had an answer in my head that sounded good enough to me so i gave it to you”\n-skipping a bit-\nHer- “its like answering some free response question on a test, i can give a GREAT answer by thinking about it more and get 6 points, or spend less time on it and have a GOOD answer for like 3 or 4 points or something”\n“Why are you telling me this?”\n“both the answers i gave you were right, the second one was just more right”\n\nNo, your first answer wasn’t right at all. Not going to the door, and almost always going to the door are not the same. I know its really some small issue but I don’t like how she thinks thats just a mistake. I feel like she would lie about things and not owe up to it, say it was just a “mistake”. Am i the asshole for taking this small thing too far? Or am I right?\n ",

      "description": "I am adopted. I've always known &amp; don't recall a time when I didn't. I also never had any real urge to seek out my birth parents. My parents are awesome, my extended family loving. It just never came up. My family was my family &amp; I was cool with that. \n\nFast forward to 2000ish. I'm in college on Long Island and heading into Manhattan for a concert with my girlfriend &amp; a friend via train. We get to Penn Station &amp; as we are walking down the concourse, a woman comes up to me &amp; says:\n\n\"This is going to sound like a weird question, but do you have a summer birthday?\"\n\nYes.\n\n\"Is your birthday in August?\"\n\nYes again (did i drop my wallet, like, WTF).\n\n\"Is your birthday August 7th?\"\n\nYes again. Now we're both freaking out.\n\n\"Wait here, i need to go get someone who might be your father!\"\n\nShe runs off &amp; comes back 30 seconds later with a guy who looks a LOT like i do now.  The questions continue. End result: these two are my birth parents. As teens (14 &amp;15), she got pregnant, had me &amp; put me up for adoption. They broke up &amp; she moved down to Florida. 15 years later, they meet at a funeral in NY &amp; end up getting back together, eventually marrying. While apart, he had married, had another son &amp; divorced. That day, they were on the same train as me and my friends, sitting in seats facing us for an hour. Apparently i looked so much like his other son that she could not let it go without confronting me, &amp; she turned out to be right. Obviously, mind fucking blown.\n\ni have not seen her in person since that day. I occasionally interact with her on FB, but have not really let her into my life. a real relationship is something she would very much like to have. she had been trying to find me for an extremely long time (ads in the paper, career in private investigation). They celebrated my birthday every year. I have no ill will towards her. In fact, I'm quite grateful for her choice, as she could've gone a different route &amp; i would not be typing this today. She is a very kind, caring person who simply made a mistake at a young age.\n\nI've kept my distance for a few reasons. One is respect for my actual parents. their reaction to this situation has always been a bit awkward &amp; i don't want to upset them. I also find the prospect of relaying my entire life story to a whole new \"family\" very daunting.  \n\nI know i could make her LIFE by simply being a part of it.I'll see her comment on FB with allusions to regret &amp; feelings of loss &amp; it makes me feel shitty. i have occasionally reached out on Mother's Day or her birthday, but am not consistent with it b/c I often just feel weird or uncomfortable about it. Sometimes, i feel like i want to engage. i have a half brother I've never met. Still, i can't bring myself to put the wheels in motion. If not for this insane circumstance, I'd've never been in this position.   My emotions have been all over the place for the past 19 years &amp; I'm looking for some outside opinions.\n",

      "description": "A bit of backstory: I live at home still, with my girlfriend, and for a while we have endured listening to my mother saying incredibly racist remarks such as that she would never date Asians, saying Aboriginal Australians should “piss off” to the desert, \n\nAnyway, so just over two weeks ago we were out for a birthday dinner for my younger brother; it was him, my girlfriend, my mother, grandmother and  me. \n\nWe were sitting there, all was going well. Suddenly, out of nowhere, my mother starts talking about how Muslims shouldn’t be able to live here (Australia). My girlfriend gets upset by this, as she is very sensitive on the topic of equality, excuses herself and gets up and steps outside. \n\nI however, remaining at the table decide that I should speak up against her. I said “can you please not make such racist remarks in public please?” She argues that it isn’t racism, and that her points are “all true.” \n\nI tried not to escalate things much further, so I simply said “can it just wait until we get home?” But she kept insisting on trying to convince me it wasn’t racist, and that if my girlfriend has a problem with it, that’s her concern. This annoyed me. I said “don’t imply that I can’t think for myself, this DOES upset me.” \n\nAnyway, I got up and said I’m leaving, and everyone else followed. \n\nWhen we got home, My grandmother swung around and said “Majora46’s girlfriend, don’t you ever leave the table! That was very rude. I don’t appreciate being called a racist.” It’s worth noting that nobody actually called her a racist. \n\nI said “she didn’t do anything wrong,” and my grandmother insisted it was embarrassing that she left, and I said “what’s embarrassing is sitting with people making a bunch of racist remarks in public.” \n\nMy grandmother said to me “don’t you ever come to my house again, don’t ask me for anything ever again,” and I just said “alright fine, I won’t.” \n\nWhen I came back, I apologised to my grandmother, but she continued being hostile, as did my mother. I refused to apologise to the latter, because I don’t feel as if I have done anything wrong to her. She then complained about us (my girlfriend and I) laying around the house not doing anything, but that isn’t true.\n\n\nI started to get worked up at this point. I felt as if I were being attacked for standing up against racism. My girlfriend pulled me back to the room saying I needed some space to relax, but my mother kept coming at me. She said I’m talking to him.” my girlfriend replied “he needs some time to calm down” but my mother started screaming in her face, and things kind of died down a bit after that\n\nSo, AITA? \n",

      "description": "My siblings and I had kind of a traumatic childhood. After the last of our parents died, we stopped speaking much. I have a brother (48) and a sister (43). \n\nMy older brother was always very aloof about how well he was doing. He went to a good college and got a high paying job and for years he made more than me while I was struggling. He is in real estate. When I was looking to buy my first home I asked him for advice and he gave it to me, but then sent me an invoice. I stopped communicating with him on any regular basis at that point. \n\nI got my life together and now am married, expecting a baby, and am financially stable. \n\nI hadn’t heard from either sibling in almost 6 years. I learned my brother had moved to a new country in passing in an email from my sister. \n\nYesterday he called and said he’s gone bankrupt and he needs $65,000 to avoid bankruptcy plus another $23,000 to keep his kids in college. I told him no. My sister is calling now telling me I have to support him because we are family. \n\nI’m doing fine but not so fine that I have tens of thousands of dollars easily accessible. He hasn’t spoken to me in ten years, did not fly in for my wedding, and did not respond to the email I sent to the family letting them know we were expecting. \n\nI can see the reverse of this though that it’s not his kids fault that my relationship with him is strained and maybe I should at least help with their college. It wouldn’t be an easy thing. We’d have to cancel an upcoming vacation, put off getting a second car (our current car is pretty small for a baby) and I wouldn’t be able to take as much time off after the baby is born. \n\nHe is family, bankruptcy is serious, and this would probably be a major bridge burner if I stand firm on it. But also, there’s a long list of people I’d more readily lend money to. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "We're both 22, and I have my own place. She moved in about 6 months ago and she's in grad school so basically has no money. So  We agreed that she could live with me rent/utility free if she'd pack me a lunch everyday for work and she'd make dinner nightly and we'd go out 1-2 days a week for dates. We rotate cleaning, but she prob does more than me in that regard. She's a fucking amazing cook for being 22 like my god, I've never experienced home cooked meals like this before. For lunch she packed me a chicken parm sandwich and veggies which was amazing I love her chicken parm. And for dinner her parents came over so she made my 2 favourite things, roast beef, mashed potatoes and cheesecake for dessert. It was so amazing, my coworkers always are so jealous of my lunches because she makes them like gourmet and dinners too. After dinner tonight with her parents I was helping cleaning up and she looked annoyed and asked me if I felt good treating her like a slave. I was confused and asked her what she means and she got mad and said she's done with cooking and feels like she treats me like a king while all I do is just help out with small tasks like washing up. I just told her that this was our agreement though and she called me a pig and an ass clown (lol) for making her cook daily. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So I graduated last May and have been working full time at this job since September. It’s in a very busy, very under staffed doctors office where the owners act like we are disposable. 6 people have been fired since I started, most over very minor things. We walk on eggshells. I am currently trying very hard to get into graduate school, which is why I took this job in the first place, because It gives me the experience hours that I need (while also allowing me to pay my bills). When I was hired, I told them that I would be interested in staying here until I started school again. While I love my job itself and many of my coworkers, my managers suck and we are extremely overworked and underpaid. \n\nMy sister, my mom, and I have had a rough year in our personal lives. My mom offered to take us on a 2 month long European vacation over the summer. The trip of a lifetime! By this time, I will already have applied to schools so my working this job is not going to be as important for my future as It is now. I am debating whether I should give them notice now, or wait until we’re ready to leave and simply give them 2 weeks notice. \n\nHonestly, my hesitation is because of my coworkers. Summer is our busy season and they will be the ones who have to pick up the slack when I am gone. They will most likely not be able to hire and fully train someone in only 2 weeks. However I am worried that if I give them more notice than that, they will simply tell me to leave, and finding a new job who will take me on knowing I will be gone for 2 months will be difficult. \n\nSo what do you guys think, WIBTA if I only give them 2 weeks notice before my trip?

      "description": "Okay so loooooong story short. Two years ago on December 13 I discovered that my husband had been cheating for 4 years with a total of 8 different women. We have three kids and a life I mostly love and I love him as well so I made the decision to work through it and build a new marriage. We did intensive therapy, he did sex addiction treatment, and we pretty much at this point have worked through this shit to get to what I thought was a very steady place in our relationship. \n\n(I want to take a second to acknowledge that my decision is not the decision many here would make. It's not even a decision I would push other people to make. I always figured if I got cheated on I would walk, but when it came down to it I chose to stay. )\n\nAnyway, today was of course Valentine's day and my body decided to postpone shark week so we were able to be intimate. After sex my husband asked if I would ever cheat on him. This of course snapped me out of my pleasant haze.  I honestly was insulted and probably snapped at him when I answered of course I wouldn't. \n\nWhen pushed for his reason for asking this he mentioned that I have white discharge. Which is completely normal when one is a couple days out from their period. I sent him an article about it and answered his question as calmly as possible. His reasoning is basically that he cheated so he thinks karma is somehow going to cause me to cheat. \n\nI'm very irritated at this point and tell him he's fucking stupid if he really thinks I would cheat. That it's completely unfair for him to distrust me because he fucked up. I'm honestly pretty angry and frankly I feel like this is really fucking unfair. I've never done a single thing to indicate I would cheat. \n\nHis final words on the matter is that sometimes something will trigger him to start being paranoid and that it's nothing I've done. But I'm still pissed. \n\nAm I an asshole for continuing to be angry about this? Should I just try and make it not matter to me?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my mom that she should not take my sister to a trip to Los Angeles?",
      "description": "So this is my first post ever, and english is not my mative language, so sorry in advance. \n\nBackground: Some time ago, my 16 year old sister (S) created a fandom account, after that, she started uploading videos to YouTube and she has done really well, her videos have views and now she has like 23k subs. She likes to go to her idol's events, although the problem with this is that she must travel 4-5 hours each time she goes to an event because we do not live in a city near the capital.\n\nSince she does not work, everything is paid by my mom: tickets to events, bus tickets, meals, hotel, etc; all this with the justification that \"it is not an expense, it is an investment\".\n\nOn the other side, my mom (M) has been a single mom for several years, she takes care of all our expenses (incluiding me, my grandmother and my sister), which is really hard because the situation is not easy. Sometimes she struggles a lot for economical reasons and she limits herself to several things.\n\nA few months ago, S got it into her head the idea that she wanted to make a trip to Argentina (we are from Mexico), she said she wanted to go there and that her idol was going to go on those dates. A couple of months ago S convinced M to take her and at the end of February they made their trip to Argentina for a week. I was happy for S because it was something she wanted for a while and I had never seen S so excited about something. The only detail with this trip is that it came out too expensive.\n\nThis is where the problem starts: A week after they arrived from Argentina, S told M that now she wanted to go to the VidCon in LA this July! I objected because its really not fair for M to have so many unnecessary expenses, since they have just arrived from Argentina and now S wants to travel again. Surely someone is thinking that I am envious or jealous, but it is not like that bc I was also invited to that trip. \n\nI did not stay quiet and talk to M, I told her things like: \"Why are you worrying about unnecessary expenses?\" \"you two just went to Argentina 3 weeks ago\" \"at least demand her to do something, she must earn it\" (S does not make any effort for her things, doesn't attend school as she should, and has even said that she is not going to study for her college admission exam the next year bc \"i will not pass\").\n\nS was there and obviously she got mad at me, but I just feel that she does not care that M gets so much debt that she does not know how to handle the debts. On the other hand, M at the beginning  got upset with me and told me that nobody tells her how to spend her money (although she later got on my side)\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "My family is going on vacation in a few months. My sister+BIL are paying for themselves, my mom offered to pay for me. I thanked her numerous times. Yesterday, my mom sent me flight info. I was at work so I didn't really look at it. My mom texted me:\n  \n&gt; Mom: Did you get my email?  \nMe: About the trip? Yeah  \nMom: And not a single thank you? Jeez. Whatever.  \n  \nShe had sent this info before, and I had already thanked her for then. That's not an excuse, b/c saying thank you is free. I replied something like this:  \n  \n&gt; Me: I didn't look at it too closely, and to be fair, I did thank you before. But I'm sorry, I was at work when I got the email, and by the time I got home, I had already kind of forgotten about it. But thank you.  \n&gt; Her: Your sister and you are ungrateful. Whatever.  \n  \nI asked my sister:  \n  \n&gt; Me: What'd you do?  \nHer: I was home yesterday and used her iPad, logged in and forgot to log out. She called me saying to fix it, how could you do this to me, fix this now, etc. She was hysterical and I hung up. I sent her a screenshot showing her how to logout. But she called me back and called me a bitch, ungrateful, etc.  \n  \nAfter this, I texted my mom back and told her that I appreciate everything, I didn't mean to hurt her feelings, etc. She accepted that but started calling my sister selfish, spoiled, and mean.   \n  \nI said something like \"Maybe she was selfish at the moment, but I don't think she's a selfish person, and she is a nice person. But even nice people can be mean sometimes.\"  \n  \nMy mom replies saying that she wouldn't help her with her iPad, she hung up on her, and my sister needs to respect and help her parents.  \n  \nI reply and say it was wrong to hang up, but she was just frustrated. But she did come back and help you, she just needed to calm down for a minute.    \n  \nMy mom says I always take my sisters side and that my mind is already made up. She says my dad, her, and my BIL are all starting to get fed up with my sister.  \n  \nI said \"It's not fair to speak for BIL. You're being unreasonable, you have to realize that other people have feelings too, and that (sisters) intent wasn't to hurt your feelings, she was just upset at the time, just like you. You called her names, she said mean things to you, nobody is innocent here. If you want to see (niece and nephew) you've got to go through (sister).  \n  \nI kept trying to tell her to view the situation from my sisters POV. Eventually, I got fed up and said something like \"I don't want to talk to you while you're being like this. Please don't text me anymore.\"  \n  \nShe replies saying that she's hopeless, she'll cut contact, she's cancelling the vacation, she's not coming for easter, etc. I said you're not hopeless, stop beating yourself up. But also stop feeling sorry for yourself, you're always seeking validation. You need to love herself for who you are and not for what other people think of you.  \n",

      "description": "Throwaway:\n\nBack story: My mother came into a lot of money when i was around 12 and didn't do anything with it, when i got older myself and my brother told her to invest this money as its doing nothing sitting in a bank account, she bought an apartment, and living/going to college in the same city, she offered me and my girlfriend to rent the place with a third person. We did this and have had 2 house mates, both fine and moved out for their own reasons. I leave to go to another country on my once a year holiday on Monday, and today (Friday) i get a text asking me when i leave. I told her Monday at whatever time from whatever airport, and she sends me this : \n\n\"I've offered the use of the spare room in [neighborhood] to [name] my colleague in [work] for a few nights. are ye ok with it.\"\n\nmy reply:\"When will they be here\" \n\nMother: \"[They] havnt confirmed that [they] will take the offer but next week. he has to finish his dissertation by [date im on holidays]\"\n\nmy reply: \"I mean. if [they] needs it i suppose. But id prefer if you run something like that by me before offering... Im not very comfortable with someone i dont know in my house while im not in the country\"\n\nNormally I wouldn't even have to ask AITA, but here's the context , Im unofficially living here, i have no contract with her, and i get a family rate, i pay 400 a month and my gf pays 400, for an apartment that could easily get 1800 if rented to the public. My mother pays for what are called service fees, 1200 a year, they just keep the buildings painted and tidy and pay for the use of communal bins. Shes not saving me a huge amount of money, i would be paying the same somewhere else, but my place definitely would not be as nice. \n\nI dont mind her friends staying over or people that i know and she knows, and even when she needs to say some times (im in a good location for her for staff/xmas parties or just nights out) But i have no idea who this person is, and not only will i not be in the house, with all my stuff (Xbox, tv high end PC with expensive peripherals - and sentimental stuff  , things from holidays with my girl friend, photos etc just stuff i cant afford to replace for any reason) I wont even be in the same country! \n\nThe thought of someone in my space, with mine and my girlfriends stuff, who i have never met and have no idea what they even look like or act like fills me with anxiety and makes me deeply deeply uncomfortable. \n\nAm i being an ass for not being okay with this considering that she let me rent here for such a low price for how nice the place and area is?\n\nside note: I am planning on increasing the amount i pay after i get my degree and start working after college in just under a year - I dont believe that i am taking advantage of her, but i guess i would like an outside perspective on this?",

      "description": "For context, this happened around 1-2 years ago and we've made up since long ago. But, I've always keep wondering if I was the asshole here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother got caught by my parents with weed. This lead to a big verbal fight between him and my parents for several days. However, my parents (especially mom) were also mad at me because I mostly refused to get involved in \"family matters\". As much as possible, I stayed busy with what I was doing while they argued in the background. When asked to state my opinion on the argument, I basically said it has nothing to do with me and I don't want to get involved. When asked to relay a message to my brother because they were too angry to speak with him, I got really angry (which is extremely rare for me) and flat out refused to act as a \"slave messenger\" between them and told them they should tell him directly if it's so important. This eventually ended with us crying because I was being \"cold\" towards them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I personally believe weed is fine (and occasionally do some now), but my defense is that I don't see any reason why I need to get involved is a shouting match between my family. Don't get me wrong, I love my family, we're great outside of the occasional arguments, but I don't believe I should get involved in a stupid argument.",

Ive been imagining myself as a contract killer and killing men in vivid detail.\n\nMy mom is very christian and has an image of me as a good person and a good son.

She doesnt answer my calls near as much as she did. My father has always hated me too. I feel very alone. \n\nShe told me that she wishes she never knew that about me.

      "description": "So, I am 16 and my cousin is about 12. About a year or so ago we used to play a lot of TF2 and Minecraft together via Discord, but at some point the other things in life got in my way, and I just felt too tired to talk to him in general most of the time. He has much more energy than I do, it seems, and so is much more eager to play together when I'd rather just play Rocket League or Minecraft in single player and relax with some hot cocoa. \n\nHe spammed me a lot at some point, sometimes even called me on my phone, so I ended up setting my Discord status to \"invisible\" so he wouldn't see that I was online. \n\nThis friday he called me again on my way back from the choir, and I thought \"well it won't take a piece out of me to play with him once in three months\" so... we played some TF2 and Minecraft together. I have to say, it was pretty fun for a bit before I started getting a headache. I told him I'd download War Thunder on my desktop and then we can play it sometime. However, I forgot to download the game and just did not feel like talking to him in general.\n\nToday he started spamming me again while I was playing some singleplayer Rocket League, and when I told him that I was too tired right now and that I have a hard school day tomorrow(Actually true) he pretty much went \"who cares\". \n\nI really don't have anything against him, but he is kind of not nice sometimes, I'm trans and he knows it, yet he keeps calling me by the name I don't want to be called by, he is really annoying at times, and I get this is all part of being a 12 year old, but I'd just prefer to play with someone older and a bit more mature.

      "description": "Okay, I really am going to regret this later. \n\nLet me set the stage. I am 17 years old and I have divorced parents. I go one week with mom, one week with dad. I absolutely love my mom. We've had our rough patches, but we're close through and through.\n\nMy dad is okay. He cheated on my mom, causing the divorce. He married his paramour, then they broke up. Things were decent when my dad was single. It was just me, my dog, and my sister.\n\nThen dad got with someone else. Immediately red flags go up. This woman is around 10 years younger, yet she looks older. Let's call her Brittany. Her and her daughter move in a week after I found out my dad was seeing someone else and I find out they got engaged a week later.\n\nBrittany drinks a lot of box wine, leaves her things everywhere, and never cleans. She makes weird ass meals every day that rots in the fridge. She didn't have a job when she moved in, brought in student loans, and vapes with an old, disgusting juul.\n\nShe has strong views on feminism, but on a \"men are pigs and woman rock!\" side. My dad is a POC and she constantly brags to her friends about how she's a white woman who dates outside of her race. She always wears flip-flops and cheap, dirty pajamas and thinks it's quirky.\n\nBrittany has a daughter I will call Kara. Kara is a clumsy 11 year old obsessed with looking older. She steals me and my sister's things so much, my sister (18) stayed with my mom full time shortly after that. Kara gets into my makeup and fucks it all up, steals my clothes and copic markers, and never cleans. \n\nKara is irresponsible and told my dad about how she steals, but he did nothing. She thinks it's okay now. I have anxiety, and the way she stomps everywhere makes me panic. I told her politely to stop, and then Brittany got onto me for it. My dad only pays attention to her and ignores me, so i spend time in my room all day.\n\nThen, to make things worse, my stepfamily and dad decided to get a pitbull. He's a decent dog, but he and my old dog, a small spitz and German shepherd mix, fight constantly because they didn't introduce the dogs slowly. My dad knew fully that dogs barking triggers my anxiety, let alone fighting, but he still got the dog.\n\nMy stepfamily never takes care of it. I was the one taking the dogs out for walks and picking up poop when i was at my dad's house. If I'm not, poop piles up in the loft and the dogs become reckless and fight more without walks. It's really taking a toll on me mentally. \n\nI feel really bad for disliking them, especially because Kara is only 11. What's your take on this?\n\nTl:dr, My dad remarried and it's tearing my life apart.",

      "description": "So before me and my husband got married we were on separate phone plans. I had my own and he was on his mom's with his dad and sister. He never paid his bill, his mom did. His argument before we were married was it saves him money and we're not married yet. I thought that was funny that a 30 something yr old still had his mom pay for his cell phone, but whatever. I told him once we get married he needs to go on my plan. He agreed. \n\nFast forward to about a year later, the day after our wedding. Me, my husband and his mom are sitting and chit chatting. We get on the subject of cell phones and his mom brings up the fact she still is paying for his phone plan. Then tells him that now that me and him are married he should go on my plan. I had the biggest smile on my face. I told him, see even your mom says so. Of course he tries to worm his way out of it. He tells his mom it's ok I can stay on your plan.  \n\nSo now, today I bring it up again. He's still trying to worm his way out of it. He asks why is it so important that I join your plan? I tell him it's because I feel that now that were married, your an adult you shouldnt still have your mom paying for your bills. Again his argument is still why would I switch, I'll have to pay more. Don't you want to save money? \n\nSo AITA or does my husband need to grow up and pay his own phone bill? ",

      "description": "My bf isn't a redditor but we sometimes scroll through this sub together, so if he happens to be reading this... Hi M...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got into a big fight over some chick who he told me was a former casual sex partner. He told me they weren't even friends, they would do things then she would leave right after. He told me she was actually married (she's not anymore) but in the process of leaving her husband so he made sure she completely understood what they were doing wasn't anything serious.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason I know all this is because she had posted on his FB wall a song, and said \"this will forever remind me of you\". So I asked him who she was and he told me what I wrote above. I told him I really don't appreciate her posting stuff like that on his wall if she was just a former casual lay. We talked about her and I told him if she does it again we're going to have problems. I made it pretty obvious I was insecure and uncomfortable about her. He basically laughed at me, told me \"she's all the way in \\[state 1000s of miles away\\], you don't have anything to worry about\" and then even got in a VC in discord and laughed and told our mutual friends \"haha my gf is so jealous\". I decided to just forget about it and turn the other cheek, which I did. I wasn't bothered and we had a good rest of the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat is until literally the next day. Everything was fine but then I remembered something from a few months before. She had actually posted a bunch of monkey emojis (🙊🙉🙈) to him on their friendiversary. I didn't get bothered at all when this happened because he didn't acknowledge her post, and I kind of figured she was just some former casual partner from his past. But realizing it was the same girl who posted the song and comment on his wall, when she KNOWS we're in a relationship (she liked our relationship post and I post things on his wall all the time), and knowing she was just a notch in his belt so she was quite literally remembering and reminiscing on his damn penis, not their \"friendship\", infuriated me. She was being blatantly disrespectful, so I got really mad (at her, not him which I told him this) and told him she's being disrespectful, and I told him \"Unfriend her.\" The reason I TOLD him instead of asking or just talking to him about it is because of how he reacted the previous day when I brought her up. Also, he always tells me if I want something from him or want him to do something, \"TELL me because I can't read your mind\". So that's what I did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first he just said \"Whatever, I removed her. Hope you're happy.\" I told him to stop being an ass after he said this, and he said \"I'm the ass?\" then we both just kind of blew up on each other. He is claiming he could care less about her, but he doesn't like that I'm \"giving him an ultimatum\" by telling him to remove her. I'm feeling really hurt and angry now because of his reaction to removing a girl who apparently means nothing to him, and again the only reason I TOLD him was because I had brought it up the other day she was making me uncomfortable yet he did nothing. Honestly Facebook is cancer and this all feels so childish typing it out, but I do use Facebook for memes and to share things with my bf, and I'd rather not see some girl from his past blatantly disrespecting our relationship when I get on. If things were reversed and some dude from my past was posting stuff like this on my wall, I would've removed/blocked or even messaged him and told him to stop in a heartbeat. So yea, I'm hurt because I feel like it's no big deal to him and he doesn't care, and I feel like he didn't want to remove her which is why he's so defensive now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yea... Who is the asshole? Me? Him? Both of us?",

      "description": "Long story short: \nWife and I have two special needs children, and I used to be in the military until I was separated due to not making rank twice. Our medical benefits and ABA homecare that was so critical to our two kids evaporated six month later and we lost all help regarding our children.\n\nLife has slowly deteriorated and I'm off working as sole breadwinner over the last few years as she tries to take care of both kids and maintain a clean home, make meals, educate children, etc. \n\nI get kids ready for school before I leave, waking up before she does, then go to work at a demanding, soulless job all day, then coming home, getting kids handed off to me immediately as she escapes to her room the remainder of the day while I make dinner, clean kitchen, dining room, vacuum house, sweep/mop floors, take out trash, clean bathrooms, do laundry and more...DAILY. Because I come home to a trashy house and her excuse is she is too stressed out and she's doing all she can and yet, I'm the one doing everything morning and evening every day in a span of hours. It's just as exhausting to me and I don't get the nice evening break she does every evening - not to mention me taking the children out all weekend while she rests at home and 'rejuvenates.' I won't lie, I have said some choice words but it usually ends up in fights, so I've stopped saying things and just do these things without fuss.\n\nEvery time I see her, she's always on her phone or computer and gets angry when I ask her to help with the littlest thing. She claims she does so much, but perception is reality and I don't see the results she claims. Sex life non existent and getting counseling or help is impossible since we have crappy health insurance and can't afford such services to help our family.\n\nAITA for wanting more out of my wife right now?",

      "description": "Hello everyone! This is my first time posting in this subreddit so sorry if this isn't the correct formatting. I'm Aria and I'm 17, and in 8 days I'm moving to a university dormitory on my own on the other side of the country. I've never really clicked with my parents, and I decided that now would be the best time to not *completely* cut them off, but definitely put some distance between us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father is violent and always has been, and is not the most pleasant person to be around due to his temper. My mother is very passive, but is controlling, and put tremendous pressure on me since before school to study extremely hard (this is probably because she wasn't able to finish high school due to pregnancy). Between each other, they don't have the best dynamic - Dad was in his early thirties when he first met Mum, who was in her early-mid teens. Yeah. I don't really wanna talk about that. But you can probably guess the power dynamic between them. Due to my mother not really having much control, she exercises control by living vicariously through my older brother and I. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere have been lots of traumatic experiences I've had growing up either from tremendous academic pressure or my Dad's temper and substance abuse, numerous of which involved the police and at one point a domestic violence order was put in place to protect my brother and I. As such I've been going to counselling for the past 3 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though I'm finally moving out, I have to come back over Christmas. My brother is also moving out in a week but will live in the same city as my parents. He agreed that I could stay with him, but my mother absolutely did not take it well and made me feel horribly guilty and flat out refused. I played it off as I was only planning on staying with him for 2 weeks, but I think she's still weird about it. My university has the option for a preferred name, which I'm either putting my middle name or another name since I want this city and school that my parents haven't had contact with to be truly my own, and I feel that my first name is kinda looming over me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I still feel the moral dilemma? My mother is a victim of my father's violence and control (as am I), but I can't deny the psychological damage done to me. I'm a first generation Australian and both of my immigrant parents are high school drop outs, so they had to work really hard just to feed us, which even then they couldn't often do (they would make US feel guilty for this but I still feel horrible and ungrateful). I wouldn't be cutting them off completely, but I feel that some distance is definitely needed and would be good for my mother too, so that she can maybe develop an identity outside of her children and reevaluate her relationship with my father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit, what do you think? AITA for not wanting to live with them/changing my preferred name?",

      "description": "Title should actually be \"Are We The Assholes\" because my wife and myself are involved in it the same way.\n\nCutting half the backstory, since I hit the character limit hard lol.\n\nWife's (F)riend makes poor life choices, asks to stay with us for few days, we agree, wife's a cosplayer, has closet full of costumes and props. F stays alone once and decided to try on the costumes. Wife has wide hips, but is not overweight, F is. Costumes dont fit oops. Eveyrthing is uncovered few days before gaming convention we wanted to attend and main costume is ruined.\n\nNow I have to add few details about one costume. I got her one for anniversary gift and it was really hard to get and really expensive. The waiting list is almost a year (if not 2 years recently) and it's a miracle I was able to get a spot for her. The costume is made out of special kind of latex, it looks like regular one, but is apparently extremely easy to put on. However, damage it and it's virtually unrepairable as you can't glue it again.\n\nF has apparently figured it out that rubber is stretchy and she could try the outfit. Well, it's apparently not as stretchy as she thought or she handed it poorly and there is huge rip above the buttocks. How do we know it was her who did that? Well she lost a sock in the closet. And nobody else could really do that.\n\nWife is devastated, I am devastated because I knew she was really excited to use this costume so obviously we confront F.\n\nTL:DR of convo:\n\nF admits she ripped stocking of other costume, then after pushing confesses to trying on the catsuit, offers 20 bucks for repairs, we disagree, tell her the costs and waiting time, calls wife a child and fetishist.\n\nI end the conversation since I won't allow some loser to insult my wife and her hobbies. But hey, day later wife is fuming and she shows me a facebook post F made. Basically playing a victim \"They say I destroyed something, want to scam me, W is a child, IJustWantToFeelAgain is fat shaming and they both are disgusting fetishists\". Comments are mixed from \"Lmao, just block those weirdos\", through \"Dont confess to anything\" and \"Why are you body shaming her\" to \"You have to pay them back\". Of course she lied she was allowed to try it on.\n\nWe both explained the situation, that contrary to popular belief latex is not fucking cheap, this designer is definitely not cheap, F behaviour is definitely scumy and her fat ass should probably avoid putting on anything that's not hers.\n\nNow I just don't know if we're crazy that we expect to get the money back (cost of the outfit + the fact that it's really hard to buy it) and that in emotions after what we heard we are more than allowed to use the term \"fat ass\". Or maybe I should also play a victim, because yes, I am guilty of absolutely having a fetish for my wife lol.\n\n",

      "description": "The backstory for this post is a little muddled, but the jist is that this dude and I have known each other since freshman year of high school. \nWe go through high school with some minor hitches, but ultimately come out as friends. I gradually distance myself away from him, however, because he repeatedly shows himself to be a negative person; any statement of opinions or even just casual conversation would usually result with him making a critical or negative comment. Whatever, we graduate high school and go on our way to separate colleges.\n\nFirst year of post-secondary rolls around, and he and I get in this stupid heated argument in a Facebook group chat because he made some pretty rude comments about me quitting my summer job to focus in university. His comments struck a nerve with me because i was tired and s bit frustrated with classes that day, and also because I had been hearing the same toxic shit come out of his mouth for months at that point, so I fired back, hence the huge fight over messenger (keep in mind I’ve heard stories about him literally sitting on his ass and not doing shit in his jobs from mutual friends who have worked with him, so he shouldn’t be saying shit about work ethic or commitment). We stopped being friends after the whole fiasco, but a few months later he apologizes and admits that he was being an asshole. I apologize for overreacting as I was tired and frustrated that day we started arguing. Everything seems good.\n\nFast forward to about a year later. We have not talked for almost a year now, save some chit chat about inviting each other out to club and party. I can’t write the whole thing out or else I’ll go over the character limit, but basically it’s him making a joke in a negative manner that I do perceive as a joke and reply in what I thought was also a joking manner, but his replies make it seem serious and so I respond accordingly:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/fGMj4D0/\n\nLast screenshot wouldn’t fit in the album (I’m uploading from Apollo):  https://i.imgur.com/yvvu7CP.jpg\n\nI realize this story is biased seeing as I’m one of two conflicting parties involved in it. However, after seeing the screenshots of our messages below, please tell me if I overreacted with him again. I didn’t think I was coming off as “angry” in my replies as he puts it, but maybe I was thinking about our prior history and letting it influence my responses a bit.",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom\n\nContext:\n been together approx 2 years. VERY stable and healthy relationship (imagine at worst a cold shoulder followed by hugs in a few hours, never any “fights” only discussions). Both in our mid-20s. My parents left on a trip for the first time since i was born. He is one of the main caretakers of his grandpa who had an accident about a month ago. We had been discussing me spending a night with him for a couple of weeks but we never set a date. We decided today with my parents being gone and him not working in the morning (very unusual) that I’d spend the night after a taco dinner at his house. At 7pm I had a dinner/galentines. I said I wouldn’t be eating because he and I planned to eat together afterwards. His barber also rescheduled and he had to be there at 7:30 am tomorrow, but this was new info since he was supposed to have that haircut today after work. \n\n\n\n\nThe situation:\n\nAfter work I HAD to drop off packages at the post office but I got there at 5:55 and they chose to close early today. Of course they did. The post is about 10-15 minutes from my house but I ended up spending a nearly hour drive back to my house to get ready for galentines because traffic was terrible. I arrived, got ready, and headed out again close to 7pm. I drove 20 miles to the late night post office, but that took about another hour of traffic. \n\nAt around 8pm I called him anxious and stressed because I was so late and still had to pick up chips before arriving. He was supportive, gave me advice that worked to calm me down, and we talked about me going over later and how great it would be to snuggle all night (we essentially lived together our first year but I moved back in with my parents after uni) \n\nWe hung up around 8:40ish when I arrived. None of our plans had changed. I didn’t eat dinner, but I stayed for gift exchanges and to play one game. Our texts went like this: \n\n\n*less than an hour after I arrived*\nHim (H): I have to be up early to go to the Berber shop. Oh that’s fun! Don’t worry if you can’t come over babe enjoy your night It’s nice that you are having girl time. We can see each other tomorrow \n\nMe (M): Can I call (sibling) after to see if he's home so I can go sleep with you? \n\nH: If you want to baby but I don’t want you to be rushing around for no reason \n\nM: No but it isn't rushing :) I wanted to see you so much. I'll head over when this game is done? \n\nH: Don’t you want to spend more time with them? Don’t call it early if you don’t have to \n\nM: I want to go with you... \n\n*about 2 hours after I arrived*\nH: How are you?? *insert really sweet cheesy memory from when we first started dating*\n\nMe: awww bae. I’m about to go over.\n\n\n\nOBVIOUSLY hindsight is 20/20 and I didn’t notice he wasn’t just being nice and making sure I didn’t leave a fun event if I didn’t have to, he was lowkey hinting that it was too late for me to go over. I genuinely thought he just didn’t want to inconvenience me, but I had no problem going to bed right after getting there and waking up early with him for the haircut. \n\nHe had good intentions, he didn’t outright tell me not to go because he didn’t want me to feel rejected, BUT I DIDNT GET THE HINT AT ALL. So what’d I do?\n\nI left the place with an excuse, called him in the car and he seemed ambiguous about the time and me going over. I was confused but immediately noticed his wishy washiness so I asked again if he wanted me to spend the night. \n\nHe said if I want to.\n\nI said, NO I’m not spending the night unless you’re okay with it, your family is okay with it, and you explicitly want me to go over. If you don’t want me to, just let me know so I can drive to my house (opposite highways.) \n\nA similar conversation ensued where he kept insisting I could go if I wanted to but he also mentioned the time, how he was going to sleep as soon as his shower was done, what time he had to wake up, etc and all the reasons it was inconvenient. \n\nI almost begged him to just tell me yes or no because I was driving and I already took the highway to his house. He never gave me a solid answer. I just said I would be going home. \n\nOn the way home, I called my brother and I vented that I was upset because I was hungry (waiting to eat with him), not going to get to spend the night I was looking forward to, and I could have just stayed playing games with friends for longer. \n\nIn the process, I went to (ALMOST TO THE SAME AREA AS THE PARTY I JUST LEFT, about another half hour of traffic from an accident!) pick up food since I was starving.\n\nHe called before bed and we talked but I was obviously bothered. When I started saying what bothered me, I definitely spoke purely in an emotional whiny tone, I began to cry, and I said I was so frustrated from the whole situation. I cited not having eaten, him not being clear on whether our plans were cancelled or not, and the general disappointment of not being able to see him. I mentioned how annoyed and sad I was that not only would I not spend the night with him but I could have at least eaten with and stayed around my friends longer. \n\nHe said that it was nearly 11 when I left (he is right) and that he did mention that I should stay with my friends longer if I wanted to. He also said that if I went over I wouldn’t have eaten anyways since he assumed I ate something from how much later things dragged on.\n\nI said I didn’t care about the food though, it’s just a variable. I said that if I got there, didn’t eat, we went to bed and woke up early I would have been perfectly content because all I wanted was to spend time together. Being hungry after NOT seeing him is just worst.\n\nI was very emotional talking about it and I usually don’t get like that. I almost begged him to just tell me not to go over. I said, “I don’t mind if you thought it was too late and didn’t want me to go, just PLEASE tell me. I took the wrong highway, I made an excuse to leave early, I didn’t eat food, I just wish you said you didn’t want me to go from the beginning.” \n\nI feel crappy because I didn’t make sure he knew that I was aware that he tried to spare my feelings and guide me to what he was implying, but I was just too upset at all the wasted time that I forgot to say it.\n\n\nAfter he said those statements, he heard me continue to emotionally cry and vent, he apologized and said he would keep it in mind for the future and try for it to not happen again. He also asked if I’d like him to pick me up in the morning to run errands together and hang out. I agreed. I didn’t even want him to apologize. I was just sad and wanted to see him. \n\nWe ended with sending sweet texts apologizing and saying how much we can’t wait to see each other tomorrow morning. The entire thing from leaving the place to my rant ending was about 30-40 minutes. Then we were fine by the time we got off the phone. \n\nBut i keep thinking about my reactions and I feel like such an asshole. I know he did it to spare my feelings and with good intentions. \n\nAm I the asshole for reacting that way to him not explicitly saying not go over?\n\nTLDR: sleep overplans with bf got cancelled because it was late but he didn’t tell me explicitly only implied it. I ended up hungry, bored, and lonely so I emotionally cry-bitched at him over the phone even though I knew he had good intentions. Am i the asshole for how I reacted to him beating around the bush?",

      "description": "So last night I am sitting behind a couch next to where my grandmother sleeps.  I was playing with my dog and when I attempted to get up , I slightly fell and hit the couch( barely made any noise ). I go to talk to my mother in the kitchen . A few minutes later I am going back to my grandmas room and she pushed/grabbed me . Without having any chance to think, I push her with one hand (other hand holding the dog) and than notice it was my grandma . It was a split second reaction. At first she laughs telling me it was a joke , but than she starts crying and saying she never touched me and never scared me and it was all my fault for the argument that followed. Saying that she never hid behind the wall but was in plain sight asking me why I “slapped” the couch. Keep in mind , I gently fell when I was getting up , barely making noise. She kept crying the whole night saying she wants to leave me and my mothers house. This morning she keeps insisting that she never touched me and keeps swearing to god ( she is Orthodox Russian Christian) that she didn’t grab me or scare me. ",

      "description": "My roommate and I share a Hulu account that we each pay $6/month for.     My friend added a profile for his sister to use. She doesn’t contribute to the account because in my friends reasoning “she’s 14 and has no job and no money”. I wouldn’t have a problem but the thing is, Hulu only lets 2 videos play on an account at the same time. So if both my friend and his sister are watching stuff, that means I can’t watch anything even though I pay for the subscription. \n\nI don’t think it’s fair that someone who isn’t paying for the account is indirectly stopping me from enjoying something that I’m putting money into. I’ve tried talking to my roommate about it but he’s kinda dismissive and last night when I was having problems he seemingly ignored my texts about the issue. I don’t know 100% if that’s the case though. ",

      "title": "AITA for asking my landlord to fix damages left by the previous tenant before he got his deposit back?",
      "description": "I just moved into a room in a house of five total people, all in their twenties. The guy who was in my room before me had been there for over seven years and is moving to another part of the city.  All of the other roommates are good friends with him. The guy asked me before I moved in if I wanted him to leave any of the furniture he had so we could both avoid having to move too much furniture. I came over, looked at the room, and asked him to leave the bed frame and the desk only. When I got home, I sent him an email stating that we had agreed to only leave the bed frame and the desk so we could have it in writing what the agreement was and he sent me back an e-mail agreeing.\n\n\nWhen I moved in a few days ago, he had left the bed frame and the desk, but also a mattress, broken TV, lamp, and rug. The room was filthy—like I ran my finger along the windowsill and it came up black with dirt—and there are tons of nails in the walls, holes where nails were, and large parts where paint had been chipped away. The curtains were also filthy and had been in the same position for so long that they had become warped and I couldn’t move them along the runner or cover the entire window. These spots had all been hidden by wall coverings when I saw the room initially. I had to spend several hours cleaning up the room before I could move my stuff in.\n\n\nOne of my new roommates asked how the move was going and I said truthfully that I was frustrated with the state that the last guy had left the room in. She got a little uncomfortable and said that she had seen him trying to clean the room and he had gotten rid of a lot of stuff before moving (but obviously not all the stuff we had agreed on him moving before...) When I mentioned the problems with the curtains and the wall, she mentioned that I should submit a request to our landlord and he would paint the walls and add in some blinds and that he had done the same thing for her when she moved in.\n\n\nSo I submitted the requests and I figured that would be the end of it. After I do so, I notice the rest of my roommates immediately starting to ice me out. Finally one of them tells me that the landlord had sent an email earlier in the day asking if there were any damages that the previous tenant needs to pay and because I submitted the request, they think he’s probably going to not get part of the deposit back. I did not receive the email. The roommates think it was a dick move because he’s a nice guy and I should have waited awhile before sending in a request so he could get his deposit back first.\n\n\nMy attitude is that if he wanted his deposit back, he should have thought of that before he fucked up the walls. And leaving all his junk behind didn’t exactly make me all that favorable to him already. But my roommates all pretty clearly think I’m the asshole. AITA for immediately complaining to the landlord?",

      "description": "Few days ago my colleagues planned a Sunday outing and I was in. My girlfriend was out of town and returned on the same day and I wanted to meet her too.\n\nSo on Friday I told my girlfriend about this conflict in schedules and asked her to let me know if it's possible for her to meet me on same day since she'd be tired and had to unpack. If yes, I could cancel other plan. She said she'd confirm it later but never did.\n\nFast forward to Sunday, I am texting her as she arrived in town and I casually mention that it's time for me to get ready and go out with colleagues. She gets upset because she wanted to meet me on same day. I backfire at her (in passive aggressive way) that I had already laid out both the plans in front of her and she never told me if it was possible for her to meet me. She said she does not remember me ever mentioning about other plan, and it escalated in an argument.\n\nNow here are few things to consider: \n1. I had only told her about my other plan only once on a call\n2. She is a person who legit forgets things\n3. I have never experienced her lying her way out of arguments in our 4 year relationship.\n\nSo am I the asshole in this scenario?\n\nTL;DR: I had two plans on Sunday, one with girlfriend (unconfirmed) and other with office colleagues (confirmed). Asked girlfriend if she could confirm the plan so I could cancel office plan. She legit forgot about it (because I feel I didn't emphasize on it enough) and is now upset that I went with office people. AITA here?",

      "description": "Buckle up folks, because this is going to get confusing. Okay, there are five main players here including myself. My friend whose ex is in question (we'll call her Steph), the ex (we'll call him John), me, and two of my best friends (we'll call them Jane and Bev). Steph and John have been on-again, off-again for around two years, with them officially calling it quits around six months ago. Steph has complicated feelings towards John. He was her first true love, and even though she knows she should and desperately wants to move on. They have hooked up recently, and John views it as a mistake. Steph however is falling for John, despite her knowing she shouldn't. She is doing everything she can to move on.\n\nThis most recent week was our spring break, and both John and Steph were away on vacation. John and I have been becoming good friends recently, and not having seen each other all break, we decided to hang out. Saturday night we got Taco Bell and drove around chatting. Sunday we drove and picked his brother up, then watched a movie at his house. And that's it. No hint of anything romantic or sexual, as I see that as crossing a line due to my relationship with Steph. I was snapchatting Jane and she could tell I was with John. After I went home, Jane and Bev, who were together at the time, went off on me for hanging out with Jack. They said I was going behind Steph's back, and they saw it as a worrying possibility for me to do the same to them. I never explicitly told Steph I was spending time with John, as neither of us thought it was necessary. As soon as Jane and Bev pointed this out to me, I decided I should tell Steph that John and I were hanging out, and make sure she was okay with it. She replied that she didn't care, he was his own person, and nothing happened between us, so why would she care? I double and triple checked with her, telling her that if at any point John and I's friendship made her uncomfortable, she should tell me. The reiterated that she didn't care, and that it made no change in our friendship. I then told Jane and Bev about this, to which they said that they didn't care, I was still being a bad friend. Steph and I chatted tonight, and she has gone out of her way to let me know she is okay with it. We are pretty close, and I believe she would tell me the truth. Since Jane and Bev have found out about it, they are ignoring any and all of my explanations and apologies. I have left them alone, seeing it best to let them calm down. John feels awful about causing these issues with my friends, and he and I have agreed to not hang out until this blows over.\n\nSo AITA? Jane and Bev seem to think so, without any regard for how Steph feels. I don't want to loose two close friends over this, but if Steph is okay with it, I see no reason for John and I to not be friends.",

I'm 20. \n\nMy girlfriend is 21 and came from quite a poor family. She works like 70 hours a week in order to pay for her flat and education. She only earns about 16k-20k per annum as it's a minimum wage job. \n\nEverything she owns, she works very hard for. But, we argue about money sometimes. For example, she will never let me pay for dates or holidays - always insists to go half or refuses to accompany me on holidays if she can't afford it, despite me offering to pay her way. \nShe sometimes tells me that she worried were too different in how we were raised because she is very minimalist whereas I have a lot of \"stuff\".\nI admire her determination to get somewhere by her own terms and not relying on others but j wish sometimes she would accept my help. \n\nShe passed her test last week and is looking to buy a car for under £500. But, I want to treat her and Sonia took her to a car dealership and showed her a 2018 car that i wanted to purchase for her, she said that she appreciates the offer but really doesn't want me to buy her a car. She says if she gets a car, she wants the satisfaction of knowing that she paid for it herself. \n\nAnyway, last night she fell asleep early and I found her bank card, transferred £5000 into her account with the reference \"you deserve it\". \n\nShe found out this morning and got really mad. She said she was sick of me trying to push money on her, she says that she wants to earn her own money. She also said that I think everything comes easy in life but for people like her, it doesn't. She told me I needed to stop and demanded to send the money back to me but I wouldn't give her my details. \n\nAITA for trying to help? ",

      "description": "Hello all,\n\nI am having an issue with one of my friends \n(Lets call him Dave) and thought I'd see if I am handling this properly.\n\nTo start I am quite upset and have decided that I will not be attending an event this weekend that we have planned awhile ago.\n\nWhat happened:\n\nTwo weeks ago Dave invited two of his friends to his house party. I have met the one a few times but not the other. Everything was going well and the party was a fun time until these two new people decided I wasnt drunk enough for them and started pressuring me to drink shots with them. By this time I was at a perfect drunk for myself and didn't want to push my limits so I declined. They became annoyingly insistent getting everyone in the party to call me a pussy and other names and make the whole focus of the party on me drinking this nasty ass rum. Eventually I caved and drank a shot but that wasnt good enough either and these two people kept harrassing me to drink. A few more shots deep and I was at the point of no return and blacked out. I threw up and passed out and felt that hangover for two days.\n\nI know my drinking limits and I am very good at finding the right buzz for the occasion. I dont need to be told to drink and I was very pissed off both at myself for letting them pressure me and these people for forcing me to. \n\nCut to this weekend where I was invited to another predrink and bar night. I talked to Dave and discussed the plan and whatever. We had a two hour conversation catching up and I told him how I felt about his friends he invited and I asked who was all going this time and they werent mentioned. Cool.\n\nI show up and we are all having a good time but then Dave shows up with these two friends of his. Immediately they are on my case to drink. I flat out told them no and they wouldnt let it go. 5 minutes into them joining our party I am yelling at them to leave me alone. Dave knows how I felt about last time and he is just watching this go on and also at points is encouraging them. \n\nThis goes on the whole night. I told myself I wouldn't let them persuade me this time and they didn't but because of that night the whole night I was harrassed because I wouldn't drink with them. They tried every berating insult they could muster to the point people came up to me including Dave's girlfriend apologizing for their behavior. \n\nI ignored it the best I could and focused on making it a good night for myself. Well the next morning they're in one of our fb group chats mocking me even more and I am just done with these guys. \n\nI talked to our other friends and they agreed they didnt enjoy these guys' company and I called Dave and told them I didnt ever want to be involved in plans with them again. If he wants to hangout with them power to him but they're assholes who can't take no for an answer and I asked him to stop bringing them around me. He agreed and I thought the issue was over.\n\nCut to 10 minutes later he adds them to our call and asks me to explain why I dont want to hangout with them anymore.\n\nI couldn't believe it. I felt so betrayed in that moment that Dave would sell me out like that and force a confrontation with these guys I dont even know or want to further socialize with. I hung up on him and then called him back and tried to explain how mad he would be if I betrayed him like that. He didn't understand how I was mad and didnt think it was a big deal.\n\nI haven't talked to him since and we have an event planned this weekend that I have told everyone I wont be going to.\n\nAm I overreacting? Or am I justified in not wanting to see Dave for awhile.",

      "description": "To put it simply, I get hot VERY easily. I get so hot that I start to feel ill, sweat profusely, and have trouble thinking clearly. I am not sure why, but I have always been like this. My girlfriend I keep our house around 65 degrees because that is honestly the max temperature I can tolerate. I'm really not exaggerating when it comes to how badly heat affects me. I wish I wasn't like this. \n\nAnyway, all guests we have know this. They know how I am, and they know the house will be cold. I provide them with copious amounts of blankets (4-5) and even an admittedly tiny heater. They say they are freezing, go into my room, and raise the temperature to levels (67-70 degrees) that make me utterly miserable in my own house. I sometimes let them for a while, but it is really hard on me physically. My thoughts are that they can always bundle up; I am more than happy to provide them sweaters, jackets, scarves, even ridiculously furry onesies. They never take me up on it. As stated, I also provide them blankets and a tiny heater. I cannot really undress any more than a thin t-shirt and thin pajama pants/shorts, so there's not much I can do for myself.\n\nSo, AITA for keeping the house cold and changing the temperature after they've changed it themselves? Additionally, I'd really appreciate any additional suggestions for how to come to a compromise!",

I hope you realise how mad I am that you decided to take a spoiler from the manga to an anime post. Please be more considerate in the future. \n\nSP:  I did not spoil anything. What I said was up for speculation as I did not confirm anything. You, on the other hand, just confirmed it yourself. Therefore, YOU are the one who just spoiled it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to see this yourself please navigate through my profile as I don't like promoting my posts on other subreddits.

      "description": "Hey guys. Please hear me out before making a judgement - I know it sounds awful. \n\nI was with my ex girlfriend (I'm a girl too) for 8 years. In the last year, we had a baby. It was a mutual thing but she carried the baby, etc. \n\nI was never too sure about having kids until recently and I decided I'd love to have a family with her. \n\nShe was always afraid of having a child because her mother and aunty and grandma all suffered from a severe post-natal depression. But, she powered through. \n\nShe gave birth to a baby boy who was biologically hers and a sperm donor. She funded the whole thing with her savings and I was there throughout the birth. \n\nAbout 6 months after our child was born, we broke up. It was mainly because I did not want to be tied down so young, all kinda stuff like that. It was mainly my choice but she understood and accepted it gracefully. \n\nWe stayed pretty friendly. \n\nI realised a few months later what a mistake I'd made and I tried to reach out. I practically begged her to take me back. She refused. \n\nI begged her to let us be a family (I'm the legal parent too as I adopted our baby after birth) and she said no, that at the time she was heartbroken but that I was right and she'd met another girl who she was dating. \n\nWe fell out. I was heartbroken and I was angry. \n\nWe stopped talking but she'd occasionally reach out asking me to see her daughter. \n\nWe met for coffee and I told her if she wants to be single and explore herself then I need that chance too. \n\nI told her I didn't want to see her but would have my kid on Friday nights. She said that was fine. \n\nShe then broached the subject of child support and said she had funded everything and hadn't received a penny off me. She said that she wanted reliable child support and help from me. I told her that's fine. I sent her her first load of money and the next day I had our son and I saw that she'd gone out drinking and to the cinema with her new girlfriend. \n\nWe got into a big argument and I told her that I'm not sending her any more money as she was just spending it on herself. She said that in 2 years I'd only paid £150, she's paid everything else so if she wants to go out, she can. She then threw in my face that I'd been on holidays and stuff. \nI said when I have my son on the Friday, I'll buy him whatever he needs, feed him, etc but that she had to cover the rest. She said I'm an asshole, so AITA?\n\n*Tl;Dr* my ex had my child. She wanted money from me, then went out drinking. I refuse to give her more money directly. ",

      "description": "Original r/Advice post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/amxzba/how_can_i_address_potential_animal_neglect_with_a/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll provide a quick synopsis for those not willing to read the whole thing.\n\nWe'll call her Karen got a dog  this past May. She was great at feeding him, taking him out for walks, playing with him, etc. However, my gf and her roommates live in a relatively small apartment that does not have access to a yard . The apartment is close to a coastal beach that allow dogs even off leash (winter time) and there is a public dog park a few minutes more in the opposite direction. Karen met a guy and has started to ask him to take the dog out for her, feed him, etc. The dog is almost a year and a half now and is not properly trained (jumps on people, steals things, tears things apart, whines constantly, sometimes nips/bites us especially when being playful). Whenever people come over the dog acts like a feral hyena while Karen just sits there asking it nicely to calm down...Saying thinks like \"Baxter, please don't jump, we don't do that here\". We (including most of Karens friends) all know how extremely poorly trained he is, so when she offers to bring him usually people tell her no. This means he either is crated or my gf or the other roommate has to watch him.\n\nKaren recently got a job which she leaves the house for on average 50-70 hours a week. She often leaves the dog for my girlfriend and their other roommate to take care of (feed, play with, take out to potty, etc.) \n\nOften times though, Karen and her bf will leave for work at 7-8 am, work all day, come home  to  change for the gym  and then leave right again for a few hours while they work out. On top of that, Karen will sometimes go out for drinks with her friends and won't return until past midnight. Having never given the dog exercise, taking it out to potty, or playing with it.\n\nBoth my gf and the other roommate talk about how horrible the dog is to me (behind Karen's back) and how bad he had been. Yet they are both too shy to bring it up with Karen because they don't want to cause tension with her. I've said a few things  to Karen about it because I feel horrible for the dog but my gf always tells me a few days later that she overhears Karen complaining about  my comments to Karen's best friends who have also tried to tell her her dog is untrained and not properly cared for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA for confronting her about it (or even reporting it) because I don't feel as though the dog is being properly cared for by the owner?\n\n(both roommates claim its not fair for them to have to watch the dog but are too scared to cause drama in the house)",

      "description": "I work in a casual environment where people spend a lot of time blowing off steam, chatting, taking a few minutes to watch a YouTube video, etc. Swearing a little here and there is perfectly accepted, so long as you're not going off and screaming obscenities at clients and the like. \n\nBecause I work in a place in the Midwest, I'm surrounded by plenty of overweight people. It's not uncommon for other people to make self deprecating jokes about the donuts someone brought in, will power, etc etc. Just useless office chatter kind of made to make fun of ourselves.\n\nWell, I'm also fat. At 5 feet tall and 135, I'm pretty fat for my size (measurements last I took were 39-29.5-40, so I'm definitely not Tess Holliday but I'm also not a healthy or attractive/beautiful size). I'm also working on it and have been, so lets skip the recommendations for keto and IF. \n\nThe other day, I made a joke about how I hadn't gotten up from my chair for two hours. I said, \"Damn, my fat ass needs to get up and move around.\" I've made this comment before, and so have others in the office. One of the bigger girls huffed a little. I ignored it and went about my little walk around the office to shake it off. \n\nThe next day, the bigger girl came over with a friend and said they wanted to talk about my comment and how they didn't appreciate my jabs at being fat, etc, because I'm not fat and I'm obviously looking for attention or approval from the thinner girls in the office. That's not true. Number one, there is no way someone could look at me and not see that I am fat. Do I fit into a size 8 pant? Yes. Does that mean anything with vanity sizing, etc? No. It doesn't. \n\nI told them that I would take what they said into consideration, but later that day made another self deprecating joke about being a fatty. This really upset them, and the big one pulled me aside again and told me, point blank, to stop. I told her that no, if I wanted to make a joke at my own expense, I'm going to. And that it's not about her, and I would never make a joke at her expense. And that's the truth -- I make fun of myself because that's how I cope with what horrors I've done to this body of mine by ballooning up to such an unattractive size.\n\nShe stormed off. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "I know how entitled that sounds, but hear me out. \n\nI don't live in the US, but all my paternal family does and throughout my childhood they've made me understand they have a better income than my family does, and they resent my father for not moving away with them (he'd the 'doctor of the fsmily'), so they don't speak much; but they've always tried to lure me to visit or stay for long periods of time with presents, trips and whatnot \n\nI'm 22 now and haven't gone visit them or the other way around in almost ten years, it stopped when it became clear to them I had no interest in moving away from home.\n\nAnyways I'm putting up this background info to be clear about the fact I haven't asked anything from them, ever, and I don't resent them from completely cutting ties with me or my family. That said, my family does have a few financial struggles and I'm currently working my ass off to finish my degree in medicine and become an MD  \n\nSo one day, out of nowhere, one of my aunts added me on Facebook and asked if I had a venmo account to pitch in for my graduation. I don't, we don't have that in Mexico; so she asked me if I could find a safe way for her to send me money. \n\nI was excited, honestly any help means the world at this point, I'm graduating in three months and everything is crazy expensive. I went out my way to gather the info she wanted, and sent it to her after a couple days, I talked about how much it meant for me and how it would be greatly appreciated \n\nAnd that was... Over two months ago.\n\nI don't want to bring it up to her again, we've had a couple short talks since she added me, about school, my father and random topics; I don't want to bring it up because I don't want her to go and tell the rest of my family that my dad is screwing up so bad I have to beg them for money, that being said I'm pretty salty about the whole thing, why even bring it up in the first place only not to follow through? I've even left her on read a couple times now \n\nSo AITA for being salty about this whole ordeal and considering to just ignore her from now on? \n\n",

I'm not super tight with his wife, she's fine, she just has never really cared to get to know any of his friends in a real or meaningful way. I've tried hanging with her, but we're just not compatible people, so no hate there.  \n\n\nSo they finally let us know the date of their wedding, and I can go, but it's not a place I want to visit that much, and it is a lot of money/time off work. I didn't think it'd be that big of a deal, since it's a destination wedding, and I thought the golden rule was kind of, if you choose a destination wedding, you just know some people may not come. But he has since mentioned to me that he is annoyed that some of our other friends are not coming now.   \n\n\nI haven't made up my mind yet or anything, but I can now tell that he's going to be mad at me for not going. I want to celebrate his wedding with him, but it really does feel like a really big ask, and now that I know he's kinda keeping tabs on people who aren't going, and being quietly angry about it, I feel kind of weird making a decision on it.   \n\n\nNote: He is having a local celebration as well, which I would 100% go to, but is that enough?  \n\n\nWe are best friends, but in the last few years are not AS close as we used to be. They aren't having any wedding party, but if they did, I probably would have been asked (in which case, I would have said yes and gone, I'm just giving context for how close we are.)  \n\n\nAlso Italy is where they got engaged and they like it a lot - they aren't from there or have any ties there.   \n\n\nAITA for not wanting to go even though I have the means to?",

      "description": "AITA, I live in our University's nicer housing option which comes with a full kitchen. We have dishes we all share together, and we are pretty chill about dishes being dirty or let out. If this happens three of us will talk and decide who should do them, but our fourth roommate is different.  \n\nAt college I feel like we ate considered adults and therefore should be treated like adults by the people we live with. But this roommate (well call him Paul) does not do this at all. We are on our holiday break, and since we go to a bigger commuter school all my roommates went home. I have been the only one here until the other night when Paul came back. All my roommates knew that I would be here all by myself, even Paul.\n\nPaul returns pretty late around 11 or so alot the time I was going to bed, because I work in the morning. I knew that the dishes needed done, but put it off because I am the only one here and it wasn't really affecting me. The next day I went to work, and then went out to a movie with the girlfriend, which was planned and tickets reserved a week in advance. I got home late, and as we were going to my room I told her I was going to do the dishes so they were clean for Paul. When I get back I go over to our washer and see a sticky note the says, \"DO THE DISHES.\" \n\nNow I don't have the best temper but I did them even though that demand made me very angry. He could have asked, and I would have done them, he could have texted me, and told me he was coming back since he knew I was here, and I would have done them before he got there. I ended up writing \"fuck you stop acting like an alpha, and demanding what you want done!\" (He calls himself an alpha thats why I wrote that) He hasn't said anything to me since, and I was wondering if Im the asshole.\n\nTldr: Was only one in room over break, roommate came back unexpectedly and demanded that I do the dishes by sticky note, so I did them and replied to his sticky note with \"fuck you stop acting like an alpha, and demanding what you want done!\" Now he won't speak to me.

      "description": "So, TL;DR; in the end.\n\nI plan on moving out this year and save money for that. Though, I still spend a bit on hobbies, etc. cause it's still some time till I move out.\n\nRecently, I talked to a friend of mine about all kind of that (new kitchen, couch, etc.) and kinda went offtopic to a hobby of mine: Bowling. So you see. Modern bowling balls have some tech into  it that makes every ball behave different (Stronger curve, earlier curve, etc.), so I was looking to buy one to complete my arsenal. To be prepared for tournaments etc.\n\nNow of course I know that a bowling ball is a lot of money, but also it's a fun thing to have and I would really  use it. Yet, my friend was all  like \"Think about the new appartment. Don't buy it.\" so I thought \"Well, okay. Rather wait  then . Have enough anyways.\"\n\nToday I got a message from said friend \"OMG did you try Sekiro yet? IT'S SO AWESOME YOU WOULD LOVE IT.\" to wich I replied, nope and I don't know if I should buy it. Then she started to send me more messages about it, etc. practically begging me to buy that game for myself.\n\nIgnored that messages and went into discord, where I was greeted with \"Oh boy you gotta try that game!\". NGL I love the Souls-Games and I know I would love it to, I just hate being pushed to a decision.\n\nSo I looked up at green man gaming (online store) to get some good deal on it. While I purchased it, I still had \"Come on, you gotta buy it, I could rent it to you through Steam Sharing, etc.\" and at that very moment, I simply lashed out a \"Just fckin calm your tits for a moment, I'm already buying it, despite you telling me to not buy anything - like that bowling ball - some days ago. So give me break!\"\n\nWich she went silent. I excused myself and she said \"It's okay.\". Though, I still feel kinda bad about it. On one way, she just meant good with the game, on the other hand it's really shitty to say buying X is not okay, but buying Y is totally fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit. Am I the Donkey-Hole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR; Friend told me to save money instead of buying equipment for bowling. Then same friend begged me into buying Sekiro, cause it'd be awesome. Lashed out at friend, when she didn't shut up about it, despite that she told me to save money few days earlier.",

      "description": "Title is a bit misleading, but accurate nontheless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently me and my best friend, who we'll refer to as J, have been going through some problems. Girls, grades, a bunch of bullshit that would have probably blown over within the next month or so. We are both at college, and we room together on campus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a way to vent my anger healthily without saying anything unintentionally hurtful to him during an argument, I opened up a google doc and wrote down whatever came to mind. A lot of it was hurtful towards him, and even though it was true, I'm probably biased in saying that. I just wrote a lot about how he had hurt me, how his decisions were making my life (at the moment) miserable, and even included one particularly aggressive paragraph at the end where I told him to *\"go f\\*\\*\\* himself,\"* and that I didn't ever want to speak to him again. Mind you, my computer is password protected, and I didn't mean most of the things I wrote in that document. It just felt good to scream out my problems, even if it was into an empty void where no one could hear me. It was supposed to be private; I never intended on anyone reading it, and would have probably deleted it once the issues with J were resolved. (I use this google doc method often, its one of the ways I cope with problems.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote in the doc last Thursday. Today, sends me a cryptic text while I'm in class and asks me to come back to the room to discuss something he referred to as *\"urgent importance.\"* I came back, whereupon he proceeded to yell and scream at me for twenty five minutes for not properly venting my anger to him, and for writing all of those horrible things about him in a google doc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out that yesterday, on Tuesday, while I had gone to take a test and left my computer unlocked, J opened up my computer, opened my google drive, and found the document. Most of the things I'd written in that document pertained to *very* personal things J had confided in me about, things only I knew. I'd never intended the doc to be seen by anyone, least of all J himself, and tried explaining that to him, to no avail. He asked me what I had planned to do with the document, I said it was only to get my feelings out and that it was never intended to be seen by anyone besides me. J told me that I had *\"violated his trust,\"* by writing all of that highly personal and confidential information down, even if it was only meant to be seen by me. He stayed the night with his FWB last night, and intends to do the same tonight. He hasn't made a comment on the future of our friendship, and I have not talked to him since the verbal altercation.

      "description": "Lowkey scared of posting in here cuz posts like these usually tend to lean to YTA (if you guys decide it, totally understand; Kinda feel like an asshole for it but I’m not 100% of that mindset). I hope the title isn’t misleading since I’d rather get more into it in the post itself. Also TLDR-ish summary at the bottom\n\nAnyways, back in 10th grade, I dated this girl I became friends with in my freshmen year when she was in 8th grade (we met through band since our school’s band programs were performed tg). We didn’t rly start off liking each other, but we eventually became friends. After a bit, we flirted and then started dating. Things escalated quicker than I expected and she was more into me than i was into her. She isn’t exactly the prettiest or the most in shape girl (I’m not fatshaming bc i was also kinda fat; not to say i only date skinny girls cuz i like who i like, but as I’ve seen someone comment under a post that’s similar, we are attracted to ppl that are in shape) but she is a wonderful person and that’s what i cared about. But then i did an asshole and started talking to another girl (big oof Ik, but don’t write me out just yet) \n\nWe had a falling-out, feelings were hurt, and we blocked each other for a while. I’ve come to terms with what I did and once I matured (cuz I was young and new to relationships) I talked to her, apologized for what i did and we tried to be friends again. She said it helped her realize that ppl aren’t who they seem to be (i was a nice guy [in before r/niceguy comments] except for the asshole thing i did) and to not be as invested into ppl bc she got rly invested when we dated. \n\nOnce we made up, we become friends and talked every now and then. We’ve hung out, but sometimes it led to flirting/kissing and although I enjoyed it, I couldn’t go through that again with her so I always stopped it before it got any further, leading to arguments (kinda like a FWB type thing but more her than me cuz I was rebound most of the time and I just wanted attention from a girl; this isn’t meant to paint her out badly bc it takes two to tango so i shouldn’t have entertained it, but yk i got needs too) Since then, I’ve just refrained from doing that type of stuff with her and so far so good. Sometimes she’ll text me and say “we should cuddle, we should hang out, we should make plans for tonight” etc and although my life is boring, I don’t wanna end up hurting her (not to say I’d cheat again bc I’ve learned my lesson and I’ve been cheated on; pretty shit feeling so I’d rather not do that again) so I always give dry responses or send lol/lmao and she gets upset but only for a little \n\nLong story short, am I the asshole for not wanting to date/ do FWB with someone I’ve dated who isn’t my type and who i also cheated on (and reconciled with in case someone scrolls to the bottom without reading) ",

      "description": "I work in a very intense environment, with 12 staff. I’m the direct supervisor of 4 of those staff. \n\nAll staff, bar one, are white-anglo. The other staff member is Syrian and Muslim. Let’s call her Zara. I am her direct supervisor. Generally I think we’re pretty mindful. We always order halal food, and organise to go places that suit her. \n\nHowever she’s pretty open on some aspects of her life being pretty fucked up. Her 21 year old daughter isn’t allowed to drive, or go out without an escort. She was forced into an arranged marriage at 14 with a 35 year old man. They’re still together and have been in Australia for 25 years, but her husband doesn’t speak any English and I think is pretty emotionally abusive tbh. \n\nAnyway, once every 3ish months we all organise to go out on a “staff night out” somewhere fun for everyone. Lawn bowls, or teppanyaki or something. It’s by no means compulsory - one lady only comes at Christmas no worries - but everyone enjoys it and it’s just a fun way to unwind. Usually, people bring their partners, which is great as we’re all very close. \n\nZara never brings her partner, and none of us ever ask. No one has met him and everyone knows the history of their relationship. I’ve only become Zara’s supervisor this year and last week she came to me to ask whether I could bar partners from attending our staff night out. I told her I’d think about it, but the next day told her I wouldn’t as it had nothing to do with work. She then said it made her feel bad her husband couldn’t come and the reason her husband and her’s relationship is the way it is, is a religious thing. She said by not barring other’s partner I was not respecting her religion. \n\nI basically told her sorry, bad luck, and escalated it, but have been stewing on this all week. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for somehow being islamophobic  here?

      "description": "So a bit of background:\n\nMy parents have always had a rocky marriage. I remember them fighting all the time about how he used to cheat on her when I was little. There's also a 40+ year gap between the two of them, and it's honestly probably one of the key factors of their problems outside of that. \n\nAbout 10/11 years ago, my dad had a stroke which my mom to this day says caused his behavioral changes. I highly doubt this as from what I remember (I was around 8 ), he's only gotten worse with time. Not to mention that he's drinking more. There's not a day that goes by where he doesn't drink, and he's 80. He's never been violent with me, but some days, I cannot stand him. He buys things without telling us, signs up for credit cards using my mother's name, and steals my car keys (he has no license after getting into a car crash with me when I was 7). \n\nOn top of all this, I act as a surrogate nurse to him. I wake up every morning to fix his bed and clean his bathroom. Every night, he insists on cooking and I spend up to an hour cleaning up after him. Now that I'm in college, I just don't have the energy to watch him AND watch my little sister, do my homework, clean the house, along with whatever else I need to do. I still do it, it's just draining and making it hard for me to want to find a job without worrying about something going wrong at home when I'm not around. It wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't such an unreasonable drunk. He never talks to me anymore. When he does, it's a critique about my clothes or he'll call me an animal or some other derogatory term. My mom isn't any better. She'll use me as therapy. She's also not supportive of me seeking treatment for any mental illness and she used to say something along the lines of: \"Colleges will see that you have a problem and none of them will want you\" which is total bs. I'm tired of explaining how I feel to her so I plan to cut her off completely. What's ironic is that I used to find comfort with my dad when I was little because he was the parent that didn't yell, hit, or scare me. But now I hate both of them.\n\nAm I just being an asshole? I mean, there are times when my mom is nice to me. She'll take me out and we'll have a genuinely nice time, but then there are times where she does some fucked up shit in front of my sister and I (not going to go into it, it's not relevant), and I just can't help but think what the fuck was going on in her head? My dad still cooks dinner for us when my mom is working. Sure, sometimes he'll fish out things that have gone bad from the garbage or cook with moldy ingredients, but the intent is there. But then he'll get drunk/curse in front of my little sister or be indecent around the house. I honestly don't know how I feel about either of them anymore.\n\nTL;DR My dad is elderly, drunk, &amp; rude, and my mom isn't the best. Am I an asshole for hating them/wanting nothing to do with them in the future?",

      "description": "tl;dr at bottom, also on mobile so sorry for spelling/format.\n\nso, me, my sister (“Anne”)  and my boyfriend “Rob”) are planning on moving into Anne’s boyfriend’s (“Steven”) house.\n\nThey have two dogs - pitbulls - who are absolute sweethearts. However, as Steven is never really home, the animals are not getting the life they deserve. They’re just spending it in cages. So, he has decided to surrender them. Both dogs, together, cost $400 to surrender because we want to take them to a good, no-kill rescue. One dog is deaf, the other has such horrible separation anxiety that he must be heavily medicated. He was going to be put down if we brought him back to the shelter we got him from.\n\nSteven is unable to afford medicating the one pittie, and made the sad decision to give them up. \n\nhe has not given them up yet, because he does not have the $400 to surrender them. He can’t afford it.\n\nHowever, today, I got a text from Anne and Steven about how they bought a hookah for ~$120. Steven gets sick on nicotine. And yeah, Anne, Rob and I do love hookah, and we did discuss buying one eventually, but it wasn’t brought up again.\n\nThis to me seems like an impulse buy on Anne/Steven’s part, and I feel like it raises a red flag. If they couldnt afford the rehome fee for the dogs, shouldn’t they be saving money? Why did they choose to buy a hookah NOW even though Steven gets sick on it? What happens if I move in with them and they don’t stop the reckless spending?\n\nI brought up in the group chat that they should have saved that money for the rehoming fee, and now i have Anne mad at me for making such a big deal out of it, I’m sure Steven is pissed, and now Rob is starting to side with them.\n\nI’m looking at this from a money management/priority standpoint. We did not need a hookah. We NEED to rehome the two dogs, and maybe get some actual CHINA for the house (we only have like paper plates and plastic cups).\n\nThey keep saying “Its their money” and they can do what they want, but both Steven AND Anne are pretty deep in debt, and I see it as this: if we move in, and they splurge on something stupid, it’s going to affect everyone in the house.\n\nRob and I are supposed to move in to Steven’s house in the summer, but now I’m having second thoughts and everyone’s getting mad at me for it. AITA?\n\nTL;DR i feel as though my sister and her boyfriend are not prioritizing their money correctly, it makes me not want to move in with them, and theyre getting mad at me for it. ",

      "description": "The other day my wife and I went to Qdoba for lunch. We start ordering and my wife goes first. She takes a majority of the last bits of rice for her burrito and I assume the lady will grab some new rice from the back. I tell her I want my normal order of a burrito and extra rice (I love that shit at Qdoba) Well, this lady picks up the basically empty rice container and starts to scrape the hard crunchy brownish looking rice onto my burrito. I ask her to stop and ask if there is any fresh rice in the back they could get instead of what she just put on my burrito. She looks at me as if I asked her to strip naked in front of everyone and dance. She says hold on and and asks some guy if she could get new rice. He says yes and disappears into the back. I wait a few awkward minutes just standing in front of this lady while we both wait for this guy to make it. He walks back out to the front and has no new rice and starts doing something else. I assume it's mixing or cooking in the back so I don't ask about it. Eventually she asks him where the rice is because I want more. I hear her say I wanted more and tell them frustrated that, \"No I don't want anymore, I want different rice.\" They once again look at me like I'm asking them to go back and start growning the damn rice and harvesting it. He comes back quickly with the rice and she starts to add the new rice on top of the old rice on the burrito. I tell her to stop and to please start over with the new rice as I don't want that old rice on my food. She is obviously frustrated with me after all this.\n\nAt this point the line has grown fairly big and I'm holding it up asking for just rice. She finally puts the rice on a new burrito, which is literally the first ingredient they put on. another guy working the line takes it from her kinda aggressively and says start taking the orders behind me. We get to the end and pay and my wife tells me I'm being a complete asshole and I should have just taken the first rice. I tell her we only get to eat at this place rarely because we live kinda far away from it and I wanted something fresh. She then starts to tell me I'm still an asshole and I don't understand what it's like to work retail or with customer service type jobs. I end the disagreement with saying the customer should always be right and my request wasn't anything out if the ordinary. \n\nAm I the Asshole? \n\nAnd for anyone who asks or says my wife overreacted, she is super chill, we both have potty mouths, we tell each other like it is, we both are honest with each other  and this at all wasn't and argument of any kind. So please don't say she was the asshole or anything. ",

      "description": "(Four things first. I'm on mobile, so sorry for formatting, this is my first Reddit post, it's gonna be really long so TL;DR at the end, and I'm trying to be as unbiased as possible but it's hard so bear with me.)\n\nSo I met my friend (lets call her Roach, so if she ever reads this post she'll know it's me, as it's an inside joke but also an insult) a little while back in school on the first day. She was shy and quiet, blond hair, blue eyes, and from California. On my way to class, I wanted to make friends, so I greeted her (albiet a bit loudly, what can I say I was a loud kid) and we became friends quickly. We had a lot of the same interests and I spent a lot of my time with her, though eventually I hung out with my other friends more so it was even enough for no one to be too hurt. \n\nRoach hung with me and my little group, the outcasts, so the main bullies of the grade would annoy us and her as collateral, despite not knowing her. This'll be important later.\n\nAs we went up a grade, near the end of the first year I noticed one of my male friends trying to spread lies about me to her, because I didn't spend time with him. I'd grown up a bit, and his childish games of make-believe just weren't my taste anymore. It made me and Roach's bond stronger. So I became more relaxed with her and her with me. This would soon become a mistake.\n\nShe began to swear soon into the second year we knew eachother. I was always raised that cussing was bad and got my mouth washed out with soap whenever I did. I used to tattle on the \"cool kids\" who would cuss, but eventually I developed a potty mouth like hers that I still hide from my mom and try to get rid of, but it's hard to at school. (More on that later.)\n\nAs we became more comfortable and moved along in our years, she confessed to me that she had anxiety and depression. I had one other friend and a parent that suffered from depression, so I took it well. However, she started using them as cards. Whenever she was particularly harsh, it was \"Oh I have depression\" or \"just my anxiety acting up again\". She said her dog was given to her because of anxiety, but all I had was her word. I let it slide, wanting to keep my closest friend around. That was a mistake.\n\nI can't remember much, but I was at my local library. It was raining, so my mom had stopped in the drop-off-book zone so I could run in and out real quick. It was against the rules to park there, so I was fast. I got a call from Roach. I leaned against a pillar and gestured to my mom to give me a minute. She obliged, but told me to hurry. When I answered, it was a wave about how her parents hated her and everyone hated her and she was depressed. I tried to calm her down, but I panicked once she brought up self-harm and suicide. Trying harder to calm her down, she began saying she was gonna kill herself. Naive as I was, she was my closest friend and I began begging and pleading for her to not hang up the phone. My mom began rushing me but I was too desperate to keep my friend that I didn't listen. Eventually, I was met with silence, and the beep of my phone disconnecting. \n\nI thought I lost her. I was too panicked and upset and overall emotional to notice that it wouldn't be right for her mom to instantly hop on her phone and text me that she killed herself because of me, so I sent her my condolences and got in the car. I broke down ranting and when I got home, I furiously called her to try and ask if she was really dead. \n\nRoach answered the phone, saying that she was joking. Back then, I was just so happy i had her, so I overlooked the seriousness of the matter. Nothing so serious happened again. \n\nNote: My grandma, my second home, died between these above and below times. It messed me up emotionally, and Roach helped aiding that weakness into some issue that I don't know the name of. This will come up later.\n\nAs time went on, little incidents occured. Roach got upset because me and a close friend (she'll be mentioned later so I'll call her Sunshine) talked a lot about anime and kpop, which we had gotten dragged into. (Fight me I'm a fuckin weeb it made me happy) and she didn't know about it, yet she'd go on about Legend of Zelda like I was supposed to know about it, and when I dropped that i liked occasionally watching Supernatural with my mom she expected me to know them.\n When I went through my animator phase and began wishing I could be one, I found the cartoons Eddsworld and Villainous, but never got into them until Roach said she liked them so I got into them so I could know what she was talking about. She told me to \"quit getting into her fandoms\" even though she had exposed me to this by showing me some video clips and art. We had a fight and dropped it. \nThat year, I had gotten a little community app called PokeAmino and met some friends who loved Pokemon as much as I do, and grew very close with them. Roach was into Pokemon somewhat, so I added her to our group chat. That friend I mentioned earlier with depression? Yeah, they had a breakdown and so their two closest friends (Me and another user who's my current best friend I'll call Starshine) tried to help them back to a calm state. Of course Roach calls me asking why I'm not answering her other calls and what's going on in the group chat. When I explain, she says she can help. I told her there's a reason only their close friends help them, because we have a connection with them, but she tries to help anyway. It doesn't help, so I sigh, my emotions taking over, and tell her \"I said it was just a close friend thing\" And she thought I meant we weren't close and snapped at me. Since she faked her suicide, whenever she goes silent, I used to panic. Eventually we worked it out, whatever. But that was when I noticed she was being a jerk.\n\nCue the third year of me knowing her. Sunshine and I talked a lot, and I talked to Starshine online a lot. Roach left the PKA chat because she \"didn't like my friends\". Whatever, I didn't care, but I did get mad at first because she didn't even try to get to know them. At one point she rejoined, but she left and stayed gone after I posted a rant about her to the chat, knowing she was rarely online and at that time not caring. She accused me a lot, and Starshine was my rock as my emotions changed and I started feeling distant. I've found I'm good at acting like everything is okay in front of schoolmates, so Roach doesn't know a thing. \n\nHowever, as it gets into the fourth year of me knowing her, my emotions got worse. I have depressive spells occasionally, and don't feel as intensely as I used to except for when it comes to music and my close good friends. Social anxiety isn't as bad as it could be, but it still affects me. And add on to that, I have anger issues and the tendency to want to handle everything myself in a highly effective way, even when I can't. Here comes the more recent stuff.\n\nRoach is homophobic. Extremely homophobic. Several of my friends aren't straight and even I lean sometimes, but she just gets so upset. She used to not mind, but now every word out of her mouth is \"I'm a Christian so gays are bad and going to hell and evolution can't exist so science teachers are bullshitting us and can never be Christian.\" She even once said she'd rather have a disabled child instead of a perfectly healthy gay kid. Don't know why, but okayyyyy man.\n\nSkipping minor events here because this is way too damn long already.\n\nNow I'm a petty bitch. I've constantly dropped hints Starshine is my best friend now, but I'm not sure if Roach got them. When asked if she'd be the maid of honor at my wedding, I go \"Haha, if i do get married, it'll either be you or Starshine\" and she replies with a disgusted \"Who the fuck is Starshine?!\" like i couldn't have a closer friend than her. So I'm obviously not inviting Roach to my wedding, whatever.\n\nAt this point, I keep her around because she helps me through the school day my making me laugh and stay out of my thoughts until she pissed me off and I break down and we start over again, not because she's a close good friend. My friends have told me I should let her go but I'm clingy as much as I am petty and want to learn as much as I can and make her go through the treatment she treated me like before I do, plus I hold the hope she'll change deep inside me. I've been just as rude to her as she is to me, if not less, and she calls me a dick or an asshole, though she is the same to me or worse. So I thought I'd head to Reddit after a discussion with another close good friend so I can find out if me keeping her for entertainment and the hope I can change her is wrong and maybe some advice about what to do.\n\nTL;DR: Friend I've known for nearing 4 years is an asshole, fucked up my emotions, still thinks I care for her though all I keep her around for is laughs and the hope I can change her.\n\nSo Reddit, Am I The Asshole?\n(And thanks for reading the whole thing if you did, this took me about an hour to write so you're a real one.)",

      "description": "There's this guy. He has a great sense of humour, very clever, he is distractingly cute, and he is good at the biochem class we're in together so always helps out my friends and I when we are confused about the homework... not gonna lie, I was pretty attracted to him, and decided at one point that I wouldn't be opposed to a date.\n\nWe got closer after we decided to group up for a partner project, and he began to confide in me that he was regularly depressed and had suicidal thoughts. I also learned from my friends that he self-harmed occasionally and had to go to ER last month after a suicide attempt that involved slashing his wrists. There are weeks where he is so depressed that he skips all his classes and locks himself in his dorm, refusing to talk to anyone. Oookay, I was both very concerned for him and starting to rethink having a relationship.\n\nBut at that point, I was pretty sure that he had already fallen for me, because we'd met up earlier that week and he'd told me that he'd never told a girl about his depression before, but trusted me like he'd never trusted anyone before. My suspicions were confirmed when my friends told me about what they'd heard from his best mate: that he liked me and was going to ask me out as soon as he'd mustered the courage.\n\nThey asked me whether I'd accept. I said no. They were in shock, said that he was smart and funny and attractive and his parents were well off and that there was no reason for me to refuse him. I brought up his depression. They were scandalized, especially one of my friends who also had depression.\n\nShe freaked out, telling me that I was contributing to the bad self-image depressed people have, as many of them believe that 'no one wants a depressed person' and 'my personality is unattractive because of my depression.' I felt terrible and nodded along and apologized, but privately my feelings did not change.\n\nI don't think he is a freak, I don't think he's crazy or any less human because of his depression, but I can't handle having to constantly take care of someone who's got terrible mental health at this time in my life. I don't want to care deeply for him and then end up getting hurt because of it. I don't want to spend lots of time trying to convince him that life is worth living. Whenever we talk for over an hour even now, he says something horribly self-deprecating and I need to reassure him that it's not true, and I feel like this will be exacerbated by a closer relationship. He even jokes about how he's going to be single forever because of his depression, and how hes so thankful that I've stuck by his side through all of it.\n\nI've tried to represent this as fairly as I can. His depression isn't something he chose to have, and I was fine with dating him before I found out about it. He's such a nice guy and he trusts me so much. I may be the asshole; I don't really know. So, please tell me if I am.",

      "description": "Backstory: My (M26) gf (F23) just moves in to a home that I am renting and there are a few things that I do around my house that can be weird to other people. For instance, every morning I pee in the shower then run the shower while I brush my teeth then hop in the shower after. Another example is whenever I cut my nails, I cut them in the middle of the floor in the other bedroom and when I’m done I turn on my robot vacuum and shut the door and let it clean it up. It’s weird, I get it but everyone gets into their own habits in the privacy of their own home and I did tell her about it before she moved in but I guess it’s different when you experience it.\n\nAnyway, we were out with her friends and they were discussing using the bathroom at our work, I mentioned I have no problem using it while most of her friends say they try to avoid it as all possible. My gf then puts me on blast and says “of course you’re okay with it, you piss in the shower”. I end up having to defend myself for a few minutes, no big deal. Once we were alone I causally mentioned I didn’t think it was cool how she did that. She said if I’m comfortable doing it then I should be comfortable talking about it. We argue a little but she concedes and says she won’t do it again.\n\nA few days later with my friends now, we were talking about foods we like that others thought was disgusting. She decided to bring up how she thought it was disgusting that I cut my nails and just leave them there, which is completely unrelated to what the topic was but again, led me to have to defend myself. On the car ride home I was more upset and let her know that I was upset. It led to her crying and not saying anything for a while. I told her that I’m not going to be okay until she stops trying to make me feel uncomfortable in my own place and if she had any problems with anything then tell me, not to our friends. But she kept on saying I’m overreacting and if it bothers me then stop doing it, all while she’s still balling her eyes out. We get home and she sits on the couch crying. I go to straight to the other bedroom and sleep there for the night. It’s the next morning and getting ready in the bathroom. I still pee in the shower and we still haven’t said a word to each other. AITA for not comforting her last night? AITA for not wanting to adjust my habits?",

      "description": "So yesterday I decided that I didn't have time to eat, so I didn't. Cut to 10:30 pm, I've finished most of my school work and I could finally attend to my stomach growls that have been echo-ing at me all day. \n\nFor context, I'm male, 20, my friend is female 27. I ask said friend if she wanted to get some food. She agrees and offers to drive. Couple other friends want to join the order so they decide to come too. Before we leave, something comes up and I have to stay behind so I just tell my friend what i wanted to get and offer to pay her back. I should also mention that she wanted one of the items that I told her to get. \n\nSo they leave, I attended to my situation, and they come back 30 mins later.\n\nShe hands me the food and says \" they ran out of the item we both wanted, they had one left and I kept it for myself.\"  I get it and since she drove I thought it was reasonable. Then she says that instead she got me something similar that I didn't ask for. okay, I guess better than nothing. Then I check the other items and I find out that everything I ordered, a total of 4 items, NONE of them was what I ordered. She said they ran out of most things and so she just got me things I didn't ask for or need because she thought I would want it. \n\nI asked her why she didn't  text me and she said that I never reply or take to long. I told her that I appreciate that she offered to drive and get food for me but I didn't ask for these items and the fact she couldn't be bothered to text me before getting me stuff I didn't want is beyond me. she demanded I pay a certain amount for them that I didn't expect to. On top of this, when I asked for a recpit she kept saying she knew the amount I owed her and that a receipt wouldnt change that.  w.t.f. \n\nSo we argued for a bit, and then she said if I didn't pay for the food she would take it back, so I  let the food go and she straight up takes it, and asks our friend group (who btw were all listening into this argument) if anyone wanted my food for FREE( I feel like this was a power move and was meant to make me feel like shit). I got so mad. So I tried to stay calm, packed my shit and left. the whole situation pissed me off. I usually get mad and react with anger but I've recently been working on personal development and this reaction is not common for me so everyone was a bit shocked. the aftermath, i haven't seen or talked to anyone in that friend group and I'm starting to think I'm at fault, should I stand my ground, or AITA and i should apologize. \n\n\nAlso, a side not, later that night the same friend offered to drive me to McD's but I declined because of how shitty she handled the situation. Maybe I'm over reacting. What do you think Reddit?\n\nTL;DR: my friend got me food that I didn't order and then proceeded to make me look like a fool. ",

      "description": "This happened several years ago, but thinking about it still baffles me to this day and I want to know if I’m missing something.\n\nI got home at 11PM from visiting my then girlfriend, and my 13yo sister met me in the hall and told me our mom had been acting very strange all night. I noticed our mom’s bedroom light was on, which was unusual in itself as she rarely stays up past 9PM, and decided to check on her. When I entered her room she was lying on her bed with her eyes wide open, but when she heard me enter she sat straight up. We had a conversation, but her demeanor was off, and she kept saying “the nosabol is arabol” and laughing. I asked her what that meant and she said it was from BBC Sherlock (I haven’t watched the show but my sister has and doesn’t recognize the words). She also kept staring at random places in the air and laughing and talking about things I couldn’t see but not being clear about what they were. I went outside under the pretense of taking the dog out to use the bathroom (something she kept asking me to do even though it wasn’t usual for him to be taken out so late at night) and called the paramedics and told them how she was acting.\n\nWell, once the paramedics got to our house she was suddenly fine and not acting weird anymore, and was only angry that they were there. They asked her a few questions (had she taken anything recently, was she struggling with mental health) and then left. Once they left she started yelling at me for being so stupid and disrupting her night. She claimed that she was only acting weird because she was tired (I’ve seen her tired many times and she’s NEVER acted like that before or since) and now she wouldn’t be able to sleep. She was also very upset about the questions they asked her because she thought I’d told them she wanted to hurt herself (I didn’t). Her yelling woke up my dad, who listened to the story and also started yelling at me about how calling the paramedics was “acting like a little girl” and how I should have woken him up instead. At some point during all the yelling my sister started crying and they both got mad at me for making her cry. Then my dad said “get the fuck out of my house, I don’t even want to look at you anymore” and so I threw some things in a bag and left.\n\nI spent the night at my girlfriend’s house, went to work the next day, and then went home to pack some more things and then live in my car for a while - only when I got home, everyone was acting like everything was normal and I hadn’t gotten kicked out. Neither of my parents mentioned what had happened, and my brother (who was gone that night and found out what happened when my mom called him to complain) only said that calling the paramedics had been “fucking stupid”. Every time the event has been mentioned since, it’s presented by my family as a funny story about how I panicked and ruined my mom’s night. Everyone except my sister also claims not to remember that I got kicked out.",

Made several aggressive comments about women we both know, including my friends. Talked about killing someone \"just theoretically.\" Scary but nothing I saw (at the time) as too bad.\n\nWe have a hobby together (where we met) that is organized by a nonprofit. He is active on the board of the committee but is not the community leader.\n\nWhen he and I first broke up, we saw each other quite frequently at this hobby, which made breaking up messy.\n\nEventually, I approached the community leader about this messy breakup (since the tension was affecting hobby events). The leader said \"If you need help let me know, and I will try to help where I can. But if I don't see something or have proof, I can't confront him.\"\n\nI do not have any screenshots or phone call recordings because he kept most of the crazy to in-person or over phone calls which I was dumb enough not to record.\n\nMy ex did not improve and threatened to make the hobby absolutely miserable for me unless I left on my own accord... And he very successfully made it uncomfortable. I just decided to stop engaging in the hobby. \n\nI've been out of the hobby four or so months and had a conversation with a gal still in the hobby. She sends me screenshots of my ex threatening to kill her \"as a joke\" in a very creepy way. This was not surprising to me in the slightest as this is pretty typical behavior for him when he had been drinking.\n\nI explained to her my relationship with him and my experiences of threats and abuse. She was very clear she did not want me sharing these screenshots. I feel, though, that I finally have proof of abusive behavior that is especially valuable since it's not just coming from me.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I share these screenshots?\n\n",

      "description": "So a bit over a week ago, I discovered my gf (now ex) had cheated on me with one of my past friends by sexting him on snapchat. I completely understand I was the asshole for how I discovered it, I went through her messages with him but I knew something was up. This was because a while before I went through her mesages, she pretended to send pictures of herself to me, however, they were not of her but were pictures she found online, plus out of the blue she wanted to upload pictures of herself in her swimsuit in a slight sexual manner onto instagram (she later revealed that these pictures were not hers when I was questioning her after I broke up with her after her sexting). She asked if she could upload them, but I told her they made me uncomfortable and she took them down. I told her she didn't have to yet she still took them down. ( I was not controlling in this situation, she told me that herself). However, a week or two later she uploaded said photos to another Instagram account I did not know about without telling me. She knew they made me uncomfortable, yet when I found about and confronted her she said she did it because she was bored. (Later, after we broke up she said it was because she wanted to fit in with other girls). After this I had enough and went through her messages and found sexts with another guy, and so I broke up with her. So in the week or two since then, I've been asking her questions about why she did it, how she felt, how she feels now, and questions similar to that. I cant entirely get over it and sometimes I repeat my questions I've asked before  without realizing. I feel as though getting to the bottom of it makes me feel better. She told me she sexted him to bring him close and then keep him at bay to fuck with his head and make him feel how she made him feel. (Before we were dating, she was in an unnoficap sexual long distance relationship with him and apparently he fucked with her head and made her feel bad, thus she felt like getting revenge. Without telling me.) Upon questioning her I have found changes in her explanations for doing it, for instance one time she said she sexted him to make him feel bad, the next time I asked she did it because she didnt want him to feel bad \"for not having a way masterbate because his girlfriend wasnt sexting him.\" But the reason I posted is because she gets annoyed with me asking questions as to why she did this, and upset that I \"bring up past mistakes and hurt her\" even though it's been two weeks since we have broken up. I understand I have to move on though. I will try my hardest to do so. Please be honest.",

Regardless, I was walking into a store to get my prescription, stopped halfway in the street because this chick decides she has to gun it past me despite me being on the asphalt of this parking lot. If I had not stopped immediately, she would have hit me at approximately 20 MPH. Instinctively, I called her a bitch because it’s not necessary to gun it in a busy Walmart parking lot. I’m guessing they read my lips because they didn’t have any open windows and they slammed the brakes to tell me to “Watch myself, bitch.” I somehow feel like I’m in the wrong despite the law that gives me the right of way. I almost feel like it would have been better if she hit me so I could pursue legal action. Am I being the asshole here?",

I didn't mind these requests as they are not too over and I still could handle them by skipping a few day's lunch. \n\nThen he gathered up his guts and asked for a costly merchandise, to be specific, it costs about $40.

People know my usual account.\n\nI'll try to keep it short.\n\nMy relationship with my bf (20m) (I'm also 20) has been mostly good but going downhill recently for a lot of reasons that aren't the topic of this post. \n\nAnyway, over the last several weeks, every once in awhile my boyfriend will make sexual jokes at my expense and include \"our\" friends in the jokes; I say \"our\" because I am the only girl in this friend group and all of the other guys seem to prefer my bf. The jokes have been anything between implying I took part in a sexual act (which may or may not have been true, depending on what they joke about) to making a joke explicitly about me, saying something like \"OP must do X or act like Y in bed, hahaha!\" \n\nMy bf sometimes makes the joke, sometimes one of the other guys does. Either way he seems to think they're very funny. I do not and have either explicitly told him so (calmly and only to him) or just tried to ignore it and avoid it through body language, etc. The jokes make me extremely uncomfortable. Nothing has worked obviously since the jokes still happen occasionally.\n\nToday it happened again and something in me just snapped and I couldn't control the words before they came out. We were all at dinner at a busy dining hall at our university, and another joke was made. All the guys thought it was funny again. Suddenly I snapped at my boyfriend, but definitely not shouting, more like a very angry loud whisper (nobody else in the dining hall seemed to notice).\n\nI basically said \"Stop it. That's not funny.\" Everyone at the table suddenly looked awkward even though I only addressed my bf. My bf looked flabbergasted for a moment before he looked angry and said (kinda paraphrasing) \"you do not speak to me like that in front of my friends. that is incredibly embarrassing and rude.\" I attempted to apologize, I said \"sorry for saying that like that,\" but he didn't seem to accept my attempts to apologize so I dropped it. I think I only tried to apologize to keep him from being too mad at me. It would have felt wrong to apologize for trying to stand up for myself. Does that make sense?\n\nLater this evening, my bf said what I did is considered emotional abuse and that I have issues. None of my \"friends\" have said anything about the incident. \n\nWe are probably breaking up soon, but I want to know if I deserve my bf's frustration.\n\nAITA for snapping at my bf in front of his/\"our\" friends? Is what I did abusive?",

      "title": "AITA for shoveling snowy driveway and depositing it on roommate’s car",
      "description": "Let me preface first with backstory before the straightforward title indicating to how I’m probably an asshole misleads you.\n\nSo yes, I did dump a rather large amount of snow on my roommate’s car somewhat recently. We live in Colorado and had gotten 19 inches of snow and I came home at 2AM from work unable to get into my driveway as it had snowed all day while I was not home. Our driveway is an L-shape that has us wrap around the house and park in the back so it’s a bit long. And this process took me roughly 2.5 hours. I did a thorough job clearing the back area but towards the end I hated taking each scoop all the way back out to the street so I had to find an alternative spot to stash the snow. That spot being on and around the vehicle of the roommate who had been home all day long and was asked by me prior in the day if he could assist with the shoveling before I got home by doing a portion of the drive. \n\n[here’s photo evidence of the snow shoveling deed](https://imgur.com/a/rFGWNhU)\n\nBut there’s more to this story. This was a bit out of character for me but I did feel justified as the roommate is basically a bum. My previous roommate and good friend, had gotten engaged and moved in with this fiancée so he subleased his remaining lease term to a random Craigslist guy now roommate, who ended up becoming the biggest pain in my ass. He is late on last two months rent (his share) which our landlord is giving him a few more weeks to figure something out or else she’s coming to me for restitution pay. He doesn’t have a job. He doesn’t look for a job. His only source of income is donating and plasma as often as he’s allowed. He uses my restroom to take shits when I’m not there (came home once and caught him having just finished the act). He eats my food. And he like compulsively sings random songs and in dad-joke fashion changes the chorus to be filled with dreadful puns. Even my dog hates this guy. \n\nSo I took out my frustration by sending a subtle message. He was awake the whole time, he could’ve come outside to even offer help. The one thing I didn’t foresee was that his car wasn’t able to start the next morning until he cleared the snow and got it jumped. Ironically he missed his appointment to donate plasma. So I’m curious, despite the trauma endured by living under the same roof as this guy and him not helping me, am I the asshole?\n\n\nTL;DR : Spent hours shoveling snow from driveway at 2AM because I couldn’t park so I dumped the snow pile on roommates car because he’s a bum who owes money and he could’ve helped and was home all day.

So please dont be mad for this story because i know this subject is very sensitive around the world right now and please if im in the wrong dont diss me, enlighten me   \n\n\nhere we go   \n   \nthis story takes place in the span of 3 years from grade 6 - 8 (im in grade 9 now so i met her 4 years ago) because it was so long ago (at least the beginning) the details are a bit hazy for me sorry if the details arent good and if it seems fake but i promise its real\n\nThere was this girl at my school we will call Amy. I was in her class from grade 6 to 8 and the whole time i had a MASSIVE crush on her... she was one of those girls that were more like tomboyish but she wasnt fully a tomboy. She had been in the elementary school her whole life and i had just switched to that school for grade 6. she was the one to show me around and all that stuff you know the typical new kid stuff. So as u can imagine we quickly became friends and hung out a lot i developed a massive crush on her, i would think of her all the time and i would befriend all the guys she seemed close with (keep your friends close but your enemies closer kinda deal) even though that was kinda selfish some of these guys are some of my best friends today and already know that that were my initial intentions. Anyways we were always in the same class from grade 6 -8 (somehow) so we were really close and she would tell me things that she would tell no one else INCLUDING when one day she came out to me as a lesbian....  \n\n\nnow as u can imagine i was DEVASTATED. i cried that night. She was the only girl that i acctually felt acctual love towards and this was really really hard on me. I kept blaming myself \"i shouldve made a move a long time ago\" \"maybe she wouldnt be lesbian if i asked her out earlier\" (YES i know she was born like that now)  Anyways ever since that day we drifted apart and one day she told me \"is it becauseim lesbian that we dont talk anymore\" it was then that i poured my heart out i told her everything how i was crushing on her since the 6th grade. she was just silent. in shock i guess. she just left and i havent talked to her much ever since. it didnt help that this happened around the end of the year either. we didnt talk all summer and when we came back in september for grade 9 she had a GF and she surrounded herself with new people....  \n\n\nam i an asshole?",

      "description": "So I wasn’t feeling like cooking tonight and decided to get something delivered. I settled on Hawaiian food. I picked out what I wanted, ordered and set my phone down. I had to leave a tip in the order. So I left a $3 tip, this tip was included in my order. Usually I chose the $3 tip and then give the delivery person $2 in cash when they get to my door. \n\nSo anyway I’m waiting and I check the map and see my driver is at the restaurant. I check again 10 minutes lasted and she’s still there. Whatever it’s probably busy. So then I get a text saying my food has been picked up and on it’s way. I live about 1.5 miles away. It took her 20 minutes to get here. Then I saw her car in the app was in from of my house. And there she was, I looked out and saw her there. On her phone. She looked over at my house and then back at her phone. I’m like wtf is she waiting for. So after a minute I get upset, put some pants on and go outside. THEN she gets out of her car and says “I’ve been out here for like 5 minutes” I told her she’s supposed to come to my door. To which she replies that no she’s isn’t and I have to request that and she never goes to the door. \n\nSo at this point I’m like whatever and she hands me my food and just stood there for a second. Then she goes “no tip?!”\n\nI say I DID tip you, my order includes a tip. And she goes, yeah but that’s only $3. She then says “I was in the restaurant for half an hour, and then had to figure this maze of a neighborhood to get to your house. I think I deserve more” \n\nI told her to fuck off and walked back to my house. She semi yelled something and got back in her car and drove off with some kind of rage. \n\nLike wtf am I the asshole here or is she ",

      "description": "Around 2 years ago I started dating a girl. She was super smart and all, and we were genuinely happy. I thought there was 'a screw loose' based on her behavior and the fact she had diagnosed depression and BPD and all that jazz, but innocent 18 year old me ignored it. Over the course of our relationship she'd talk about meeting a 'weird and creepy' guy in her class. We both lived on campus, as did he. She started hanging out with him after classes, and I didn't have an issue with it. She started acting weird against me, like somehow figuring out my entire families addresses, figuring out where they worked, hell she even got a hold of my dad's SSN somehow. One of the worst things to me was if we ever walked past children (Like, 5 years old to 12 years old) she would start screaming at them to get the hell away from her while they were just walking past her. She claims she just really really REALLY hates children. Even 18 year old me's red alarms were going off because I have never told her any information about my family and I have no idea in hell how she got it all. I demanded she told me and she just laughed about it. The thought of breaking up over it was deep in my mind and I wasn't sure what I should do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell lo and behold, soon after meeting this creepy guy she flaked on myself and my parents (who drove over 4 hours just to meet her) and instead spent it with him, where she 'accidentally sucked his dick' (Yes, she literally said \"I accidentally sucked his dick\"). 18 year old me wasn't that dumb, so I quickly drop her and tell her not to contact me again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCourse she ended up contacting me a few times, but I ignored her completely. So, as a result, she starts to send letters to my NEW address (How in the hell did she find out my new address?) She started screwing around with my dad's SSN and he had to go through all sorts of legal issues. She would even contact my roommate and demand to see me (My roommate even let her in my room before!). I'd see her on campus and she'd literally start running after me and crying and screaming (see /r/BPDlovedones for more similar stories). Christ, she even contacted me on ANIMAL CROSSING\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, 1 year later I think I see the last of her. No issues with her anymore ever since I blocked every one of her accounts and phone numbers I can find, as do my parents. I still see her around campus but she doesn't come chasing after me and I ignore her. Outta the blue a few weeks ago, after about a year and a half breaking it off, I got a voicemail from yet another new number of hers (How the hell did she find my number AGAIN?) She says that she used my name as a potential witness in a sexual assault case for her against 'creepy guy'. I think this is weird because all I know about him is that he's weird and she 'accidentally sucked his dick'. I have no idea of what happened to them after, so I have no useful information. Staying true to my no-contact rule, I block that number and think nothing of it. I later get a voicemail from my college police saying \"Hey this is the police Ms. 'scaryBPDgirlWhoMightKillMe' said you might have some information you'd like to share about Mr. 'AccidentallySuckyDick' come visit us if you'd like\". I again ignore that message because I want nothing to do with my ex, including this. I don't want her figuring out where I live now (Or my NEW new phone number)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been thinking about it new a few weeks later, and AITA here? I'm actually looking for a criminal justice type career after my Comp-Sci degree, and I don't want this guy around campus if this assault did happen if I could help with any info I have. But again, all I know is that he's kinda wierd and his dick has this incredible power that draws in members of the opposite gender and can actually cause 'accidental sucking of the penis'. I don't want anything to do with this girl. AITA for not doing more?",

      "description": "*Tl;dr A guy I had a dubious friendship with is in a less than ideal situation and I don't want to reach out to him.*\n\nSo I went to a small high school where I didn't have a lot of friends. I met this guy through the school band, as we were both in the same section, and he and I talked once or twice. However, when I would try to hang out (e.g. sit with him at lunch or something) he would constantly be sitting with his other friends and wouldn't even address me when I spoke to him. He was also on his phone basically 24/7 but when I texted him it always took him 5+ days or so to respond. He never was directly impolite to me, but it felt like I was definitely putting more into our friendship than I was getting out of it, so I stopped hanging out with him and he earned my enmity for the rest of high school.\n\nNow we're both in college, and I'm very much over my social life in high school. However, recently I heard from another friend that my old fake friend (who is going to college on a sports scholarship or something) hates the community he's in; he doesn't drink or party, and he's found that nobody else around him shares that trait.\n\nOne side of me is like, finally, karma's come around and he's getting what he deserves. But at the same time, I faced similar problems early on in college as well, until I found a community I could fit into, and I feel a little bad for his situation. The other friend who told me this suggested I text him, but I promised myself I would cut toxic people out of my life once I graduated high school.\n\nIf I refused to reach out to him, would it be assholish?",

      "description": "For the story to make sense we need to cover what happened yesterday. We were at an auction and my girlfriend had $1,000 in a PayPal account that I've never seen her use before and I thought it was strange that she wanted to send it to my bank account to buy some jerseys at the auction. I asked her where she got the money from and she told me that she saved it up and put it into her PayPal. I thought that was a weird way of saving money but I went with it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow today I saw a post on instagram where one of my friends got a dm saying, \"I'll send you $1,000 for a nude and it doesn't even have to show your face or anything.\" So my friend just send a random nude he found online and the guy actually sent the money. Now at this point I know what's going on with the scammer, it's the same problem with Twitch streamer donations. A person donates a large amount of money and then does a chargeback and somehow ends up refunding the donation and then the streamer gets hit with a fee of some sort and the scammer makes a few bucks off of it. I don't know all the logistics of the scam but that's the essential scheme of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo while I was at work I sent her a text saying hey I'm not mad if you did this but there's a scam going around where a guy will send you $1,000 over PayPal for a nude but then he refunds it and you'll have to pay a fee and get screwed over. And she thought I was calling her a slut and how could I possibly think of her like that. Then she goes on to say how she has a credit card with PayPal and pulled the money out of her credit card and was trying to send me that money to use. But that threw up a red flag because her story isn't lining up with what she told me yesterday. Then there was some back and forth arguing and I was trying to explain to her that I'm only trying to look out for her but she said it's a joke that I thought she would even sell her self like that in the first place. But I trust her that she didn't send a nude I was just honestly trying to give her a heads up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking she sold a nude for $1,000 even though she swears she didn't?",

I hate it when people are in my personal space myself and I was a good feet away from the man. I started yelling back because the fastest way to trigger blind rage for me is when people start shouting in my face and refused to move from my spot because I wasn't anywhere near the guy to begin with? Felt awkward after because the whole shop was staring at us and was wondering why nobody stepped in was because I was the asshole in this situation. Even after I stopped yelling back, the guy kept talking shit.\n\nThen I noticed the cashier was trying to calm down the customer but I don't understand why these type of establishments don't call the police when deranged individuals start harassing other customers? Especially if the frequent the area enough for you to know their name? But on the other hand, the cashier could've known the guy personally. The area didn't seem sketchy to me at all either. I couldn't tell if the man was drunk or mentally ill (which is already bad enough because of how stigmatized it is). I feel bad now because the man could possibly been mentally ill. You never know what kind of struggles people are going through. I myself am trying to wait until the next semester of uni to get treated for anger issues amongst other personal issues. In hindsight, it would've been better to go to the other side because you never know how dangerous some people are. ",

      "description": "The title might be confusing, but basically my mother and father split when I was born. So they are separated and for as long as I can remember they have been. \n\nMy grandfather on my mother’s side is basically confirmed to pass sometime before the end of this week. I would like to visit him before he passes but my family is in Missouri and I live in California. A last minute round trip flight or even one way is basically $500+ (or $1,000+ for round trip).\n\nI’m a recent college graduate who just entered the biology research field. Any biology major knows that most entry level bio jobs basically do not pay crap. On top of that, I live in LA. I basically don’t get to save much money and will in no way be able to afford or pay off a random $1,000.\n\nI’m in a strange position where I’m more of a lone dog. I am not that social and do not talk to people often, including family. Thus, I can’t just ask my mom’s family for money because they probably would be surprised that I even wanted to go visit one last time. They’re also not rich and obviously a funeral is around the corner.\n\nSo the only real option I think is to ask my father. However, to make things worse, when his father died last year I did not show remorse or even attend the funeral. I had never talked to my dads father so honestly didn’t know anything about him. He was a complete stranger to me. My dad knows this and wasn’t upset I didn’t attend the funeral, but I’m not sure he’d be comfortable paying for me to visit my mother’s father when I showed no such interest towards his own father. \n\nTo make it even MORE complicated, my parents HATE each other. All things point towards it seeming inappropriate to ask my father but I really want to visit my grandfather before he passes... I don’t know what to do or how to ask even if I’m an asshole for doing it TT",

I had brought my laptop and I was showing some of my family members the details of a trip I was taking on it.

      "title": "AITA for complaining about a dog in my building?",
      "description": "For Backstory: Three years ago I lived in a building with a dog who would snarl and bark and claw and dig at the door every time I walked by with my dog. I didn't say anything because I figured the dog was behind a door. One day we were getting off the elevator and that dog attacked us, and my dog suffered a facial injury and definitely some emotional trauma.\n\nNow: I recently moved into a new apartment building with my dog. To get out of the building, we have to walk by a corner apartment where another dog lives. Immediately after we moved in, each time we walked by the door, the dog would snarl and growl and bark and dig at the door so much so that the door would shake, and my dog would cry as she walked past. It was not barking, which I am fine with. Dogs bark, I get it and I really don't care if we are barked at. it sounded like this dog wanted to eat my dog for breakfast, the exact same way that it sounded before she was attacked. I went down to the leasing office after about a week of this and told them my story, and that I just wanted to make them aware that it was happening. I brought them up and we walked past the apartment together and they saw what was happening, and it  really scared them too. My understanding is that they called the woman who lives there to tell her about the issue, but otherwise I don't know what was said. They told me to keep track of the dates and times that the snarling and growling and door shaking happens, which I have been doing just in case we would ever have a problem.\n\nMaybe 3 days later, I saw the woman with her dog and explained to her that it was making me and my dog uncomfortable, and that we were scared because of what was happening. I asked her to help me find some solutions and even offered to pay for a gate to keep the dog away from the door while she was at work. I also offered to do a leashed meet and greet in a neutral place to try to help the situation despite being nervous. I also informed her that my family was a breeder and we were professional trainers, and told her that I was training my dog to walk on the far side of me when we go by the door to try to help the situation. She has been totally furious and rude to me, and completely unwilling to entertain doing anything to help the situation. \n\nLast night we saw them while we were out on our walk. The woman told me to my face how much she didn't like me, because her dog was not aggressive. I am satisfied based on our meet and greet that the dog is not aggressive in a neutral place, but I am not convinced it is not reactive and won't be aggressive in its own home about its own territory. However, based on what I have seen, I do NOT intend to lodge another complaint unless the situation escalates beyond growling and snarling.\n\nI guess this woman's reaction to my complaint took me aback. I feel like if I got that message that my dog was scaring people while I was at work, I would be trying to figure out why, and what she needed to be happier and work on the problem instead of just being angry that someone complained. I think at best the dog is not getting enough exercise or stimulation, which makes me truthfully sad for the pup. I am wondering if I am the ass hole for complaining at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl:Dr\n\nI complained to my building about a dog barking and growling and snarling and digging and shaking the door every time I walk by and scaring me and my dog. AITA?",

      "description": "So back story, me and this girl (Let’s call her Sarah) have been friends for 4 years and have decided to enter a private FWB 6 months ago.  We made it pretty clear that the only condition to be kept was the secrecy of the relationship since we are students involved in a small high school program.  A while back I found out Sarah told a close friend of hers when we were looking through her texts together and she admitted everything we have done to her friend.  At first she tried to say it was a joke, but after some crying to admitted that she did in fact tell him everything. I got upset and really angry, essentially I told her to give me time to calm down and decide if we should still continue even being friends.  Everyone advised me to just suck it up and let it be, so I decided to just that. So my question is, AITA for reacting the way I did? Judge me to hell im pretty sure I can take it since it’s resolved. I still feel very uneasy about the situation and I need some outsider perspective.",

I [33m] work in a large office for a big financial company, and I have a work buddy [24f] with whom I take my breaks and occasionally hang out after work. We've been good friends for four years.\n\nIt is relevant to remark that she is very attractive. She did some modeling in her teens until she got pregnant and had to give that up. I on the other hand am a big, pudgy dude with old injuries &amp; a fetal alcohol syndrome, which makes me look a bit weird.\n\nMy friend is has been single for a while after a string of relationships that went bad after a few months. I only ever see her dating young &amp; very attractive dudes. There has never been anything sexual between her and I. When we first started hanging out she made it abundantly clear that friendship was all she was looking for.\n\nHer and I have talked a lot about her dating problems lately. Recently she was talking with some firefighter dude who she was very excited about until he ghosted her. She was telling me about it yesterday morning on our first break, complaining that she has not gotten laid in weeks, and then she said \"I should delete POF and just fuck you instead.\" I assumed she was joking. I've never been sexually propositioned before, so I responded \"I don't think you have to stoop that low just yet.\" It was immediately obvious that I had upset her. She said \"fuck you,\" got up and walked away. She hasn't talked to me since. \n\nI emailed her to explain myself and apologize, but she never responded. Today as I came in to work I saw all the stuff from her office that I had given to her over the years tossed into the dumpster, and I didn't see her for break this morning.\n\nI still don't think I understand why she's so upset, and I don't understand why we have to end a good friendship over a misunderstanding.

      "description": "For context, I’ve been good friends with this guy since middle school. He and I both went to the same college, and, while I graduated, he’s done a few “victory laps” and is still in school. Also, while I’ve grown up some, at least in my opinion, he is still somewhat immature. Most recently showcased by his current relationship with a high school senior that he met at work. \n\n\nMy fiancée (23) and I (24) recently moved into our first “adult apartment.” So, we were planning on throwing a housewarming/NYE party tomorrow. I naturally extended an invite to my buddy. However, he is now insisting that I allow him to bring his gf or he won’t come. \n\n\nMy issue is her age. While she is 18, she still can’t drink according to the law. I really don’t want to be providing alcohol to a minor, especially a high school student, in the apartment that my fiancée and I, both professionals, reside. It could impact our careers. I feel somewhat hypocritical for that, since I did drink underage frequently, but I just don’t want to put myself in that situation. Also, while I do understand that he is legally allowed to date her, the whole situation is creepy to me, and I don’t want him to think I’m encouraging it. \n\n\nSo, reddit, am I the asshole for drawing this hard line?",

He said they were just meant to hang out at his girlfriend's house with the other couple (gf2 and bf2), the other couple showed up 3 hours late, gf2 wanted to watch a movie they've all seen and make out which my friend said was weird to do that it front of another couple, he said even the other guy was so bored he tried to make up an excuse to leave but gf2 called him out on it.\n\nSo fast forward a bit my friends girlfriend texts me to ask if I was okay, it's normal for her to text me as we are friends too. So I screenshot my conversation with my friend to send to her but before I do, I call him to tell him I was going to let her know what happened and said that he needs to be up front with her about stuff like this, he said don't tell her what happened and that he would talk to her later that night, so instead I told her that my car was overheating but I was fine. \n\nAfter my friend calls her to tell her what happened, she texts me back asking if I lied, I let her know right away what had happened, she called me out for lying and she said she felt like shit because her boyfriend (my friend) left her to be the third wheel with the other couple which even she agreed was getting awkward before he left. We texted back and forth for a bit and she seemed okay with what happened after I finished talking to her.\n\nAm I being the asshole for going along with it and helping him, or is my friend the asshole for getting me involved and not handling the situation the right way.\n\nTLDR\nI lied about my car breaking down and to my friends girlfriend to get him out of a bad double date, afterwards I made him tell her what happened and she got upset for us lying to her.\nAm I the asshole or is my friend for getting me involved?",

      "description": "I'm using an alt as my friend uses reddit as well.\n\nSo last year, I was in a new school and making new friends. I became friends with one of my classmates as we both shared interests in playing an online game. I'll call him Alex in this story. So, fast forward a few weeks, he introduces me to some of his childhood friends who also play this game. For the next few months me, Alex and some of his friends would spend the weekend gaming all day. It was super fun and we all had a great time. I ended up becoming better friends with them and we would go out together, sometimes even without Alex. This carried on until about August last year? Slowly, Alex and I slowly began to drift apart and we ended our friendship in a small argument but that's for a different story. Alex had found a different group of friends that he hung out with. His old friends also began to distance themselves from him due to personal issues as well that I was not involved with.  \n\n\nA few weeks later, I was chatting with one of Alex's friends and he asked me about something Alex told his friend group. \"Hey (my name), so Alex is mad at you for 'stealing' his old friends? He told me it was because of you that they decided not to play with him anymore.\" After hearing this I was confused so I texted Alex about this. I don't have the messages because I switched phones recently but Alex basically says that he was the one who introduced me to his group of friends and now I've stolen them from him. \n\nI still hangout with Alex's old friends and we still play together but Alex has not been in contact with any of them since last year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole in this situation? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "A good friend of mine had his first child a week or so ago. He sent me pictures, I congratulated him and his wife and all is well. We hung out occasionally before his newborn but it wasn’t an every weekend sort of thing. \n\nI get a text “hey would you want to meet my son”. I say “absolutely man!” Genuinely wanting to meet his son and he replies “cool, we have a meal train set up”. I had no idea what that was. Apparently it’s for friends to sign up for a night to cook dinner for friends who don’t have much time to cook meals (new parents, families with children in hospitals, etc.)\n\nHe sends me the link and asks me to pick a date. I do it in the moment, but I’m more and more bothered by how he did it. I’d be more than fine with him saying they’re struggling and it’d be a huge help if I signed up. I guess I have the problem that he opened with using the introduction of his newborn son and it’s really rubbing me the wrong way. Kind of like: Hey want to meet my son? Well come cook me dinner then. \n\nThinking about canceling and I wanted to know how much of an asshole that’d make me. \n\ntldr: My buddy asks if I want to meet his newborn, then uses that to send me a link to his mealtrain asking me to sign up to cook dinner for them for a night and come meet his son.

      "description": "We have a dog. We have to take turns taking her outside to use the bathroom. Yesterday evening he asked me to take her out, but I said no as  it was his turn, and he hadn't taken her out at all that day. He kept begging because he couldn't be bothered, but I was adamant and didn't want to be a push over. \n\nHe eventually came up with the deal that if I took her out then, he would take her out every time the next day and I wouldn't have to take her at all. That sounded like a sweet deal to me, (Taking her out is a bit of a hassle, especially in the current weather) so I accepted and took her out. \n\nI Went to bed that night and by the time I woke at about 5am he was still up but about to head to bed. Just before I left he told me to wake him up when I got home, as I usually take her out as soon as I get back from work, and obviously he'd have to take the shift.\n\nI Arrived home later that day and gently roused him, as I'd been instructed. The first thing he did when he woke was ask me to take the dog out. I Reminded him of the deal but he started moaning that he'd hardly slept and begging me. When I didn't cave in he got very mad, even told me to get out his house at one point. He throws that around all the time when he's angry, so I didn't take him serious. Instead I just went to the bedroom (He's fell asleep on the sofa) and stayed there for the rest of the day. He did take her out not long after that confrontation, but was obviously not happy about it, throwing her lead  across the kitchen and leaving it there in the floor instead of putting it away once he was done.\n\nI Had to go out somewhere that evening, and he still seemed a little annoyed even at that point, refusing to say goodbye to me. I Got home again a few hours later, and once again he asked me to take the dog out as he was in the middle of an online game. I Simply Responded with, \"You know what I'm gonna say..\" So he just told me to get out. Now once again, I am banished to the bedroom on my own, where I sit and write this right now, and he is again in a mood with me.\n\nSo, am I being unnecessarily stubborn by wanting to stick to our deal? Should I have just done what he said?\n\nIf I can defend myself for a moment, I wanna say that I did this out of principle. It wasn't that I just couldn't be bothered taking her, it's that I don't want to be to be a pushover like I have been in this and past relationships. My fiancé is kinda manipulative and good and getting me to bend to his will, so I wanted to start making a stand and end that pattern.\n\nBut, it's for you to judge.",

      "description": "I am a senior year undergraduate, and our college has several in-campus hostels. Each student is allotted a hostel to live in, and there aren't any better places to live around our campus.\n\nThis incidence happened a few months ago. I didn't want a roommate, but I arrived late for my semester registration, so, they only had one double room available. So, I and my batchmate, who I didn't know very well, decided to share that room. A few weeks passed, and we were getting along pretty well. But, he almost always seemed high on something or the other, which was not a problem for me on the condition that whatever he did shouldn't affect me. But, he would always be moaning and making weird sounds and doing some stupid stuff which was disturbing.\n\nHe was a chronic smoker, and I am a non-smoker. And smoking is not allowed in our hostel. I didn't have any problem with him smoking. My only condition was that he shouldn't smoke inside my room.\n\nDays passed, and things started to fall apart between us. I always tried to be patient with him and often compromised, even with his ridiculous demands. One of his requirements was to switch the lights off whenever he wanted to sleep, which would sometimes be pretty early. Irrespective of whether I was studying or working. But, I complied and started using a small table lamp instead of room lights whenever he used to sleep. After doing this for a few days, he asked me even to keep the table lamp switched off. I did that for the night he asked me to do so. Things started to escalate that night when he asked me to change the orientation of my bed and table so that the light from my laptop won't disturb him. It was painful to rearrange a bed and study-table, and I was working, so, I said that I would do it in a day or two. When he insisted, I strictly told him that I wouldn't do it.\n\nNext day, he was in a bad mood because of last night. So, he started smoking inside the room to irritate me. He didn't stop at that. It was a hot and humid summers day, and he began by closing all the doors and windows of our room (while he was smoking). The switches to control lights and fan in our room was on his side of the room, so, he switched them off and told me that I couldn't switch them on as I was no longer allowed on his side of the room. I warned him 10-12 times to stop doing this, but he didn't listen.\n\nSo, I took a videotaped him smoking in the room and sent an entire narration of the events of that day along with the proof. Soon, they allotted me a new room, and he was expelled from our hostel while our examinations were going on. It's a tedious process to get a new hostel, so, he was probably left homeless. The warden reported him to the Dean of Student Affairs. I didn't follow up on what happened to him after that.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hi, all. I'm going to be a little deliberately vague about specifics, because my partner is a Redditor, too. \n\nWe're both in our 20s and have been together for nearly a decade. We just relocated to a new city for SO's career, but are making very little money and it's tough to make ends meet sometimes. We currently both work in the gig economy, so income can be unpredictable from week to week. SO comes from a wealthy family, and it's their family who is helping us out with our rent, so our primary expenses are food, gas, groceries, and utilities. \n\nWell, my SO is crazy irresponsible with finances, even with the little money we do have. Part of it isn't in their control, because they have a mental illness, and one of the main symptoms is compulsively spending. So I feel bad for criticizing their habits... but on the other hand, because SO comes from a wealthy background, I also feel that they have no concept of what it's like to budget. My SO has never had to penny-pinch or sacrifice to make ends meet. I came from a family that wasn't nearly as privileged, and regularly had to make money stretch from paycheck to paycheck.\n\nBecause of their habits, I'm completely in charge of our finances, and I hate it. SO begs me every day to eat out, or to \"treat ourselves\" because they worked hard or had a stressful day. I do empathize, but it's just not financially responsible for us. What really drives me crazy is when they beg to go out for food when we already have stuff at home. I'll even list the things we have, but they will insist that they just aren't hungry for those things. It makes me want to scream, \"So what?! Tough it out!\" But I never do. Sometimes I just give in because I'm tired of arguing about it every fucking day. \n\nSometimes to make our money stretch until payday, I skip meals. My SO never does, and that makes me resent them, if I'm totally honest.\n\nBecause when I do suggest we be more frugal, they get really upset. They always say that, in the worst case scenario, their parents will send us money. I'm appreciative of the help they already give us, I don't want them to give us anymore. I really want us to stick it out for ourselves. But they say that I'm the asshole for making them stressed over a \"non issue.\"\n\nI love my partner more than anything in the world, but it makes me really concerned for our financial future.",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for over 4 years now. He’s always been the kind of guy that always want to spend time with me and be with me. We live together and he says he sleeps the best whenever I’m by his side. \n\nSo the remainder of my family members from Vietnam is finally moving to America after waiting for over a decade. This will be the first time my whole family is together in over 20 years. I’m picking them up Thursday night and I told my boyfriend I wanted to spend the night with them. He asked me why don’t I just come home after spending time with them? And sleep on Saturday since he doesn’t work on weekends? I told him there’s no point since our apartment is further away from my workplace than my parents’ house. I thought it would be a smart idea to just stay there and go to work in the morning. He started to get mad saying he can’t sleep without me and he has to wake up at 5am for work and I’m being selfish and thinking about myself. I told him it’s my family I’m allowed to go see them if I want to. And then he said, “fine do what u want. Ima do me” and I said that he was being petty and mean. And he had the audacity to say, “other bitches don’t think so” and I’m like “fine go ahead. I don’t care anymore. I’m sick of the way you speak to me.” So I ran out into the living room crying. I decided to sleep out here for the night. He comes out and says he’s been super stressed out because of work and I’m the only person who can help him get his mind off it, but instead of finding ways to help reduce his stress, I’m being selfish.  So he said not to speak to him and that he’s going to ignore me for a couple of weeks.  I don’t know how serious he was being because he tends to say stuff when he’s angry. But I don’t know if I’m wrong for not considering his feelings or what? Am I the asshole here? \n\nTDLR: Will be reunited  with family from Vietnam on Thursday. Wanted to spend the night with them. Asked boyfriend. Boyfriend is stressed and needs me home so he flipped out when I asked and told  me not to speak to him and  that he will ignore me for a few weeks.",

I don’t mind watching him because he’s not a bad kid but I am tired of not getting anything in return for it. There isn’t even gratitude on her part for me doing this for her.

      "description": "          I (M16) had previously asked this girl (F16) out and had been rejected. She asked to remain friends and we did. 6 months later I had reason to believe that my feelings were mutual, and thus I asked her out again (in person this time). This time around she said yes. For the next three days, everything was great. We planned a date and there was plenty of conversation (texts). Then, out of the blue she sent me a message which basically said that she was breaking up with me because it was \"more of a best friend situation\" and asking if we could still be friends. I felt very betrayed.\n           In the weeks after this, I steadily cut off communication with her. I was not mean or aggressive, just cordial. My brother has said that I was unjustified in doing so. For reference, this happened over a year ago. If you have any questions, ask away.",

      "description": "2 and a half years ago my (M26) father passed away unexpectedly at a very young age. After he passed in the first few months it was obviously very hard for me and my brother (M22) to cope with, as we both lived with him in his house full time. \n\nAfter he passed, me and my brother decided to let the house foreclose with no repercussions to either of our names. We just couldn’t afford his high mortgage as I was finishing up school and him just starting. \n\nMy father did have a large life insurance policy (about 110k) left for me and my brother to split 50/50. \n\nRight after he passed I told/promised my brother we would buy our own house and start fresh. However after looking for about 3-4 months, time was running thin on how soon the bank would repossess my fathers house and left us no choice but to start renting. \n\nFast forward to present day, we are still living in the same apartment. And after some vacations here and there along with paying our rent with the insurance money and not living as frugally as we should have,we are left with about 40k to still split. \n\nA short time after my dad passing, I met a wonderful girl and have been dating ever since. We are now at the point where me and her have been looking for houses because we both have good/steady income and are at the point in our relationship/lives we are ready to settle down together and take these next steps. \n\nMy brother on the other hand, works about 30-35 hours part time making slightly above minimum wage, not making enough to cover half a mortgage/bills etc. \n\nMy brother is now upset that I walked back on my word. Telling me he has 20k in the bank and he can afford it. \n\nThe thing is, once his “honey pot” runs out, this will leave me to flip the majority of the bills. \n\nI offered him to move in with us for the time being, only charging him our utility bills. \n\nI recommended to him to put his half of the insurance money in a new account and told him not to touch it until he himself is ready to buy a house of his own, and pay the utilities in my home with his personal income and save up in the mean time. Until he locked down a well paying full time job. \n\nWhen my father passed we were just kids who didn’t know what we were doing and we were about to take on a mortgage we had no business getting into at the time. We just figured we would buy together because we had “all this money.”  \n\nAITA for walking back my word and deciding to buy with my partner instead of him?\n",

      "description": "One of my coworkers is obviously bulimic. Anytime after she eats, she goes to the bathroom that's not very far away from my desk and throws it back up. She's losing a lot of weight fast, too. Which is none of my business. But the fact that she's using the bathrooms to purge is really nasty. I feel for her if she has a mental illness, but it doesn't mean it's okay for her to just blatantly do that in public like that. She also sprays a ton of air freshener after she does it. I've gone in afterwards and it's not like there's vomit still in the toilet/all over or anything, so she does clean up.\n\nI'm not trying to sound heartless or like I don't care about her as a person, FYI. I do care which is exactly why I ended up going to my supervisor behind a closed door and letting him know that I was concerned about Coworker's behavior and gave him enough examples and what to look out for so he didn't have to just go off my word alone. \n\nWell a few days ago he approached Coworker and let her know that someone had raised concern about her throwing up and he wanted to check in with her and see if she was sick, etc. Since then she has kept very quietly to herself and hasn't really talked to anyone in the office outside of normal office duties. We are usually a vibrant office so it's noticeable. \n\nWell today she did it again and I approached my supervisor about it and he sat down and gave her an official warning I guess because she came out crying and left early. \n\nAm I The Asshole?

      "description": "From a young age, really as far back as I can remember, my dad has had severe anger issues that he's never sought help for, despite encouragement from our family. He berates my mother and I constantly for our choices, and blows up in anger when we make our own decisions rather than being agreeable to what he thinks we should do. I have tattoos and piercings, and am pursuing a career in cosmetology. I don't expect him to like the way I look at all, but he frequently goes as far as calling me ugly and shameful to the family. He shames my mother for her weight and appearance, although he himself is overweight and is starting to experience related health problems. He's very openly sexist and racist, and in the past I've found Nazi-related memorabilia in our garage. \n\nI constantly walk on eggshells in my house. I've tried to have conversations about how it upsets me that he treats us the way he does. It's a bit of a losing battle - he resorts to yelling and talking over people when faced with confrontation, and feels that because he's a man and, in his words, provides for the family financially, he has the right to dictate my mom's life and mine. (My mother works a full time job, as well as doing all of the cooking and housework. I pay my share of food and bills and am working on moving out.) I do my best to stay civil, but have admittedly gotten upset and screamed back before.\n\nDespite living in the same house with my parents, my father and I don't speak. My mom knows that when I move out, I plan on cutting contact fully with my dad, and she supports this decision. I've accepted that my relationship with my dad will never be what I want it to.\n\nWhat's been stuck on my mind recently is this - when I get married, I do not want my father at the wedding. The rest of my family will be welcome, butI know that having him there would essentially ruin the day for me and everyone else. He's a heavy drinker, even in public, which only makes his anger worse. I have no interest in having a relationship with him, and frankly don't feel like he deserves to come to my wedding.\n\nWhat stops me from being confident with my decision is an overwhelming sense of guilt. My dad has made allusions to having depression before, mostly in regards to the way that our family treats him. (My mom and I are not the only ones who have to face his wrath, and he doesn't have a good relationship with anyone in our family.) I do sometimes feel like he says these things to purposefully make me feel guilty - and it works. In the past, I've felt guilty enough to try to salvage a relationship with him - which never lasts, and the cycle repeats. \n\nI'm afraid that not being invited to his only daughter's wedding would push him over the edge. As terrible as it seems, part of me simply doesn't care after all that he's put me through.\n\nWIBTA?",

      "description": "Lemme preface this with the fact that I feel really fucking bad about this and just want to know if I am in the wrong\n\nSome Context: I am a female freshman in high school, and I run cross country. I have a couple friends on the team, but I started running with this junior dude. (He's one of my brothers friends so I kind of already knew him before cross country started) For a while, thats all it was. Just two people running together and having normal conversations. \n\nOk heres the story: One day when my brother couldn't drive me home from cross country practice, junior dude offered to walk with me. Whenever I had to walk, this dude would walk with me. Then he started insisting on buying me slurpees because \"he knew I always got them after practice\". (At the time, I didn't realize this was weird)  \n\nSome days after cross country practice, I would have soccer practice, and I would go with another girl from the team. One soccer practice, my coach told me that we would have a scrimmage (half of the team against the other half, and I would be playing against the girl). So, this girl and I were pretty competitive. We started hyping this stupid scrimmage up, and I guess Johnny didn't realize it was really just a scrimmage. HE ACTUALLY SHOWED UP. THIS BITCH SHOWED UP TO OUR SCRIMMAGE AND HE JUST WATCHED US PRACTICE. (Once again, I didn't realize that this was weird)\n\nThat weekend he showed up to my soccer tournament and afterwards he asked me to homecoming in front of the whole team. I said yes, completely taken aback (I barely knew this dude) so I said yes. (I thought we'd just be going as friends, so I thought nothing of it) But I also didn't really want to go to homecoming, so I was dreading going. \n\nThen he dms me on instagram: \"I've never had a real gf before.\" Bro I just about started dying. WHAT THE FUCK. Ok then I spent like 2 hrs drafting a reply to say: \"Um we're not dating\" But before I can reply, he says \"Have you told anyone yet? I've told all the guys from cross country about us.\" That was the only thing I realized was off. I was upset, because I wasn't aware that any of this was happening and now everyone knew about something that didn't even exist. So yeah that was great\n\nSo the next day he told me that we should go buy tickets and I decided that I would tell him then that I didn't want to go, so I did. I told him that dances stressed me out (because I didn't want him to know that I found him creepy) and that I didn't want to go. He didn't just say, \"oh ok thats fine\" or anything he said \"you just need to get over your fear, once you do, then we can buy tickets but if todays not good than another day is fine.\" I don't think he realized what I meant, so I repeated myself. I told him I didn't want to go to the dance. He replied, \"I know, but you will, and when you do, we can buy tickets.\" I was so confused so I just said ok and left to go to class. We haven't talked since.  I feel terrible, but I want to know if, when, and where  I did anything morally wrong, because my dad keeps telling me I was so rude to him to say yes and then change my mind, but I think that I have the right to do that. So yeah. ",

I was in a hurry and frustrated so I went back up to my apartment and wrote a quick note along the lines of: \"Hey, please don't do this again or I'll get the supers to cut your lock. But for today, I'll just return the favor and keep your bike in place too. I'll be unlocking it this evening at 7 PM.\"\nI then went back down, taped the note to the seat and locked our bikes together. My commute was a 30 min walk. I got to work late. Finally, I come back home and go to unlock the bikes. My tires are slashed. Like seriously? What do I do now? I live in a large building so I don't even know the owner of this bike. I'm probably going to talk to the superintendent but am also considering leaving my number on the bike so we can talk this out. But who's the asshole here?",

AS fought M when D was abusive. \n- D got help and stopped but AS continued cycle of  emotional &amp; mental abuse to me.\n- intervention for AS led M+D to my settled on “just don’t speak of you’re gonna be a dick” (this isn’t enough for me and have since gone no contact)\n- M+D don’t want to talk about our estrangement or the past decade of abuse. D is more open to admitting his wrongs and calling out AS. \n- I’m depressed/spiralling over dismissal of abuse/the sweeping it under the rug.\n- Over the weekend I had a lot of self hatred, negative thoughts and trauma pop back up (as a result of prev point). Now to the story.\n\nI got into an argument with my mother. I blamed her for not seeing the abuse and not protecting me. I hold a lot of anger and resentment over it &amp; told her (while screaming &amp; yes I know not helpful) that I can’t trust her and I resent the years of abuse that went unchecked.

Today I caught her talking to someone on the phone and crying about her family. \n\nAITA? Is this resentment I hold for her unwarranted? Should I not have gone off despite the times when I say it calmly it’s ignored?\n\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend is currently in grad school about 300 miles away. He struggles with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as well as ADD. We were open about our respective struggles with mental illness, and he’d shared the warning signs he was in a bad place. I’d asked what to do if I didn’t know he was okay, especially if he was away at school. He said, “Keep trying to reach me. I’ll come out of it eventually.”\n\nThe last time I saw him - mid-February, pre-Valentine’s Day - was great! Despite him being sick, we talked for hours on the phone. When I arrived, he soon fell asleep in my arms. He was affectionate, attentive, was reluctant to let me go (it was a Sunday, and I had work the next morning) because “no, it’s still Saturday, your phone must be wrong, so you don’t have to go” and “I’ll miss you.” He was almost clingy. He said he couldn’t wait until spring break to visit again. After a hug and kiss goodnight, I headed home.\n\nThe next day, things felt off when we texted. I asked him if he was distracted and we needed to talk later.\n\nHe admitted he was off a mood stabilizer (which I didn’t know he took) and felt distant but that there wasn’t anything to worry about and - even though it might take two weeks or so - he’d be back to his regular self soon.\n\nThings were strained, but we spoke. Some days were better than others. He wished me a Happy Valentine’s Day despite feeling awful. I reminded him I was proud of him communicating when his anxiety was high. He was still very kind and appreciative of me, albeit much quieter.\n\nThen I hadn’t heard from him in almost two weeks. I tried to reach out - sending words of encouragement - but no replies. Calls went to voicemail.\n\nSo I hit a breaking point. As a girlfriend, I was fed up. His anxiety was triggering mine. As a friend, I was worried. I needed to be sure he was okay.\n\nI called his school’s campus security to request a wellness check.\n\nThat’s when it happened:\n\n“Did you call the school?”\n\nGood, he’s okay!\n\nI tried to call.\n\n“Please don’t call me again. I just came home to security and police and got interrogated.”\n\n...what? I didn’t realize it’d be that intense. I thought it’d just be one security officer knocking on his door, just seeing that he was alive?\n\nI responded: “I didn’t know if you were okay. I’m so sorry this made you uncomfortable.”\n\nHe ended it with “Please leave me alone.”\n\nI haven’t replied. I’m giving him space. I’m heartbroken.\n\nAITA for requesting a wellness check? Was I selfish?",

She has been in a relationship she hasn’t wanted for a couple years now and has gone as far as cheating on him twice. But she won’t break up with him because she considers him her safety net. She also hates her job but is comfortable there so she won’t look for a new one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is clearly unhappy with her position in life and she takes it out on the people who are closest to her, me and the boyfriend. She constantly pushes me away, doesn’t respond to my texts (or responds with one word answers), makes jokes out of serious questions, and can be very manipulative/cruel when she gets angry. At points in our friendship she has \"tested me\" by telling me it's okay we reschedule and then getting mad and giving me the silent treatment when I do. She is also extremely jealous of the friendships that I have with other people and will give me the silent treatment when I start doing the same activities with them as I would with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately she has started to make “jokes” about her death. Saying things along the lines of “what are you going to bury me in?” and “it won’t be long now, I’m not going to make it to 30.” These jokes are making me and other friends uncomfortable since she has a history of depression. When I told her that the jokes were stressing me out and I asked her if I needed to be concerned, she tried to make a joke out of it and gave me a vague answer. When I told her that I was looking for a serious answer she got upset and gave me the silent treatment for a week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo sum it all up, I am worried about her and I’ve tried to make that clear on several occasions (not just the one mentioned) but this relationship is starting to be stressful and I’m losing my patience. This is not the first time she has given me the cold shoulder when she is starting to enter a bad place because she is unhappy with her life.

      "title": "AITA for moaning about the roof being faulty? rest of family dont seem to care and making me seem like im the problem.",
      "description": "Little bit of back story on the house before we get into it, the house is a typical 1970's built house in Britain, the houses were built to an \"okay\" standard but corners were definitely cut. Our house is no exception to this; especially when it came to the roof. The people who built it back in the 70's used less rows of tiles than they needed to in order to cut costs. 1/2 of the houses on the estate are like this as they did it half way through building the estate. Ours was one of the last to be built hence it had less tiles than it should have.\n\nWe had the roof repaired a couple of month ago due to it being very deteriorated, partly due to age but also down to inherent problems mentioned above. When the roofing works were being done the roofers in there infinite wisdom decided to do it whilst it was raining, obviously this caused damage inside the house. The bathroom ceiling and my parents room ceiling were hit the hardest with the inside roofs being soaked. Luckily mine was completely fine despite water coming down off the light fitting and onto the bed. \n\nOriginally the roofers said they would sort any damages through their insurance and my parents though nothing of it. Fast forward the next day and the Forman comes over and says that due to the roof being in such a poor state they wouldn't be paying any of it. \n\nThey then showed us pictures of the roof and it was worse than we thought, the plasterboard was black with mould. But inside of the house showed literally no signs of damage what so ever until the roofers let a rain storm inside the house \n\nMy parents were obviously not happy about this and I was very, very angry to the point at which I was willing to get trading standards involved but my parents came to an agreement with the forman to knock off a portion of the bill to cover the expenses of the ceilings needing to be replastered. This amount was not enough to cover this but ultimately if we had took this to the insurers they would probably not have paid it. \n\nThe roofers carried on and finished the works and I can't fault the rest of the work they did, they did it quickly and safely. We were left with a new roof that should last us another 40+ years. Cool. Due to my parents not having a lot of money I chipped in about half the value of the roof, as I wanted to help plus its my roof too. \n\nFast forward to the present day and ive woken up in the middle of the night and its the first lot of wind we have had since the roof was done and I hear a banging every 10 seconds(ish). Being as I have lived in this house for 15+ years at this point I know every sound this house can make and didn't recognise this one. I couldn't get back to sleep as this sound was too loud and unfamiliar and I can't go to sleep when there is noise. (once asleep im fine).\n\nSo in the morning I go and tell my parents this and tell them I think one of the tiles is loose at the back of the house right above my room. if left unchecked this could loosen other tiles and cause a major roof leak plus its really annoying having a banging noise 2m's above you every 5-10 seconds. it's only a matter of time before this becomes more of a problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere reaction is what has got me annoyed, first they tell me I'm imagining things then they say \"oh its just the wind\". The last roof did not do this and had it done so I would have been well aware of it. I ask them are they going to do anything about it and they just shrug their shoulders and say its not really an issue. It is an issue!!!! \n\nI have got quite annoyed with them about this as they making it seem like I'm just doing this to be a problem and that I'm blowing this out of proportion when in fact I'm doing it so that we don't have to spend more time and money fixing a problem that shouldn't be there in the first place. At the moment they don't seem to have any intention of fixing this issue and it really pissing me off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR I paid for part of the roof to be fixed on my parents house that I live in. There is a problem with some of tiles being loose above my room and its making a noise that is keeping me up at night. They don't want to accept that there is an issue and are acting like I'm being an asshole for not wanting to put up with this. \n\nAm I being too sensitive and making a mountain out of mole hill or is my reaction justified being as it could literally destoy my room and everything in it if they don't get it sortedt?",

We just celebrated the birth of our son slightly under 2 months ago after moving thousands of miles away from our original home. I don't have a \"sterotypical\" military job (its office work), but i still have to do military things like mandatory meetings after hours, and working out any designated time between 730 am to 430 pm, mon-fri. (Its a sweet gig, not complaining) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also studying for the next rank which involves a test of my job and a test of my branch's military history. I usually work and come home for lunch and study for an hr or so when i get off work. My wife never makes my breakfast or lunch and very seldom makes my dinner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe only have 1 income, I don't make a lot but i try to have food in the fridge that can be cooked. A lot of times my wife will casually ask, \"can I put the dishes away\" or \"take dog out\" or \"change diaper\". When it comes to our child, I'm not really complaining about doing anything. But my baby is a baby that sleeps a lot. Yes, baby wakes up through night and has to be fed, and my wife takes care of that, but baby still sleeps afterwards and throughout the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm i wrong for not wanting to do chores? I do trash and shovel snow. But for the inside of the house. I can get she is sleep deprived, tired, and did have a whole human come out of her. But I really feel like if I'm working at a job and trying to study for this test, I almost shouldn't have to do anything. I don't like making my own breakfast, lunch or dinner. But i will since I did that as a bachelor. I'm not trying to be misogynistic, but I kind of want a more traditional role. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have brought this up with her, we have gone to counseling, although it has been a month since last session. but for the casual requests, part of me is just like \"it's just loading the dishwasher, not a big deal\". I ultimately feel, Im paying all the bills, and giving her an allowance for her to raise our kid, sometimes clean, and binge watch streaming services while I also help around the house and \"fend\" for myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you all think?

      "description": "This one should be cut and dry because you have the entire interaction word for word below from the subreddit in question. I know it's unusual to ask AITA about a post on another subreddit here, but that subreddit does not have a lot of subscribers and i wanted to know if my downvotes/his upvotes would hold up in a larger audience. \n\nSome background info: The subreddit is about \"where delicious whole and raw foods are discussed,\" but often gets used by a popular grocery chain. This chain was purchased by Amazon in a historic move that was considered fairly controversial (or at least disruptive to status quo) but customers, team members (store staff), and vendors/brands. As a result someone asked, \"How has working at Whole Foods changed now that Amazon owns it?\"\n\n**Top comment was**: \n\"it hasn't, except for the never ending fucking comments from customers about how much everything has changed.\"\n\n**I replied**: \n\"Worked for a brand carried by WFM and I can say for a fact that this comment is incorrect. There have definitely been changes from a vendor side (massive changes that have changed brand ability to interact with customers) and at the store level (changes that impact how team members treat customers, mostly because of how job performance is evaluated). Did you forget about \"order to shelf\" and the bare shelves that came with it? Did you forget about dropping Pruvi as a demo scheduling system and instituting Daymon Interactions? Did you forget about the dozens of articles detailing how team members felt like robots constantly checking boxes to satisfy objectives unrelated (and in some cases counter-productive) to good customer service? Which region/store are you thinking of specifically?\n\nAt a surface level things haven't changed terribly, but at its core WFM is not the same and to a close observer the changes are clear.\"\n\n**His/her reply:** \n\"jeez, get off your high horse. you don't even fucking work there.\"\n\n**My reply, which was not responded to:** \n\"No actual responses to customer/vendor complaints? Just admonishment? Not great, man.\n\nFor the record, I love the store and most team members. I think changes have made things incredibly difficult for some people (team members, vendors, brands, and customers alike) and that shouldn't be ignored. If nothing has changed in your store, that's awesome, but my response was not intended to be a \"high horse\" response as much as it was supposed to inform people who were genuinely curious about the changes made.\n\nGrocery vendors were also hit with a 3% surcharge per order and Whole Body brands were hit with a 5% surcharge per order. These additional costs make it hard for smaller, local brands to support themselves on WFM shelves. Companies that depended on their success based on growing in WFM have died. That stuff directly impacts what customers get to buy.\n\nSo while I don't work there, I do know what has gone on and since the OP asked what the differences are, I answered his/her question.\n\nNot trying to start a beef, but don't you see how some of these changes have serious impact?\"\n\nSO... Am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "So I really need to know if I’m the asshole here. And it’s actually a hard thing for me to determine cause it’s with my parents, and they aren’t exactly the nicest people. I would classify my mother as a narcissist, but they fuck with my head too much for me to know exactly if I’m the shit kid they say I am or if they are actually shit people. (If it matters, I’m almost 30). \n\n\nSo. Without much background my sister moved back with my parents after leaving a less than desirable relationship. My mom seems to have a habit of opening peoples mail. She does it with her and and my younger brother. (I was kicked out by 18 so I’ve never dealt with this.) My sister doesn’t want it to happen, but won’t say anything cause she is constantly walking on eggshells at home. I didn’t really know the extent of it all. Anyways, I was angry for my sister and called my mom out on it. Simply said. “Stop opening her mail, she deserves her privacy”. She message me later that night saying “I knew who it was from, and told her immediately. But I get the message.” I was alseep. \n\n\nThe next day my sister starts freaking out on me asking what I said, she knew I sent the first message, and why would I say anything. Apparently my mom attacked her for what I said and was refusing to help babysit (something they offered to do if she moved in with them to save money) in the new year because of what I said. My sister obviously threw me under a bus and claimed she had no idea and that I was angry on behalf of her. My sister then told me she’s never telling me shit again and that I’m never to say anything to her about what we say. Fair. \n\n\n\nSo I talk to my mom, never mentioning what my sister said. And apparently she’s appalled at my first message, asked if I wished to change my stance. I replied no and that my stance is the same, she shouldn’t open peoples mail without their permission, etc. she never once said she was sorry, and just played a victim. She said “I don’t deserve these comments” (I literally told her that she shouldnt open peoples mail without their permission.) I then said “you did something wrong, but don’t deserve comments saying you were wrong?” And she told me she was going to work and that was the end. So I said ok. \n\n\n\n5 minutes later I get a message from my step dad telling me how I butt my nose into business that’s not mine, my sister doesn’t care about the opening of the mail it was something else she was angry about, my main goal in life is to trash my mother (it’s my mo didn’t you know), he took a moment when I thought we connected in my moms shitty behavior and threw it in my face saying “your mom never did that” oh and “if you pass this on to your mother see how you and I get along I think the future”. \n\n\n\nI immediately told him to never contact me again. And blocked them all through social media and texting. My sister hasn’t said anything to me since early this afternoon, and that weird. My younger brother is talking to me but he’s away at college so I don’t think they’d say anything to him. \n\n\n\nDid I fuck up? Is this on me? Should I apologize? I don’t want to. But I feel like maybe I am the shitty person they say I am. Iunno? Please tell me. I’m so mentally exhausted. ",

      "description": "To start off I go to college and have two roommates that live with me. We are all friends and have been for 2 years now. My dad owns the house but I’m the landlord so I take care of most of the work around the house because it’s my house and I’m just more invested and like things to be clean.\n\nWe have lived together for about 8 months and we have only gotten in about 10 arguments. All of these arguments have been about the cleanliness of the house. They leave dirty dishes in the sink, garbage on the counter, don’t take out the trash, don’t empty/start the dishwasher, and whenever there is a mess of dishes out or in the sink they blame the other person and I end up cleaning it because it pisses me off. Most of the time I have caused none of the mess. They have also done none of the cleaning of the floor while I have swept/swifferred/vacuumed about 8 times this year and they only help a little when I bitch at them.\n\nSo about a week ago I came home from class and the kitchen was a mess. Dishes all over the kitchen and in the sink and none were mine. I texted them both and said I was tired of mothering them and I’m not cleaning up the kitchen. They both claimed that none of the mess was theres and they wouldn’t do it. That pissed me off and I called them out by saying “so you’re just gonna assume I will do it? And what about the floors? They haven’t been cleaned in a while and there are rocks and dirt all over the floor. Were you just gonna wait until I caved and did it for the 10th time?” There response was that because I had friends over for one night about a week before, I should have to do it all.  And to clarify they are friends with my friends also and we’re hanging out with us all. I told them they were full of shit and until they cleaned the whole house, I was going to start living like them.\n\nI no longer take out the trash, I don’t sweep the floors, I don’t throw away garbage, I don’t start it empty the dishwasher, and every single plate, pot, pan or utensil I used would be left out until they cleaned the house. I then told them if They didn’t want to help then they could find a new place to live. They said they weren’t going to clean and I told them to start looking for a new place because there lease is up in 2 months.\n\nHousing where we live is terrible and they will most likely have to move into a small apartment where the rent is more expensive. I don’t feel bad at all because I’m my opinion it shouldn’t be this big of a deal to clean the house that you live in.\n\nThey think I’m an asshole for blowing up out of nowhere but these arguments have been on and off all year with no changes on their part.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I stayed true and told them to get the fuck out?\n",

      "description": "Tl;dr at the bottom. \n\nMy girlfriend moved in with me about a year ago. We've been together now for over 5 years. I plan to ask her to marry me in March, we have a wonderful relationship and I want to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\nThe only major fights we've had have been about her sister who is narcissistic, controlling and a leech.\n\nMy girlfriend has a small, cute pomeranian who she left with her mother and sister when she moved in with me. They agreed to take care of the dog. The little dog is like a child to her.  She stops by their house almost daily to feed him and spend time with him.  \n\nBut her pet is getting on in years (almost 14) and he's been getting sick quite often lately. The little dog got sick again this morning and my girlfriend and her mom and sister got into a huge fight over it and they accused her of not taking care of her pet. Her mom also made her feel guilty about having to pay for the dog's medical bills, even though she's paid her back every cent. My girlfriend is currently studying full time while working 3 part time jobs to pay for her studies and expenses. Since she's moved in with me I pay for everything except her medical aid and car. I'm a teacher so I'm not extremely rich either.\n\nThe dog got terribly sick again today and he was struggling to breath. My girlfriend and I rushed him to the Veterinary hospital and they placed him in an incubator of sorts to help him breath. He has to stay over-night as he has severe swelling in his throat so the vet couldn't diagnose him yet.\n\nIn total she's spent over $5000 over the last year on veterinary bills (about $600 today) . Today after we got home I told her that we can't afford to keep paying his bills and that she will have to make a decision on euthanizing him if he gets sick again.\n\nTl;dr - my girlfriend's dog is old and sick and I suggested she should euthanize him.

      "description": "So one of my girlfriend's long time guy \"friends\" hit her up asking her to come over and hook up. He knows we're together, and he also has a girlfriend. She said no of course, but still. This bothers the shit out of me and I told her I'm not cool with it and I don't want her to keep hanging around him. She then explained they'd been friends for around ten years and they'd been fuck buddies at certain points throughout that timeframe. What really bothers me and hurts like hell is that when I mentioned I wouldn't really wanna stay with her if she continues being cool with him, she was fine with it. She basically said she absolutely refuses to stop being cool with him even though she knows I'm not comfortable with it at all. She made every excuse in the book. \"oh I said no and I don't think he'll try again,\" \"oh we've been friends for years,\" \"oh he didn't know we were serious,\" \"oh he was just drunk.\" But I don't care, he blatantly disrespected me, her and our relationship and I don't want her having anything to do with him since he sees her that way and clearly doesn't care. She kept making exxuses and I kept explaining to her that he's not even a good friend if he'd try something like that. She wouldn't have it and basically said she wouldn't drop him even if it meant losing me. She's basically choosing some toxic piece of trash guy \"friend\" who tries to fuck her while she's with me and he has a girlfriend. It's not just me, this is TOTALLY fucked, right??",

      "description": "Hi! I want to know if I'm just being crazy about this or what (throwaway account tho). On mobile so I apologise for any formatting mistake. (Kinda TL;dr at the end)\n\nBackground: Me (M24) and my wife (F25) have been married for almost a year, and in the last year we had to move out of our home country (not by choice, more of a necessity) and start a living in a country where you HAVE to work for someone (not freelance) in order to be able to stay legally. \n\nWhen we first arrive, I started working (she kinda the same) and most of our shared income was being saved for moving out from where we were staying. We manage to move out, both got better paying jobs but we were still using our shared income  to buy basic things (a bed, cooking utensils, etc). Fast forward a few months and we are settled.\n\nThe income: (in USD but with are not in the US) hers: about 660$, mine: about 810$\n\nThe discussion: about 3 months ago we finally started having savings (woohoo) and I told her that we should start saving some money, she agreed BUT she started to spend more money on trivial things (more clothes, street food, etc). I asked her to stop spending in those things and she went berserker about how she works ALL week, more than me (it is true, my job is calm, hers not), and that is HER money, and I can't do anything about it.\nI got upset and asked her why did she think it as her money, and not ours, and that if she wanted to have \"her\" money and me not complaining, she should have to pay for half of our living expenses (I was paying pretty much everything related to living at that point). She went bananas, telling me awful things (which she admitted, but did not apologise) and finally agreeing on... Do nothing. (I'm weak, I know)\n\nBut SOMETHING did change, and this month she started paying some things (not half but it does help), but her buying obsession is the same (every month she HAS to buy clothes, and eat outside at least 3 times a month).\n\nTHE PROBLEM: (TL;DR) I found a better job which I'll be starting next week,  and in that job my salary will be around 1325$, and now she is saying that I have to pay everything because I make a lot more (paying everything I still have more than her), and I casually mentioned again about splitting expenses and she got all defensive (I just want to have some savings ;_;)\n\nAITA for wanting to EQUALLY split our expenses?\n\nP.d: if I have any grammar errors please correct me, English is not my first language\n",

      "description": " Ok so long story short, we've been together almost 2 years now and it's  been lovely. He's sweet and caring and just always there for me, I adore  him. When we got together, he was recently divorced, but his ex and him  had been separated for years, the papers just hadn't been signed until  more recently due to custody issues. I knew this and was ok with it, my  parents did something similar and it all worked out fine. So, his ex and  I became friends on facebook because of pictures of their son and I  felt like it was a gesture of goodwill. I haven't had too many problems  with her, but recently I noticed that the pictures she'll post sometimes  are pictures that my boyfriend will take of sights we've seen recently,  and stuff that he's also shared with me in one of our mutual photo  albums. None of these adventures and trips involve their son. It's  really bothering me, and I haven't talked about it with him yet, because  I don't want to overreact. I just feel upset about it and I want it to  stop, but I don't want to blow up on him or be upset with him over  nothing. So reddit help.. Am I the asshole for being mad about this? ",

In the first semester, I quietly and begrudgingly accept this, but I got fed up this semester. I like to be able to hear my thoughts in the bathroom so I decided that any time I heard someone playing loud music in the bathroom, and I was going to be in there longer than 5 minutes(like during a shit or a shower), I would sing sea shanties in order to make any other music unenjoyable. I stop right when they stop. I figure if they are allowed to play music that loudly I can sing just as loudly. I don't just confront them for a few reasons:\n\n1: it's multiple people\n\n2: I would rather not let them know it was me(the echo plus my singing voice makes it so that it's hard to tell it's my voice)\n\n3: they are in the bathroom and I can't really tell them to stop when they are in the stall\n\nSo far my go to songs for this are\n\nBarrett's privateers\n\nEliza Lee\n\nRoll the old chariot\n\nRandy dandy o\n\nSouth Australia\n\nRolling down to old Maui\n\nBoney",

Last night he decided to go on a night out but still wanted to make sure he went to the gym this morning. So in the evening before he went  he came and gave me £20 and stated that if he did not meet me in the morning to go to the gym I can keep the money- being a broke student I happily agreed.\n\nFast forward to this morning and he never met me and I could see his light was off through his window. I messaged him and got no reply so continued to go to the gym alone. Once i got back to our accommodation he was up and explained that he set his alarm but somehow slept through it and never consciously chose not to go to the gym.\n\nI felt bad after hearing this but said I would stick to the deal and keep the money so he makes sure he comes next time. After this I decided to buy him a drink and he thanked me. However some of my other friends are saying that me keeping the money is not me being a good friend by sticking to the deal and that I should pay him back all of it (£20 may not sound like a lot but as I said, for me as a student it is nearly a weeks worth of money).\n\nAITA for not giving him the money back?

      "description": "Firstly, I apologize if this long-ass post. I've come to you for advice once and I appreciated the honest responses. If I really am an asshole, please tell me so I can do better the next time.\n\nSo I've been dating an older woman for the past 3 weeks and I felt it wasn't working out. For context, I'm 29 years old and she's 41. We're both Chinese living in San Francisco. She doesn't speak a single word of English despite living here for the past 3 years. She mentioned she hasn't made any friends or had a boyfriend because nobody is similar to her.\n\nIn the first week of dating, I mentioned I am moving to New York in September for a career opportunity (been planning this for quite some time). She told me she would \"not date anybody else, and that she'd wait for me in San Francisco forever.\" This part really creeped me out and I told her I did not agree to it. The next two weeks, she continuously complained and kept bringing up that she would wait for me. I felt increasingly creeped out, but I did not feel malicious intentions.\n\nIf I don't reply her text within minutes, she would blow up at me with a long, angry text for not responding (happened twice). I already told her the first time that it made me feel uncomfortable. Another problem is that she'd never tell me how she really felt, even though I already mentioned that talking about our feelings is important in solving relationship problems.\n\nI told her I made a few friends in the city since moving to the US 7 months ago. I mentioned we'd smoke together (legal in CA), she'd tell me to stop being their friends because weed is an addicting drug that will destroy my brain and my life (a very common misconception among older Chinese folks, including my parents).\n\nOn 2 separate dates, she kept paying for dinner which was, to be honest, nice of her. But whenever we go shopping, she would \"sneak pay\" my clothes at the cashier by saying she wants to \"test her credit card\". This is normal in Chinese dating culture as it is typical for the guy to pay for everything (meal and gifts). But I grew up in Hong Kong in an international school, so my views are a more \"westernized\" and I usually go dutch with my dates.\n\nFor the past 3 weeks, I felt overwhelmed when I'm with her.\n\n**1st question: Are my feelings justified, or am I overreacting**\n\nI broke up with her after work around 6 pm. I explained to her in detail why I felt it wasn't working: moving to NY, cultural difference and language barrier.\n\nAt 10 pm she texted me saying she wants to come over and return my shirt she borrowed a few days ago. I told her to give it back to me on Monday. She texted back saying she's walking over to my apartment now. In that moment I felt extremely threatened. I then texted back saying if she comes over, I will call the police. She replied saying \"I can't believe you'd say that, I'll never come over.\" I then blocked her number.\n\n**2nd question: Am I the asshole for threatening to call the police?**\n\nThank you.",

      "description": "First things first, I'm a bi, overweight, virgin. Just some context, as it matters later in the story. I know what my username is, but that's not the point. \nI've kept this hidden from most people, except a few gay kids from school I trust won't spread anything(ha). I especially didn't tell my \"best\" friend b/c he's homophobic. I never could tell him something personal b/c eventually it'd always come back to me.\n\nAnyways, my \"best\" friend from high school (call him Ed) started dating a mutual friend (Shortie) that her \"best\" friend (Pattie) had a huge crush on Ed (Shortie knew the whole time as well). It was sparked by alcohol and me telling Ed to get in the backseat with Shortie. Soon after, I had to leave and Pattie took over as designated driver. (This is where I have a problem) \n\nBasically, while Pattie was driving Ed and Shortie around, as most drunk people enjoy, Shortie bent down and started making out with Ed in the backseat. They got caught when Pattie asked \"why so quiet back there?\" and their lips smacked from seperation and surprise. \n\nFor Pattie, this basically broke her. She had a crush on Ed for the longest time, and even tho it probably wouldn't happen, I still feel for her. \nIt got even worse as whenever we would hangout, you would turn your head, and they'd start making out. full on. Pattie couldn't take it and left within the week. I stuck around a lil longer, couple months, but he'd usually ask me to leave a couple hours early so they could go fool around before his and her curfew(the few times that we did hang). \n\nHonestly, I didn't mind leaving early, what hurt me is I told them \"I don't go outside, so if y'all hangout, lmk and i'll be there.\" and they, my \"friends\" responded \"oh, yeah for sure, we'll let you know\"...well they didn't. I even showed up a couple of times unannounced b/c I knew they were there. Just always felt like I didn't belong anymore. Like i was a black sheep. I even brought up a girl from college I was eyeing, but they just moved onto a different subject.\n\nI really could care-less about them dating, it's just the starter method and than Ed telling me about them having sex and drinking daily without listening to me or taking my help or advice.\n\nFor example(we're getting to it, relax, it's a long story), around 1:30-2am i tried helping them move vehicles safely to each other's houses as Ed was hammered, laying on his truck door. I left and came back 3 times, each more aggressive and annoyed as neither would listen. On the third time, Ed was so annoyed with me, he rolled up his window on my fingers, crushing them for a good 15-25 seconds before Shortie shook Ed, getting him to reverse the window. That, was one of my last draws. \n\nThe final one was on 4/20, when the night before, Ed (&amp;Shortie) picked up some cannabis for me and could've dropped it off before work, or anytime in-between but he waited to deliver it until I was leaving town for a party, with friends I was riding with. I just said to him, \"you just keep what you have, and ill get more today\" which sparked him yelling at me over text and on the phone because he was gonna take a break after 4/20 and didn't want the cannabis. It worked out, as we met with him 5min later at a fast food restaurant, acting calm and said \"I wanna smoke later.\" Idk what it was, but in that moment picking up the weed from him and at the party, all i could think was \"I'm done with this shit.\"\n\nHe came over to smoke the next day, but I was in a mood. the sesh just felt off and cold. I even asked about Shortie but got a \"shes good\".\n\n(still with me? great.)\n\nI was never a caller - if you need something text first and call if it's an emergency - he knew that, told him many times. But he kept calling me. for like 2 weeks+ he called me multiple times a day, each time I never picked up. Even texted asking \"do you not know how-to pick up a phone?\" \"No idea\", i responded like an ass. But I was over him. He could keep all his secrets in me, but could never keep mine. \n\nEventually, he did text asking what's wrong, to which I laid out my reasons, drinking, pregnancy scares, general dickishness towards me. He also doesn't like many of the people in \"our\" friend group - only 2/7, for reasons that IMO were stupid. We also chatted on the phone, I told him that we can still be friends(made me feel like a girl) and be friendly. I just didn't wanna hang for a little while... \n\n...and well, that \"lil while\" has turned into almost 7 awkward months. \n\nIn that time, I've found a new set of friends that align more with me - they're still dating, even got matching tattoos that they claim aren't matching(I could go on about those as well, I called them out on it). Ed and I haven't talked, but Shortie has messaged me and vise versa(because the tats)but nothing is solved. \n\nFrankly, I'm jealous/envious of their relationship &amp; having sex with someone you actually care about on the daily. I felt like it was being rubbed in my face. I just needed an excuse to leave for awhile...It's made it really awkward for everyone b/c he still picks up weed from the same person I do - only difference is he doesn't pick up for me, when I've done the same for him. He's also in the same snapchat group and hasn't said anything to the group since.\n\nTL;DR: My \"best\" friend from HS started dating a girl, who's \"best\" friend had dibs on Him; I eventually got sick and tired of feeling left out and neglected, I stopped answering His phone calls until I felt it was mean/time and layed out my reasons for why I wasn't answering. Things are awkward b/c we're still in the same group message and buy weed from the same person. It's been 7 months - I feel like they deserve to know my personal reasons - but also not.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": " So a bit of backstory to this;\n\nMe and SO are getting married later this year and we're having a very small wedding overseas and we're trying to fund our families coming. SO's brother has a girlfriend of one yearish (BGF) but we've never met her due to the fact that we are currently living abroad. We can't really hold that against her but SO's brother decided that he wouldn't go to our wedding if she couldn't go. SO's parents absolutely adore BGF so we reached an agreement with them that we'd pay for B bit not for BGF and the two of them could save together for their flights and they'd have a room in a place that we would pay for.\n\nSO wasn't massively happy with the arrangement, she doesn't like the idea of having someone who is a stranger to her at our wedding and in our pictures, especially if she may not be in the picture for a significant amount of time in the future. Que sera though, provided B isn't going to have a hissy fit and not come them we're willing to make concessions to try and make all parties satisfied if not exactly happy.\n\nFast Forward to today;\n\nB sends a message to SO asking BGF can wear a white dress to the wedding as it's the only one she can find.\n\nWe're a bit upset by this; firstly she's there because we want all of SO's family there but he has the lack of tact or common sense to turn round and ask us for her to wear white to our wedding. We've politely said we'd prefer that she didn't but after him flipping out and saying he won't come if she can't we don't know if we've made a mistake\n\nSo, reddit, AWTA?\n\nTLDR; Unwelcome girlfriend of SO's brother wants to wear white to our wedding.",

      "description": "About 4 months ago I (27 m) met someone (27 f) on a dating site. Apparently we went to the same school, so we knew of each other but never really met before. We hit it off pretty quickly, had a lot in common, and went on a couple of dates. During the 2nd date she had told me that her ex fiance cheated and left her only a few weeks before and that her friends basically made her profile for her. We were genuinely enjoying each other's company and conversations though so I said that it's okay if she isn't ready. I went through a similar situation last year so I knew what she was going through. \n\nOver the next couple months we hung out a lot, talked every day, and told each other things that our closest friends and family didnt know. We hung out so much that all her friends and family thought that we were dating. We comforted each other and even \"cuddled\" a few times for comfort. We have had conversations about sex, but never tried anything.\n\nI have told her how I felt about her, not in an annoying way. She said that she doesn't want to hurt me as she was still confused. We went on a trip with my friends, and on the drive there I said something jokingly, along the lines of \"I know we aren't together, but try not to get too friendly with my friend (friend's name), he can be a pretty smooth player\". She said that she didnt have any interest in him, and after a little bit said \"I dont know, are we together?\" That really sent a lot of emotions through me and I wasn't sure what to say. A while ago, I expressed that I just want her to be happy, whether we are together or just friends and I want to be a good friend to her no matter what. I asked what she meant about what she said before and she said that she just doesn't know and doesn't want to hurt me. \n\nSince then we only saw each other once and talk once or twice a week. It has felt very weird since we would talk all day before. I have initiated conversations but get little to no replies any more. I know she's busy and has been going through a lot though so I understand.\n\nHowever, this past weekend I was out at the bar with a couple friends and decided to text her asking how she was doing. After a short convo she told me that she met someone, a friend's brother. It got to me quite a bit, not just because of how I felt about her, but how it all kinda made sense to me. I dont need to hear it from her, but I have a strong feeling that she just didnt want to tell me that she wasn't into me and the reason she doesn't talk to me much is because she doesn't want to see me hurt and it's easiest for her. If that were the case I wish she'd told me a long time ago so I didn't have all of these mixed signals and feelings over the last few months. I haven't talked to her yet, and I do feel like an ass for feeling like I dont want to be friends like we were, but i feel lied to and led on. AITA for potentially ending a friendship because of this?",

      "description": "So I really like GSDs and when I get older, I want to breed them and sell the puppies.  I voice this to my friends and to these two teachers who I’m close to and I’m instantly bombarded with the phrase “adopt don’t shop”.  Now I say that it’s my preference, and whatever I prefer is what I’m going to get.  People can adopt dogs and all, good for them, but I want a GSD puppy that I’m going to raise and love with all my heart.  They respond with “Yeah, but you can take care of dogs that already exist, you’re harming the environment by creating more puppies.”  Then they start saying that you have to inject the dogs with sex hormones and force them to have sex, and I just say “Well I didn’t do research on that, I was just gonna wait for one to be in heat and then see what happens.”  They laugh at me and say clearly I haven’t.  I say also I’m not inbreeding my dogs because I’ll be getting them from two separate breeders.  I still get dissed and I’m pretty upset because I just wanted to talk about what I wanted to do when I’m older.  One of my friends jokingly says “Yeah ____, we just diss you because we hate you.” and I just laugh.  This has happened before in my friend group with different topics, one being just yesterday where I was alienated by my friend group for playing a trade game in discord and I claimed a bunch of characters so I could get people to trade me (they got angry and said it was unfair that I had their characters.  They threatened to kick me.  I said I have their characters so I could trade for characters they have). I’m just upset right now and I want to know if IATA.",

      "description": "Some background, I live far away from my mother. We don’t have any other family and my mom raised me by herself. Her choice in partners has always been poor and she hadn’t had one in a long time until she met Martin about 10 weeks ago. Martin has a lot of money and showed her a lot of attention and affection using that money. He’s also an alcoholic and people who know him well say he always has been. \n\nI came to see my mom for the holidays and she wanted me to stay at his house because he has a lot of stuff to do. The minute I arrived he handed my mother and I a drink. The rest of the night, Martin kept separating me from my mother to show me things or talk to me by himself. He asked me over and over again if I had a boyfriend and how old I was. He made me extremely uncomfortable with these questions. \n\nHe told me some stories about tragedies that have happened in his life and it really struck a cord with me because they’re so similar to things I’ve also gone through. At this point I started to warm up to him and take pity. He asked me to go check and see if my mom was asleep. She was. He started getting as close as possible to me and talking about how he does stuff with 20 year olds and how old am I again? (In my 20s) he was touching my hair and staring at me and when I’d ask him what he was thinking he’d just say “no no no no no”. At this point I excused myself to my room and called my boyfriend and expressed to him how terrified I was. I managed to calm myself down and think that maybe I perceived the situation incorrectly and took the phone with me to the bathroom. \n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom he was just standing there with his pants undone. I screamed because he scared me and he didn’t do anything. He just stood and stared. I asked what he was doing and he said “Just checking that my cameras are working. Who’s on the phone?” And I said “my boyfriend” he continued to just stand and stare for what felt like 10 minutes before I backed up to my room and went inside, him still standing there. I locked the door and he tried to open it. I stayed on the phone with my boyfriend the whole night and this man tried repeatedly to open my door. \n\nIn the morning I told my mom everything and she tried to tell me I was overreacting and he didn’t know what he was doing. I decided I’d give him another chance. We all went out to dinner where he insisted we drink. I didn’t. My mom did. At some point he took me outside where I told him that what he did that night scared me and that he has no right to try and come into my room or touch me, his house or not. He then told me that I crossed a line that night and took my top off. That didn’t happen. He told my mom I was lying about everything. \n\nI convinced my mom he was at best lying and at worst gaslighting. I told her she needed to leave him ASAP and she did. She called a friend who’d known him their whole life to let them know she was leaving and they said “Lemme guess. He tried to fuck your daughter”. Apparently he has done this many many times and been far more persistent and terrifying than he was with me, with girls much younger than me. His wife who killed herself in their garage told people he “terrified her but he’d kill her if she left”. \n\nMy mom is still talking to him on the phone and being friendly like nothing really happened, all the while maintaining that she’s not going back to him. She said she’s being diplomatic. They had airplane tickets and hotel room to a concert in February and still plans on going with him. I told her she’s not and started freaking out because honestly, this is not the woman who raised me. I feel she’s being manipulated and that this man is toxic and dangerous. She told me I needed to back the fuck off and let her handle her life and that I’m being dramatic and paranoid. She said she “can still use him for things she wants”. I think she’s enabling his behavior and messing with someone who’s potentially very dangerous. \n\nAm I blowing it out of proportion? She insists she knows him so well and that I don’t know him at all. I suppose that’s true but he just scared the absolute shit out of me and I don’t think alcohol is an excuse for that. This whole ordeal has been very confusing for me and I’m starting to think maybe I am the asshole and I should just leave it alone and let her handle it. \n",

      "description": "First and foremost, I know that it takes a lot of courage to open up about sexual kinks and fetishes, and normally even if I wasn't into something I would be supportive and encourage my partner to tell me. But I feel like everyone has some hard limits that would change the way they look at their partner, and once something is said you can't really control how you feel about it or pretend you never heard it.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have had a pretty solid relationship and a good sex life. Our hard limits have always been pretty fleshed out, and one of mine is that I would never be down to open our relationship. Recently out of the blue my girlfriend essentially told me she wanted to cuckold me. Told me that she had been watching videos and reading forums and was turned on by it. She went on to say how hot she thinks it'd be if she made me watch her sleep with other dudes, \"playfully\" humiliated me, talked about chastity and all that stuff. I was completely stunned and disgusted, and told her that I was absolutely not interested and I didn't want to talk about it again, that it was a very firm no. I tried to put it out of my head but my stomach was doing flip flops. \n\nTwo days later she brought it up again, this time trying to reason with me and explain why it would be great for us and how much she'd like it, and how she could \"prove\" to me I'd like it. I got upset and told her that I already said no and she knew I'd never be ok with it, and I needed her to stop asking. She dropped it.\n\nI've been trying to let it go but I can't. Knowing my girlfriend thinks so little of me that she'd want to not only sleep with other men but derive sexual pleasure from humiliating me during the act. It makes me wonder if something already happened, makes me feel sick to know when we're intimate she's probably getting off thinking about that dynamic. I feel depressed when I'm around her now, and I can't help but see her differently than I always have. I know that in my heart I won't ever be able to forget what she said. I just don't feel secure in the relationship anymore.\n\nSo I'm considering ending it. Told her that I wasn't comfortable anymore and that the knowledge she not only wants to open our relationship but reduce me to the role of a secondary sexual partner humiliated me and that I need time to think. I'm currently staying with a friend until I decide how to proceed.\n\nI know she's not the asshole for having a kink, but am I the asshole for no longer wanting this relationship?",

      "description": "So I’m 13, throwaway account and on mobile. Sorry for formatting.\nMy brother is graduating May 2020, and in June 2020 I will have my quince. It’s basically this big celebration that Hispanic girls have when they’re 15 because they’re considered a woman. Kind of like a sweet 16? Anyways.\nI was talking with my mom about it because these things take AWHILE to plan. I’ve been invited to one that’s happening in March 2020 as one of the dancers, because it just takes so long to plan. My mom told me I could have my quince any way I wanted it, so I’ve taken it into consideration about what i really want. I told my mom I didn’t want an outdoor one, because I would prefer an air conditioned room over a mosquito filled, Texas weather outdoors since it’s happening late June. Or so I thought. \nMy mom said that it was going to happen in  May, and I got really confused. Turns out she really wants it to be in May, and thought we could have the quince the weekend AFTER my brother’s graduation so the out of town family from Mexico can just stay for a week. I don’t like this Idea at all. Firstly, I really don’t want to celebrate a month early. My birthday is late June, and i don’t know the exact date of the graduation. It could be anywhere from early May to late May, and either way we’re looking at a month in advance at LEAST. I don’t want to have a celebration so early and so far from me actually turning 15.  Plus, it would be trouble with the choreography. It takes 3 months to plan the choreography, and that means we would have to plan it in February as opposed to March or maybe early July. Plus, school. This means I would have my quince DURING SCHOOL. I would absolutely hate this. Especially since it would be around finals week. Plus, I’m not a big party person. I am not in favor of having 2 big celebrations on 2 saturdays in a row. If it was over the summer, sure, but not during school. I use Saturdays to rest and Sunday isn’t an option as it’s a day I’m forced to wake up early for church. \nWIBTA if i confronted my mom about this and told her I would not have a quince in May? ",

      "description": "My father has cause a lot of issues, not only with my fiance, but also with past girlfriends I have had. My Dad is an alcoholic, hard headed, stubborn, never can admit he does anything wrong, and likes to put the blame on everyone else. My fiance' and I have been together for almost 4 years. She's a great person, never has any issues getting along with anyone, smart, funny, and just all around awesome. I couldn't ask for someone better.\n\n During our first year of dating, my dad was just getting to know her and I was bringing her around more. My Dad comes from an Italian background, so Sunday (sometimes Satruday) dinners with the family are a big thing. So we would go over usually once  a week.\n\n\nMy Dad, being an alcoholic, was drunk 99% of the time we would go over for dinner. Him being drunk led to him being kind of flirty with my fiance' (at the time was just my girlfriend). For some reason, the topic of girls who are \"sluts\" got brought up the family dinner (was brough up by my dad) and he mentioned that my girlfriend was a \"slut, but in a good way\". This was probably the worst thing he has said, but there was also instances of him flirting with her, telling her that shes gorgeous, and also was tickling her in the stomach area, in a \"joking way\" apparently. My dad has always been a friendly/flirty person with most all women, so even though I did find it inappropriate, I didn't think much of it and kind of let it go. \n\nMy fiance' didn't say much about it at first, but after several times of being tickled by him, she started expressing to me how uncomfortable it makes her and how inappropriate it really is. It took me a while to realize it, and I guess its because I grew up with my father acting like this and was used to it. Now being an adult, I am starting to see my father is not normal and the things he is doing is not appropraite, and I am totally understanding of how she feels. He also sent a text to me one day when we were having a summer party (which included a slip-n-slide) and asked if my girlfriend was going to be in a bikini when he got there.\n\n\nMy fiance started to become distant from him, and one day he finally asked what was going on and she explained to him how she felt. He said he was sorry and wanted to appologize, but to this day ( about 1.5 years later) he still hasn't. He claims he has tried over and over again and we keep blowing him off, but its not the case at all, and thats what he tells other people. I am starting to beleive his drinking is starting to mess with his memory and he is having a hard time distiguishing between what he actually does and what he thinks he does. \n\nI explained to him he needs to appologize and until then I am going to be distant as well. That has not seemed to phase him. Now with the holidays coming around, I am starting to feel guilty about it because I have a feeling I wont be seeing him on Christmas. I didn't even hear from my dad on Thanksgiving. I am trying to stand my ground though so he understands that he cannot act this way and until he appoligzes to my future wife, this is how things are going to be.\n\n\nI am having a hard time with this because I am always a nice person and feel bad being mean to someone,  regardless of what they have done. Plus the fact its my own father. Am I the asshole or am I not the asshole?\n",

      "description": "Backstory: I work full time and my fiancée stays at home with our twin 7 month old babies, who are still teething and can be a handful at the best of times.\n\nI came home from work and straight away help out with the bubs who have been crying non-stop since they woke up from their nap. Dinner was still in the oven and my fiancée wanted to go for a walk in the hopes that a change of scenery may appease the bubs. \n\nUpon arriving home from our walk, my fiancée turns the oven off and we prepare the bubs to be seated and have their food organised along ours for dinner. As my fiancée is dishing out dinner, I can smell the distinct smell of the food being burnt. It’s a lamb casserole with veges but it should be fine. \n\nAs I try a bit it the lamb, I notice that’s over cooked and hard to eat. My fiancée notices my reaction and assured me that the veges should be fine. I try them however they’re covered in a tomatoey sauce that’s burnt and the flavour just saturates throughout the whole meal.\n\nI winced as I took another bite of this meal and then my fiancée says “just eat it and put up with it” which is not like her and I didn’t appreciate being forced to eat. I thanked her for the meal but I wasn’t going to eat it. She started berating me to eat the food, saying such things like I’m spoilt. \n\nOf course, I dug my heals in and wasn’t going to have a bat of it. I continued to refuse to eat dinner that she had prepared as nicely as I could. I told her I appreciated the time and effort that she put into the meal however I wasn’t going to force myself to eat a meal that I didn’t enjoy.\n\nShe was quiet while she ate the rest of the meal while I fed the bubs their dinner. Afterwards, she left the kitchen and went into our bedroom without saying a word. Even that night, when we tried to hash it out, she is convinced that I should’ve eaten her food and I’m adamant that I’m not obligated to eat any food served to me, especially if it’s burnt.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA? I don’t understand why she took it so personally. My fiancée is usually a great cook and I always tell her so, I help out with the cooking as well, I’m flabbergasted!",

We go there somewhat regularly and usually have great service. \n\n    The same is true until about halfway through the meal. Our waiter's (who has served us in the past and done a good job) family came for dinner at the restaurant and were seated at the table behind ours. \n\n    Now understandably our waiter was helping them out, but he began to completely ignore his other tables, he was chatting with family while on the job, as if he were a customer. While we were repeatedly asking him for more bread or a glass of water, after not completing any of that, we had to flag another waiter down to wrap our leftovers and we spent another few minutes trying to flag our waiter down for the check. At this point my father got pissed and started agresivly calling the waiter over. Our waiter came over somewhat annoyed, and began Making excuses. Our original intention was to have desert but because of how long the whole process took we were already over it. We asked him for the check, expecting him to comp something or atleast discount for the poor service. Instead a full priced check. So we all decided not to tip on what would have been a big tip as we're were a party of 6.",

      "description": "Long story short: We had an amazing deal ($500 each in a gated Los Angeles house with a backyard pool.) Three of us were living in the house. One roommate we'll call Tina is from Florida and \\*demands\\* running the AC when it's above 70 degrees outside. She refuses for open windows, and says she'll cover the extra cost of the AC. We receive the bi-monthly bill and it's $1,500 (the last bill was about $600) so the other roommate and I split $600 and have Tina pay the extra $900, which she was very unhappy about. \n\nTwo months pass and we get ANOTHER $1,500 bill, same scenario except this time she refuses to pay for the extra cost. She doesn't have a job and runs the AC all day while everyone else is at work. Since asking her to keep it down doesn't work, I pulled the fuse on the outside box so the fan runs but the AC doesn't actually work. It was also only about 75 degrees outside, far from causing any heat or health issues.\n\nEventually she figured it out and insists I need to move out of the house IMMEDIATELY and that she'll be changing the locks, saying I caused her medical problems and I have broken her trust beyond repair. This is illegal (google an illegal lockout) so I called the landlord, who (surprise surprise) she had already talked to and said that I was creating an unlivable environment and asked that I be terminated from the lease. She also got the other roommate on her side, who just kept telling me \"you need to go.\" I had already begun moving into a new place, but with the threat of having the locks changed, I exercise my right to a 60 day move out notice with the landlord, and say I'm not moving without a written notice. This means everyone has to move out of the house, since you can't kick someone off of a lease. \n\nEveryone ended up kicked out of the house, and they tried to ruin my reputation with our friend group. As dramatic as everything turned out, I still think I was in the right here. AITA?",

      "description": "In a rush, sorry if this is all scrambled up, if you need more info let me know :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I host a daily giveaways community. We do a lot of video game giveaways, and we always have at least one daily giveaway which is completely free. Meaning people only have to click to enter and that's it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order to fund ourselves we occasionally do sponsored events and stuff like that. It's unrelated, but it's just so you know it's not like I'm completely kind and doing this all from my own wallet. Money is the least of my needs and I mainly host the community for fun, but I still profit sometimes, and the giveaways fund themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, being the lone host of these daily giveaways, I have to make a message and announcement every day, and take care of yesterday's winners.\n\nThe only thing winners have to do in order to claim their prize is message me with a screenshot of the giveaway they won within 24 hours. You have to understand I wake up with about 30 or so messages from strangers every day, so I really just ignore winners who don't screenshot because I know it's a simple request they need to follow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully this is not too complicated... bear with me if you can\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot long ago someone one a \"special\" giveaway we had. It wasn't daily and ran for about a week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe prize was pretty big, and the winner messaged me, but without a screenshot. Naturally I ignored the message. Eventually he did screenshot but the 24 hours were up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him he had a lot of time to check the instructions (which are sort of pinned in the community) and that I won't give him the prize.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course he argued, and I kind of changed my mind about it a lot. One time I thought like, \"maybe he has a point, he did message me\" and then a minute later I'm thinking \"NO, 24 hours is more than enough time to check, I don't need to be chasing the winners. It was his responsibility.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mainly do the screenshot thing because of two reasons, one being I host a lot of giveaways and need to know which giveaway they won, and two being sometimes people try to fake it and message me they won when they didn't. So it's easier for me to verify.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGenerally the work of verifying won't take more than 30 seconds with a message, but again given I host them daily and have a lot of winners to work with, I ignore messages without a screenshot. It's part of the process of claiming the prize.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... am I in the wrong here? AITA?",

      "description": "I play this game called Far Cry 5 on my PC. It's made by Ubisoft, came out in early 2018 so almost an entire year ago, and is mostly solo-player and co-op with some player-vs-player, too. Through the game and UPlay, Ubi's own client similar to Valve's Steam, I made this friend, \"Mr. Z\", who's from the other side of the world. I live in the eastern hemisphere and he lives somewhere in North America, like many other people that play the series. \n\nA few weeks after he added me I noticed strange things when we play co-op, such as neither of us dying or even taking damage from anything, him super-jumping, and him giving me hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of in-game loot, which should under normal circumstances take a while to collect. I asked him about it and he revealed that he uses cheats. I told him I'm against cheating in PvP games and he said that he only uses them in solo and co-op and never in PvP, which means he uninstalls them first, every time. \n\nEarlier today, we - Mr. Z, his friend \"Ronoid\" and I, so at least 3 people - were talking on UPlay group chat. I happen to have mentioned Mr. Z using modded software, which shocked/startled/surprised (whichever word English-speakers use) Ronoid and made him what Mr. Z was doing. The conversation ended soon after that.\n\nLater that day, which was just today, Mr. Z told me, on private chat of course, that he needed my help in doing a co-op challenge, which he immediately followed with, \"nevermind, I forgot you hate cheaters\". When I saw it I genuinely felt bad and sent several apologies, still in private chat, including things like \"I'm sorry\" and \"I only hate malicious cheaters, those that do it in PvP games like GTA Online which is infested with those kinds of people\". He replied saying that he was playing Far Cry PvP with his friends who then hated on him, accusing him of using cheats in PvP and faking his scores/stats, and they all left his lobby. I really felt bad about this, I know it's my fault. I did a shitty thing. I said a few more apology phrases like \"I'm sorry that happened\" and some others. I wasn't being sarcastic at all, I genuinely felt guilty. I don't remember our full conversation but I think I made him hate me as a friend, because I think he said a few sarcastic-*sounding* things like \"I wonder how easy it is to do it in multiplayer... easy as 123!!!\"\n\nTL;DR: I knew my online friend used cheats in a game we play but only in solo and co-op and never in PvP. I mentioned it in UPlay's group chat which made his friends think he's a cheater, and made him hate me.",

      "description": "This is going to be a long one and throwaway acc \\~\n\nBackstory:\n\nSince a kid I was always sheltered and my decisions were always made for me. I didn't really have much say as a child due to my mom taking both roles as a mom and dad. She raised us very well but something that has always made me explode quicker than anything recently is when she tries to still do the same thing as I am 21. I am not that golden child of the family and I very will accept that I have said many rude things to her in response to her saying thing such as \" I wish I disown you and put you up for adoption.\" or \" If you don't listen to whatever I say and follow my plans we don't have to talk anymore and you can do your own thing while I do mines.\" Things like that really hurt me since I am trying to rebuild my broken family from scratch. I have been able to reconnect with my brother and sister but none of us can really connect with our mom. She threw me into a state of constant anxiety and depression being at home with her since she can blow up at any time if there is something that isn't going her way. To win she would try to take away anything that she or my relatives have gifted me from my car,laptop, and phone which is fine because all these things are more luxury items than needed.\n\nProblem:She demanded that I give her my schedule for any events, she decides who I am allowed to hang out with, and only go to school yet still expects me to pay for the bill of the car that she took which has my name. The reasoning and I wish I was shitting you about this.. I told her I wanted to work for my own things now and not rely on anyone anymore since I promised this year I would start to become my own person and depend solely on myself. She immediately flipped took the car, said that she wish I wasn't her son which in turn I flipped back and said \" I never asked to be born esp from a mother like you.\". She proceeded to ignore me the next few days and I took it upon myself to be the bigger person to apologize and really try to connect with my mom. I told my mom about the frustration that has built up, the constant bird watch, and how I never have been able to really decide my own life. She brought up once again that I only go to school and she would pay for everything. She has said words before and has never stuck with them hence why I don't believe she would this time and I am already working toward being independent so her doing this would be counter-productive to my goal. She called me an ungrateful child and that we would never have to speak again and that there is no mother son relationship. It really hit me and got me wondering if I am just an ungrateful asshole like she said I was and if trying to build something my siblings couldn't even worth it at this point?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So, I recently got a thread lift done for my nose, it has swell down considerably but if I were to accidentally hit my nose or something, it would hurt because it’s bruising on the inside. \n\n2-3 days ago, bf and I went out together for dinner. Bf always has been a little rough with his teasing and he accidentally hit my nose and I got pissed because it hurts and he never really apologise for these things(not intentionally hurting me or verbally hurting my feelings due to a discussion) . I get that in this case, it might not be a big deal considering it’s accidental but it’s still basic manners, no? \n\nI Guess the fact that he never really apologise piles up or take my feelings into consideration and that annoys me plus when he does apologise (just once or twice), it’s always really insincere. \n\nSo I got mad, I didn’t really try to converse with him and he proceed to use his phone and continue eating. In hindsight, he did try to ease the tension every now and then by talking and trying to feed me food. \n\nEventually, I think it got to him as well and once we left the restaurant. He said it was a wasted evening and that he’s tired and wants to go back home. I felt really bad so we parted ways and went back home and we haven’t talk to each other since then. \n\n\nAITA for being mad at him which ended up ruining both of our night?? ",

      "description": "Basically, one of my friends, who I'll refer to as Dylan, is really into roleplaying on the internet, specifically sexual roleplay. I don't judge him, different strokes for different folks, all that. He's previously told me about his account on a specific website, he's shown me his roleplays there, etc. Basically, the account is public knowledge. I recently went on to his account, to see if he's still doing it, to discover he's started a new roleplay with sexual undertones, with him roleplaying as a character that seems to be based on my girlfriend. I'm talking same name, same hair color/style, similar heights, similar personality traits, so on and so forth. In the past, Dylan has tried to flirt with my girlfriend and I've called him out on it, so I don't think its too far of a reach to assume he could've based a character off of her. It made me uncomfortable, so I showed it to my girlfriend and she feels the same way. Would I be an asshole to confront him about his character? I understand it's not actually hurting anyone directly, in my opinion it's more of the idea behind what he's doing. ",

We tried looking for somewhere cheaper to live initially but this is the best we could get in the timeframe allowed because of needing to start work so soon.\n\nIn the last six months he's claimed he's been looking for work but I've not see much evidence of it... And this is probably where I'll come off bad but I have his email linked to mine on my phone (It's filled with job notifications and that's it... Nothing personal on there anywhere.)\n\nNow we think it's much harder for him to get a job because he practically failed his degree whereas I aced mine.\n\nSo now and again we'll have a tiff about me suspecting whether he's even bothering to look for work and it usually ends up with him in tears because he already feels guilty about not being able to provide.\n\nHe typically looks for jobs on retail but absolutely refuses to get a job as a cleaner (Because he thinks it will make him sick) or at a place like McDonald's (Because he thinks it's degrading) or careworker. (Again might make him sick.)\n\nBecause of this we're not doing great financially.\n\nI'm expecting a few (Just dump him and find a better man)... 2 problems:\n\n1. I love him to bits, we've been together 5 years and I just know he could do more if he just put some elbow grease into life.\n\n2. I can't drive yet and he takes me to work in the morning...

      "title": "AITA for wanting my best friend to visit during summer vacation?",
      "description": "Warning: very long. TLDR below. \n\nOk so before I get straight into it, here's some background. I've (21F) been with my wonderful boyfriend (22M) for 5 years. We have a beautiful 3 year old daughter and are just so happy together. We've done so much to make each other better people, always motivate each other and are much better at communicating problems with each other. We just love each other and our daughter so much. However, his mother hates me basically. No matter what I do, it's wrong. No matter what I say, it's wrong. It's getting so frustrating trying to make this woman happy when I give it my all, only to be told I haven't tried at all to include her or his side of the family. I try harder than her own son does (he really doesn't care about his family, he just doesn't want to hear it from his mother). She's always started drama to mess with us. She tried to takw over holidays to keep my family out of it. She refuses to see her granddaughter unless I invite her myself, which doesn't happen since I work 6 days a week. She gets into my boyfriend's head over silly arguments we have at home, saying those silly things are why our relationship is \"failing\" even though it's not. We missed a family trip once because I was hemorrhaging and had to stay in the hospital for the night. My boyfriend wanted to stay home with me and our then infant daughter, since the doctor said to just rest at home. He wanted to take over while I rest. Doing so had his mother pit the whole family against me, the \"controlling bitch\". \n\nSo, we all have a week long vacation with his family during the summer. It's all for their family and friends are always welcomed. Everyone from all over the country comes together to see friends and connect etc. My boyfriend asked his mother last year if we could bring another friend (other than his best friend), who happens to be MY best friend. She's definitely cool with it and said we need to help more financially if we want more people. That's fine, totally understandable.\n\nMy best friend is a rather tall, black, male. He's only a year older than me. Here's the obvious red flag to her, which we understand; we're friends over the internet. We haven't had the chance to meet on person, but we talk almost every day for the past decade, over discord, Skype video calls etc. We know everything about each other and have spoken to each others families. My boyfriend also talks with him and they get along so well, which is great since my boyfriend is so introverted and hates social interaction. We wanted this year to be the year we meet my best friend.\n\nWe tell his mother and obviously it is unsettling to her that he hasn't met us in person. We tell her not to be worried, with my own parents adding in he's a great kid. My father wants a BCI check, just because he is also slightly suspicious of people online, espically if he's going to stay overnight before we leave for vacation at our house. My friend agrees because he understands. We give my boyfriend's mom the same suggestion and boy does this get fun.\n\nShe requests for one as well, but also had gone digging into his Facebook profile without my knowledge. She looks through all his posts, friends, etc. Mind you, he doesn't use Facebook and has been hacked many times, having dumb repetitive posts with dangerous links being posted. We didn't tell her he was black though. She just thought he was some clean cut white kid. As soon as she saw he was black, she was completely against it. She claims his family are all crooks and gangsters and they all live in the hood etc., which is completely untrue. And he is very smart. He's in college on a scholarship. He's more weeaboo than he would ever be gangster tbh.\n\nWe get the background check from him. First, it goes through my father, who works in the same field related to criminal background and criminal activity, so he knows what he's looking for. He says it's all legit and sees no history of violence or crime. We then give the paper to the boyfriends mother, who proceeds to say she's seen enough and that paper won't prove anything. All she has seen is his fb profile full memes and weeaboo crap from over 2 years ago. He hasn't been active since literally 2016. She also proceeds to tell my boyfriend that she thinks my friend and are having an affair because of an old fb profile that I haven't used in years, having my friend on that friend list and not having my boyfriend added. I had that profile for online friends I didn't trust back in my anime loving days. Nothing more nothing less. Hell, I don't even remember the password and email for it.\n\nNeedless to say she's convinced my best friend is a crook and a hoodlum and dangerous etc. She doesn't want him anywhere near her, after doing what she calls her \"detective work\" and still expects us to pay for a vacation that we don't want to go on at this point. Both my boyfriend and I said we planned this for a while, with her knowing as well, only for her to change her mind when she found out his race. She didn't even care that it was an internet friend after we said we'd get a BCI from him, it's just the fact that he's black. Anyways, we just find it rude, especially coming from a grandmother who doesn't care to see her own grandchild unless she's \"formally invited\" instead of. \"pathetically asking\" to see her.\n\nWe're going to set up video call with her tonight. The three of us will be on a video call with my friend, to see if it will help clear things up, but my boyfriend thinks she'll still be prejudice about the whole thing.\n\nSo am I the a-hole here??\n\nTLDR: future mother in law allows an online friend (my best friend of over a decade) to be invited to our big family vacation until she learns he's black, continues to stereotype him and call him a gangster. She's rude enough as it is and caused drama all through out our relationship over holidays and my health conditions, our daughter, etc. We really dread the idea of a vacation with her this year unless she stops being prejudice towards our friend.

      "title": "AITA for telling my autistic brother not to confide in me?",
      "description": "So some background: I am a 21 year old university student, but currently on break. Part of the reason why i'm writing this because my brother recently had a shouting match with my parents about religion, which is a sensitive topic for them. He asked them if it was possible to be erased from multiple timelines and my parents both lashed out at him almost simultaneously, because he has been asking this exact question and others like it for about two years now, being very persistent to the point where he pesters them daily. \n\nMy Dad got very angry and told him to go to his room, telling him to shut up along the way. Later, I was watching Netflix in the family room and my brother, who we'll call Thomas (Not his real name) came into the room and told me that he didn't exist, and that our Grandmother was visiting him in his dreams, telling him that he will be smited by God. I don't know what to say to him anymore, as both of my parents, my older brother, myself and even other relatives have sat him down and tried to tell him that there's nothing to worry about and that he should just live his life, but he doesn't seem to want to listen. I've already told him everything that I thought would help him, so I decided to be blunt, and I said something to the effect of \"This is why people don't like to spend time with you, why do you continue to torment our parents every day?\" He responded by saying \"I need to confide in somebody.\" I then told him not to confide in me, and to find someone else. I realize that it was harsh, but I've tried being nice and apparently that hasn't worked. \n\nThomas has Asperger's Syndrome, which means that he could be able to fit in reasonably well with other people with a few quirks if he worked at it, but the problem is that he doesn't want to work at it. He wants everyone else to change around him to accommodate him, and as a result of this maladaptive behavior, he actively pushes people away from him, resulting in very few friends. \n\nThomas is very conservative. Now this in itself, wouldn't be an issue for me, but it becomes an issue because he never shuts up about it, and brings it up at every possible turn, even at family gatherings. He is incredibly idiotic and uninformed about politics, making downright false and disingenuous statements about how \"Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to weaponize the U.S. government to promote their Communist agendas,\" while also saying that Donald Trump is a kind-hearted man. Those two statements are among the more tame things he has said, but he believes these things wholeheartedly while also spouting these crazy statements to complete strangers. The worst part is my Dad doesn't correct him when he says these things. He never tells him to knock it off or what he's saying is false and/or bad. I believe he does this because my Dad is also a hardcore conservative, but I don't think he's as extreme as Thomas is. My Dad lets him ramble and says either \"Yep,\" or \"Whatever.\" Unless it's about religion, in which my Dad challenges him and is quick to debunk everything Thomas says. These discussions and arguments happen almost every single day. \n\nHe doesn't seem to realize that his behavior is the problem though, to him, he is never the bad guy and it's always someone else's fault. This obsession with religious figures is just another in a long line of hateful obsessions that also include Weeaboos, Liberals, Communists, Jews, Women, other autistic people, Muslims and pretty much anyone from the Middle East or who is of  Middle Eastern descent and I'm pretty sure he hates black people, as I've heard him refer to other black people using the hard-r n word in public under his breath. \n\nI want to hold him accountable, as I don't think my parents actually do enough to help him outside of yelling at him and taking him to therapy sessions that he doesn't take anything out of. I think he's spoiled, because he seems to view everyone who wants him to have even a little bit of accountability as some type of villain who exists to torment him. He recently went off about one of his close friends, who we'll call Joe, who cut him off after many years after Thomas started sending threatening and unhinged Facebook messages. One of which read in all caps \"YOU'D BETTER FUCKING GET BACK TO ME SOON YOU BIG NOSED KIKE.\" Among other hateful and unironic statements. Thomas then started doing the same to his significant other after Joe blocked him. However, unlike Joe, she retaliated and told him that he has a bad case of the Dunning-Kruger Effect, and that neither her nor Joe would contact him again. This sent Thomas into a rage, as he blamed her for \"insulting his stupidity.\" While being completely unaware and inconsiderate as to how he was coming across to them.  \n\nI'm wondering if I'm the asshole here because of what might be a lack of understanding of Asperger's and Autism. I was prompted to write this mostly because I overheard a conversation Thomas had with my Dad where he told him that I'm not very patient with him, and that our older brother, who we'll call Ryan, has much more patience than me. My Dad retorted by saying that he doesn't make it easy for me or anyone else he knows. Ryan later told me that I need to be more understanding of him and his Asperger's and that I need more patience. However I think they're blind to the fact that we're dealing with an individual who could very well be dangerous if left unchecked. \n\nTL;DR: My brother who has hateful obsessions with various races, ethnic groups, ideologies and religions got into a shouting match with my parents about trivial religious nonsense. He then started ranting to me about it, saying that he wanted someone to confide in after I asked him why he torments our parents and family members. I told him not to confide in me, because I’m sick of him not listening to mine or anyone else’s advice. I basically told him that if he won’t listen to my advice on how to overcome the problem, then don’t bother talking to me about it. I won’t help you if you won’t help yourself. ",

      "description": "Hi everyone, I'll try and be as unbiased as possible since I do genuinely want to know if I'm being an asshole, because, well, I don't want to be, and I will stop and be better if I can.\n\nAnyway, recently, my ex-boyfriend (31M) and I (24F) broke up, it was mutual, we agreed things weren't working. My boyfriend is understandably upset as we were together for 3.5 years.\n\nWe both have a few things of each others, I have some of his clothes and a headset, he has some of my tech (keyboard, VR, 3DS, etc.) he also owes me money too (I have chalked that up to, maybe might not get that back, but I at least want my things).\n\nI asked him if we could drop off the stuff at a mutual friend's house, as it was too soon to see him (it has been around a month since at this point) and I want my things back. I feel like this is the best way to do it. He originally agreed to this.\n\nRecently, he messaged me saying that he *doesn't* want to do this, because it makes him feel bad. He also keeps asking me if I need the stuff urgently (like, no, but...). He hasn't outright said it, but what I've gathered is that he wants to put it off until I am ready to see him again. (He keeps trying to meet/see each other, and I keep saying no because I'm not ready. I also know from a mutual friend that he wants to get back together, and I do not. This is part of the reason why I want my things back first, because I feel I have a better chance getting the things back before we see each other again.)\n\nI tell him that I really want my things back, and I just want to get it over with because I don't want to put it off. He says I am not considering where he is at (I'm assuming this was referring to how he is emotionally) and that I am being unfair (for not waiting until we can swap in person).\n\nI don't feel like I'm being unreasonable. I have the most to lose in this situation should things go sour (hundreds of dollars lost for me, as opposed to maybe a hundred for him, max) and I just wants my things back.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being considerate of his feelings and still asking him to drop off my things? Should I give him more time, and wait until I am ready to see him? ",

      "description": "My mother had a fight with my grandmother(my dad's mother) over a year ago.   She claims that my grandmother has verbally attacked her multiple times over the course of many years(parents have been married for 20 years).  But finally my mother snapped and came out about all the things that my grandmother has said and done.   There were many examples that my mother has explained to me and there are too many to explain here.  Some of them seem reasonable but happened over a decade ago and don't sound serious enough to be remembered for that long.  Others seem to be so exaggerated that it just seems like my mother just took it the wrong way.   An example would be my grandmother saying to my mother \"Why did you stop Weight Watchers, you were doing so well?\"  (Weight Watchers is a weight loss program and she lost a bunch of weight from it but stopped it abruptly midway.)  This comment really offended my mother for some reason.\n\nI personally think that neither my grandmother or my mother are innocent in this.  This fight has dragged my father, my brother, and me away from the rest of my family for more than a year.  My father's brother and his family have all taken my grandmother's side and I miss the good ole times with them and just want this to be over but neither side wants to try and fix things.  Honestly this wouldn't be such a big problem if this just stayed between my mother and my grandmother but no, everyone wants to take a side.  \n\nMy grandmother's 80th birthday party is this week and they invited me to go to it.  (I am 19 and moved out so I can make this decision) My aunt, uncle, cousins, and grandparents will be there.  My mother somehow found out about it and she said that I can go (obviously) but that it would hurt her making her feel like I am going against her and don't care about her.  She thinks that I should not go so that it would tell the other side of the family that I support her.  \n\nTLDR: Mom and Grandmother fought.  Grandmother's bday party is coming up but Mom doesn't want me to go so she could feel supported.  Neither of them is completely innocent.\n\n So WIBTA if I go to my grandmother's 80th birthday party even if it will hurt my mother?",

      "description": "I'm feeling guilty that I haven't met the expectations of my grieving friend.\n\nMy best friend is extremely high maintenance.  As her maid of honour 2 years ago, I was expected to go to pretty insane lengths to keep her happy and keep the bridesmaids performing up to her expectations (daily hour long phone calls were just the start).  This lasted for over a year and a half, which drained me incredibly but I hung in there and rose to the occassion, thinking this level of attention would drop back down after the wedding.\n\nAfter the wedding, I took some time to catch up on my life, focus on myself and get things in order since I'd let a lot fall by the wayside leading up to her wedding.\n\n6 months after the wedding she lost her mum unexpectedly. At the same time I started a new job that left me with zero time to myself whatsoever.  I'm talking 8 hours a day work, 4 hours a day travel and 2-3 hours of an evening doing studies as well as looking after my own family.\n\nI called every 3 days, texted daily but didn't get a chance to see her until the funeral (which I was lucky to even be able to get to).  I also sent a huge bouquet of flowers the day after it happened, not that flowers really help, but still.\n\nI've been feeling guilty that I should be dedicating more time to her.  AITA for not going to greater efforts to provide support? She has a huge in-law family who have been supporting her throughout this, not to mention her new husband and a few other friends who live very closeby who can visit (I live over an hour drive away) so I felt that she did have a LOT of support pouring in from every angle.\nShe has sent me a lengthy message explaining how I haven't been there for her enough.

When they got back we all told friend A she shouldn’t smoke anymore because she just threw up. \n\nThis caused friend A to curse and swear at both friend B and C. Then continue to argue with me. She started saying that we were all ganging up on her and got really angry. I was trying to explain to her that she just needed to calm down and listen to others for a minute, but that was just causing more of an argument. \n\nHere’s what really made my blood boil: \n\nWhile friend A and I were arguing she said, “why do they gotta pick on me”? \n\nI said “who”? \n\nShe clarified that she meant friends B and C. \n\nBefore I had a chance to say anything else, this girl I’ve been friends with for close to 10 years, looked me right in the eyes and said \n\n“why can’t they pick on you I just want them to pick on you”? \n\nI literally looked at her stunned and was like “why the hell would you want them picking on me”? \n\nHer response, “so they’re not picking on me”. \n\nI felt really hurt by her saying that and I almost wanted to cry. Friends B and C’s jaws just kind of dropped. \n\nLater we let her smoke more, she apologized to the others but not me. Now I’m just confuse whether I did anything wrong or not, but I still can’t believe that someone who is supposed to be my friend would say that to me. \n\nShe was bullied a lot when we were younger by her peers, because she doesn’t have great hygiene and stuff, and I have noticed in the recent past I am expected to stick up for her but she kind of enjoys or laughs along if anybody is picking on me. \n\nWas it mean to all gang up and tell her not to smoke anymore? It’s just like, if you’re puking is it not a waste to being smoking more??? Like really. ",

      "description": "My fiance (30F) and I (26M) have been together for just over five years now. We initially met at work, but now both of us work in two different facilities. Since she started at her new job a year ago she's become work friends with a mid-40s dude that I used to work with at our mutual workplace (this dude works PRN and lives five hours away from our city, relavent later). Based on my previous work experience with him this was kinda surprising as he was a fairly quiet dude and kept to himself. \n\nAround fall of last year she admitted to me she had a bit of a crush on him. I'm realistic and realize that people occasionally have work crushes when in committed relationships. I trusted her not to take things too far as if I felt I couldn't trust her with something like that the relationship wasn't one to stay in anyway. Her interactions with him were limited to at work and via text.\n\nHer and I have infrequent sex (once or twice a month) and it typically consists of her lying passivly while I do my thing. Well a couple months back it was particularly passionate and something about it just gave me a sense of dread. Well two weeks back she admitted to me that not only was she thinking about her work friend during it, but she had told her work friend about it asking him if it was normal. I was taken aback and told her she needed to stop talking to him, but reassured her that we would work through this together. \n\nShe admitted to me a few days back that a few days after telling me about the first incident she texting him a nude photo of her. She tells me this photo was unsolicited and was not asked for. Again I was taken aback that 1) she was still talking to him, and 2) that she would betray my trust like that a second time. I told her she needs to stop talking to him if she wants us to heal our relationship.\n\nNow with just the above its pretty obvious that I'm NTA. However for context my fiance has never been in a relationship that's lasted longer than 3 years, we have been having our relationship issues but both sides prior have been loyal, she has been cheated on or abused in all of her relationships giving her self-esteem issues a-plenty, she has a small social circle that have mostly moved away or gotten jobs that keep them occupied more days than not. Even prior to all this she told me she values his friendship because she feels she can talk to him openly (red-flag for me when she told me that and I reinforced that I'm supposed to be that person she talks to openly). \n\nI want to give her an ultimatum between her friend and I. I love her dearly and care about her even more so I would hate what forcing her choice would do to her. Whether she loses her friend or me its going to make her spiral further in her depression. AITA for forcing this decision on her?\n\nTLDR; 5 year long fiance sexts her best friend coworker and I want to give her the ultimatum of cutting him off or losing me. ",

      "description": "I had been in one of the worst relationships of my life for about a year, and he ended it ~~over text~~ during my first week of college. Obviously shitty timing with the whole \"adjusting to my new surroundings\" thing, but it couldn't have been better for me. \n\nI hope that none of you have experienced what I have, but I know some of you have and experienced even worse. It started small where he'd dictate who I could and couldn't talk to. No guy friends (except for our mutual friends which will come into play later) despite him cheating on me twice that I know of, and whatever girl friends I had, distanced themselves because he would rarely let me see them and hogged all of my spare time to himself and I refused to hear reason from them ~~brainwashed.~~  It escalated to him dictating what I would wear when we would go out, refusing to pick me up until I changed my clothes into something of his standards (usually something more revealing or tight fitted).  And then it got way worse.\n\nHe started to force himself onto me sexually, it started as a joke, where I would jokingly resist, but really he and I knew I was on board. But then there were more times than not that I actually didn't want to do anything, and he would still proceed to do what he wanted. I never complained, or lashed out at him about it, or else he would hit me. \n\nSo he was not a pleasant man. And I never left because like I'm sure some of you may know, you can be blinded when you love someone. But that's all important. Even just hearing his name makes my skin crawl, and mention of him makes me feel actually nauseated. \n\nBut we had our mutual friends, and I wasn't going to drop friendships just because I hated my ex. Then one day, I was with a mutual friend and his father, and his father tells me that my ex had been up to visit my friend the night before. And while, yes, I know it wasn't any of my business, I was furious. I felt so betrayed. So betrayed in fact, that I later that night texted him and told him that I couldn't be his friend if he was going to be friends with that snake. Later that night I realized that I was the asshole and I apologized. I owned up to being overly sensitive, and knowing he had been so near to my college shook me up bad. He accepted my apology, and things were fine. \n\nAbout 2 weeks later, this friend posts a picture of him and my ex on his Snapchat story, at a concert of one of my favorite artists, that I had taken my ex to for the previous Christmas. I unfriended him more to save myself from seeing more of my ex than anything. But it felt like a total slap in the face. \n\nThen just this passed New Years Eve, I get a Snapchat video from my best friend. This guy is like a brother to me. He was up here at my school the night after my ex left me because he wanted to comfort me, he took me in for a few days when I couldn't stay at my home, and he and I have talked about everything. Loved each other to death. But he sends me a video of my ex at his house for a new years party. I didn't care that I hadn't been invited, all I could think was \"why the fuck?\" so I texted him, clearly upset. And he says \"lol sorry\". Not posted on his story, not an \"oops wrong person\" he sent a 5 minute video of just my ex to me specifically.\n\nI haven't spoken to him since, and I told him that I couldn't be friends with someone who could backstab me like that. I have a new boyfriend now, and he respects whatever decision I make in regards to my ex, but he has said to me that cutting my friends out like that might be a little harsh, with them being the only friends I had back home (since I wasn't allowed to have any other friends).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; my friend posted a picture of my abusive ex boyfriend, and another sent me specifically a video of the ex boyfriend, and I cut them off.

      "description": "At a bowling tournament this weekend I asked a group of people to move tables.  \n\nThe tournament requires that teams move lanes between games.  Its considered courteous not to crowd the people bowling ahead of you, but the seating arrangements can be contentious, theres good and bad seats at every pair of lanes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTypically, most pairs of lanes have a low table, and a high table behind them.  When my game finished I went to the lanes we're moving to, chit chatted with the guys bowling ahead of us, and put my bag down and walked away to stay out of their way while they finished their game.  \n\n\nWhen I came back, a group of people had sat down at the high table where I left my bag. as our games started up, I realized they were bowling in the pair of lanes next to ours, with a free table available over there.  I politely asked them: \"would you guys mind moving over to that table behind your own lanes so our group can stay together?\"  \n\n\nThe woman simply said \"No we prefer to sit here.\"  \n\n\nAdmittedly I can be stubborn, so I said \"its just that, your lanes are over there, and that table behind your pair of lanes is free.\"  \n\n\nshe said again \"we prefer here\" and at this point her husband jumped in and said \"we were here first\"  \n\n\nNow I'm actually mad, because they were the last bowlers in their group, and I'm the first, theres no way thats true, and even if it was, its only because I was being courteous to the bowlers ahead of us and giving them space. Also, what is this Junior High?  \n\n\nI called them Rude and said they need to stay on their lane's tables. she said \"are you done?\" I said \"sure.\" and they stayed out of my way the rest of the day.  \n\n\nAITA?

We’ll call my guy friend C, and his ex, who I’m also very good friends with, L. C isn’t a big concert goer but L loves 21 pilots just as much as me, so I invited her and two other friends to go.

When I first found out I definitely planned on uninviting her, but L has a long history of anxiety and depression, and the week after they broke up both her grandmother and her cat passed away. I didn’t want to also tell her she couldn’t go to the concert and add onto what all she was dealing with, and now that the dust has settled I just feel bad for having to pick a side and want her to come anyways.

      "description": "  I've been in my apartment building for 3 1/2 years now. The building has 24 apartments, not all are occupied. There are only 2 sets of washers/dryers. All of the younger occupants use their parents washers.  I have kids and a lot of laundry to do. Normally running 4 loads every Wednesday, and a buffer load or two Saturday. I don't always get down to change the loads right when they finish as it's crazy some days keeping up with the kids. It's been the norm to come down to my laundry put on the clean folding table adjacent to the washers. And I don't blame them for not taking their day to wait for me. Everyone uses both washers at a time if they have the loads. If you go down and both are taken, but leave your basket, the first person starts to leave one open knowing someone is waiting. \n  Yesterday, I go down with only two loads to run. One washer taken, one open. Cycle is finished, clothes sitting. I give it a few minutes and decide to start digging out the tree and christmas decor from storage. No one shows by the time I'm ready to start carrying up the 10 large bins to the second floor. So I move the laundry and start both cycles because there's no laundry basket with clothes waiting. \n  Carry up my second set of boxes and headed down for my third trip and when I pass a new renter, single mother and her kid are in the laundry room. The conversation as follows:\n  NewGirl: umm excuse me!\n  Me: yes?\n  NG: did you move my laundry?\n  Me: yeah, it's all on the counter. I didn't see anyone that needed the washers, so I started both. You need me to leave a dryer open when I move mine over?\n   NG: *0-100. Starts screaming* Your are rude. Really rude. That's my laundry and you don't touch it. There's 24 apartments here and two washers. You moved mine and took both washers.\n  Me: I'm sorry. The cycle on the machine to the right takes 31 minutes. The machine on the left takes 28. It'll be done in 12 minutes. Do you need it then?\n  NG: No I don't. But you're rude your shouldn't touch my laundry. I only use one at a time. I've done 8 loads today. *More cussing and betraying ensues...*\n  Me: *still holding restraint as her daughter was in the room* Look. I've been here for 3 1/2 years now *completely cuts me off to scream at this point*\n  NG: I don't care how long you've been here. I'm 52 years old and you're... *at which point I am losing it and cut her off*\n  Me: I don't give two shits how old you are. Don't care if you're a single mother to your one kid. I have three and it doesn't give me an excuse to scream at my neighbor the first time I've talked to them. No one waits for me to come down and change my laundry and I don't expect them to wait. I would never take 8 1/2 hours to do 8 loads of laundry and you shouldnt have either. Use both the washers and you'd be done in half the time instead of taking up half the machines literally all day. I've also seen people leave their laundry sitting for hours and entire days in the wash or dryer. *Again cut off*\n  NG: *with more profanity in front of her child* 5 minutes. 5 minutes! That's all it was sitting for.\n  Me: simply not true. You're just being a real bitch about this and not how a 52 year old adult should approach a conversation. I'm not waiting hours for the people that leave their clothes. I don't know, not would I care that it's your laundry there. I have no we a6 of knowing how long it's been sitting there before it's okay to move it\n  NG: you shouldn't move anyone's laundry. You're a rude asshole.\n  Me: well you're pretty screwed. I wake at 4 am. Everyday. My throw away laundry will be in both washers every morning at that time, and it'll sit there. Don't you dare touch it.\n  NG: *storms away mumbling the whole way*\n\nObviously an unpleasant person. Her approach to the situation unreasonable and uncalled for. But as for laundry etiquette, AITA???",

Like what it's not fair to me that I have to give up my room that is already the smallest room in the house because my sister dropped out. I have no control over what she does it's such bullshit.

      "description": "So this happened a while back but it still nags at me. I had stared a new job i was 16 at the time and it was in a small cafe like shop. It was i think my second time in the closing shift and the way we close down usually breaks down like this. We close doors at 8:00 and do all of the cleaning up (washing dishes, prepping for tomorrow, sweeping floor, wiping tables etc.) Then we take one last look around and lock up and leave, the times that I closed we left usually around 10pm as there are only 2 people shutting down. So i was working at the till and the person i was closing with was working at the food section so we start closing. I count the remaining sweets we have left and take the old products to the back as they will either get thrown out or donated and clean the sweets counter. Then I start counting the money and filling out papers for how much we had in sales and they are about half done with their station. Once i finish i put the cash in a safe in the back and start cleaning up the coffee station. By this time its about 8:30 and they finish their station and start washing dirty dishes. So i get finished cleaning the coffee station at around 9:30 and start cleaning the tables in the front and sweeping and mopping the area. 10:45 hits us and we have to clock out (we get written up if we dont clock out in time) so I finish up the rest of the mopping and its about 11:00 and my parents were texting me because they were picking me up and wondering where i was. As i had cleaned up all of the front and mopped and sweeped everything and my partner was still in the back washing dishes (mind you its been about 2 hours and 30 minutes at this point). So i asked them if i could go because it was getting late and all they had to finish was the dishes. Now we dont have a dinner rush at this cafe, most of the customers come in at middday and the shift before us does dishes then too so there arent a ton of dishes to clean and we had a big dishwasher. So they shouldnt be washing dishes for that long. I ask if i could go because my family was waiting for me and they said \"yeah, have a goodnight see you tomorrow\" so i thought i was in the clear, but i was wrong. The next day they had sent a picture of the dirty dishes to the works group chat at 1AM saying that they couldnt do it all because i had left them. Which looked like the same ammount of dishes that were there when i left. So Am I the Asshole for leaving? ",

      "description": "TLDR: My boyfriend's (21) brother is autistic and 17-18. He has asked my boyfriend personal questions about our sex life, and their mom sees it as he is developmentally about 14-15 and starting to be curious about sex and all. He keeps bringing up that he wants to see me wearing cat ears like an anime catgirl, and I am very uncomfortable.\n\nAnime is likely my boyfriend's brother's special interest, so I try to engage him in conversation since I had an anime phase in high school (I'm 22). His family doesn't really know much about anime, and I understand how that can be frustrating to not have anyone to share your hobby with.\n\nI frequently wear a choker with a little bell on it, and his brother (I'll call him C for simplicity's sake) tells me it reminds him of anime catgirls. That's fair enough. But he has asked repeatedly to see me wearing cat ears like an anime catgirl. Knowing anime tropes, I'm aware of how sexualized catgirls are (if you're not familiar, a quick google image search will probably do the trick).\n\nI want to give him the benefit of the doubt that this request doesn't have any sexual undertones, but he has also asked my boyfriend what we do with the door closed/why we sleep with the door closed at night and if we showered together. Their mom had to explain to him why not to ask those kinds of questions, and she is aware of his budding sexuality as he is closer to 14-15 maturity wise.\n\nC brought it up again the other day, asking if he could see me wear cat ears like an anime catgirl and how cool it'd be if catgirls were real and how they'd have catlike mannerisms. I tried to go along like yeah cat ears are cute and that's a thing in a lot of anime. My boyfriend said something along the lines of \"C, that sounds ridiculous to be in real life,\" and C replied \"this is just between me and (thr0waway9295).\" My boyfriend and I were both really uncomfortable, but I tried to defend C like \"he means because you don't like anime.\"\n\nBut I can't help but wonder if this is sexual in nature or if it has anything to do with the fact that I'm Chinese. They have a cousin similar in age who is also into anime, and some of her drawings are hanging in C's room. Would he also want to see her wearing cat ears since they have similar interests too?\n\nIn any case, I am very uncomfortable with the entire situation. I brought this up to my boyfriend briefly, and I definitely will talk to him about it again.\n\nAITA if I want to be around C less and voice this to my boyfriend? Am I just being too sensitive/not considerate enough of his autism?",

      "description": "My mom fosters two distant cousins. They help at her store. One is a teenager, and the other a young adult (let's call him Ander)\n\nI came in last week, having not been home since December. Yesterday, I'm helping supervise body work on mom's car and mom joins me there in the evening. It starts to get late and she wants to relay instructions for the boys to close up shop but she doesn't have Ander's phone number, so she calls her neighbour to give his phone to Ander. He obliges but moments later he calls, pissed, that he didn't sign up to be insulted. Mum immediately says to give the phone to the teenager. She proceeds to give instructions and end the call and completely glosses over the \"insult\" statement by her neighbour. So I ask her. Turns out Ander has done this before, amongst other public shows of disrespect towards my mother\n\nWhen we get home, against my mom's wishes to ignore his affront, I confront Ander and he keeps being rude towards me and my mom. This devolves to a fist fight and afterwards I ask him to pack up and leave our house. \n\nHe obliges, saying how he's done with my shit. Starts to pack. Says he would treat my fuck up. Says I'll pay for disrespecting him in such a manner. How do I have the guts to hit him. Is he a kid?\n\nI can't believe it. He's been with us over 5 years now. My mom has treated you like her own son. Clothe you. Feed you. Sheltered you. Bought you a phone last Christmas and you disregarded it because its too small. It was an itel. I'm barely ever home myself. I expect that when I'm not home, you'd protect and stand up for my mother not disrespect her.\n\nTurns out his reason for not picking the call was because, in his words, Why would mummy call &lt;neighbour&gt; when I have a phone in my pocket?\n\nIn the meanwhile, my mom is now on the phone with my aunt, and his dad. She's begging me to let him stay but I'm not having it so she figures they'd be able to talk me down.\n\nNow the extended family is involved. Most of them saying the same thing, that I should let him stay and we should all go to bed and discuss it in the morning. But I have a better idea, since he wants to leave, and I don't want him here. I escort him and his stuff to another aunts place, a few blocks from my mom's.\n\nThis morning, mom agrees to have him back, at least till he can start a business of his own with her help (which was agreed upon when she started fostering him, estimated to be the end of this year). I want whatever mom wants but I'm not comfortable with it. Dad (not around) and siblings and a few cousins agrees with me that he should leave. My aunt gives him a stern talking to and promises me that he would do better \n\nAnder returns to the store. We share a terse but civil interaction. No apology was offered to me or my mother\n\nA family meeting is planned for this evening.\n\nTL;DR cousin is disrespectful and I kick him out in the middle of the night, starting a shitstorm of family drama",

Nothing is ever good enough, nothing is ever praised, nothing I ever accomplished was looked at with anything other than indifference. If I ever asked for help financially it was always met with long lectures about how stupid I am and then it would be held over my head for months and snide underhanded comments would be made like \"Well we cant go to the movies because (me) cant handle their finances.\" \n\nThere is SO MUCH MORE crap to add to this but... due to cut hours and loss of business my check these last few weeks have been less than I am used to. I missed a bill and my power got shut off. I get paid this Saturday and I'll get it paid and the lights back on.. I just have to make due for a few nights. \n\nMy mother found out and offered to pay my electric bill. I refused because its easier on me to just live in the dark than deal with her emotional abuse. Anyways, she argued with me about it and demanded to know why I wouldn't accept her help. I broke down and told her, she makes me feel like a piece of shit and I'm tired of feeling like that. I'm tired of her acting like shes never had hard times herself and that I didn't want to deal with her BS about me sucking and the jokes about me needing help. \n\nHer responses were that she was sorry, ok, and goodnight.\n\nNow I feel like garbage for possibly hurting her feelings... am I the asshole?",

      "description": "This happened a few days ago. We were texting and I was telling her about a stressful situation I was in. I’ll explain just to give context. At her suggestion, I had written a piece for a local writing competition and was trying to submit it. The group holding the competition only lets members participate, but I had already decided to join and sent in my application two weeks prior. They didn’t respond to my email until that day. They said I couldn’t join until they reviewed a piece of my work to see if I’m good enough. Had they responded earlier, that would be fine, but instead, since they were slow they weren’t going to be even considering my membership until after the deadline for the competition. \n\nI told her all of this and how frustrating it was. I told her it annoyed me and made me kinda angry that they were being unprofessional in their slowness and how it almost felt intentional, since the email I got even mentioned that had they read it sooner I would have been fine, but I *just* missed it. She responded over text in short snippets. She told me that if the group annoyed me that much I should just stop complaining and do something else. I shouldn’t care about joining if they annoy me that much. \n\nI got kinda mad at her and told her as much. We had a little fight. I didn’t like how she was being short with me and getting mad at me for venting. She vents about her problems to me all the time and she’s always encouraged me to be more open and to talk to her when I’m having problems. After we discussed it, she explained that she had not intended to seem annoyed or angry at me.  I apologized for the mean things I said. \n\nShe is still mad at me for not apologizing for misinterpreting her messages. It’s my opinion, which I expressed to her, that I shouldn’t have to apologize for her making me feel bad. When I’m not clear with what I say and I offend her, which thankfully doesn’t happen often, I apologize for miscommunication. \n\nI have apologized for the mean things I said while angry. I don’t feel like I should apologize for being offended by what she said. I don’t want to set a precedent where I apologize whenever she makes me feel bad. It doesn’t really happen often, but it just seems like a bad idea to set that precedent. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "Tldr at the bottom.\n\nI'm 26F and my boyfriend is 32. \n\nWe've been together for about 8 months. My lease is up and I want to move, but we aren't ready to move in together yet. So, we decided that I would find an apartment close to him, and then we would see how we're feeling in 6 months when his lease is up, and decide then if we want to move in together. That way we aren't rushing things, but are still leaving the option open.\n\nSo, today, I was talking about apartment places that I've been looking into, and I told him that I found an open apartment in the complex next to his apartments. (He lives in an apartment complex that has 8 buildings or so. The one I found is not one of those, but in the next complex over, which is pretty much a one minute drive, because you just have to exit his complex, turn onto the main street, and then into the complex next to it.) \n\nHe just said no, and was super weird about it. I asked him if it was because it was too close and he was weirded out by it, and he said that wasn't it. I kept pushing and he eventually admitted his ex-girlfriend lives in that complex. They broke up about 6 months before we got together, and I honestly never asked too many questions. I know they were together for about 3 years, and that she broke up with him and he thinks she was cheating toward the end. I never looked her up, don't even know what she looks like. I got upset because I feel like \"Oh by the way, my ex lives one minute away from me\" is something he should have told me about, right? But I didn't want to cause an issue over nothing, so I didn't bother pushing it. \n\nBut then I got to thinking. Sometimes he'll pick me up and I'll end up at his place for the weekend without my car. When that happens, instead of driving me 40 minutes to my house to get my car just to come back, he'll let me use his truck to run errands or to the store or whatever while I'm at his place. There's been at least 4 occasions when a white car has followed me down the main road, followed me all the way to the back of the complex, and then left when I pulled into his garage. I was curious once and followed them back, and they pulled into that complex next door and parked, but didn't get out so I couldn't see what they looked like. I now feel like it almost has to be her? I told my boyfriend this story, not knowing she lived there, and mentioned that it really freaked me out and I didn't want to drive around alone anymore. He played it off as 'really weird' and at one point said I was probably being paranoid. But if he knew it was her, shouldn't he have told me? I've been on high alert looking out for myself, thinking I was being stalked, and it turned out to be his ex, and he played it off like I was crazy. \n\nI brought this up and it started a big fight with us (a first for us) and he thinks I'm overreacting. I basically stormed out and haven't talked to him since yesterday. But now I'm not sure if I was right to be so upset. AITA? \n\nTl;dr: My boyfriend didn't tell me that his ex lives a minute away, and she's been following me and he's played it off like I'm crazy. Am I overreacting by being so upset? ",

      "description": "Hello, this is my first post on reddit, I've seen the subreddit in YouTube Compilatory Videos and i thought this was the best place to talk about this ongoing debate I've had with my bud for years:  \n\n\nSo there's this guy (we'll call him Mike) that I've been friends since Kindergarten and is still, to this date, one of my best friends. We live in different cities now, but every time we're together, we bring this up, so I thought it would be better to settle it once and for all:  \n\n\nSo, about 5-6 years ago, we were in my city's local Amusement Park, and Mike just had one of the newest iPod Touch models (They were kinda popular at that time), and we see one of these games where one guy sits in a plank and the other throws a ball at a target to try &amp; get him into a small pool with water (Dunk Tank, I believe it's called).  \n\n\nMike and I decide to play it, we bought 3 tries each, and I waws the first to sit in the thing. Mike got me on his second try and I fell into the water. Then we switched places.  \nFor some reason, Mike had kinda forgoten to take his iPod out his pocket, but he didn't really care that much, since my aiming wan't great.  \n\n\nLike I said, my aiming wasn't that good, so I give my first try, I fail, same with the second one, but when i went to pick up the ball for my last try, I thought *\"Screw It, I'm not gonna get him anyways\"*, and i just pressed the button with my hand, obviously without knowing he had the iPod in his pocket.  \n\n\nSo, he comes out of the tank, we walk away, and about 5 minutes later, he realizes that the iPod fell into the water alongside him. He tried to turn it on, Nothing. He put it in rice for a few days, Nothing. The thing broke down beyond the point of easy repairing.  \n\n\nAITA? He always says that i wasn't going to land that 3rd try (which is true) and that's why he didn't bother taking out the iPod, plus, I broke the rules by hitting the button with my hand, but in my defense, neither of us remembered he had it in his pocket, and I wouldn't have pressed the button if i knew he had it with him, or if, you know, he had taken it out and handed it to me before getting into a water-based atraction.  \n\n\nThanks beforehand for helping me settle the debate, and I'm sorry if there are spelling/grammar mistakes. English isn't my first language and I haven't practiced it in a while now.  \n",

      "description": "My in-laws are very traditional and have very specific ideas about Holliday's that my wife and I don't share. Specifically for every Holliday they buy the kids a basket of candy filled with plastic tinsel that we feel terrible about throwing away.\n\nSo the other day I decided to send them a text about upcoming Valentine's day and what they were planning. I'll post the text and their response next.\n\nMy text:  Hey for Valentine's this year if you guys want to get the kids stuff can you please give things like nuts, seeds or beef jerky instead of candy. They also need things like deodorant, nail clippers, Combs. Also please don't give them the plastic or metallic streamers or confetti. We agree it looks nice but we feel terrible having to think about how it will be around for thousands of years so we could enjoy it for a few seconds.  I know it's presumptuous of us to ask all this but if it wasn't important to us we wouldn't ask, so thank you for your understanding.\n\nTheir response: Whattt??? We only do pizza on Valentine's day and I dont think we've ever bought streamers or confetti. Personal hygiene products are your department, I think, and the candy hearts aren't event available this year, so no worries!\n\nThe next day I talked to my FIL about and and basically tried to tell him we understand it's their tradition to buy baskets but basically we agreed to disagree. Later that day my MIL called my wife to bitch her out about this and basically they are super angry and think it's rude of us to ask them to change and we are stupid for worrying about the environmental impact of their gifts. They also said my text was extremely rude.\n\nI recognize bringing this up in person would have been the best thing but I didn't because I knew it would devolve into a shouting match and I was hoping starting the convo with a text would let everyone calm down and gather their thoughts before we talked in person.

      "description": "My wife and I are staying at her mother's house while we're shopping for a new home. \n\nMy wife's brother is also staying at the house as he is jobless. He has mental issues and is being medicated to help control his anger. He's been mostly fine in the time we've been staying there but my wife insist that it's only because I'm there. He also has drug problems. He has pawned his PS4 4 times this past month and the MIL has brought it back from the pawn shop. No end to that cycle.\n\nThe MIL has a mild case of hoarding. There is random shit everywhere. We cleaned up the basement to make room for ourselves but goddamn, it's messy, dirty, but not horribly unlivable. \n\nWe have numerous nieces and nephews on my side of the family. It's fairly normal when these kids are staying overnight at their grandparents or their aunt and uncle house. \n\nMy wife and I are trying for a baby and the topic came up of whether or not we're going to allow our family to babysit our children overnight. I'm ok with my side of the family doing that, they all have kids, they're experienced and they're normal.\n\nHer family, however, I won't allow our children to stay with them overnight (Except maybe her sister after some changes to be made). That was my firm statement to my wife. She was disappointed to hear that. \n\nHer mother's house is not a safe environment for children to stay, there's a drug user with mental issue staying there. It's a filthy place to stay. Her sister has a pair of dogs that I wouldn't leave young kids around without supervision, it also doesn't help when her boyfriend constantly drinks and leaves beer cans all over the place (I'm not talking 10 or so, I'm talking a garbage bag full of cans after cleaning up one time)\n\nMy wife said that it's possible that her mother can clean up, get rid of her brother and said the same for her sister. \n\nI believe that her mother is stuck in a cycle where she is enabling her son's drug habits (Who the fuck buys a PS4 4 times from a pawn shop?) and thinks that her house is perfectly fine. Her sister on the other hand, I can see some improvement but as I said, her family has ways to go to prove to me that they're capable of taking care of little kids.\n\ntldr; wife's family is fucked up, I told her I won't let our future children stay with them",

      "description": "We moved into a townhouse in mid-December. Ever since we moved in, there have been posters for a lost cat. The flyers looked pretty old, so I checked Facebook and see that the cat went missing on July 15. I'm not sure if the cat has been found or not. The last update on Facebook was August 21 saying he wasn't found.\n\nI know it's kind of assholey to take them down since they're not mine, but they're an eyesore and have to come down eventually. Seven months is long enough, right? I assume he's either found or dead.\n\n(I could also text the owner and ask if he was found, but if he hasn't been, that would be pretty awkward.)\n\nWould I be the asshole to take the flyers down?

I have other houses rented out to Section 8 tenants, and normally don't have issues.  This woman and her family have been nothing but evil and destructive. She immediately moved her mother in to watch her 4 kids.  She is not supposed to have other adults living there.  I would not have really minded but, her mother who wasn't supposed to live there, was running a daycare out of there.  This put additional wear and tear on the house.  They finally left at the end of the lease, but they have torn up so many things, the deposit will not even cover it.  I could try to go after her in small claims court, but I doubt she will pay.

      "description": "We have had 3 history teachers this year:\n\n\"Original\" teacher called Jans, he had an accident and hasn't come to school for a month.\n1st substitute teacher called Joshua, actually really cool and interesting guy, his teaching method was kind of old in the way that he only talks and we listen but the way he tells things makes all the class shut up and pay attention. Surprisingly he also had an accident after 3 days of being there so he had to leave.\n2nd substitute teacher called Melany, actual pain in the ass, not trying to be harsh or rude, but her teaching method is not the kind anyone in my school is used to, let me explain you. We are used to learn with activities that keep us entertained and interested in the class, every teacher in the school does it, even Jans did it. But she somehow expects for 25 loud teenagers to sit and shut up in the class reading and answering questions individually when we are not used to.\n\nSo today at History. I got to be honest, my class is very loud and makes a lot of jokes in general. We usually joke sometimes by singing happy birthday even when there is no actual birth day that day, but we have fun and the teachers have fun. But not this teacher. She started saying how disrespectful it was to her and that she will be telling the principal about it. We only shut up but kept messing a round doing jokes BUT at the same time working on what she told us to (read and answer questions individually). She told us to behave ourselves and that we have to work individually and in silence. Many of us only shut up for a minute and then kept talking and joking. This is the way we behave all the time yet we get good grades. \n\nSome of us got bothered and complained that her teaching method was boring and that we were used to do more activities to learn. She said we had to get used to her method because she will be with us for another 2 weeks. I didn't said anything at the moment, but had a lot of things to say to her. The time passed and eventually, minutes before the period ended, someone complained again and she said the same thing. So I told her that her teaching method was too old and that it basically was useless now because there are better and easier ways to learn nowdays that benefit the student and the teacher. She didn't respond, but I'm sure she heared because later everybody told me how \"daring\" I was telling her that. \n\nI was planning on repeating it on Monday since to my view of point, we are right and she is wrong. But I would like to know if I behaved like an a-hole by saying that even if she didn't respond. \n\nJust keep in mind something that I've learned trough the years. If there are teachers that are able to control a group of \"misbehaving\" students, it is not because of the students if a teacher is not able to control them, it is probably because of the lack of attitude on the teacher and the way the teacher teach that is not able to control them.

      "title": "AITA for Disapproving of a Friend's Drug Use?",
      "description": "Long post. Sorry in advance.   \n\n\nTo preface, I'm not exactly anti-drug, as I've used a number of recreational substances both legally and illegally, and actively rely on pharmaceutical drugs as part of a treatment plan for my own mental illness and cognitive difficulties.\n\nThat said, my closest friend and I are often at odds over their rampant and reckless drug dependence. They're the sweetest person, but they struggle tremendously with schizophrenia, an eating disorder, self-harm, family issues, and a history of sexual abuse and resultant PTSD. With all that to deal with, I do understand why they've developed such a reliance -- it makes them feel better, helps them forget, allows them to take control of the ways in which their brain is warping, etc. \n\nMy problem is not so much a moral judgment -- if it was, I doubt we ever would have become friends in the first place -- but from what I feel is a place of concern. I feel like with so many issues, feeding a drug habit to the point that it becomes an addiction that their life almost solely revolves around is just making matters worse, and is going to do them more harm than good, even though it may not feel that way to them. Particularly, they've recently gotten into frequently using more hardcore substances like GHB, meth, and crack; all very popular in the chemsex community that they frequent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first time they smoked meth around me, I was extremely uncomfortable, and asked them not to. In my mind, it was because I didn't want to feel like I was enabling the seeds of what I was sure would grow into addiction and be yet another problem to deal with. But when I told them this, they snapped at me, and got deeply upset, humiliated almost, that I would even use the word \"enable\", like I was seeing them like a naughty child that needed to be fixed by my meddling, or a bad person with no self-control. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey told me that they felt judged and hurt by my words because they felt I was someone who understood and wouldn't attack them for their problems and choices. I thought that was a kind of shitty and manipulative way to put it, even if it wasn't intentional, and apologized for making them feel hurt, but defended my position. We've been friends for ages, and they're generally not a manipulator at all, so I was very surprised and assumed they must have honestly meant it.  \n\n\nIt got worse than ever when ended up in a room at a hotel party, just the two of us and a third person. I was already in a bad mood, and it seemed apparent to me that the two of them were regarding me as a dark cloud over their fun, specifically because I didn't want them to smoke meth or crack in the room (partly because it was tied to my card and name), didn't want them to engage in chemsex while I was around, told them they were making me uncomfortable, etc. At one point, as I was in the bathroom, I overheard my close friend tell the other how terrible I was making them feel and how they felt like I was being judgmental and shaming their choices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had a big falling out, but both put in a lot of effort and cooperation to work at fixing our relationship and being honest with one another about what we felt. Even nowadays though, we don't really talk about all the drug use in seriousness. They'll make jokes about being a junkie or a crackhead, so I think they do understand that they have a problem, but are bringing it to me as someone they can trust and act naturally around with that info, without fear of judgment or repercussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm always encouraging them as diplomatically as I can to use more wisely, cut back, think about consequences and what certain cocktails will do to their mental health and body in the comedown period, but we can't ever really truly discuss it without starting an argument about why they aren't allowed to use without being accused of being an addict, how I'm being hypocritical, and haughty, and taking the moral high ground by being against \"hard drugs\" that I've never tried and don't really have much knowledge of -- effectively talking smack without knowing my shit.   \n\n\nUltimately, I feel that my concern stems from a place of caring. I already know that they've got a history of addiction and self-destructive behaviour, and while I know it's not my place to make decisions for them as an adult, I feel like the best I can do for them as a good friend is not encourage anything that could spiral into further self-destruction, even if it means coming across as a nag or a party-pooper. But then why do I still feel so guilty?  \n\n\nTL;DR: AITA for bringing up my junkie friend's problems and constantly encouraging them to get clean -- or at least cleaner -- or am I just being judgmental and meddling in a very intimate problem they're fully aware of, and had the guts to let me in on, only to be hurt and patronised by my lecturing and unhelpful, uninformed mother-henning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I didn't think I had done anything particularly bad until I mentioned this story to a friend who told me what I did was pretty shitty, so I thought I'd post it here to get a group consensus. Also, this is a throwaway account as a couple of people know my real username. So, for a bit of background info, I have been with my girlfriend for just over 2 years and I'm very happy with her. A few weeks ago I was in Waterloo tube station in London and made eye contact with an attractive girl while on an escalator, this happened a few more times with her smile growing bigger each time our eyes met. When we got off the escalator (she was a little ahead of me) she approached me and we began talking.\n\nI considered telling her that I was already with someone, but I found it kind of fun to relive my days as a single man for a brief period, also, something like this has never happened to me before so it was quite exhilarating. After a couple of minutes she asked to exchange numbers which I did to keep up the illusion. We said goodbye and later that day she texted me, so I replied saying that I was already with someone and that I was sorry for misleading her. I also said she was very pretty, and if I was single I would have asked her out in an attempt not to hurt her feelings. She seemed to find it quite funny and texted back saying I had nothing to worry about, we haven't spoken since. I considered the whole thing to be no more than window-shopping, as I had absolutely no intention of cheating on my girlfriend. However, my friend said this was much worse than window shopping and a form of emotional cheating. So, AITA? ",

      "description": "This happened a while ago and I never felt I was in the wrong but I’d like your perspective.\n\nGrowing up I lived on the same road as this girl, I’ll call her Gigi. For over 5 years off and on we played together and walked to school together. I say off and on cause we’d have a lot of fallings out over various things. Eventually when I was 13 I stopped talking to her altogether. I know I was 13 as the last straw was my birthday. The plan was 5 of us would go to the cinema and out for food. One by one all my friends cancelled on the day we were meeting for various reasons (Gigi said her sister stole her money, another was having a hair cut). Until there was one friend left. I was stood at the bus stop on the way to meet the one friend when Gigi and a boy walked past, laughing loudly about how I was still going to meet people and how stupid I was. It honestly didn’t click at the time. I went to town and stood there for over an hour, my final friend didn’t turn up nor did she answer her mobile or house phone. Then I remembered what Gigi had said. It has sounded like she knew there was no one to meet. I went home making sure that I didn’t go past Gigi’s house so she didn’t see me. Monday morning came, the girl who was getting her hair cut hadn’t had it cut. My friend who didn’t turn up gave me multiple excuses: slept at friends house, no alarm clock, not taken phone charger. (I mean we were meeting at 2 so how long did she sleep?) I said ok and went to sit with some other girls in my class. I never confronted any of the girls or Gigi, I never spoke to Gigi again and she never attempted to speak to me. Gigi ended up moving schools (but not houses). I heard from someone else because she claimed she was been bullied and the school was doing nothing to stop it ( she’d moved schools for this reason 2 times before). \nMany years later I’m at the bus stop, Gigi and her mum are there also. Gigi looks at me, I look away. She sits near the front so I have to walk past her to a seat. On the bus Gigi looks upset, is almost crying and her mum is saying loudly about how it’s ok, some people are just fake and immature and that Gigi is better than that. \n\nTLDR: am I the asshole for holding a grudge as she ruined my birthday,  ignoring the old friend and making her cry?

She flipped it around on me saying that she cant believe how little i care about this relationship if i could dump her like that. I told her the same thing but for leaving me to party in a different continent for two months. Im generally a pretty easy going guy but this struck a cord with me.",

      "description": "My husband and I have been married for almost a decade, and we have a 4 year old son. \n\nMy father in law is a functioning alcoholic. My mother in law is oblivious to this fact. She either is in complete denial or doesn’t care, either way, I don’t feel like I can tell her my issues. \n\nOver the last 15 years, whenever we’ve gone out to dinner for a celebration (birthday, anniversaries, whatever), my father in law gets WASTED before we’re even at the restaurant (my mother in law drives, so no “worries” on that front). \n\nThere have been too many instances over the years that have left me embarrassed to even be with them. He’s a jerk to the wait staff, makes stupid jokes about their names, and even made a waitress cry one time because he mocked her teeth. \n\nI always lag behind and leave an extra tip and let the staff know that I’m sorry for his behavior, and they always appreciate the gesture, but I know they’d rather not deal with an asshole!!\n\nNow, we have our 4 year old son, who is becoming very impressionable. I’m getting more and more uncomfortable going out to dinner with my in-laws because of my father in laws behavior. My son adores my father in law (my dad passed away almost 10 years ago, so my father in law is the only grandpa he has) and I don’t want my son to think it’s OK to be a jerk to waitstaff. \n\nI don’t know how to address this with them without them getting defensive about it (apparently, my husbands Godparents brought it up to my in-laws at one time and everyone was so offended that the relationship ended).  My husband had approved them many times about the behavior and they refuse to even acknowledge that there is an issue. \n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to go to out to eat with my alcoholic father in law with my 4 year old son because it sets a bad example for him?? \n",

      "description": "For context: her sister has 3 children and I adore the shit out of those kids. I would do anything for them. However their mom is a recovering addict (who relapsed last year and just restarted recovery) and is currently living with my fiancee's mom since her and her ex-husband lost their house. They've been there for a year. \n\nIn that year, it came to light that her husband was an abusive meth head and that is why he is an ex. That was 2 months ago. At this time, her sister has a new boyfriend who has already cheated on her and has to move out of his current living situation (with his ex) by tomorrow. \n\nSo these two are moving in together. However, they don't know how to save money and have none to move out with. Even though her sister is living rent free at her moms. \n\nHer sister is constantly borrowing money. And every time she does, my fiancee asks how I feel about lending her money and every time I tell her I'm not comfortable with it as she never pays us back until tax time, this year we recieved a lump sum of over $2000 from her to cover what she owed. \n\nSo my fiancee asks me yesterday how I would feel about lending her $1000 to move out. That is a fuck ton of money to just throw away, in my eyes.  She tells me that her boyfriend will pay us back next week from his taxes and until then we will hold on to the title of his car. \n\nI told her that I wasn't comfortable with it and that if we lend money to her sister I feel as if we won't get it back. Especially if we rely on her boyfriend, who has already cheated on her sister, to pay it. \n\nToday she calls me and says she lent them $700. I told her not to ask me anymore how I feel about lending her sister money if she isn't going to take my thoughts into account. She's now angry at me for being upset and not wanting to lend the money. \n\nHalf of that money is mine. We pool our incomes together because she is better at budgeting and stuff like that than I am. \n\nAm I the asshole for being upset?",

He said that I have to learn to not dump my responsibilities just because someone asks me to be there for them and I shouldn't let people take advantage of me. That i need to stop being too naive and immature for him and that I had plans for tonight. The only plans we had was him watching tv and i was supposed to do all the laundry and dishes and write both our rent checks. Honestly idk.. am i really the asshole for making sure my friend isn't dying? She hit her head on a steel beam at work a couple months ago and has since then, several times, lost her vision in her left eye, becomes really dizzy and lightheaded and nauseos, she couldn't speak a full sentence to me at work today, she was shaking so bad.. she has a blood clotting disorder and a hit to the head like that she could've had a stroke. The longer it goes, the worse and higher chances for her having one. I just wanted to make sure she was ok and she asked me to go, and i offered to take her anyway. If i wouldn't have taken her, she wouldn't have went.. thankfully the doctor's don't think anything super serious is wrong, but it's still pretty dangerous for her. ",

      "description": "What it says on the tin. I've been curious about that. I'm a college student and I don't have a lot in the way of disposable income, but I still like giving my friends and family little gifts. This semester I quit my job because it's my senior year and I want to focus on school as much as possible, so I have even less income than I normally do. My family doesn't expect much from me gift wise, but I'm an adult now and not giving presents makes be feel kinda bad tbh. Like I'm still a kid lol.\n\nHowever, I got an early Christmas gift from a grandma that was a 150$ amazon gift card. I was excited cause I thought I could totally buy my friends and family more gifts now. \n\nBut now I'm starting to second guess myself. I feel like it's kind of a grey area. Is it asshole-ish to buy presents for people with money that didn't actually come from your own pocket? My bf said it's fine, but others I've asked have had more mixed opinions.\n\nSo now I'm more just curious. What do you guys think? Would I be an asshole buying presents for people with the gift card since the presents didn't come from my bank account? Or does it not matter at the end of the day cause its the act of giving?",

I live in a different city to my family for study and just try and find whatever room works with what I can pay. She was nice and her sister OL lived there too.\n\nThings were alright but after KL had family over Christmas I started noticing someone of my food has started to go missing. I haven't told KL yet but I think it's OL taking food or someone KL has over. I'm not too sure though as I'm at work a lot lately to be able to pay for rent.\n\nBut over Christmas and New Years because they were bank holidays my rent would be given a day later. And KL was asking me about it on Boxing Day going like hey havent gotten the rent yet. And considering KL had her family here as well and KL was asking about rent in front of this family, it made me probably seem like I dont pay rent. Now at this point I had never ever missed a week of rent. I still havent. And the fact that KL doubted me sorta hurt.\n\nBut over the last few weeks KL would have people over and they would be here for hours. Or better yet staying the night. But KL doesnt tell me. No heads up. The only thing I get told now is when KL gets food from some sort of event.\n\nI don't tell KL when I have work cause I don't really see the point of telling KL if I am independent and get to work my own way.\n\nBut tonight especially. So someone comes over at 10pm. And I'm like ok weird for someone to be here so late but I'll leave it. KL is talking to this person for 3 hours. Moving to the kitchen. Which if we all know echoes a little which is really annoying. \n\nBut here's the thing. I have work early. And I wake up even earlier to catch the bus because I live a while away from work. KL knows what time I get up for these early shifts. \n\nBut literally at 1am KL turns on the hallway light. Which shines right into my room.\n\nAnd another problem that has occurred is the laundry. Because I work weird hours I do my washing whenever I can. But the laundry isnt connected to any other room of the house. It's a separate little room out the backdoor. And lately KL has locked it. And I being the socially awkward person I am cant bring myself to ask KL or OL to unlock it cause it just seems weird asking to have access to a thing I should have access to considering I'm paying my rent and everything.\n\nBut yeah so I've been finding food and supplies being used so I keep most stuff in my room and I haven't confronted KL about it. But stuff that has gonna missing or used is stuff either I paid money for or stuff I got from other people who kindly gave me stuff. \n\nOver Christmas I saw my family and got some little Christmas treats from them. I put the treats on my shelf in the fridge. The next thing I know they are gone completely. \n\nStuff from my shelf in the freezer has been moved and used. I just feel like people are using stuff that doesn't belong to them and they dont see what's wrong with it.\n\nHere's the worst thing. I asked about getting a key to the laundry. KL basically said no even though she is out a lot of the time or OL is napping. KL just doesnt reply to my messages anymore and it makes me feel like I can't trust KL. I couldn't even contact KL after something happened on the way home from work one time. And considering KL is the one of the people who I should be able to talk to cause I'm living there and far away from my family, it just makes me feel like I just can't talk to people as a lot of people I know here live a while away.\n\nI can't remember what broke everything completely the other day but I just knew I wanted to move. I've posted on pages asking if people know of a place and have actually found a place closer to work. I haven't told KL yet. And I'm actually sorting out moving in the next two weeks. \n\nThe problem is KL is either away somewhere or on the phone talking to someone and KL doesnt reply to my texts so that's pretty useless as well and I feel like this is something I need to tell KL in person. I plan on telling KL tomorrow after work but I feel bad about sorting out a place behind KL's back even though to KL there aren't any problems\n\nTL;DR. KL was great but now no communication, my stuff going missing even though I pay a lot for it, and no access to a necessity I need.\n\nSo AITA for wanting to move out?",

      "description": "We bought a new house earlier this year.  It was extremely dated (late 70's - 80's style) so I did a lot of work (by myself, for about two months) to update the house before we moved in.  My husband's friend made several comments about how he liked the decor better before I painted/remodelled.  After about 10-12 comments of that nature over the course of several weeks, I finally told him that he is quite welcome to decorate his own house in any manner he pleases and \"thank you for voicing your opinion!\"\n\nHe stopped making rude comments, but then he started nicking up the doorways with his bag each time he came over.\n\nI asked my husband to speak with him about it because I really don't know him - he is a recently made friend my husband.\n\nI thought it was resolved because he became \"overly\" nice for a week or two ... But it wasn't long before he started \"teaching\" me things about my job and eventually asked me for an introduction to a very busy colleague so he could make a complaint for the purpose of getting something from their company for free.  When I told him that I didn't have the information he wanted, he accused me of gatekeeping and bullying him.\n\nI asked my husband to ask his friend not to come over anymore.\nThe friend didn't even ask why.  He just said \"wow.\"\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nI'm a woman, if that wasn't obvious.",

      "description": "I work in IT in a squad of 7-8 people in a big company. Most of the people in our squad are employees at the place we work, but I and my colleague (from here on 'Colleague') are contractors from another company that specialises in the type of IT that Colleague and I do. I’m slightly senior to Colleague but have no authority over them. We’re the only two people in the squad in our field, but we used to have a manager part-time in the same field.\n\nColleague came onto our team to do work for a new project and apparently did very well, so when project phase 1 finished Colleague’s contract was extended for bits and pieces until phase 2 started up properly. Both companies were fine with this. Since Colleague didn’t have much work to do, they began to pick up a bit of work in the application I work in, but I didn't have much that I could hand over to them at the time. Late last year I noticed they were leaving a little bit earlier than they should, but I let it go because I knew they didn't have much work.\n\nA couple of months ago Colleague and I's manager left and I had to pick up a lot of *their* work, and we also got in more work that Colleague could pick up. Colleague doesn't like doing the sort of work we got, but it's definitely in our field and has to be done by one of the two of us. They’ll do it, slowly, if it’s assigned it to them in meetings and if I chase them up on it. But they’re lazy about it – they complain about the work, they won't follow up on anything by themselves, they’ll ask me about things I’ve explained several times before, and there’s always long gaps after they’ve done one bit of work before they ask if there's something else. Because I don’t manage Colleague and getting them to pick up work is a pain in the ass, I just do a lot of it myself. I do get recognition for having picked up the work I have, if that’s relevant - it's not like Colleague is stealing my credit. But I have a really high workload for my position and I’m pretty tired of it.\n\nOver the last couple of months Colleague’s hours have also gotten worse. We have to bill 40 hours a week, but they usually come in around 8.30 and leave around 4 and take an hour for lunch. They also spend a lot of time on their phone and going to visit work friends, which is kind of a no-no for us as contractors. Nobody seems to have noticed the hours because the other people in our team either get in after Colleague or leave before them. I’ve never confronted Colleague about their hours, but I mention quite often to them and to our squad that they need more work.\n\nLately I’ve been considering complaining to our manager at my company about Colleague's hours. We don't live in a country with at-will employment so Colleague wouldn’t be fired on the spot, but we do swipe in and out to get into work, so they’d be caught if my company looked into it. I imagine they’d get into fairly serious trouble, and would either be replaced in my squad or have to pull their socks up. WIBTA for this?",

      "description": " So, here we go. My fiance and I have had a shared duplex apartment for 3 years.  We live off an end street in a very quiet rural area. The biggest disruption is when a nearby field is used for a tri-city fair once a year, it is that kind of small town.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n My fiance thinks our place is haunted. I do not believe in ghosts.   Over the years she has tried to bring me \"proof\"  such as a the TV randomly turning on (pretty sure its either an Alexa issue or a Chromecast issue) or coming home to randomly opened cabinets  (Are we 100% sure we didn't just forget to close them? Also, we own a cat, which is basically a furry ghost.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, last night she woke me up around 3 AM to tell me she saw our daughter come out of her room, and hide under our bed. This wouldn't be unusual, she is 2 years old and thinks hiding is the best thing in the world.  I get up, check under the bed. No kid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA brief hunt leads me to the child's bedroom, where she is sounds asleep. I chuckle, and tell my fiance she must of dreamed it. She insisted she saw a little girl walk up to the bed, and hide under it.  I assume she just has \"sleep brain\", as I do, and ignore this. I sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning, she starts in on me for \"making her feel crazy\".  She asks why I can't admit ghosts are real when she has shown me all this \"proof.\"  I tell I don't believe in ghosts, just like I don't believe in leprechauns or Big Foot. It is fine if SHE thinks they are real, but I don't, and we should agree to disagree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"WHAT ABOUT THE PROOF?\" She yells.  I tell her that I think everything can be explained scientifically,  and she most likely dreamed the \"ghost\" last night. I tell her that if she presents me a peer-reviewed study in a reputable scientific journal, then I am open to reconsidering me views.  She accuses me of \"Gaslighting\" her and says I am an asshole for trusting scientists and facts over her feelings. I got pissed, told her I didn't want to hear another word, and went to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?",

We all came to agreement that everyone wanted out of the lease “at all costs”. \n\nLuckily, I have a family member that is a lawyer and specializes in property and tenant disputes law. I told my roommates I could contact him and he would help us free of cost. They all agreed this was a great option. \n\nAfter contacting my family member, he sent a letter to our landlord. Basically it gave them the legally required time to fix the problem or else our lease would be cancelled after a month from when they received the letter. It also said that it would be best for both parties if they just flat out let us out of the lease. \n\nAfter this was explained to me, I went straight to my roommates. My GF and I showed them the letter and asked for their approval. Which they quickly gave us. I told them explicitly there is a chance the lease could end sooner, so look for a place no later than the end of the month. After that my family member sent off the letter. \n\nA few weeks after this we receive notice the landlord is letting us out of the lease. We need to provide them with the date we will all vacate the apartment. As soon as we heard this we texted our roommates informing them of the situation. My GF and I had found an apartment for the end of the month, as I had informed the others to do as well. We told them we would be moving out at the end of the month and we asked them when  they would like to vacate and end the lease. One roommate then told us it sounded like we had already made a plan and were leaving them “high and dry no matter what”. We then informed her the lease would not end when we left, but instead when they found a new place. In the past we have even offered for them to stay with us at our new place until they can relocate. \nWe also told her we would still help clean our part and assist them in moving as much as possible even if we leave first. \n\nShe is currently being distant and somewhat cold to us. We do not want to leave her high and dry in the slightest, but she believes we are. AITA?\n\ntl;dr GF and I gave roommates notice of lease cancellation and told them when to expect to leave. They gave their approval. Lease cancellation comes along weeks later and they say we left them high and dry. \n\n\n",

      "description": "I (18M) asked my father if I could take my vyvanse late (5pm) today to finish some schoolwork I have to do. He asked me if I was planning to go out, which I didn't, so he agreed to letting me take it on basis of finishing my schoolwork.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't plan on going out because a friend of mine was supposed to come over tonight. He knew this from days ago, and let me take the medication even after I clarified the intention of me staying in was because my friend planned on coming over. As soon as I go back to my room my friend texts me saying there is a possibility of having to cancel our plans. I figured I didn't want to stay home all night idly (because the work I have to finish can be done relatively quickly if I apply myself to it, which I plan to do). I went back to his room and asked if I could end up going out IF my friend did not come over. I barely managed to finish the sentence before he began hollering at me about being ridiculous for not keeping an agreement for more than 10 minutes. I asked him, extremely calmly, to not yell at me for asking for this on basis that I had agreed to not go out because I expected my plans to go through, however felt it'd be fair to establish a backup plan given the uncertainty. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was annoyed by his reaction because of the excessive yelling because my family is currently undergoing a therapy process which mainly revolves around being kinder to each other (my family's extremely dysfunctional/aggressive, especially when disagreeing with each other, and everybody basically reached their limits, so we collectively decided to seek out professional help) and that went completely out the window without much build-up or an extensive argument (as is common). I understand that he is in the right to be annoyed over me suddenly contradicting the terms I had agreed to in order to take the medication. I also understand that given my history of drug use (which he was fine with) and currently undergoing treatment for Bipolar Disorder II he is right to be concerned about me taking amphetamine-based medicine and going out, therefore implying taking other substances such as alcohol, which he is not opposed to but prohibited me from engaging in recreational drug use (admittedly I never was the most obedient teenager, so it's sensible for him to be suspicious).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I truly had no intention of drinking, smoking or taking anything because I did drink some beers yesterday and am feeling quite exhausted, but simply wanted to meet up with my friends and meet new people tonight, but that's not something he'd believe in. I just think it was a bit unreasonable for him to get furious and attacking my integrity/reliability over me asking if he'd allow my plans to go out change given original circumstances for agreeing to his terms changed. If this was a matter of more serious commitment, I'd understand him. He still argues that he's allowed to be this angry. I really don't know if I was wrong to just ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Asked dad to take meds to work. He said only if I wouldn't go out. Agreed because I had confirmed plans for a friend to visit me. Friend said plans MAY fail. Asked dad if I could go out should they failed. He got extremely angry, yelled and attacked my integrity. Family currently taking therapy to work on treating each other without so much aggression, which he maintains to not have breached any promises to adhere to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This happened a while ago, but there's still tension, I've lost some friends, and I'm wondering if I was the asshole in the situation. \n\nTwo summers ago, I dated a guy named Owen. We lasted a month before he decided I wasn't right for him, and it was difficult since I had to see him everyday in class (it's a small professional program). Around this time, I started to become friends with Beth who later showed interest in him. They matched on Tinder and while I was still trying to get over Owen, I was very happy for Beth and gave her encouragement. I never told her about the fact that Owen and I went out, since I didn't want to deter her. One night at a party, Owen told Beth that we had gone out, and she wasn't very happy that I never told her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually we had a talk, and I told her what had happened between us and why it didn't work out. Beth messaged me saying she wanted to give it a go with Owen, and I was absolutely okay with, even saying that I probably wasn't right for him, and she'd be a better match. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe end of the summer term rolls around and Beth gets dumped for the same reasons as me--Owen can't commit. At an event, Beth's friend asks me what's going on, because Beth told her that I was \"crazy\". Beth later apologized for that comment, and only thought I was crazy because things between the two were going so well. It was only when she mentioned commitment that he dumped her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFall (new term) comes around and Owen's friends tell me he's got a FWB who he met on Tinder. Beth doesn't know this, and is still interested in Owen as evidenced by their text messages and his coming over to hers to \"talk.\" Beth is uncomfortable with me trying to rekindle our friendship, cancelling plans we made and barely talking to me. Part of me wants to tell her so she can get over him, but part of me thinks this is Owen's life and not my business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months later (Beth and Owen are not together), Beth finds out about his FWB, is super upset, and through a friend, knows that I knew about it all along. I told Owen that Beth has found out, and he regrets not telling her earlier.  Needless to say, Beth does not like me, and neither do some of her friends. Reddit, give me your honest opinion, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Didn't tell my new friend Beth I dated a guy she was interested in, she finds out, tells her friend I'm crazy but gets dumped in the same way. He later gets a FWB who I knew about but Beth didn't. She was still into him, and was devastated when she found out. ",

      "description": "Backstory\n\nMe: a 17 y/o theatre nerd posting about this on mobile, sorry if the formatting gets weird\n\nPossible Asshole (PA): girl in the grade above me, also a theatre nerd. She has been getting on my nerves recently by exaggerating events that we both were present at to make herself seem cooler or whatever. She also has been doing this thing where if we work on something together and it gets messed up, then she’ll say “oh I knew that would happen”. Then why didn’t you say anything!! It just is really insincere. \n\nYesterday we were both at a build for the show, working really hard to construct the set. I had woken up with a swollen throat and a throbbing headache. Not feeling amazing to say the least. In my rush to get to the build, I had only grabbed a poptart and some water; meaning by the time we broke for lunch, I was FIENDING for some real food. PA and I are friends, so I asked her what she was doing for lunch. \n\nMe: I have a gift card to Panera and could really use some real food. \n\nPA: I was craving Panera too! I’ll drive there\n\nMe: Perfect! Would you pick me up our usual?\n\nAt this point it is important to note two things. 1) she is also 17, and in my state a 17 y/o is not legally allowed to drive more than other 1 person. Plenty of people break this law but I got into a car crash a few months ago and have been trying to play it safe. 2) when I say “our usual” I mean that she has both picked up panera for me before AND we get the same thing as each other. It wasn’t like she had to remember anything different. \n\nI handed her my gift card which had $25  on it and told her she could use some of it but I’d prefer to have some money on it for next time since our order costs about $10 each. She agreed, and then gathered the group of people that were going with her (4 other people). \n\nIt’s about 20 minutes into our hour long break and I’m feeling okay. I continued doing work (cleaning up from the pre lunch activities) while I waited for her to come back. As I’m sweeping up I get a call from her\n\nPA: Heyyyyyy\n\nMe: What’s up?\n\nHer: So everyone in the car voted and we’e going to Wendy’s. \n\nMe: Really? But I gave you my gift card! \n\nHer: Sorry, everyone voted and I believe in democracy. Do you want anything from Wendy’s? \n\nMe: No, I’m lactose intolerant and don’t have cash. Plus I wanted real food. \n\nPA: Sorry. Sure you don’t want anything? Bye then*hangs up*\n\nHere’s where I start getting frustrated, because Wendy’s is 10 minutes away without traffic and panera is 5 minutes away with traffic. Plus there’s a Burger King in the same lot as Panera so they could have gotten pretty much the same thing there. I ask my sister to go out to get it since she has a longer lunch break and panera is 15 minutes walking distance so I wouldn’t have made it back in time. \n\nPA returns with 20 minutes to eat and while I sit moping, waiting for my sister. One of the girls who went with PA overheard me in a hangry rant to someone else there and informed me that PA was the one to bring up Wendy’s and everyone was pretty indifferent to it. This particular passenger quietly preferred Burger King because she wanted to get back quicker, but a ride’s a ride. \n\nI wander over to where PA’s group is to get my gift card back and to understand why she did me dirty. This group is basically her cult followers as they are two years younger and can’t drive so they look up to her like a god. They repeat the line of “democracy man” back to me, but PA is not here to defend herself. \n\nIn fact I didn’t see her at all after lunch. Apparently she left without talking to me or giving me my gift card back. By the time my sister returned with my lunch, the break was well over. \n\nI have little faith that I’ll ever see that gift card again because I lent her two books for a research project and she gave them back to me 2 years later after vigorous prompting from me for about 1 and a half years. \n\nAm I the Asshole here? Am I justified in thinking she should give me my gift card and a sincere apology? How should I approach the conversation of giving my gift card back in the first place?",

      "description": "TLDR: Teacher gave more opportunity to another student and I want to tell her how she doesnt practice what she teaches and that she favors her favorite students which is wrong.\n\nI am currently in high school and today I had philosophy class. I know this will sound like a very small thing but whatever. We started listening to a lecture video in class, we were supposed to take notes. We weren't able to finish the video so we were assigned to finish the lecture in our house (7 minutes left of lecture). Two days later (today), we had to turn in our notes. As the teacher asked for our assignment, she said that if we failed to include something from the last 7 minutes of the lecture she would assume we didn't do our homework, so she would deduct 3 points (out of 10) from our assignment grade. Upon hearing this, one of the girls (who had already turned in her work), who is almost definitely the teacher's favorite student, asks if she can check \"something\" in her notes. The teacher already had our papers with her and she gave back the girl's paper to her. She seemed somewhat reluctant as if she knew she was doing wrong yet she still did it. She obviously (I assume its obvious) knew the girl would fix her paper so she would not be deducted 3 points. She was the only person that did it. She then returns her paper. The teacher then repeats that she will deduct 3 points if we fail to mention a topic from the 7 minutes of the lecture. I ask her, for my own amusement, if we can fix our notes just like the girl did, and she said no. I must note that I never referenced the girl, I asked as if the girl had never done that. I really feel im on the right side because she teaches us so many things about philosophy that she never fucking practices. For example, she always tells us her opinion that equality of opportunity is good, yet she clearly favors her favorite student. I want to mention this to her in our next class (after class, not during, just me and her) and I would like to tell her this not to deduct 3 points from the girl, but rather because I find it very unfair that she acts like that, and also the fact that she doesn't practice what she teacher. So I am sort of conflicted right now and I know this is something very small but I cant seem to stop thinking that I should act on what I believe is morally right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I created an account just for this, I hope I don't mess anything up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, some background information. This school year I met this group of 4 people during my first-period class. Besides me, there is only one other girl. I'm a pretty shy person, so this was a big deal to me (even though we have only known each other for about a week).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to around mid-fall and the guy in question asks me out. I reject him (obviously), because I have not known him for very long and I only think of him as a friend. My other friends are like, \"dude wtf. You guys would make such a cute couple.\" I tell them the reason above, and I just assumed we would move on. The guy (let's call him \"G\") won't even speak to me or look me in the eye. It's weird at first, but I get used to it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow it's the present time. G has asked me out again (even though after the first rejection he has not even spoken to me face to face), being egged on by the other boys in the group. Although this time, he asks me out in our Snapchat group chat. With all the other members in the chat. I privately text him my rejection. After that, I kinda logged off Snapchat and went to do my own thing. The only other girl in the group texts me and tells me everyone in our group knows I rejected G and that he feels heartbroken. No surprise there, they were bound to find out. Then she texts me that G is considering leaving our group because of it. I respond: \"I just don't like him that way and that's G's problem if he doesn't understand.\" She responds \"I understand, but you don't have to act like an asshole about it.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA in this situation? Should I have been nicer about it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBtw, 2 of the 4 members are still mad at me. The girl is over it and did say that I can make my own choices on who to date. ",

      "description": "This story starts a few months ago. Basically a good friend of mine was going down to Parris Island, South Carolina for Marine Corps boot camp. I was talking to a mutual friend who said she was going down in 3 months for the graduation. I have wanted to be a Marine since I was 6, and was very close to joining before I was medically disqualified. So, she knew how much I loved the Marine Corps and invited me to come along. A few days ago, she told me that they probably aren't going anymore because her mother is in the hospital and her car wouldn't fit everyone. So basically, she made it sound like the trip was off. She was apologizing, saying how she knew it meant a lot to me, but she just didn't feel right leaving her mom right now. I was more than understanding, was telling her she didn't need to apologize, just making sure she knew it wasn't her fault. When I was getting out of class today, I checked snapchat and on her story, she was in the car with the rest of the people who were going and was saying \"Roadtrip crew!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been friends with the person graduating from bootcamp since 1st grade, while the others have only known her for about 3/4 years. I'm really considering just cutting those who went out of my life because not just did they lie about something they knew meant the world to me, they don't consider me important enough to bring with them. Am I an asshole for not wanting to have anything to do with them anymore? ",

I’m next in line and as a lady is walking away from a register I start to walk towards it and a lady, her husband, and her service dog dart past me and get to the register first. I say “excuse me I was next in line” to which the lady responds “oh I have a service dog so I’m allowed to go first” then she turned around and started scanning her items. I said “just because you have a service dog doesn’t mean you’re more privileged to scan your items first”. If she was getting medicine, or some type of emergency needs I would have completely understood and let them go first. But they weren’t. They were buying groceries. Then she said “oh, what are you going to do? Tell on me?” I said yes and luckily a manager was about 50 ft away. I called her over and told her what happened. The manager asked her if she did that and all the lady said was “I have a service dog!! I can’t believe you tattled on  me!” The manager politely asked her to never do that again, she would remember her and the service dog and next time would ask them to leave. \n\nSo I stood there and then the self check right next to hers became available. So I went next to her and she made another comment about how I’m immature and have no sympathy for people. I just smiled and didn’t say a word. Also, let me mention that her husband never said a single word then entire time and had the dog’s leash under his shoe instead of holding it! I truly believed these people take advantage of having a service dog, treat the dog like shit, and use it for sympathy and to get what they want. I also took a picture of him standing on the dogs leash, just to be petty. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "A little background, I'm in college full time for an engineering degree. Not a super difficult workload (yet), but enough that most of my time is dedicated to studying. I keep a close eye on my graduation requirements and do my best to stay ahead of the 8-ball as far as credits and required courses. I have only a couple critical classes I need to take to graduate, and I'm really buckling down to make it a quick and successful final year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat all said, this summer my parents have a family reunion of sorts. Mostly just my parents and all of our siblings/step siblings (all of whom are grown adults). They have been planning this small family vacation for a couple of months now and asked early on for us to ask off of work, school, etc for about two weeks. This was basically no problem for me from a work perspective, as a work at a job that allows me a lax schedule so as to spend a lot of my time on school. HOWEVER, the school I attend has only one professor for one of my final classes, an advanced calculus class. Not only this, but he also teaches several other lower level maths, meaning his scheduling and seating for the advanced calc class is limited. (Offered 1 time during summer during the entire academic year). The class is 3 days a week for an hour and a half a piece. (You can probably see where this is going, but I'll continue regardless.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy options to take this class are as follows: 1) Take the class this summer at the school I attend currently. This will keep me on time to graduate and cost me nothing extra as financial aid will cover the cost. 2) Wait and take the class next semester as a transient student at another school an hour away at out of state tuition costs out of my own pocket. Financially, this will ruin me but I will only be behind a semester 3) Forego the class for a year and take it next summer, essentially putting my academics on hold for a year. I would really rather not do this, but with family matters it gets touchy, obviously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I am heavily leaning towards option 1, as the other options would cost me time or money that I would prefer not to spend. However, I'm sure my parents would be disappointed I wouldn't be able to attend the get-together and might not be pleased at my decision. I'm at a loss for what I should do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr Would I be an asshole for ditching a family vacation to take an important required class for my degree?",

      "description": "So this month I was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which I had booked and seats selected for. I specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat — just the aisle and window. \n\nWell, a very obese man boards and I can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. I assume maybe he bought two hence why he’s even attempting to hoard. I’m mentally crossing my fingers he’s not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. \n\nI get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. Well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. After a minute, I decided to be upfront and tell him:\n\n“Sir, I’m sorry but this situation is not working for me, you’re taking up quite a bit of my seat”. \n\nHe wasn’t rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there’s not nothing he can do — although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. It just wasn’t enough, though. He still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. I’m talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. \n\nI end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. She instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. She goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren’t any open seats on this flight, so there wasn’t a way to move people so he could have two. This causes a very awkward silence. \n\nThe guy seemed embarrassed and didn’t want to get up. He mentioned how he can’t wait for a later flight. I felt bad for him but I was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight — the comfort I paid for. The flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he’ll need to book another flight. The guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here’s where I made my offer. \n\nI told the guy, “Look, I’ll put up with this if you give me $150 — that’s half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances. \n\nHe instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. He even told me he appreciated it. \n\nWell the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn’t volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. I just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. \n\nFrom my perspective, I gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and I was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person’s body pressed against you involuntarily). A win-win. He wasn’t angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately. \n\nAfter the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but I ignored them. This leads me to beg the question, AITA? ",

      "description": "I'll try to give you guys some info about how the relationship was, just in case you need it.\n\nSo, my ex and I separated a long time ago, and it was a short relationship. Long story, but to sum it up, we were arguing a lot more than usual, so I decided that I couldn't take it anymore and I separated. \n\nAfter that, he even sent me some audios talking about how I was the cause that the relationship ended. He realized he acted wrong and asked for apologies, and I forgave him, although I found the audios to be unnecessarily harsh (some of the audios were, like, 10 minutes long, just to talk about how I screwed things up, and all the other audios were like that)\n\nWe still talk sometimes, we're in the same school after all, but it's obviously not as constant as before.\n\nNow, to the main issue.\n\nHe bought me the stuffed animal (it's one of those beanie boos, you know?) while we were still dating. I'm not that keen on stuffed animals, so I even asked at the time if he would find it bad if I let my dog play with it (because she loved the thing!), and at the time he said that yeah, he would find it bad, so I respected that and just let the stuffed animal in my bedroom. It's still there to this day.\n\nThere are times when it falls, and my dog grabs it, and she's just so enthusiastic about it! She loves the thing, and if it was up to me she could totally have it, but I'm afraid that giving it to her would be a dick move, like as if I was despising the present.\n\nIt's mine now, so I could do whatever I wanted with it, especially now that we're no longer together. But do you guys think it's disrespectful? Things may have gone south for us, but I don't want to act like as if I don't care about the presents. I mean, they symbolized love after all, or something close to it. \n\n I know it's a silly question, but it was my first relationship, I really am clueless over this matter haha, so if you guys could help me with that, I would really appreciate it ^^",

      "description": "Hello, all. I've been wanting to get this out of my chest for a while now and I found this sub in which I think this belongs to. Also, sorry for the broken English. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, three years ago I started experiencing small but noticeable twinges on my male parts, mostly the nuts. I simply decided to ignore them given that my sexual life at that time was really active (Married, sex only with wife) and my drinking habits were also heavy, so I thought that the reason for the twinges were either an infection or something that I decided to threat on my own taking some pills I found on my medication drawer.\n\nTime passed by and 3yrs fwd (Today's day) pain began to grow to other parts: vas deferens, prostate, itchy rectum, night sweats, pains in the lower parts of my vertebrae and other symptoms. The worst of it all is that it's been a month now that I've been ejaculating blood, like, blood, you know? No white just red drops. I think it's called \"hematospermia\". SO I decided visit doctor.  \nWent to visit an Urologist and told him about what was happening and since when it was happening. Needless to say, he was shocked for how long I've been delaying this and told me that all of that might only mean prostate cancer, that I needed to get a diagnosis and discard whatever is happening. That it may not be that late and we might get this thing cured IF cancer is what is affecting me, otherwise I'll just need to take some pills and go through some recovery and whatnot.  I know this is not the way in which you usually approach your patients, but well, such is Mexico. \n\nI was in shock, like, I relentlessly convinced myself that all of my pain and suffering was due to an infection or my bad habits and the realization and the probability of me having cancer depressed me and put me on a really strange situation with me and with mostly everyone around me.   \n\n\nSo, I went to the clinic and asked about the price for such diagnosis and testing and everything and was surprised by the amount of money needed in order to get this thing discarded. Like, what if I don't have (cancer) and it is just a bad infection? I don't want to pay for them to tell me that I just need to take medicine and will be OK, nor I want to spend money on the baddest news of all my life.   \n\n\nInstead of spending money on such thing, I decided to visit Japan :) . A place that I've always wanted to go and have the time of my life. Spend all the money that I've been saving on the trip and have a blast, meet Japanese girls, get drunk on a Karaoke, eat Ramen on the street, take some pictures of a Sakura tree, sleep in a capsule, meet Japanese girls x2, visit Aokigahara (it has a really spiritual meaning for me) and probably stay there for as much as I can. Mexico has this really great relationship with Japan and I've been reading that I might even get a job there.   \n\n\nMy family knows about all of this since yesterday and they were not really happy about my decision, they called me \"Selfish MF\" but I don't care. If I do have cancer I rather visit the place of my dreams and then I'm willing to accept whatever life have for me, if I don't, well, at least I got my pp sucked by an actual wifu. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - There is a big chance I get diagnosed with cancer and instead of following my doctor's suggestions and have it discarded and treated, I decided spend the money visiting Japan.

This go round, we have been together for 1.25 years.\n\nLast night we were spending time together for new year's eve. Everything was going well until I hit an insecure spot and asked him if he loves me.\n\nHe starts with \"of course i love you, i always have and always will, but...\" and starts talking about logistics of our relationship and how we can set up a living space in another part of the house and basically he wastrying to discuss moving in with me so we could spend time together and still allow for us to pursue our respective arts (he is a musican, i do visual art) because he is not going to go through another year without releasing new tracks.\n\nHe ended up saying something along the lines of \"but I know thats just not gonna happen with you\" and I said 'well then why do this then?'\n\nSome more i love you's were exchanged and  we went inside to get ready for bed, but he was still talking about how stressful it was for him to come over because he cant work on music or anything so i said \"okay, i can call you an uber if you want\"\n\nHe got so upset saying he felt like i was kicking him out he went outside and called his family to pick him up from my place. I immediately start asking him not to leave like this - i was just offering etc etc. \n\nI repeatedly asked him to call them back and cancel the ride, but he basically said he was tired of feeling  like I could just kick him out at any second and to stop talking to him.\n\nI called him a million times after he left, and tried to tell him over and over again that i wasnt intending to offend him, i was suggesting the thing that i thought might make him happy and obviously i do not WANT him to leave - but he kept hanging up on me and basically told me to never call his phone again because he is tired of my shit.\n\nThis morning, when i woke up, i saw he is still listed as in a relationship with me on fb, and has not changed his profile picture from the picture of us, but he has not replied to any of my messages or called or texted... so i am fairly uncertain as to what is going on.\n\nTL;DR - bf hasn't released a new track in over a year, and attributes it to spending too much time with me so i offered to uber him home and he was so upset by me offering to uber him home that he left and told me to not talk to him again (but i dont think he broke up with me)\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "Ok, so for a little bit of context, I started writing a series of DC fanfiction stories on Flickr last year. They proved popular enough, and I managed to get quite a few more people on board writing these stories set in our own universe. That's where I first met this friend of mine- He had been a fan of my stuff and, I was apparently an inspiration to him. I wrote stories about the character Killer Moth, and he wrote a spin off about his son, a character I had created just for the series. \nFor a time, things were great; his writing was darn good, and with a few others on board, we formed a Discord group to communicate, for crossovers and the like. Now, this person had reservations- he didn't want me to think he was stealing this character from me. I reassured him this *wasn't* the case- I had actually killed this character off before he resurrected him, and he seemed satisfied. \nThen, I put forth my next idea, to clear up some continuity issues in this universe- a storyline loosely based on the comic \"Flashpoint\" (in case you couldn't tell already, I'm a bit of a geek), and for this particular story, I would be taking the reigns back for this character. My friend seemed ecstatic about this, again, he felt he'd stolen the character from me. Feeling he deserved that much, I brought him on to collaborate with me on this storyline. Unfortunately, those doubts of his resurfaced, despite my best efforts to console him, and he stepped back into a consulting role. When I pitched my ideas later, they were received... poorly. He acted anti-social, and voiced his disapproval. I asked him what he would have rather done,  I reminded him that my heart wasn't fully in it, after all, it had began purely as an attempt to  fix continuity, but this time I was labelled condescending. I argued back that he was a nightmare to work with, because he wasn't be constructive in the least, and for a couple of weeks we didn't speak, save for my attempts to bring him back to the chat. There was a point where he even seemed happier, relaxed to not be on there. But I still felt regret. Nevertheless, I continued to post my issues. A few days ago, he resurfaced on the main chat, as though nothing had happened, but still he wouldn't comment on Flickr. Despite everything, I still wanted his feedback, so I asked him. He was hesitant arguing I wouldn't want to hear it, again and again, though I tried reassuring him that any feedback is good feedback, he relented. He said he was disappointed, and, that I was right when I had said I couldn't write that particular character. \nThat's when I made a dumb choice. I told him yeah, it's certainly hard to work with this character, considering he was just an OC I created, no traits of his own, and that he only bloomed through his writing. He misconstrued this, or maybe I worded it poorly, but he took it as an insult to his contributions to the universe, as though he had added nothing of value. Concluding that returning to the group was a mistake, he \"officially\" left (before that point he'd simply not replied, but still read things), lastly telling all the other members that his door was still open. \nI'm worried that I am indeed an arse for escalating the situation. If I had maybe let enough alone, it'd have been fine, but I feel my constant reassurances were off putting, and while I meant well, I was actually just being vain, for demanding feedback from him. I just feel bad because whereas just a year ago I was his inspiration, but now he resents me. ",

      "description": "I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 6 months now, and we have been having problems for the last month or so. \n\nWe are both in our early 30’s and I have known her for a few years. We dated once in our mid 20’s and broke up with no contact in between. \n\nI missed her about a year ago and reached out. We started talking, meet up a few times and decided to try again. Which seemed great for awhile until we both got busy with work and life, as I started a new job. \n\nWe got into a huge blowup over commitment issues and how our relationship seemed to be falling apart. \n\nI then accused her of only sleeping with me again so soon because she wanted to get pregnant to tie me to her. \n\nShe informed me that she is not and has never been or wanted to be pregnant. \n\nMy problem with that is she slept with me again so soon after a year break. Was during our first official date, but we had seen each other several times before then. I tried to make a move while semi drunk before this, but that didn’t lead to anything. \n\nHas anyone accused a non pregnant girl of trying to trap them? And I don’t mean sabotaging the condoms because she never touched them. \n\nOr Am I The Asshole? ",

This project was fitting together and myself, MB and NG were getting along.\n\nDay Two, in the morning I had woken up with a sore throat, dry cough and general aches throughout my body, my flat mates were experiencing similar symptoms and so we had decided to quarantine and stay in the flat. I had notified my group via Facebook messenger and NG was understanding, MB complained saying I was dead weight. After explaining my situation I offered to work from home (this was a design class and so I had all the software available on my laptop). MB refused, saying something like \"It wouldn't be the same\" If I were to work on it from home.\n\nDay Three, Still sick, MB messages me asking if I'm going to be arriving to today's meeting. I had slept most of Day Two and so I hadn't seen this message yet. I said I would try to get out of bed but couldn't, I called the doctor and booked an appointment, nothing open until the next day. \n\nDay Four, MB has blocked me on Facebook and disbanded the chat group, at this point it's just me talking to NG, I ask if I can contribute at all and he declines, telling me I shouldn't participate.\nI go to the doctors office, get a note and get my drugs.\n\nDay Five, I feel amazing, the drugs worked and so I go to class, it's presentation day and so our groups are presenting their projects, Myself, MB and NG are called forward, MB tries to get a word in but the lecturer didn't care and shut her down, told us we had 5 minutes to sell our product, MB and NG had speech cards handy, I had my notes from day 1. we sold the product to the point we got an average mark.\n\nI got my credits, had it placed in my portfolio and got an award for achieving a certain grade on all my projects. I explained my situation to my tutor and he told me I still did my part but I feel guilty that I was mooching off of the group,\n\nNG and myself still keep contact and I even got him a job designing websites for a firm, MB still has me blocked and according to my other friends I get bought up as a mooch every once and a while when she has a few too many drinks... So AITA?",

      "description": "This happened about yesterday-ish and she told me she lost all respect for me afterwards but I wanted to know if I was wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was in my French class sitting by myself at a table as my teacher is handing out worksheets. When she gives me one I get to work immediately and finish it by myself and just chill out. I had my headphones in as I was working because that's how I work best, so I didn't know that she was just giving out all of the answers on a powerpoint behind me. And I figured \"well shit I might as well check if my answers were correct\". I go over to my friend and held up his paper and check to see if all of my stuff matched up. And I was pretty much all correct, I just made a few adjustments here and there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe teacher asks what am I doing standing up and I apologize and say I was just verifying that my information was correct. She then makes a remark saying, \"Oh were you really checking or COPYING the whole thing?\" I was a little taken aback because I literally was up for like 8-10 seconds in front of the class so everyone could see exactly what I was doing. I held up my paper and said, \"Well the whole thing is complete as you see here, I was just checking since I did it on my own\". And she said, \"I know it's done but HOW did it get done is the question.\" And I start to get irritated and I tell her that she literally looked at me while I was standing up and saw everything I was doing. And she was saying, \"well I don't know , would you like me to give you a 0 then?\" One of my classmates spoke up and said, \"A zero for notes?\" because in reality it wasn't even a serious assignment, it was basically notes as we had to just fill in some blanks. And she further reprimanded me saying I was being disrespectful by talking back to her and I began to say \"No I was just correcting--\" and she immdiately cut me off and just reached for my paper to give it a bad grade I assume.\n\nWas AITA for speaking up?

      "description": "Hi guys, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm currently struggling with my thoughts lately. I've found this sub so I figured Id just make an account and ask more then just close family/friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLittle backstory: I'm 25 now  \nGrew up pretty rough, parents rarely home due to work, trying to pay the house they wanted to secure, so my sister and I grew up nicely. Got bullied most years, no one helped, had to learn to do everything by myself. Mom got health issues due to working in a factory and needed support by us kids early on. Were a pretty big family so a lot of illness, struggles, deaths etc. experienced early on. That was from 8 to 18 years  \n\n\nI ALWAYS take care of anyone in the family, or my girlfriends family. I do it because it feels right to me and no one else could. I help everyone financially and with my car or even small stuff... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nB2T:\n\nTwo years ago my mom got a surgery to get her gallblader removed. Surgery went weirdly wrong and they had to cut her stomach open two times, due to leakage of the acid thingy from the gallblader. Shes been feeling shit ever since and I had to take care of her in the ICU and at home. \n\n  \nLast year I went into therapy due to being heavily depressed for the last 4 or 5 years, not feeling emotions and shutting everyone out, having suicidal thoughts and even attempts. Talked to my about it but past the first sentence she started instantly crying and I went to a therapist to not be a burden to her. I got better so thats a plus.\n\nI do everything for my family, especially my mom. Id die for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo weeks ago she went under surgery again because the doctors found out she had been living with half her liver dead inside her body, and that might be because of the leakage two years ago. High possibility that that is the reason why shes feeling pain etc. the whole time. Surgery went really well, she got home just after 6 days because shes recovered so fast. I visited her daily, sometimes twice a day. Now shes home, doing okay, still in recovery but shes been really weird ever since. I still try to support them as best as i can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut heres my struggle: (still living with my parents btw.)\n\nWe grew up with a dog, and I really love animals n stuff, my girlfriend didnt want me to have a dog but after we spoke for months, she agreed because she understands how important that is for me, and how the dog would make me happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents do love dogs, but whenever I bring the idea they get angry af, telling me off, telling me Im a shitty son if I think about stuff like that, because my mom is not healthy and she cant take care of a dog. Im allowed to bring my dog to work and its even requested by my boss, because its a really dog friendly company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey know I want a dog, they show me puppys they find on the internet but whenever I bring it up I get shit on. Trying to talk to my mom ends with her starting to cry, asking me why Im doing this to her and telling me to stop pushing her. I already told them I couldve went and get the dog if I want to, but I dont because im trying to be a good son and want everyone to agree. The dog would do my mom good to. She always talks about how our old dog would never leave her side when she was feeling bad etc etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI even have a straight up list on how to keep the dog as far away from mama as possible, to not be a burden to her... Im ready!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I really dont know if Im just a bit too focused on getting what I want or if my feeling that my family doesnt even think about all the stress and chaos the last years put on me too - not just my mom. My older sister is also shitting on me, but shes not even living with us anymore...  \n\n\nAITA for wanting something that makes me happy? Or AITA for still pushing for a doggo?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, sorry for the long post and mistakes! Please be honest, I can take it! :-)",

      "description": "I been talking with a girl for a few months now that is near perfect in everyway. Things progressed very quickly. At the beginning, I didn't realize the role religion (Christianity) played in her life ... until a friend of hers told her that she needed to stop seeing me in a week. This was early on in the relationship, but she chose not to, and it didn't get brought up until again until very recently. I have never really been to church, but I'm somewhat familiar with the Bible and Christianity in general. While I believe some of it, I'm indifferent to other aspects and I know my mind can't be changed. I have also always respected her decision regarding her beliefs ... until recently when she told me she could never love me as much as God or Jesus. That I could never be the most important person in her life. In my heart, I know I can't be with someone that I love if they can't love me back the same way. It makes me feel terrible because I understand where she's coming from very slightly, but I can't get over this one belief ... it makes me feel worthless. When I told her I couldn't be with someone that loved God or Jesus more than someone in front of them, everything pretty much ended. Her therapist told her I was being manipulative, as did her non religious mom. She thinks I'm saying that I'm more important than God. Or that I'm trying to say, at the very least, that I'm equal to him. This is not what I'm trying to do at all. The last night we talked, she mentioned how much she sacrificed for me. How she lost friends and opportunities within the church. I had no idea I had caused any of this, nor did I mean to. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for reaching out to my friend when I was suicidal?",
      "description": "Throw-away account\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome backstory (sorry if it’s long). I’m male, in my early 20’s, and my friend is female, and one year younger than me. We’ve been friends for seven years, having originally met online. I was home-schooled from middle school onwards, so I never had any friends outside the people I knew online. For this, I’ll call her Rose. Me and Rose have essentially been best friends the entire time we’ve known each other. In the very early stages of our friendship, we had a semi-pseudo “romantic” relationship in which we called each other boy-friend/girl-friend, but it was as real as an online “relationship” between two young teenagers could be. Anyways, that part of the relationship ended after about six months into our friendship. Half misunderstanding, half me being dumb. Whatever the case, it reverted to “just friends” which I was fine with.   \n\n\nWe continue to stay really close friends. We have our up’s and down’s, times where we don’t talk as much, but we always pretty much stayed friends. Rose helped me through a really bad toxic relationship I had with someone else, who sort of led me on for five years, but that’s another story entirely. Point of the matter is we’re super close, and she’s the only person I honestly feel comfortable telling anything to.   \n\n\nNow, I’ve also suffered from MDD (major depressive disorder) for a long time. I tried to take meds, talk with a professional, and all that stuff but it was not really effective for me. I’ve always just defaulted to dealing with it until it boils over, having a melt-down, and then cooling down until it builds up again. I know, I know, that’s super toxic and unhealthy to do but this is in the past. I’ve also been suicidal. When I was younger, it would more be me thinking about it a lot and wishing I had a way to carry it out more than anything else, but it was always in the back of my head. When I got older, I was able to purchase a pistol under the cover of “self-defense” but in my heart I knew what I was buying it for. For the next time I had a bad melt-down, I could finally just end it. I should also mention at this point that I only have a few friends in real life, live with my roommate “Dave” who is also a friend, and am still a virgin.  \n\n\nAlso for context, about a year and a half ago I was the closest I had ever been to committing suicide. It was after the toxic relationship with the other person finally ended for real, and I didn’t know what to do with life anymore. I got as far as bawling in my room, holding the gun to my head, and just screaming at myself to “DO IT”. I couldn’t, obviously, but that memory sticks with me. I never told anyone about it, because after I calmed down some I felt really embarrassed in myself.   \n\n\nFast forward to, we’ll say very recently, and Rose is going to come visit me for my birthday for a few days. I’m ecstatic. However, the thought that she might maybe have some romantic feelings left for me entered my mind. Now, mind you this is really dumb for me to think. She’s told me before that she doesn’t see me that way, and I know that. But being the dumb, hopeless virgin I am I stupidly let this flicker of hope light in me. To make things worse, my roommate essentially convinces me that it’ll probably happen. Now, also know that I am not (or at least I hope not in this specific case) an asshole in that I will try to pressure her into this. My mindset was “If she does, cool. If not, it’s still cool because I love just being her friend”, and that is true. It’s the hope that was the main issue.  \n\n\nAnyways, she gets here, it’s a good time, I make a subtle comment, and she (as I should have expected) shuts that shit down. She’s not interested that way, I accept this, and we move on. It’s the next day, and we’re just having a conversation, when I ask her if I made her feel uncomfortable (I’m always constantly in fear that I will upset people in any way, as I have really bad social anxiety). She says no, but that she was just kinda sad that I thought she would. (For additional detail, she is polyamorous but is still selective in who she sleeps with, which is fine) I explain that it’s less me thinking that she was “like that” and more just me wanting to get that part of my life over with. I have this false idea that if I can finally just lose the vCard that my social anxiety will magically disappear (which is stupid, I know).  \n\n\nAnyways, I kinda break down a little bit. I explain to her how I feel alone so much of the time, how the pressures of being a virgin weigh on me because of how people view me. Then I explain the story from a year and a half earlier where I almost killed myself. In this she is super supportive, tells me it’s okay, and we have a good talk. Everything seems fine for now, until I’m taking her back to the airport. As we pull up to the terminal, the realization that everything is about to go back to normal dawns on me. I had been enjoying having a real friend near me that I could talk to, and that was all about to vanish again. I tear up a little bit, and she sees it as me just sad she is leaving (which is half true). I drop her off, and begin to drive home. My tearing up turns to full-fledged weeping as what I can only describe as a panic attack occurs. The entire drive home (1.5hrs) I’m just praying that an eighteen wheeler crashes into me, or that I can just force me hand to ram me into a tree.  \n\n\nI finally make it home, and b-line for my room. I grab my gun, cock it, and begin trying to mentally force myself to “DO IT” again. I’m just staring at it, getting progressively more and more furious at myself for being too weak to do it. I try to convince myself that this is the logical choice, but I just can’t. I’m full on panicking now. I can’t end my life, but continuing forward seems equally daunting. I feel stuck, trapped in my mind, no escape, no- sorry. This is not the point of this story, my emotions started to bleed into my typing.  \n\n\nAnyways, I’m panicked. She’s on the plane, so I can’t contact her. I don’t know what else to do, so I type out everything that was running through my mind from the point of dropping her off to now. Hoping against hope that she would understand and be able to help. I finally calm down some more, and I just nervously wait. She finally sends me back this:  \n\n\n“Hey so I'm really exhausted And this whole weekend was fun but it was also a big reveal. You are really in the dumps I can't help you, no one can. You're the only one who can help you. If you don't want to feel depressed anymore you have to take steps. None of those steps are: 1. Venting to friends 2. Losing your vCard 3. Having more friends - The steps are actually: 1. Getting physically healthy 2. Getting professional help ( medication for anxiety, learning coping mechanisms, going to counseling to vent) 3. Creating a happier space for yourself 4. Loving yourself. Our friendship won't save you, your mom can't, ur family can't, Xbox hobby can't, job can't, Dave can't, a girlfriend can't.These are facts, and maybe no one has had the balls to tell it to you with care in mind. I want you to be better \\*redacted\\*, I sincerely hope you find happiness in yourself and life, but I can’t let my thoughts go unheard.”  \n\n\nNow I just feel awful. I feel like such an asshole for throwing this on her. I feel like I may have accidentally pushed her away, and I’m scared. The logical side of me says that it was okay, but the emotional side of me is berating me for being a massive asshole as I should have just kept this to myself. Am I the asshole for reaching out to her? I just need a second opinion other than the voice in my head. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place, but it seemed like it fit. ",

      "description": "So I’m gonna dive right in\n\nThere’s this girl in class with me who really doesn’t do much. She’s a slacker and is also a bit slow. She will ask the same question multiple times and has held back an entire class’s progress once or twice because the teacher had to just stop and work with her. I think I’d feel a bit different if she actually put in effort instead of just being present in class and then forgetting everything. \n\nAnyways...\n\nI’ve been offered an interview for a really coveted internship, and was chatting with this girl before class, and it turns out she has an interview for the same position. \n\nI let her take a look at my samples I’m bringing to the interview so she could get an idea of how to prepare, and she started eyeing my work aggressively. “I really need to do mine like this.. how’d you do it?” she asked. \n\nAlways down to share resources, I pulled up the websites I had downloaded my source files from and sent her the links. Explained that you basically download the file, plug in your work, and it does the hard bit for you. She would just have to search the database to find source files compatible with her work. Easy, right? \n\nApparently not. She sighs at me in frustration and basically barks “Can’t I just use the files you have downloaded already? I have my hard drive and you can just put them on here for me.” \n\nAnd this girl actually hands me her hard drive expecting me to copy my files for her. Now, I think I’ve been very nice sending her some great resources and showing her how to do it. Especially considering we are up for the same position and she’s essentially my competition. She really wants me to give her my work so she can just erase my plug ins and put her own stuff in?\n\nMe- “Well I’m not sure it’s a good idea for us both to have the same source files, it’ll look like we copy and pasted and will be pretty unprofessional. I’m sure you understand. There’s a few thousand more files to choose from on the websites I showed you, though, so don’t worry. I’m sure you’ll find something.”\n\n-cue sigh- “well, can’t you just like find new ones. Since you know how these work better than me, it wouldn’t take you very long to just find new ones and let me use these, right?”\n\nNow this is where the Asshole part comes in. I refused to give her my source files. I feel like since I spent a fair amount of time finding the perfect sources and crafting them to my pieces, I don’t think it’s fair for me to give them to her and have to start over myself. Especially the night before my interview.\n\nMy friend (our mutual friend) told me I was being selfish and letting the interview get to me, and that I obviously just wanted her to fail. I think if that was the case, I wouldn’t have given her any help at all.. I don’t know. I’m starting to second guess my decision to not just give her my files. Was I being a bitch? \n\nAITA? \n\n",

She said that using black people for my entertainment is racism, and that laughing at a culture I don’t understand is racist. But, I explained to her, it’s not that the actors are black, it’s that I enjoy the humor, and that isn’t it discrediting the actors comedy by saying they’re only funny because they’re black to people of color who enjoy the movie? Maybe that’s not what she meant by it, but she’s refusing to talk to me and telling our mutual friend that I’m a racist because of this. I don’t think I did anything wrong?

      "description": "About two years ago, my older sister came home from college, took a pair of very nice boots from my closet while I was gone, and kept them. I paid $300 for them because I wanted a nice, comfortable pair of boots that I could wear for several years. \n\nOnce I realized they were missing, I asked for them back, and she said no. I couldn’t physically take them from her because we lived in different cities, so I didn’t really have any options at that point. After that conversation, she wore them to a music festival and absolutely trashed them. They were caked with mud, stained, and had been folded up and squished in the back of her car. She was still in college and I knew she didn’t have a lot of extra money, so I decided to wait a while until she got a stable income to ask for new boots to replace the ones she stole. \n\nFast forward to today when I was at dinner with her. She’s an adult now with a steady job, her own place, and she is financially stable. We happened to get on the subject of boots. I politely mentioned my old boots and asked if she would consider buying me a new pair or replacing the ones she took. She got upset and insisted we change the subject because she “didn’t want to get into a fight at the dinner table.”\n\nAITA for wanting her to replace something she took from me and ruined?",

      "description": "Alright, this story is kinda old but I still think about the morality of the situation to this day. \n\n\n So, when I was 16 I got kicked out of my house in a little mountain town in Colorado with no phone, no car, and really nowhere to go. Weird situation at home. First thing I did was walk about 5 miles to my brother’s work (a little restaurant) to plead for a job. Started washing dishes 5 minutes later. \n\nThere was one guy that I worked with, super smart but thought he was above “bitch work” (his words not mine). Let’s call him Alex. Of course, he was the one who trained me. I don’t see myself above anything to this day, so I just went with the unreasonable tasks that had obviously never been done before me. As time moved on, this stopped happening and we became friends. I saved up enough money to buy a car which I was living in as that was basically my only option, going to high school, and working full time. I had a girlfriend that I’d stay with maybe twice a week for a warm place to stay/do laundry. \n\nNow, Alex was super into doing acid (not really my thing but I don’t judge) so his dad kicked him out. He was 19 or 20 at the time, but asked me (still 16) for a place to stay. I arranged a place for us with another friend’s family. \n\nJust a week before this, I woke up on the morning after Valentine’s Day to see my girlfriend had been cheating on me with multiple guys over Facebook on MY FUCKING PHONE. Tip to the wise: if you do this, make sure to sign out of your account. If I open my phone and see 12 messages over Facebook, I open them without thinking about who’s account I’m using. When guys are telling me about how great “the other night” was, I can put 2 and 2 together pretty quick. \n\nAnyway, after leaving her ass, I’m now living with Alex basically in a garage. One day while taking a break he showed me a video or something when a message pops up from my ex on the screen. His screen. He claims he was trying to help me blah blah blah so I went with it. I wanted to know for sure if he was sleeping with her and lying to me about it. I wanted a plan to cut ties if that were the case. I waited for my time to strike. And it came HARD. \n\nTo spare the details, I found out through a friend that my fears were true. I felt violated, not only from my cheating gf but from one of my best friends. \n\nThe day of reckoning fell upon me by accident. \n\nAlex came into the kitchen (at the restaurant) telling me the lockbox, where about 1000 dollars was kept, was easy to get into. He said you can turn the lock without a key and showed me. When my boss came back I told him he needed to replace the lockbox as you didn’t need the key to open it. Of course, he asked me how I knew that and motioned to Alex. Obviously Alex had no explanation so he got fired on the spot along with another friend that was with him. Exactly what I wanted. He knew he was done living with me at that point. \n\nAITA for getting him fired and making him “homeless” at the same time?\n ",

      "description": "Throwaway, for reasons. \n\nI am a professional singer, and I have a side gig as a choir director for a local group of young children (a dozen kids, 6-10 years old) at a church. I absolutely love my work as a choir director for these kids, and I really do enjoy hearing them sing. \n\nI am in the beginning stages of planning my wedding, and a question came up concerning the music during the ceremony. I had the idea to ask my little cherub choir to sing, and my fiancee loved the idea, as she knows how dear those kids' voices are to me, and how much they would enjoy being there for the ceremony, if only as the musicians. \n\nI mentioned this idea to the kids at our last rehearsal, and they were all very excited. A few mentioned to me that it made them feel like 'real musicians', to do a wedding gig. I pitched this idea to the parents of the choir, and the majority seem pretty okay with it. However, a few felt jilted, when I explained that the parents and children would not be guests at the ceremony, nor at the reception. The ceremony will only be attended by our immediate family at whatever venue we choose, and the parents would be able to either drop off their kids for the duration of the ceremony, or wait it out in seating in another area. The reception will take place hours later, likely in my own backyard, and there will not be anyone invited that is under the age of 21, for a variety of reasons, the least of which is the presence of alcohol. \n\nThe kids are old enough and experienced enough to behave themselves for the duration of the ceremony, and most of the parents (including those few that are complaining) do not attend most of the church services nor other events the kids sing at, so I don't see how this is any different. And again, most of the parents seem fine with it. \n\nI told the parents who were frustrated that if they didn't like not being guests, then their kids wouldn't have to sing, and they could just skip the event- 10/12 singers would work just as well. That, for some reason, angered them more.\n\nAITA for wanting my students to sing at my wedding? AITA for not inviting their parents to attend the intimate ceremony? AITA for not planning on inviting my students nor their parents to the 21+ reception?",

      "description": "Throwaway secondary account just in case. \n\nI am in a club called Academic Decathlon and I've spent a lot of time recently with them for practice, as we had just finished our first round of competitions. So that's a solid few months of having my teammates around me nonstop and honestly, they're really cool people and I wouldn't trade anything in the world for them. \n\nBut, one of my teammates has been a bit of a dick as he's been comparing me to my partner a lot. She scored about 5 questions higher than I did during practice, and he's been disappointed in me and says I have not been trying enough. But that simply isn't true, as I have been working really hard all year and organizing our team's spirit events - but he is a record holder of our county and is upset that no one is close to him. \n\nAt first it was alright, but it has become really grating, and I have him for other clubs and classes, but he simply disregards anything I say;  as he doesn't understand why everyone cannot get a perfect SAT score or control the majority of the clubs here like him. I tend to just be seen as an idiot and frankly, I'm just mad at him for it. \n\nI was able to find and network with other people from other schools within my competition just to ease myself, as I have him in so many clubs and classes, and so many people look up to him that I just wanted space. But, as I talked about it with some of my friends, now he wants in on this group chat and I really just don't want him there. I tried dropping subtle hints on why he should not join, such as how he doesn't know anyone and that it's probably not something he'll find important but he continues to ask.\n\n It's nice having someone to relate to in there, and I'll just feel like I'll be in his shadow for another aspect of my life if he joins. I already feel pretty isolated here due to people perceiving me as just deadweight, or just not as intelligent so I really think I just need my space. \n\nBut then I feel like an asshole for saying no, with a mutual friend saying I am the asshole.

      "description": "TL;DR: Bro and his gf promised I could get a cat before we moved into this house. Now that we have moved, they are fighting me about getting a cat again, despite it being my major stipulation for joining them on this lease. WIBTA for getting a cat regardless or their disapproval?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my brother and myself have been living together for the last 6 years. We've always split rent and paid our fair share of all bills. We both moved away from basically all of our family and are each other only real close relatives, though we talk to our mother still. We grew up with dogs and cats and love both kind of animal. Enter his girlfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe moved in with us about 3 years ago and we all split rent 3 ways now. She is very narcissistic and tends to argue about any little thing she doesn't want/like happening. My brother generally bends over backwards to avoid fights with her while I tend to stand my ground so as to not have to tiptoe around since we are all adults (24-26 years old) and we should all be able to have our way from time to time. Anyway, about 4 years back, before she moved in with us, my brother and I decided to get a cat since they are relatively low maintenance and it would've been nice to have around the apartment just for comfort. We get a cat, litterbox, everything else, bring her home and let her explore and get used to the place. His girlfriend comes over and bitches about it not showing her enough attention and only trying to hide under the bed. Despite my arguments that it takes time to get used to a new home, my brother breaks and we return the cat the next day. It broke my heart having to take it back and I've never forgave her for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to her living with us for about 6 months. She wants a dog. I see it as an opportunity to have some kind of pet, even though its not a cat like I want. Her and myself go and get a dog. The dog is nice and fun but she quickly turns to hating it; doesn't want it to roam the house because it might mess something up, doesn't want to let us play with it inside because we are too loud when we play with the dog, etc. She talks about getting rid of the dog, but now my brother is attached to it and won't let her get rid of it. We still have the dog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've wanted a cat since we got rid of the last one. I was always more attached to cats growing up and being alone most of my time outside of work, I wanted a companion to spend time with. I'm social and all but still an introvert and like spending time at home. Every time I've tried to get a feline friend, it turns into a huge argument between me and my brother girlfriend. She had some run-in with a shitty cat when she was young and just hates them. I concede most times due to my brother talking it out and convincing me to wait. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to 4 months ago. Our old lease was expiring soon and I was considering breaking off to get my own place. They approach me about leasing a house together. Its a benefit to us all because of the money it saves us while giving us a whole house to live in. I make one major stipulation for my name being on the lease: I'm able to get a cat. She has blocked me in the past from getting one by talking to the landlord about how shitty cats are and how they shouldn't be allowed, but this time I get the okay right away from our leasing company. They say fine, I can get a cat, but I have to wait a little while after we move in so everyone can get adjusted to the house first. We move in and roughly 3 months have passed without me bringing it up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil yesterday. I went to look at a cat at a local shelter. While I'm driving I get bombarded with texts about how they'll never allow me to get a cat and we don't need anymore animals in the house. I'm almost 25 years old and feel like I'm being treated like a child here. My mother advised me I should just go get a cat since they promised and I squared everything away with the leasing agency. Would I be an asshole for doing that despite them having backpedaled on their promise here? I feel trapped in the 1.5 year lease now that I've signed away on it and the one thing I asked them for is being reneged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n ",

I started to fear that the situation between the parents was not in the best condition, and I thought that maybe he was \"preparing the ground\" for something\n\nWhen I got to the meeting he said he had asked my father what was happening with me and if I had a driver's license My father replied, \"What are you talking about? He is not working for three years,\" and he decided to take me out of the situation I was in by arranging for me work and employment. (Which actually made me really angry about this whole thing) that he began to slip into very personal tracks that I think should not be asked by him but by my father (asked me about my sexuality, and if I was with a woman) And he also wanted to take me to an escort girl and get me a driver's license at his expense ... In short, he took me under his wing\n\nAnd he said it would please my father by making me happy too\n\n(My mental state in the recent period has improved and I feel that  is already behind me and I am on my way to good things, and this irritated me even though it shows that my father does not know me and is not aware that the situation has improved)\n\nThe thing I was annoyed about was that my father was giving up trying to connect with me and / or help me in a certain way and the thing my dad might have sent him to get information about me instead of asking me directly",

      "description": "This semester I enrolled in my schools band program due to the instructor who's other art classes I take asking me to join because he needed someone to play saxophone. I said yes because he is my favorite teacher and it would get me out of a class I don't like. Anyway this semester he decided that instead of just band preforming that he would combine the work of all the classes he teaches into one event displaying k-6 Art, High school digital media, and theatre. This means that my involvement in the event would be increased alot from basically nothing to some of my photography being auctioned off to raise funds to support the programs, playing in the band and even preforming as a lead in a minor theatre skit. \n\nIn previous semesters my only involvment in these things was basically as an assistant helping when needed doing whatever it takes to make the event run smoother. I never did any actual performing. I never told my parents that they should come to these preformances. This semesters program rolls around and I dont tell them anything other than that I am helping out and I'll catch a ride home from a friend as usual. Then today I was tagged in a few pictures on Facebook from the preformance by friends from the class and because my parents follow me on Facebook they saw the pictures and where upset and \"hurt\" that I didnt invite or tell them what I was actually doing that night. \n\nSome background Info on my reasoning for not telling them- My parents are typically hermits who dont like to leave the house unless they need to. Then during previous events they are always pressuring me to leave asap or not wanting to go at all and in general just ruining the experience for me. One example is last years awards night at my school where they announce the winners of the student council elections and because I ran for office it was required that I be there then half way through my mom gets a headache and decided that we had to leave right then and there. I refused because I put alot of effort into my campaign and If I left it would forfeit. I won but got my ass chewed for making them wait twenty minutes. Then during my classes  photography showing they didnt make it because they were to tired. Then the worst event is when my school held a \"fasfa night\" to help teach seniors how to apply for student loans going into college and naturally parents were required for the event. They were irritated afterwards because we could have technically done it from our house. So after that I decided to save my self the stress and stop involving them in things. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "I had to push my bike for a couple of metres because the path went through a passage through a mall, and at the exit there was a homeless woman with a dog collecting money in a coffee cup. She looked sad and her dog was cute so I gave her the spare change I still had in my pocket (like 1€). She said thank you and asked for more, but I said I didn’t have any more money, even though I still had a 10€ note in my backpack. Then she said I would probably have a credit card and I should go to the pharmacy across the street and buy her some cold medication. I COULD have done that, but I had a place to get to and wasted half my pocket money on a Godzilla shirt this month, and anyways, I just said “I’m sorry” and walked away, with her calling “pleaaaaase” after me. Am I the asshole for not helping her?",

      "description": "Alright, so, quick context.\n\nMy school gives a series of awards to many of the seniors depending upon the number of things that they have accomplished over their high school years.\n\nEveryone expected me to win the \"all-rounder\" award. I've held the most leadership, lead the most initiatives, and worked the most and the longest to improve my institution (apologies for the not-so-humble brag).\n\nHowever, one thing I have not done was try to win awards, mainly because of how self-centred I considered them. Not that anyone who aims to improve themselves by winning competitions is bad or wrong, it's just that that really wasn't my thing. I was and still am more of a \"let's make changes and start clubs so that all of us can learn and grow\" kind of person–– I headed 5 societies in my school: student govt, debate, theatre, technical, and orchestra and participated in videography, model UNs, and quizzing. (again, not-so-humble bragging, sorry).\n\nMy dear institution, therefore, decides to ask for all our certificates and uses that as the SOLE criteria for judging a student for awards. And I end up with nothing–– not even an acknowledgement for ANY of it. EIGHT goddamn years of staying till 7 PM to try to organize festivals and club meetings and raise funds and whatnot while the teachers did nothing but relax, eight years fo constantly grinding myself and just... nothing. I'm pissed, because I feel like I deserve at least something.\n\nI don't hate anybody who won, they're all my friends and are incredible people and totally deserved their awards. And five years later, I know I won't care at all, but right now I feel hurt. The ceremony is today, and I've been called because I'm the school captain. I know I'm being painfully petty but I really don't want to go.\n\nAm I being an asshole?",

      "description": "I'm a flexible asexual. Basically, sometimes I'm entirely ace, fully repulsed by sex to the point of being physically sick when it's brought up. This can last anywhere between a few days, to a few weeks or even months at a time. \n\nI was going through a period of this when 2 of my friends in a large group chat starting getting into the nitty gritty details of some experience one of them had just had. No one else was engaging and I gently asked them not to discuss it in the group chat as it was making me highly uncomfortable and asked if they could use their private chat instead.\n\nThey laughed it off and continued. More firmly, I asked them to stop. At this point the rest of the chat chimed in and proceeded to bombard me with highly sexual things, making me incredibly uncomfortable and no one was listening when I begged them to just stop. \n\nI left the chat, to which they added me back in immediately. This continued for about 20mins before I stopped leaving the chat and just muted it instead and didn't talk to them for a week.\n\nAm I the asshole for asking 2 people who were essentially spamming the chat to take their conversation elsewhere, for leaving the chat once everyone took the piss on me for even being ace, and then ignoring them until I was ready to speak to them again?

He visits sometimes in the year, and he came December 23rd and he’s going January 5th. We spent Christmas together and he gave me two books. I feel bad, because now I feel like I have to spend time with him. He says the only reason he is in this country right now, is because of me. And I haven’t even been out with him yet. I haven’t even showered or done anything. He messages me every day wanting to be with me, but I’ve declined a few times because I just can’t handle it. He wants to go out all the time and it’s stressing me out. I also can’t manage to get up, shower, being social and all that stuff.\n\nI in all honesty think he is intrusive. If he wasn’t here I’m sure I would’ve showered and gone out for a walk. But his presence just makes it all so unbearable.\n\nHe lives in another apartment because my mother and him are separated. Yesterday he came home with food(and I’m really thankful for that btw) and I usually have a hard time eating food with others so I waiting for him to go until I would eat. But he didn’t go. I asked if it was okay if I started to eat now, and he said yeah sure, and I told him that I usually eat while watching something alone, and he still didn’t get the reference. I told him ok so is it okay if I go to my room. He said yeah yeah I’ll be waiting for you outside. I mean, there’s nothing wrong with that I guess. I don’t even know why that made me feel so uneasy and annoyed.\n\nSo well, now I don’t want to spend New Years with him because I would much rather stay in my bed and do nothing. Like I’ve done for months now.\n\nI have to try to see it from his perspective. He lives in another country, without his daughter, was happy to see her and has missed her.\n\nSo WIBTA if I don’t spend time with him and for my overall opinion about him?",

      "description": "Obligatory I'm on mobile and this is a throwaway account\n\nNow, I realize the title sounds really bad - but there is a little background\n\nI don't have a good relationship with my mother. She was manipulative and neglectful to me and my brothers, sometimes borderline abusive. She would often disappear for days at a time with her boyfriends and this became a larger issue when I was a teenager.\n\nIts also worth noting that she has several physical and mental health issues, which I never blamed her for and I can understand it made raising children difficult, so I can't completely hate her.\n\nShe started seeing her now-husband when I was 14, and he moved in with us shortly after they started dating. We all got evicted from our home when I was 15, which I later found out was due to him gambling our rent money away. After that I lived with family friends and my relationship with my mother has been hanging by a thread ever since. I wasn't invited to their wedding.\n\nOver the years that they have been together, he has kicked her out of their house on several occasions, cheated on her, been in jail multiple times for drug possession and physical abuse (from a previous relationship) charges, gambled their rent money, threatened to leave her, and hit her. Whenever this happens, I have become the good daughter and come to my mother's side regardless of my shaky relationship with her and listened to her cry about the things he's done, tell me about how she needs help finding an apartment and she is going to divorce him, done what I can to support her, and then watched her immediately forgive him when he walked in the door.\n\nSo when I got the text from my brother that her husband had hit her, I didn't really care to do anything.\n\nNow I understand that abusive relationships are incredibly hard to get out of. At the same time, it's incredibly frustrating and emotionally draining to me to see this happen over and over again. We don't speak to each other, and when we do it's the same broken record. I have had plans of cutting her out of my life completely when I graduate college because I don't feel comfortable having her in my life, but at the same time I feel guilty for not jumping to help her.\n\nSo, AITA?",

He was quick to get to the point and wrote that he would like to get to know me and if we could meet. To make it clear: I never agreed to meet with him. We only wrote for a few minutes and for a bit the next day and I said that we could maybe meet in the future but I would like to get to know him a little before I agree to anything. \n\nHowever, because the picture he used was somewhat familiar I showed it to a friend who recognized him because a girl we know has been \"friends\" with him a few years ago. I asked the girl about him and to make it short: he was very pushy, got agressive (mostly insults) and posessive when she met with other guys (they were not together) and willing to cheat on his girlfriend. She told me that he could have changed since then but that he was a creep when she knew him and warned me to be cautious.\n\nI decided to ignore him because I was no longer interested and because he would probably demand a reason why I changed my mind. I didn't feel like lying and wouldn't tell him the truth because he might get angry at the girl.\n\nSo I know I'm not an asshole for cutting the contact of, but am I for ignoring his messages without an exlanation?",

      "description": "In SK it's considered desirable to have a youthful look (smooth skin, bright eyed, slim, look at kpop) and I have a close friend(22f) who keeps joking about having a crush on a family friend that is 17 this year. Some info is retracted for privacy sake.\n\nI know she is joking. While he is conventionally attractive I know she doesn't mean it because of history. She always picks guys that are out of reach (one way or another) as an object of affection so she has a reason to not take it too seriously and not find real connection with people around her. It was always a topic we joke around with before but this for me crosses the line.\n\nShe mentioned it once in a while jokingly and I kept telling her to stop but she keeps bringing it up. Last week I snapped and was a lot harsher about not saying stuff like that when I'm around and she took it really badly. She's really sensitive these days and while I understand I wanted to draw the line for my sake too. I was very blunt.\n\nShe has issues with being confronted and has a lot anxiety problems. After confronting her properly she had an episode and just imploded. I'm not sure if confronting her was the right thing to do specially if it was just a joke. We haven't spoken since.\n",

      "description": "So, I cut my ex out of my life almost instantaneously within the past few weeks, months after we broke up and tried to remain friends, and I can't help feeling like I'm overreacting and its really my fault. I'll throw a tldr at the bottom but otherwise...\n\nSo, within the past year I moved in with my ex to escape a family situation that left me in the psych ward and with a lot of stress issues. At the time it was only temporary, it was 4 people in a 2 bedroom house, and we had plans to move out and find somewhere better once I got a stable job.\n\nUntil then, I was helping out by providing food to them-- All of which seemed to disappear days after I'd buy it. This wouldn't be abnormal, except I was facing an eating disorder and ate little to nothing, and 2 of the others were rarely ever home, leaving my ex as the only culprit. And we're talking Costco bulk food here.\n\nEverytime I'd order food my ex would complain about the stuff I'd order. He was tired of eating: Mac and Cheese, chicken nuggets, riceroni, ramen, etc. so it made buying decent bulk items really hard...\n\nIt frustrated me, but I tried to work with it as I was sort of living with them rent free.\n\nOnce I got my job a lot changed in the house.\n\nI was working with people who couldn't look after themselves travelling about 8 hours every day to and from work, 9-5 essentially, and it was really exhausting to me.\n\nI'd come home and everyone would ignore me. Even my ex. I would sit in the living room and cry while everyone just walked past me. My depression begun flaring up from all the work and home stuff (not to mention I was sleeping on the couch for a good amount of my time there) and it was beginning to really affect me.\n\nBut my ex didn't seem to care.\n\nHe got upset at me for now greeting him whenever he cam home from his 3 hours of college, often wouldn't offer me any choice in joining on food orders, gold me he found it rude when I chose to skip an outing as my paycheck didn't come through and I had no money, etc.\n\nHe told me I had to talk to him when I had issues, but every time I did he would blame me for it or  best case scenario, stare at me like a deer in the headlights.\n\nAnd the kicker? Shortly after finally settling in, he decided he didn't want to move into a bigger place anymore. I was stuck in a 2 bedroom apartment, on the couch, with 3 other people in there.\n\nWe broke up on night after I had a particularly bad day. I was in the living room crying to who is my current partner right now about how everything was becoming too much for me. During my breakdown, I recieved a text from ex (who was in the other room) saying, \"gonna be real with you chief, I don't think I can do this anymore.\"\n\nHe started telling me how it was my fault everyone was stressed, how I should have talked to him if I was upset, how he shouldn't have to be responsible to check on me if I don't come to him  etc. He even messaged my current partner (who I was crying to) asking what was wrong with me before he ever messaged me.\n\n(My current partner told him he had to talk to me and that they weren't going to say what was wrong unless he went. He blew up at me about how \"I don't need them being all condescending to me\")\n\nI only apologized, hoping he would stop, but he didn't. I got upset, explained why I wasn't comfortable coming to him, that I'm sure my current partner didn't mean it rudely, that I was sorry I upset him, and all we ended up agreeing on was that it was best I move out with my whole $10 to my name.\n\nWe made up before I left, literally only a few hours before I caught a ride back to my family.\n\nBut recently we had a disagreement again.\n\nWe were playing a multiplayer game and he was insulting our support most game. It had got on my nerves, but I tried to remain focused.\n\nAt one point my system shut off without warning. I rejoined the game to see everyone getting utterly destroyed, and my ex making a bad call in game. He started insulting me for messing up on his bad call and getting him killed, telling me I should have \"stayed disconnected\"\n\nI only responded \"lol whatever\"\n\nAfter the game, I took a few minutes to calm down before going to apologize. I said I was sorry , that I got upset and didn't have the ability to follow through on his call and tried to calm down in game.\n\nHe told me that I should \"learn to detilt\" in game like him.\n\nI informed him he was actually the one getting upset more than me, that it was his fault J was getting upset.\n\n\"This is why no one likes to play with you xd\" he wrote.\n\nI said that once to him, after he blew up at me in the same game, but his current partner and several other people told me they didn't like that he got so mad and that's why the often stopped playing with him.\n\nI was really tired of having every time I went to apologize turn into \"this is why you're a bad person\", \"this is why it's your fault\", \"I'm better than you, see?\"\n\nSo I just wrote \"lol k\", and blocked him on everything. \n\nHe wrote about how I was petty for doing that, how I couldn't take criticism, but I genuinely see it as \"why should we be friends if neither of us enjoy each other's company anymore?\"\n\nBut I'm paranoid.\n\nI worry I was in the wrong for this and I genuinely don't know if it's a result of emotional abuse and manipulation that I'm either twisting this super hard or if I'm feeling guilty cause I'm not... used to not having someone step over me  if that makes sense? I guess I just need an outside perspective on this...\n\nTL;DR My ex constantly twisted every argument to make it my fault, took advantage of my buying food for the entire house, had me sleeping on the couch in a small apartment with 3 other people, broke up with me via text while I was in the next room crying on the couch mid break down (\"Gonna be real with you chief, I don't think I can do this anymore\"), we made up, got into another argument after he got upset, purposefully upset me, then took a high ground and told me not to get upset so easily. I blocked him on everything. He called me petty for not wanting to deal with this anymore.\n\nAm I in the wrong?",

I've been working through some self-image and mental health problems, and have recently taken the opportunity of being on holiday to expose myself to situations that are difficult for me to try and build tolerance. These include: taking spontaneous pictures and leaving the house without prepping too much (beyond good hygiene).\n\nDuring this time I've been traveling with family. I had considered this to be a good time to practice these things, especially as exposure is limited to strangers and family. \n\nHowever, a few hours ago my brother's girlfriend posted quite a few less than appealing tagged pictures of me (and other select family members) without asking permission to do so beforehand. This has led to me to spiral badly to a point where I haven't been for a long time, after putting in a lot of hard work.\n\nAITA for blaming and wanting to yell at her for this deterioration?",

I said there must have been some miscommunication and I thought that she was picking up Tom at 10. I told her that if transportation was a problem my husband or I could drive Tom home.\n\nTom’s mom said that the issue was Tom wanted to stay over and would be let down if he had to go home. (Again, I don’t know why she thought he was sleeping over, since I made it clear on the invitation what was expected. We will have a couple other boys over who are the kids of family friends and they will also be leaving at 10 pm!). \n\nIt was a sort of awkward conversation to say the least. But she ended up saying she would come to pick up Tom after the party. \n\nTo be honest, even if I was inclined to have Tom sleep over, I doubt husband would go for it.

(English is not my first language so I will try my best)\nSo my cousin got married almost two years ago.\nWhen I first met his wife, I thought she was great. But now after two years of knowing her I know that she is not a good person and that she uses people around her. It took me a while to realize that because I see good in people most of the time. We live in a big house so my neighbors are my two uncles and their family and my aunt her husband and my grandma. We've always been connected and we always celebrate together for example our birthdays. It's not a big celebration we usually bake a cake and drink coffee together. This summer it was my father's 60th birthday so I baked him a cake we ordered a few pizzas and we made him blow out candles and everything just for fun haha my cousins wife was inside the house we called her a few times to come and eat the cake but she didn't. She didn't even wish my dad a happy birthday. Sometimes she doesn't even say hello when she sees us. ⏩ To today. She works maybe 30 minutes away by foot. But she doesn't want to walk so she calls me all the time to give her a lift since I'm not working at the moment. That wouldn't be such problem if there weren't 2 buses she could take to go to work (buses are more common than Uber in our country)\nShe offered to pay me for the lift 3 dollars a day. I said that I don't want to take her money and the inconvenience of having to be free because I need to take her to her job. But she continued to ask me for the lift but without paying.\nToday she asked me what I'm doing this afternoon. I said that I'm studying for my college to what she replied \"oh nothing important then can you give me a ride\".\nAm I in the wrong here? She literally contacts me only when she needs a lift.\nIf it was some extreme situation like 1 o clock in the morning and she needed a lift of course I would help her, but this seems like she's taking advantage of me and I don't know how to say no. I tried today and failed miserably. ",

They didn’t have the brand I wanted so I bought another one assuming that they’re generally all the same, and I’d seen good reviews on this brand as well. I asked a manager to reassure me that if it didn’t fit, I could return it, and he said that as long as it wasn’t damaged and returned in the packaging, I could return it, no questions asked. \n\nEnded up not liking the head collar. It didn’t fit quite right on my dog and I believed would have caused him some pain if he were to pull while wearing it, which is the exact opposite of what I want. I went to return and there were 2 cashiers in the store, both super friendly throughout the whole process. I explained it just didn’t fit, and when they asked if I wanted to exchange it for a different size, I mentioned that I preferred a different brand and they said they didn’t carry those, so they just put the return on a gift card. I went to see if maybe there was another option, but it turns out, they only had the one brand I didn’t like. Not a big deal, my dogs were running low on food anyways, so I figured I’d pick them up a bag while I was there. \n\nWhen I went to check out, the cashier asked me if I’d like to pay with debit or credit card. I said I wanted to use the gift card and pay the rest with cash. My cashier looked at the other one and scoffed and was suddenly not friendly to me at all. As soon as I was done paying, there was no “thank you, have a nice day”. Just an eye roll and they both promptly walked away towards the back. I could hear them both whispering as they walked away. Normally they offer to help carry large purchases to your car as well, but I wasn’t offered help. \n\nI didn’t think that if I got a gift card from a return, it would have to be used for a similar product, especially when they only offer one brand. It’s essentially still my money since I paid for the original product, correct? Everything was fine up until that point so I don’t know if there’s some unwritten rule against what I did (like when I was a barista, we’d get annoyed at customers who would order 5 blended drinks 2 minutes before we closed because we’d already cleaned the blenders). \n\nThis is the second time this has happened (I once returned a bag of food because I didn’t realize there was a hole in it and they’d just put tape on it. I didn’t want to risk feeding it to my dogs. Returned it, used the store credit and bought some treats and toys) where everyone is super friendly, greets me on the way in, super helpful with the return, then gets irritated when I use the store credit for something unrelated. \n\nAm I an asshole? Or are they just being judgmental?",

      "description": "Hi everybody, first post here, desperately seeking to be judged by strangers.\n\nLittle background: I (23M) am a professional photographer (and economics graduate) and from a year and a half work for a marketing company, a pretty big and famous one in my country. The company started really small, two years ago, I was with them from the beginning more or less, I’ve seen them growing up incredibly fast. \n   Now the company is starting to work with the television, reality shows, tv series etc. My girlfriend (24F) is a dentistry student and an actress/model in the spare time(she was “on the wave” two-three years ago). \n\nToday my boss called me after some weeks during  which I was not answering his texts because I got finals at university  (master degree). He said that they got a job for me, there is a new influencer (3mil+ followers) in the company that needs photos and they want to me to do that. \n\n   It’s worth to point out at this moment that I don’t “just take photos”, I am part of the marketing process, doing network, speaking with potential customers, being a liar sometimes (trying to be honest with you tho) and for those skills I always end up to never be substituted for other people, even if I tend to disappear or to work at my own pace and rules. \nMoreover, I have some side deals with them such as doing their personal shopper. Plus, and this is very important, I have the feeling that if I say no another time to the company, they will just stop calling me for working. \n\nI was excited to have the opportunity to take those photos. Good money, good exposure, a really nice impression with my boss, good possible future connection. \n     Immediately after saying yes, I text my gf to tell her the news. She was immediately upset, saying that that world sucks, people in the entertainment industry are shits, women are bad as hell and so on... \nWe get in a fight over facetime and she has those crazy eyes of a jealous girl, and insist in telling me that she knows those people and they are bad and my reputation will be hurt by that. \nShe insist saying that I don’t need those people and I should say to my boss that I don’t want this job, he will not fire me in her opinion. \n\nProblem is: she worked and still works in that world, and I find it to be hypocritical from her to limit me in this way, especially when I am a total trustworthy guy who know how to behave and have a good experience in manipulate people for business purpose. How could I be “seduced” by “beautiful bad women” when \n1. I’m not really of any relevance or influential or famous \n2. broke and ugly\n3. totally in love with my gf that I want to marry and die with? \nHow could I be seduced by the “celebrity” if I never wanted it neither I’m looking for it?\n\nAm I the asshole to telling her that I want this job, I need the money and I will do it?\n\np.s. sorry for the broken english, not my native language and I’m really tired and stressed out. I’m really sorry also for the formatting and the telenovela-style narration. Love ya",

My parents are all upset that I was 20 minutes late.  I currently have spring break and I work 8 hour shifts at work during the day and don't get to sleep in. Then I go out at night and try and enjoy the 2-3 hours I can and repeat. I do understand that I was 20 minutes late but the roads were wet and I was not about to tell my friend to race to my house trying to endanger all of us for no good reason. I would understand if I was late because of my poor planning but unexpected events came up and it was out of my control. I am doing this to try and prove a point to my parents. My parents are treating me like I came home drunk and high in the back of a cop car. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Within my group of friends, there is one girl who's name is Blue and two other gentlemen by the name of Gray and Green. We all live scattered around the U.S. and Britain, so online communication is primarily online. Green and Blue used to be in some form of long distance relationship, but are not any longer and largely just friends as far as I'm aware. Gray and Blue are apparently close now, to the point where Gray goes off unhinged whenever Blue is upset in any way.\n\nOver the course of the summer, my friendship had been deteriorating with Blue and Gray slowly. Some of the things were how I was apparently sexist for questioning Blue, how I was apparently obsessed with her for naming something after her, and apparently not knowing she was upset. It escalated into arguments where they would both team up against me, because they don't want to even consider my words. No one ever went out of the way to tell me something was wrong, and instead waited until the next day to tell me. I felt ashamed and disrespected because of it. They then slowly started implementing new things to not get me to act up, which only infuriated me more and more until it somehow got decided that not telling me anything at all about problems was for the best. It got to the point where college started back up for me and I couldn't hang out on a frequent basis anymore.\n\nWhat happened a few days ago is that something happened between all three of them. I don't know if Green exploded onto Blue about still having feelings, if Blue realized she had feelings for Green still, or if Gray decided to rage about. I don't know because no one will tell me anything. All I know is that Blue's upset, because she's offline and because Gray is raging. She has refused to respond to any of my messages for the last couple of days, checking in to see if she's okay. Gray is obsessed with saying that it doesn't concern me, that I'm only doing it because 'I desire her'. I do have a crush on her, but she's a good friend of mine that's in trouble and if somethings happening I want to know what it is and calm this paranoia running through my head. Do they feel so indifferent about me that they'll leave me in the dark and let my worries eat me inside? She doesn't even talk much to me anymore, mostly just to Gray or Green. I hate not knowing what is going on, why everyone suddenly gets upset, goes offline, refuses to talk to me or anything at all. I'm wondering what I should even do anymore.",

She said she would do the laundry if i handled the dishes, but i end up doing the laundry( i don't mind that one really, i like folding clothes) We had a conversation and i told her if this ends up being one of those things that you say you are going to do, but i end up doing it, i'm going to the closest Wal-Mart and buying a pack of Pampers, because i'm not going to be washing shitty cloth diapers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have an issue with changing the diapers...it's just washing them.  \n\n\nAm I The Asshole?",

After a week, we met up, I told her very nicely that she has to stop having such crazy reactions (not in those words) to minor things. She apologised, resolved to be nicer as it's been about 80-20% in terms of effort and love over the last week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe had to return home (out of the city) as her cat was getting put down. As she left (after we spent two really nice days together, and a great date) and no we don't live together yet, I texted her saying I love you a ton, had a lovely time, and i'll call you after the cat situation so I can cheer you up. She responded with a lovely message that was essentially saying 'I love you too, had an amazing time, and have a lovely night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not reply to this message for what was close to 24 hours. I loved her message but didn't see any need to message her back quickly, especially as she has had a go at me for wanting to have the last word sometimes. I messaged her in the evening, asked how she was, and after she replied, completely normally, saying i could call in a couple of minutes as she was about to get back home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spoke to her on the phone and did my best to cheer her up after the death of her long time pet. She eventually started acting strange and asked me why I didn't reply. I said I was busy with some other things and didn't see any pressing need as she didn't ask me any questions or demand anything. She was adamant that it was 'strange' and she thought that 'you think something is wrong' or that 'I didn't like her,' or that 'things weren't ok.' I then apologised for it but she continued to basically have a go at me. I told her that I disliked where this conversation was going, told her I loved her, had to repeat myself about four times as she was raising her voice and insulting me. I then hung up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe messaged me multiple absuive messenges and again seemed adamant that I had done something horrible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't particularly understand. I could understand that she thought it was rude, but was the kind of think we'd just spoken about her overreacting to less. I don't get it really though. Am I an idiot?",

      "description": "Backstory:\n\nSo my friend (A) and I have gone to this music festival before (Rockfest in Quebec for those who are wondering) and mostly had a great time, besides her shitty not-boyfriend at the time. He was a bastard the whole weekend and really made it hard to fully enjoy the experience. \n\nThis festival takes place in June, and tickets go on sale in December/January. A and I decided to try again this year, and we agreed that I'd buy the 4 tickets since I had the highest limit on my card (4 of them plus camping and parking add up). We would split the costs down the middle, which we agreed was fair. \n\n3 months later, my boyfriend and I broke up. So I ended up with an extra ticket. \n\nThe problem:\n\nA and I were dead set on enjoying our experience, so who we brought was a big deal. We asked a few people we thought would be a good fit, but no one really said yes. So, I figured selling the ticket would be our best option. Since I bought them early, I got a deal, and could sell the ticket at regular price and actually make $20. \n\nA insisted that we ask a girl (B) that we met at the previous Rockfest to join us. A kept in contact with B, B was good people, she would make the weekend fun etc. So, I agreed, as long as B payed her own way. \n\n\nUnfortunately, B lost her job a week before we went, didn't even want to go anymore but A insisted. During this week and even at Rockfest, I still could have sold my extra ticket. But, like I said, A insisted. She offered to pay for B's gas, food and drink at Rockfest etc. \n\nThe Aftermath:\n\nSurprise! It's been 6 months and B hasn't paid a cent back. Even with gentle reminders every few weeks (at first, I've given up on seeing money from her). \n\nAfter 2 months of nothing from B, A and I talked about what to do and agreed it was fair to split B's costs, I even agreed to pay for some of the stuff A insisted on buying B, like gas. A literally said \"you could have sold the ticket, but I wanted to bring B so I feel partially at fault\"\n\nSo, it's been 4 months since we made that agreement, and she's paid me what she definitely owes me, but not B's portion. Now she thinks that I should foot the full cost, since I bought the \"extra\" ticket in the first place. It was \"my responsibility\" to handle it (yes, she said that to me). \n\nShe also said that it's been so long and I've paid off my credit card since then that \"it doesn't really make a difference, does it?\"\n\nKeep in mind that she works full time, and I work part time (4-12 hours a week) while I'm in school. \n\nI've basically written her off, there's a few other reasons that helped me make this decision, but this was the final push. \n\nAITA though?\n\nI'm just wondering, is she right though? AITA for expecting A to split the cost? I did agree to \"selling\" (lol) B the ticket, and I did say that B didn't have to worry about paying me back until she had a job again (I know this wasn't the smartest, but she has a kid and I felt bad). Still, I made that crappy choice. Am I misunderstanding this? \n\n**TL;DR** friend and I agreed to split the costs of a 3rd \"friends\" idiot fee, friend has now decided that I need to foot the entire bill. I'm opposed to that and basically have written them off.",

Right after I guess finishing her task she entered my room and asked me in sort of a loving way about what was I listening to and made comments about the song which wasn't offensive or truly bad but as a person who likes isolation and hate when people give their unwanted opinions on the subjects I never ask them or want to be observed this truly annoyed me and angered me that she was listening and greatly observing what I was doing this whole time so I said to her, in an annoyed and arrogant tone to leave my room and shut the door as you go to which she said do not complain when I do the same with you later.\nP.s I wasn't truly angry about the comment but the fact that she was spying on me as the volume was very low and one could barely listen to it and would need to greatly focus to listen what was it like from the living room.",

      "description": "Context: My job is to give citations in a downtown area of a certain city. My co-workers job is to fix the meters, collect money and be in the office during office hours. Me and my other co-worker who also gives citations have to text him whenever there’s an issue so he can fix it right away. The office is closed on Friday.\n\nOkay now to the issue. He was given a schedule when to collect the money for which street. For example, Monday: A Street and B Street. Friday since the office is closed, he’s suppose to be out fixing stuff. Does he do this? No. I’ll often text him about a broken meter, doesn’t respond... I now include my supervisor in these text chats so whenever he doesn’t respond (which is every time) he calls him.\n\nIt’s really starting to annoy me because all he does is sit in the office watching YouTube videos. He’s admitted to sleeping. This pissed me off because since he doesn’t work on Saturday and I do, I have to do my job AND his job. I can’t write citations with broken meters.\n\nWe’ve told him he needs to fix meters on the spot so they can be quickly be running again. He doesn’t understand the point of that, he thinks it’s better to just leave an empty pole while it takes him a few days to fix. A few days? It literally takes 2 minutes. I remember I once told him a meter needs a battery, he told me “I’ll get around to it on Wednesday” 5 fucking days to switch a damn battery.\n\nHe was also told that if a part falls inside the pole, he needs to fish it out. He responded with “I didn’t sign up for this”.\n\nNow for the mind blowing part, this man is 34 yo and doesn’t have a license. His dad drives him around. You might think he probably can’t due to a condition? Wrong. He’s fully able to and actually needs one to work his job. We have a cart we can drive around to fix the meters or carry heavy stuff since the downtown area is big. He’s been driving an insured street legal vehicle without a license and my boss doesn’t know. Not only that, the cart’s seat belt doesn’t work.\n\nHe’s been working for a month and he’s still “trying” to get a handbook for the driving test.\n\nIt doesn’t stop there. He’s suppose to add up all the money collected on Excel. He can’t do it... we’ve had someone come down from the next city over 3 weeks in a row. That’s 30min away.\n\nWhat did I do?\n\nHe told me someone in the morning was complaining that he didn’t open the door and that he was sleeping. He just told him we are closed today and went back to doing nothing. So I created an email with a fake name and submitted complaints to the company in hopes that my boss looks at the security cams and sees him doing nothing and getting him possibly fired, demoted or replaced. \n\nAm I an asshole for this? I’m literally doing his job now and not getting paid anything extra. If anything my boss will see that my citation average is starting to drop since I’m busy doing my co-workers job.\n\nI want to add, I walk ~15mi a day. He walks 2 at most.",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. \n\n\nWe've been dating for about 9 months. He's a wonderful, sweet, caring man who treats me well; this is our first significant argument. \n\n\nI was seriously abused (sexually, mentally, physically) for my whole life growing up, quite especially harshly from age 4 to 16. I don't like to think about it much and I feel like I'm fairly well-adjusted and successful despite this. It's also not something I casually tell people, because in the past people immediately treat me differently, like I'm broken or going to fall apart at any moment. I hate the sympathy and the scrutiny and I think it's really none of anyone's business. \n\n\nMy abusers are related to me, and as such I nearly destroyed my family when I told my father and stepmother when I was 20. Since then, I've had very limited contact with my abusers, but they're still in my life and I see them around the holidays. I have them blocked on every form of social media and usually make myself scarce when they visit, which is rare.\n\n\nI am (a bit understandably, I think) on edge whenever they're around. One of my abusers stopped by unexpectedly on Wednesday and I stayed at a friend's house during this time. \n\n\nMy friend, who is also close with my boyfriend, apparently made some offhand comment to him, like \"She's staying at my place while so-and-so is in town, you know how it is.\" I think she assumed that I had already told my boyfriend, otherwise she wouldn't have said it. \n\n\nEither my friend told him (possible, but unlikely, I trust her) or he jumped to a conclusion that happened to be correct (possible, he's extremely smart), and he asked if anyone in my family had ever \"hurt me.\" I replied that my family has a messy history and I didn't want to get into it. He kept pressing me and pressing me and I got very snappish and said it was none of his fucking business and that if it was something I wanted his opinion on, or something he could help me with, I would tell him, but otherwise to back off. \n\n\nHe became very hurt and withdrawn and I felt guilty for yelling at him, so I apologized for raising my voice. He said he's extremely hurt that I don't trust him and that he would never hurt me. I eventually told him some very broad strokes about what happened to me (how long the abuse lasted, how I've gone to therapy and how it's the reason that I don't do certain things with my family) but didn't want to go into specifics or details. \n\n\nI thought that would be the end of it, but now he's demanding to know exactly who and what happened to me, and I do not want to tell him. He says that it would be therapeutic to tell someone and that he has a right to know about my past because we're dating, and we've discussed the possibility of marriage in the future. He also said that until he knows exactly who did this to me, he doesn't want anything to do with my family, to which I tried to explain wasn't necessary, because my abusers are barely ever around and my dad has basically shunned them. \n\n\nI feel like I'm perfectly justified in not wanting to tell him about the extremely painful and fucked up shit that happened to me, and he doesn't have a \"right\" to know anything except what I'm comfortable telling him. But my friend seems to think otherwise and she said that its at least partially my fault for not telling him sooner, and that I need to have better communication; I straight up told her that it's my choice on who or what I tell anyone about anything, and that he doesn't have a right to know about my past just because we're dating.\n\n\nAm I the asshole for not telling him? I feel like I'm not but my boyfriend is super upset, which makes me feel like I am. \n",

A lady, around 40-50 yo with a big suitcase approaches me and asks me something. As I remove my earphones she repeats: \"Hello, I want to call my aunt and tell her where I'm going. Can I make a call with your mobile phone?\". I was a bit surprised as 1) Everyone has a mobile phone where I live, 2) Wherever one is going, there probably is a phone and you can call from there, 3) Just generally had a bit of a weird feeling with the person. My conclusion was that the woman was either confused/crazy or tried to pull off some kind of scam. So I told her that I prefered not to (give her my phone). She then walks on mumbling \"greedy asshole\" or something.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So, me and my girlfriend were shopping for some stuff, spending our Saturday really well, the mood was great, when we meet one of her friends in the same store. I don't hate her friend, in fact, I think she's pretty nice. We we're all shopping together when we started discussing how best to build a shelf. My girlfriend was saying how they did something similar during high school and asked if I did something similar, when her friend, well aware of how my humor was, dropped the line, \n\n\"I bet he wouldn't, he was homeless!\"\n\nNow it was obviously a joke and the way she delivered it, it made me want to laugh, but I never shared that with her. I had no idea how she knew this. Well, my girlfriend told me she had shared that with her, when she had asked \"what my story was\".\n\nWell, the air kinda got awkward and I really couldn't do anything but kinda cringe and walk away. It just made me really uncomfortable that she had known this. After my girlfriend was done chatting she came to find me looking over some bubblegum and I explained why I was upset.\n\nShe took the stance that she didn't understand why it was a big deal. I had told others about it, why couldnt she? I explained that, yes, I had told others and yes, maybe my attitude was a joking one at the time, but I felt okay with that because I got to choose to tell them, it was up to me. When she did it, I felt like it was taking the choice away from me. I really did not want her friends to know this information as it's pretty embarrassing and shameful to me.\n\nShe responded with that her friends love me, which I do believe and that I shouldn't be ashamed, which I agree, but I feel like she wouldn't address the issue that she shared something kinda personal about me without at least telling me. I told her I wouldn't do that to her and she said she didn't care if I did.\n\nShe apologized but she's kinda cold and I can still tell she's bothered it. I love her with all my heart and I'm not worried if she'll break up with me over it since I know she loves me just as much. I'm not even mad since I didn't tell her this and I can't expect her to read my mind. What's done is done and I already got a memo page full of bad jokes and her favorite gummy snacks to make her smile again, but I just wanna know, \n\nWas I an asshole for being bothered by this? It's bothering me a lot and I've never dealt with this before. Help me our?\n",

      "description": "So my boyfriend is a sucker for hickeys (no pun intended). He absolutely loves the feeling of them and every time I suck on his neck he fidgets and quivers like he’s having an orgasm. I really like giving them to him because it makes him so happy, but I also really don’t like the fact that people know that I gave it to him (I think they look really trashy and unprofessional) especially when we’re in public together. And I don’t like my boyfriend walking around letting the whole world know about our intimate life\n\nHe doesn’t seem to mind it and I told him that it makes me uncomfortable when he walks around in public with them so I asked him if he could hide them or use concealer. He agreed and when he was with me in public, he’d cover them which I was happy with, but I also thought he would cover them even when I wasn’t with him. I ran into him in between our classes and I saw him not trying to cover them at all. I got super upset and told him I won’t give them to him if he won’t cover them, but he thinks I’m being ridiculous. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I would like to start out by saying that this is all happening in a friend group I've known in high school, so we would be alumni. About a year and a half ago I've started becoming with them since they were doing some (messed up) film project and needed actors so I was down to help. Then we all started hanging out more often. One thing we all notice is that the director guy, Bob, who has been in a relationship with Alice for two years at the time, get in to some pretty toxic arguments. By consensus we all agree that it's not good for them and they need a break from each other at times. However, they seem normal half of the time so it's like \"oh, okay I guess they're civil now.\". Contrary to this, these arguments, most particularly started by Bob, still continue.\n\nOne night, the couple, a bunch of friends and I are at Dan's house and we all had a lot of alcohol to drink. I definitely had a lot to drink if I busted my shit on a treadmill that was hardly running, so I just proceed to lay down on this single chair couch thing. Suddenly, the lights go out and I'm confused as to what's happening. Apparently some people had to go home leaving my very drunk self passed out on couch and Alice, who is probably equally drunk. I wake up briefly remembering her walking over to me and I'm saying \"oh no, no no no no no\" because I know what was about to happen. She sits on me and I'm trying to get comfy but it's not working. I felt my arms getting grabbed and dragged to her body and that's the last thing I remember. I wake up to her sitting on me, with lipstick smeared on my face as  I checked the mirrir in restroom, looked at my watch - 5am. Holy fuck whatever happened, happened throughout the whole night and I don't remember it not was I asking for it. She's a cheater! This relationship just seems like it's in shambles and I sense that they should be apart. Clearly this bimbo has no interest in Bob. I didn't know what to think at the time, Alice says don't tell anyone because she regrets that, so I didn't, until I got confronted about it with Bob. \n\nI used all my power to explain what realistically happened from my perspective because it seems that Dan saw what happened that night, but added his own exaggerated twist on it and I'm facing heavy backlash from friends. I'm sitting here, like what the fuck, confused as to why I'm the one getting the blame here, after all I explicitly didn't provoke that and I don't even remember 80% of that night. I've never been in relationships so I wouldn't know what, but I could have told him, but I'm under the impression that I'd get beat up, the last thing I'd want. That ended their relationship, temporarily, and I realized and I guess that contributes to me being an ass as a given.\n\nLong story short, both Alice and Bob had it going on-and-off which caused a lot of unwanted drama within group, until eventually everyone all hates me for what happened and Alice and Bob split afterwards.\n\nWas I just being fucked with, or am I an ass?\n ",

      "description": "I recently had a dispute with a friend that centered on my unwillingness to ask to speak to the manager of a customer service rep for an online retailer. I had expressed that the customer service rep was rude, but that I did not have time to go through the whole shebang of speaking to a manager. I said that I was angry in the moment, but the anger passed in a few minutes, so it was not a big deal.\n\nNow, I can see that some may say it's better for me to speak to the manager for personal preference, whatever.\n\nMy friend's point was that I have some moral obligation to speak to the manager, as each time somebody does so they push the quality of customer service in the positive direction. According to her, by my reasoning that I do not have time to go through that process, I am saying bluntly that I do not have time to make the world a better place, and that I value my own time above her time and everyone else's time. She cited a few examples of instances in which she spoke to a manager or complained about some institution's behaviors and was able to affect positive change as evidence of the effectiveness of this approach. I mentioned that I almost never speak to the manager in circumstances where service is poor. I was only able to think of two or three times in which I have spoken to a manager. She seems to think that my reticence in this regard makes me an asshole.\n\nObviously, I think this line of reasoning is comical at best, but I am curious to hear other's thoughts.

      "description": "Posting from a throwaway because my safety is potentially at risk here. For some background, I am a college student and took a part time administrator job for what could be called a half way house for ex-convicts. It's an easy job, good hours and I really don't have to do much. The owner of the house has a contract with the state government to provide a place to live, life skills and transportation to and from work for the residents. The owner is an absolute piece of shit (if you've ever seen the movie Heat, he is exactly like the diner owner, though I've never seen him extort money, I wouldn't be surprised at all) and he seems to live to bust these dudes, most of whom genuinely are trying to get strait. The owner has a strict rule that we are to report any resident violations or we will be fired on the spot. \n\nWe had a resident that I'll call Carl. Carl absolutely busts his ass trying to stay out of prison. I really like the guy and he's one of the funniest and friendliest guys I've ever met. I usually don't try to get into resident business, especially their convictions because I want to see them as people rather than convicts. \n\nThis is where shit went down earlier this week. The owner claims that his van broke down and couldn't provide transportation to pick Carl up from work. I personally think it's absolute bullshit because I heard him in his residence (a guest house out back) screaming at his girlfriend and I think he just didn't want to back off from the fight. Whatever, I guess the van could have been broken down. I called Carl and told him about the, Carl said it was no problem he'd get a ride or walk home. One of Carl's terms of release was that he can't be within a certain distance of bars and dedicated liquor stores (I think it's 200 yards, but not sure). Carl was super late getting home and was about to bust his curfew so the owner asked me to see if I could find Carl. I drove around and sure enough Carl was standing right next to a bar. I don't know if he'd been drinking or not, I assume no because he's pretty committed to his sobriety. Carl acted like he didn't see me in my car but I know he did and when I went to turn around he must have bolted. I know he sprinted home because he actually beat me home but was crazy out of breath. \n\nI tossed and turned all night about what to do but in the morning, I told the owner. Owner reported the violation and apparently Carl was taken out of his work for processing on a violation. I don't know exactly but he's at least going back for his original time. He's going to miss the summer he had planned with his young kids, he's back inside and all this when he was working so hard. I feel like fucking shit. Like absolute shit. \n\nI know how I feel, but am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "24M and 25F, we live together.  She can drive but it gives her anxiety to drive in the city so the only place she ever drives herself to work. I drive us everywhere we need to go, sometimes I'll drop her off at work if I need to use the car (it's my car) and I drive her around town occasionally if she needs to be somewhere and I'm not busy.  \n\nThe problem is that whenever she gets out of the car, she walks around *in front* of the car, so I can't start driving away until she's gone past.  If she were to go around back, I could start driving away the second she gets out.  I mentioned this to her once and she acknowledged it but didn't change her behavior.  I mentioned it a second time and she seemed annoyed at me for suggesting it. \n\nI'm taking time out of my day and I'm usually the one who fills up the tank. It seems like a small accommodation to make to stop inconveniencing me when I'm basically a free chauffeur for her.\n\nSo here's where this became a big problem.  After dropping her off today, she walked around the front of the car, as usual.  I started going forward and revved the engine to pretend to hit her (I wouldn't have actually done it obviously).  I thought she would get the message that it was a reminder for her to go around back, but instead she freaked out on me and said I could've seriously hurt her.  I tried explaining my side of things how I want her to go around back, but she won't listen.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hey there! Just as a disclaimer, I come from Sweden, so English is not actually my first language. So I deeply apologize for any mistakes I make in my grammar. Oh, and first post. Wooo...\n\nCharacters in this ”thing”\n\nMe: as i´m writing this, I am currently 13 years old. I am male, but despite that, I have quote the feminine appearance, long, brown, very curly hair (it actually has natural dreadlocks, its pretty cool, i get compliments about it a lot ☺️). I am also really short, around 150-153 cm. My voice is also very high-pitched, and so i often get confused as a girl. Like a lot. Seriously, my friends are just calling me a trap at this point since i look like a girl, and it doesn’t help that i have kind of a baby-face, so i now look like a loli-trap, which is just not that fun to be honest... (i have a couple of stories about that, but that is just not what we are here for, is it!?) \nForgot to mention but i... uh... have...a...big butt... Yeah.... its quite big... (it comes up later, ok?)\n \n\nRobin (fake name): Now, Robin is a kind of bully. He is one year older than me, and he is pretty tall and muscular. But he does insult me, but at the same time look at me with a sort of hunger in his eyes, and I don’t know why........\n\n\nOk, so here is the actual things that happen\n\n\nNow, Robin, as i said, insults people, including me, but he looks at me weird... he just comes up to me and starts talking, only to run off in a sulk as he comes to the sudden realization that he has no real subject to speak to me about, seeing as i like to spend time alone, reading a book, drawing or listening to music. I’m a shy person, and i dislike most interactions, so it gets kinda awkward with all of the things he says.\nOne time, i was walking past his locker when i saw pictures of boobs and dicks inside, and that led me to believe that he is bisexual, nothing wrong with that, but I’m straight, and i think he is hitting on me, which i dislike. \n\nBut one time, he went a bit to far. I was standing and talking to some friends, i think we talked about chemistry or some other stuff, but this man just comes running up behind me and slaps my ass. But not just a simple slap, oh no! He squished it hard, and then ran off. \nWhen i later confronted hm about this, he just shrugged and said that he liked ho it jiggled, and how big it was, that he just had to feel it...\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for rejecting him? Again, I’m straight, and I don’t know if i am or not the asshole for doing this to him, as recentas I’ve started to talk back when he insults me, and he just walks away like a wounded animal when that happens...\n\nSo feel free to cast your judgement upon me, and i shall know wether or not i am, a asshole!",

      "description": "I am 20F. My friend (20M) and I have known eachother for just over 2 years. We met in 2017 at university, studying the same degree. \n\nWe've been basically best friends since then and spoke in person every day on campus and occasionally over the phone. However, I stopped studying at the end of last year and we've spoken only a handful of times since then.\n\nAnyway so about 2 weeks ago I sent him a message saying that I'd like to talk about the state of our friendship because it feels like no one from campus (especially him) makes it seem like they still want me in their lives and it feels pretty shitty. His response was that 'well that's expected' since I'm not on campus anymore. I responded by saying that since we don't see each other at all I expected him to be more responsive over text. \n\nI still haven't gotten a response from him and am wondering if I should just move on from this friendship, even though he means a lot to me. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to just end our friendship ?",

      "description": "If this sounds absurd, it's because (imo) it is. But here we are. \n\nLast night it was a sort of traditional movie night at my friend's apartment. The place is packed and I've got a spot on one of the good chairs, and rather than sit on the floor a female friend of mine (let's say \"Riva\") comes over and sits in my lap. I'm a little surprised because we've not really been *that* cozy together before, but it's she's obviously comfortable, so I roll with it (and also it sort of plays into my suspicions that she's sweet on me). Initially I sort of put my hands behind my head behind my head, but after like ten minutes it feels a bit awkward (like, you know, weird lap-dance posture) so I then put my arms around her waist. They remain there for the duration of the film - with some occasional shifting by both of us, obviously - and she never seems weirded out by it. And, unsurprisingly I'm also enjoying it, because I feel there's some chemistry between us. But it's not more than what one might describe as cuddling. \n\nSo anyway, movie ends, everybody goes home. All cool. And then I get the fateful text from another friend of ours: \"You made Riva really uncomfortable last night.\" \n\nOk, so that's baffling. I text Riva to meet up and have a chat, and she echoes the sentiment, saying that I sort of crossed a line with the snuggling. Like, holding onto her was a no-go (though she doesn't allege I copped a feel or something). I immediately apologized. \n\nBut here's the thing... *I don't actually think I did anything wrong.* Maybe I'm an asshole for it, and I'm not about to make a big deal about it, but it's true. What really might tip me over the line is I'm doing this thing that's kind of blaming her - meaning I think she should have told me if she was uncomfortable at the time, or hinted at it with body language, or not sat in my lap in the first place. So I'm a little indignant. But I dunno. What do you think? AITA?",

At the start we weren’t very close but we texted and went to parties/just hang out a lot.\n\nI don’t want to make him uncomfortable with unwanted advances, since he’s straight and I’m bi so I’m not overly touchy.\n\nHe also has another close friend (lets call him J) who he hangs out with a lot and invites to hang out with us too.\n\nMy issue begins with this:\nI basically only said a comment that was like ,,J you can really tell a difference from you working out... you look good man“ It wasn‘t even sexual, just a compliment.\nWell it was at a party with J, S and me in the room and S reacted badly to me complimenting J. He started jokingly saying „wow you never  compliment me like that“. We all just brushed it off but he kept making remarks like that through completely unrelated conversations.\n\nI wanted to go home early but J and S wanted to stay but in the end S decided to walk me home since he was „pretty tired“ anyway. \nWe walked home and.... somewhere he started talking about what guys I find attractive. I told him that I have no specific check list just someone handsome.\n\nThen (you guessed it) he asked me if I was attracted to him. I just  said “no dude” and tried to laugh it off. \n\nHe started getting really mad, saying that he knows me way longer than J knows me and we are closer and he kept asking me if he was really ugly to me. I told him he’s not ugly but not for me and he responded with listing Js flaws and asking how I can think he’s attractive and not him. It was really dramatic and long story short: I ended up walking home alone.\n\nNow I’m wondering if I should apologize or do something else...\nAlso, why did he react like that?",

      "description": "Might be a long post, on mobile and somewhat emotional, so bare with me.\n\nMe and my brother are fraternal twins. I am a woman and he is a male. Not long after we were born, our biological father bailed. My 20-year old homeless mother was left with two infant children. My grandfather (bio dad’s dad) housed us until my mom met my stepdad (SD) and married him. Grandpa was upset because my parents hadn’t been divorced that long before she left with us to another state. All the while, my mother never kept us from our dad. We were around 2 at the time when my mom remarried so to me SD is my dad. Both my SD and dad were active duty military so they both traveled a lot. Dad was cool with my mom having us all year as long as he got us in the summer. Those summers never came and communication with him was cut off. He entered our lives again as teenagers. Me and my brother went to visit him for the first time at 15 and my brother decided he was going to live with dad. Fast forward 3 months, my grandpa tells my mom about my dad’s meth habit. My mom confront my uncle (dads little brother) who they lived with and he said it was none of his business and she asked, “what if it was your kid?” So my brother get brought back to our state. \n\nAlmost 15 years later, my brother is getting married in like 10 days When I got married I invited my whole family on that side, including my dad but informed him he would not be walking me down the aisle as my SD has been the one raising me. He didn’t show which I expected. Today spent the night talking to my grandfather who was diagnosed with end stage heart failure. He was shocked I hadn’t know since our dad and told my brother months ago. He then mentioned the wedding, and how due to his health condition he couldn’t travel. He then said my dad would be attending. \n\nI found out a lot recently involving my brother and dad. Short summary: our bio-dad is a multimillionaire due to something the military caused (he was vague about this). \n\nMy mom told me he had been going and talking to our dad which i don’t care honestly. It was when I was informed by his future wife that our dad told my brother that whoever attends his funeral out of the two of us gets the money. I don’t care about the money because I’m still not attending his funeral. What I’m mad about is the secrecy from my brother on every level, including my grandpas illness. So would I be the asshole to let my mom and SD (who paid for the wedding) know that my brother invited our biological father? I let them know when i got\nMarried about inviting him, but he never showed and they seemed happier he didn’t. ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting help?",
      "description": "Tl;dr at bottom\n\nI have a particular coworker, let’s call “Sweet But Annoying” (SBA), that I can’t stand when they ask if I need help. It’s not that I think I never need help or that I have never needed help before, but for some reason SBA grinds my gears when they offer.\n\nTo offer a little back story, I have been at my current job for a few years and am well adjusted in my position. I worked elsewhere previously for a few years in a different specialty, so I was not new to the profession. I have a solid understanding of my work, and am 99% independent in everything I do. I don’t know everything, nor do I claim to, but in situations where I genuinely need guidance in a specific scenario, I wouldn’t ask SBA. \n\nSBA has worked at my place of work approximately 6 months longer than I have, so not much more experience than myself. However, I would estimate I have more experience as my previous job was built upon by this one, as they are different specialties but very closely related, whereas SBA’s previous experience was no where close to this. \n\nRegardless of our past experiences, I have been given much tougher assignment in our current workplace. I have more experience and poise with the various equipment we use and the people we serve. My critical thinking and knowledge base, in my opinion, is at a higher level than SBA’s. This isn’t a pissing match in who has more experience, but this will relate later on.\n\nMy job is very time oriented but it is a speciality where you normally aren’t running around in order to get everything done. So if you have good time management, everything falls into place as you work, leaving you comfortably independent throughout the day. You don’t usually require help unless something off the cuff happens, in which case there are several people available to help, and you don’t need to ask.\n\nMy specific complaint is this. In most cases, I will need a second person to verify something, per our policy. So I will ask SBA to verify, as a second person and myself have to sign as we both verified the information is correct. That’s it. That’s all I will have asked for, and then I will continue my work. SBA seems to linger many times once whatever is verified, and watch me continue working. SBA then, in the sweetest voice they could muster asks if I need any help. As if they are talking to a child or someone that just isn’t up to their standards, and obviously needs SBA’s god given gift to help the less fortunate.\n\nI quickly say nope, as I have no need of their help, and SBA gives a facial expression as if I’m just lying about needing their help, as to not bother them and asks, “Are you sure?” \n\nTo get my point across, I look up and smile, raise my eyebrows and look around the room and shake my head while saying no again. As if to signal that wtf else do you think I need help with?! I’m clearly working on whatever I’m doing, I called you in here for a specific reason in which I’m required to do, and you have fulfilled that request. I don’t need your help for anything else.\n\nNormally this would be fine, (especially if SBA lost the little kid voice) but even after two no’s, SBA continues to linger like they still don’t believe me, and then eventually laughs and leaves. I kind of want to say “You can leave now” although I know that saying it would be rude, it would get my point across...\n\nTo circle back to the experience bit, I am calm and collected in situations, and I let my knowledge and experience guide me. I do have some internal anxious but I don’t full on freak out if something unfortunate happens, rather I move to find a solution to fix it. SBA gets their feathers ruffled at the slightest sign something is going haywire. I’m talking, shaky hands, whimpering voice, calling everyone in to help, running to do anything, complete blackout flight or fight response. This happens even when a minimal situation occurs, as I have seen first hand.\n\nI’m not bothered by SBA for how they act, that’s not my beef and I help when needed. But when I am needing to calm SBA down on something not a big deal, and help correct such small situations before a full blown meltdown occurs, I would expect to not be treated in an holier than thou attitude.\n\nI could run circles around SBA if I wanted to, so the constant asking if I needing help as if SBA is my parent, and myself a wee baby needing help, bugs me. I would expect that treatment to a new person, but if SBA is really thinking I need their help, solely because they have been there longer, they aren’t paying attention.\n\nI am normally a very happy person, willing to chat with just about anyone, but because of this, I have found myself to become off-put by SBA and seemingly unwilling to want to have a conversation. I am not myself when talking to SBA, usually very short responses and not much else. Any interaction bugs me now, and I feel there is some fakery thrown in there. I’m not sure SBA realizes, but AITA?\n\nMost this sounds very petty reading through it, but it is kind of insulting, and even though I feel I am “better at my job” than SBA, I never treated them any differently. I actually am usually the first to help when asked, with no qualms about what had been done. I stick together with my coworkers and look out for them when they make a mistake. I don’t run to management about everything, like some do, but rather ask that person about it and the horrified look usually tells me that they will pay better attention next time, without the needed berating from the higher ups.\n\nI don’t even really care if you reply, this is more of a vent post, because I have been relieved of my subconscious thoughts many times after just venting. Reddit is a great resource to just get it all out. AITA because I don’t know SBA’s side, obviously, but yet I have chosen to treat them differently in personal ways (not professional).\n\nTl;dr Coworker insists on helping, not a wee baby, can do it myself, can run circles around coworker, wants coworker to go away, now constantly annoyed by coworker AITA?",

We are in a long distance relationship. While we were texting the other day, the subject of race came up, and I jokingly said that he had white privilege (which I do believe to be true). He then responded by saying that I was “white shaming” him. \n\nI explained to him that by being white, he does have privilege even though he can’t see it. Some real life examples would strangers greeting him and not me when we are together. However, he retaliated by saying that I was being racist to him and I was being unfair because I was “hating on him” over something he can’t control (being white). He also said that white privilege doesn’t exist because every race has privileges, like Asians being smart and and black people running faster. He said he shouldn’t be blamed just because his ancestors did something wrong. \n\nAt this point I was furious and I realised I wouldn’t be able to change his mind, so I just ended the conversation there. \n\nThe next day he asked me if I knew why I was wrong and why he was mad about the conversation. I just ignored him because I don’t think my own mindset is wrong. However since he is so upset I don’t really know. Was I being an asshole by stating he has white privilege and insisting on it? Note that he has never been racist to anyone, and has always treated me like an equal. ",

      "description": "Relevant to this situation is that my (26M) girlfriend (21F) has a severe heart condition, underwent two heart surgeries, is on several medication for it and has to be very careful about not getting stressed and/or scared due to how frequent her afib attacks are.\n\nMy best friend (22M) is aware of this and has known her for the duration of our relationship (2 years) and known me for 4 years. \n\nRecently he has been in a good mood and I guess became energetic, and started jump scaring my girlfriend at random times during the discord calls by making loud sounds very close to the microphone or shouting down the microphone when entering the chat. Perhaps he found that funny.\n\nIn fact, a few days ago as he entered the chat he screamed down the microphone and it gave her chest pains. She didn't want to say anything because she didn't want to be rude and asked me what to do about it as it became more repetitive as the days went on until one time he did it when I was in the call.\n\nI politely asked him to stop but he proceeded to do it again twice after that - each time I asked him to stop. I left the call after the last time and told him I won't be coming back until he stops this as it very disrespectful to her and dangerous.\n\nShe didn't want to start an argument and said that she can deal with it but I didn't think she should. \n\nHe then sent me a half assed apology and once again I said that as long as he didn't do it again we were fine. He made a sarcastic remark to which I told him he cannot see that he is in the wrong and is making us both uncomfortable with his actions.\n\nHe constantly kept dismissing me and later resorted to personal insults and gas-lighting me saying that I'm causing issues on his birthday (which it is, but that doesn't give him the right to disrespect my girlfriend) until I snapped, blocked him and told him to fuck off.\n\nMy girlfriend got a message from him asking her why I was overreacting about this. AITA in this situation? Did I overreact?\n\nTL;DR\nMy best friend kept jump scaring my girlfriend knowing she had a heart condition and then when confronted about it became confrontational, gas-lighted and insulted me until I snapped, told him to fuck off and blocked him.",

      "description": "Bit of a backstory, I am adopted. My adopted parents are amazing and I have been their kid all my life. I’ve never known another family. I do have contact with my bio mom, but don’t talk to her for various reasons.  My parents also have 4 bio children (my brothers and sisters) who are younger than me. \n\nSo my grandparents were over a couple of weeks ago, they are your usual conservative rednecks. The visit was fine until I got up one morning. I went to the kitchen to make myself some breakfast before heading to\nSchool (I am a university student). My grandparents were in the kitchen. We said good morning to each other, I asked if they wanted anything to eat. They decline. Normal boring morning. \n\nThen my grandma asks “so how’s your real mom doing” \n\nI am confused at the question, and tell them that she should be home soon, you can ask her then. My grandma corrects herself “no your real mum, the one who gave birth to you” \n\n“You mean my bio mother” \n\nMy grandma nods.\n\n“Well I don’t talk to her so I don’t know. And for the record she isn’t my real mum, your daughter is” \n\nThe two don’t apologize for the mistake and try to brush it off as them being old (my grandpa is only in his early 70’s, not that old in his family)\n\nNormally I would chalk this up to them being old and not up with the times but my grandpa has a sister who adopted 2 kids in the early 70’s. he and my grandma are well aware about adoption and terminology and all that Jazz. \n\nAnd I have always suspected that they don’t see my as one of the grandkids. I was venting to a friend about this and they said I should just let it go and not be mad at my grandparents. \n\nOf course I will always love them, but I feel I have a right to me mad at this. I’m nearly 19. I have tried to talk to them and they just change the subject instead. \n\nSo AITA? Should I just try and let it go? \n\n",

Most of the people there I did not know, but they were pretty nice. I noticed a girl who seemed interested in me and I started talking to her for a while.

The girl and I agreed on meeting the saturday (5th january). \n\nNoone said anything about it that night and noone complained.\n\nThe next day however, the girl texted me that she cannot meet me on saturday, because her best friend and my ex-girlfriend complained about us kissing on the party. She said, that they don't want that we (the girl and I) see us again.\n\nThe girl said that she would talk to her best friend on the weekend about it.\n\nPS: Sorry for any language-mistakes\n\n",

      "title": "AITA For refusing any contact with my ex after we broke up?",
      "description": "The TDLR will be at the end but to make the long story short and just get some clarification, i need to know if i was the asshole after my ex and i broke up. \n\nWe began dating in July of last year. This isn't the first time we dated and the only difference between then and now is that i've cut him from my life. Back in 2013 when we first dated we broke up because my best friend sat down with me one night and told me how he flirted with her and our other friend and she showed me messages of him hitting her up at 2 am asking if she wanted to come over for a bit. I took it immediately as a sign he was cheating on me and broke up with him. We still talked occasionally but i didn't physically started hanging out with him again until June of last year. \n\nNow, as you can see, some years passed and it was good to see him again because before hand he was a good friend of mine. We hit it off immediately and we decided to try and date again. My idea was that he seemed more mature now and maybe, just maybe, he had changed. I was so wrong. \n\nTo make another long story short, my brother and his wife lost their home in August so they had moved in with me for a while. At the same time my mom's house was condemned and her and my older sister needed a place to stay. My boyfriend was angry because i had to share my room with my sister so they could all work out how to fix their lives again. Since we only ever hung out at my place because his house was basically a bachelor pad. He shared a home with his buddies so he didn't like how they would make weird noises if i ever came over. When my family moved in he felt weird being over there with me when my sister was a bed over so he got mad at me for letting them \"ruin our relationship\". I told him it would only be for a little bit because they are my family and i was in a position to help them and it really wasn't a big deal. \n\nSkipping ahead, we still went on dates very rarely and i learned from my best friend (who we will call S) that my boyfriend was seen out with some new girl. My thoughts immediately went to \"he's cheating on me again\". Skip ahead, after November he refused to come to my house or meet up somewhere like the coffee shop. He said he wanted to have a private discussion to talk. No hiding or whatever. i told him that if he wanted that it would take a while because of him refusing to come to my house and him refusing to let me come to his and meet up somewhere. i tried for the month of November to January to meet up and he kept refusing, saying that it needed to be a private 1 on 1. \n\nFinally in the beginning of February we got his 1 on 1. he basically wanted to cry like a little girl, saying he was seeing the new girl behind my back and that he started talking to her in August and he really liked her. He said he wanted this to be personal and for me to know it wasn't me but him and i shook my head and told him that if he wanted to break up then he shouldn't have wasted my time with his bs for the amount of time he did. He then told me that he had been meaning to break up with me since August and that hurt a lot. I knew it was bad in November because of his sudden attitude change but since August? that was shocking to me. \n\nBefore he left i said i didn't want to talk to him for a bit, that i needed time to think and process on what he did. He agreed and tried to hug me, saying we could still be friends, but i kept distance and said no. The time i put off, from Feb to June, was to think over the past experience of 2013 and what happened this time. This whole thinking i was doing was to decide if i even wanted to be his friend anymore. did i want to be friends with a cheater? When i know that whoever he's with could end up getting hurt by him because he had an inability to stay true to his partner? \n\nTo help make up my mind, i went to meet his new girlfriend. i didn't know her well but i had no grudge against her. She didn't know he was with me and, according to her and what she told me, when she met him he said he was single. What helped me make up my mind is that she told me she was excited to start looking at things for their anniversary. This perked my attention and i asked her when that was. She laughed and said December 10th. I forced a smile and laughed with her and thanked her for her time.\n\nThen i went home and did a lot of things. Some emotional but the bottom line was that i blocked him on all social media, deleted our conversations, and blocked his number from my phone. i sent a message to our friends in common that i was no longer on talking terms with him and if we decided to meet up and hang out he wasn't invited. \n\nThe only thing i forgot was that we were friends on Xbox too. a few days later when i got on i remembered he was my friend on there because i had a really long message from him. i didn't even read it, except the first sentence. That was because i was kinda forced to in order to open the message to delete it and block his profile on xbox. I won't bother you guys with that but it made me laugh. \n\nNow more time has passed and things are obviously changing. I have been in no contact with him since my decision to block him but his girlfriend (who is now his ex according to our common friends. i told them i didn't want to know but you know and i know they will tell me everything... bastards lol) is wanting to be friends because she said she didn't know he was still with me. I was told by our friends that i was being rude by not talking to him and straining our friendship group by making them chose between us. i just shrug and say if they want to hang out with him they can go ahead. I'm comfortable being by myself and hanging out by myself. Am i an asshole for cutting him off and supposedly straining our friendship group by making them chose between us? i don't care if they want to hang out with him instead of me. they weren't my only friends and i am comfortable enough to hang out by myself. They just keep telling me that if i just talked with them around him and accepted his presence then we could all hang out without any problems and they wouldn't have to decide who they want to hang out with on the weekends. \n\nTDLR: My ex boyfriend cheated on me not even 2 months into our relationship so i decided to block him on everything. Our common friends are upset because i'm \"forcing\" them to chose between him and me. Am i the asshole for blocking him and \"forcing\" them to chose sides? cause i'm not really. if they want to hang out with him, i'm cool with it. I've told this to them time and time again but they are adamant that i'm \"forcing\" them to chose. ",

We still talk casually often and I love her to death but I have this problem. Every time I vent to her she mocks me saying why I’m being such a baby and such. She has vented to me multiple times I still talk to her normally frequently and I am always open when she vents. I don’t talk to her just to vent but I do want to vent to her sometimes as she is my best friend. She says that I can’t start venting to her out of nowhere and then gets mad when I want to. I talk with her frequently but if I ever wanna just vent seemingly out of nowhere she mocks me. Am I the asshole for venting to her without sparking conversation first even though she’s my best friend. ",

      "description": "Preemptive sorry for formatting on mobile.\n\nSo, my ex and I we will call her C, are best friends, our relationship ended surprisingly well for what happend. She left me while we were trying to have a child, for her ex now turned new bf. She had been visiting her mother out east and ran into him at random while out on the town (I can confirm this is the case) and realized she was still quite in love with him. She came home early from her trip and told me about everything and we broke it off.\n\nThey started dating again but were at this point an LDR, after a while he comes into our city to see her, and she really wanted him to stay with us. Problem is we live in a one bedroom apartment as no others have come available in our building, and we share the one bedroom between us (I work graveyards so I sleep during the day and she sleeps at night so we essentially take shifts.). \n\nI said no, citing that we may have stayed amicable and she was in fact still my best friend but I did not want them sleeping (and very obviously having sex) in the bed I have to sleep in. She got quite angry and we had a big fight about it, she was convinced I was just being petty about us having split up and that for them to Tay at a motel (or rather for him to) would be really expensive and something her new bf had not taken into account for his finances.\n\nNeither myself nor C make a lot of money and I definitely felt for her but I just didn't want to have to sleep in that kind of situation.\n\nAITA for not allowing my best friend and yet ex gf  to have her new be sleep at our place?

(this all happend in a week) after school i was thinking a lot about breaking up. we were gonna meet on Saturday but she told me she couldn't go bc here mom said she had to look after her lil brother but her mom was also home? sounded like an excuse to me. i skiped her for a bit saying that i had to do a group project and that it was a lot of work and that that was the reason i was online. i was just thinking of breaking up. and i did. i told her that she was cool and nice but that i wasn't ready for a girlfriend. i told her that it was not her but me (really clicé i know) and that i was sorry. she was super mad and i understand her but she then blocked me. i understand her side too but it was all going was to fast for me. this wasn't love to me. i told my friends. some where a bit mad some understanded me. i told everything. they support me. i took a long shower thinking about it and then went on my laptop to type it all out on here. what do you guys think? i have screens but they are in dutch. thank you for listening",

      "description": "Since this is a throwaway, names &amp; details might be a *little* different (I know one of these guys uses reddit, not sure about this sub).\n\nAnyways, myself and three friends (18/19-yo) took a road trip up north to a city roughly an hour and a half away, complete with a two-night hotel booking so we wouldn't have to drive back and forth every day. Here's the thing: We're traveling in a country where a lot of people my age don't have a license, so *I'm the only one who's driving the rest.*\n\nThere was an athletic event taking place over the weekend, which the four of us all attended for the last two nights. On the second night, the event didn't really finish until midnight, so we all agreed afterwards to grab some McDonald's on the way back to the hotel. \n\nOne of the guys I was traveling with--we'll call him Jose--a massive hispanic dude (probably 6'3\") who ate enough burgers and fries to completely obliterate any bathroom he touched afterwards. Well, as it turns out, that's exactly what happened next.\n\n\nWe all got back to the hotel room and Jose immediately tells the rest of us that he's taking a shit in our hotel room's bathroom. The problem is, the ventilation in the bathroom was fucking atrocious (it took hours to air out the first time Jose shit in there) and I knew that myself &amp; the other two guys weren't gonna be able to shower before we all rolled out the next morning.\n\n\nSo, I did what any sane, rational person would do and politely asked him to take the room key and use the hotel lobby's bathroom instead.\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\nJose was hell-bent on using the bathroom, and it started to piss me off because I knew I wasn't gonna be feeling great on the drive back the next morning. I made a snarky remark as he was entering the bathroom. It was nothing offensive, as I just referred to him as another person's name (in reference to a friend of mine that I argued with in a hotel room last year). \n\n\nSo, after hearing that, Jose storms across the room and squares up, standing chest-to-face with me and telling me to \"say it again.\" \n\nI shook my head trying not to laugh, and he proceeded to grab me by the neck and toss me a few feet backwards.\n\n\nIt totally caught me off guard as I never expected Jose to get violent like that, and the other two guys just sat there speechless.\n\n\nI grabbed all my shit when Jose was finally in the bathroom, told the other two guys I didn't feel safe sleeping in the room anymore, and left the hotel to drive home at three in the morning. They had access to taxis and a train going back to where we lived, so I ignored their pleas for me to come back. I turned my phone off and drove home while listening to a podcast to cool down.\n\n\nAITA for leaving them all behind?\n\n\nTLDR; was traveling with three other guys and got grabbed by the neck, tossed across the room by one of them, drove a few hundred km home and stranded them in a different city at 3am",

Before we moved in we agreed that she would do all of the cooking/cleaning and taking care of my place since she doesn't work and is trying to get an online business started from home. Because she isn't bringing in an income I agreed to pay the entire rent while she gets her business up and running. She thought this was a good idea and agreed to do all the cooking, and cleaning. I don't really eat breakfast, so I usually just get coffee or some fruit but she did pack me a lunch daily and had dinner ready when I got home at around 6ish. We'd usually eat out like once or twice a week so she's not cooking every single day, but most I guess. \n\nAbout 3 weeks ago she said she didn't want to cook anymore and said I was treating her like a slave making her cook and clean all day. I just said well you live here rent free and you only clean maybe once a week and cooking doesn't take up all of your day and she got super mad and called me an asshole. She asked me to start cooking but I'm so tired/stressed from work I don't want to after and she's at home all day.\n\nAITA?",

Not cool in as \"neat\" and move on, but cool as they pretend to be bisexuals and take pride in announcing it multiple times a day. They wear gay pride shirts and all that too, but very obnoxiously. And the thing is I wouldn't care that much if not for them milking it for popularity. But this experiance made me hate these kinds of individuals especially:\n\nSo I take the bus home from school and there's these 2 girls (one 7th and one 8th) that say there bi or lesbian very often. Whenever they get in trouble they use their \"sexuality\" as an excuse. Even though I'm from Texas my school is VERY liberal. It usually works, too.\n\nSo one day I was on the bus and they were pretending to have sex. Making sounds and all that, climbing on top of each other in their seats. Then they started too reach under their shirts and it got worse and worse. (Thankfully none of them went nude.)\n\nThis made me very uncomfortable and I told them they were making people uncomfortable and to stop. The bus driver didn't do anything about in fear of getting reported by them.\n\nSo I was wondering, AITA?",

      "description": "Ok, AITA here?  \nBackground.  Together 20+ years.  Ex cheated and then ran off with the woman he cheated on with and left behind myself and two kids.  I’m over all this, but it’s not been an easy road. He pretty much abandoned the kids.  I’ve worked with them and tolerated a lot of shit from the two of them (passive aggressive bullshit, like notes pinned to their clothes telling me how to remove stains).  That’s annoying shit, but they are rude and aggressive towards me, undermine me, tell the kids lies about me etc etc. \nThe kids no longer see their dad, but he and his wife (stepmother) still think they can dictate terms re the kids.  (11 and 16). \n\nDad has spoken to eldest once since November.\nYoungest hasn’t heard from him in weeks.  They don’t care.  \nI’ve decided that it’s his job to fix his relationship with the kids, not my job anymore.  I realised that I’ve been trying to ‘fix’ things forever, and emotionally it’s bloidy draining, so I’ve decided to drop the rope as such, and leave them to it.   It my circus, not my monkeys.\n\nHere’s the situation. \nThey just had a micro premie baby.  We’re talking under 28 weeks.  He sent a message through to both kids.  They showed me.  One sent back a quick reply and hadn’t wanted to talk about it since.  The other didn’t reply at all.  Doesn’t care.  \n\nEx texted me.  It’s not going great with their new baby.  Whilst I’m sad for the baby, it’s not my job to relate information to the kids from him.  I understand it’s an emotional time for them both, but emotionally this is not my problem.\n\nOf course I’ll talk with my kiddos if they want to talk about it, but I feel like this info needs to come from him.  Not from me.  I need to stay well out of it for my own emotional well-being.  \n\nSo, am I the asshole here fir not wanting to be the one delivering ‘their’ sad news re a child that is naught to do with me?  ",

After maybe a month of him using it on and off I decided to try and go on it and he changed the password I asked what was the password and he told me. ( I forgot why he changed it) after maybe another month or so I’m playing with him and we are losing a few games and he’s not on the account rn so I tell him to wait a min I’m going to get my other account. The second i join the party back he starts freaking out and yells at me and eventually signs me out of the account. I start texting him trying to figure out what he’s so mad over and he’s telling me I’m fucked up for stealing his account. I tell him it was mine all along I just let him use it he was not happy about that and after a while of going back and forth he says something about deleting it. I go back on the account and the character is gone. He told me he was stopping me from stealing his stuff. He also told me that he wasn’t going to let me have what he worked for even though I was still going to let him use it. So I contact the support of the game and they put the guy back on the account. After I get it back I send him a picture of me getting it back. (I knew I was gonna make him mad) He was not happy at that calling me fucked up and telling me to kys and saying more toxic things. I haven’t talked to him since it’s been about a day.\n\n\n",

Also, this isn't nearly as drastic as some of the other things on this subreddit, so sorry if this doesn't belong here.\n\nMy (13m, turning 14) birthday is coming soon, and I've invited some friends to watch the movie Captain Marvel and maybe play Super Smash Bros Ultimate if there's time after. Coincidentally, my aunt wanted to spend that same weekend at my parents' house, and have her kids (13f and 10-11m) see that same movie with me. This aunt lives several hours away from us and we see each other only occasionally, and when we do meet, they usually end up talking to each other, leaving me to either stand next to them in awkward silence, sit with the adults which usually also ends with me being awkwardly silent, or start looking at my phone. So it's not like I'm that close to any of them. My mom explained the situation to my aunt, and offered for her kids to join my birthday party. Aunt specifically asked if I would be uncomfortable with this, and my mom, without consulting me first, says that it won't be a problem. I wouldn't have mind if it was just me and them, but I have other friends there already. I don't want to worry about entertaining them too, so AITA ",

      "description": "I am asking because I feel like an asshole but I am also standing by what happened, so if I am an asshole in this situation then that's ok. \n\nI work night shifts at a hotel so all my interactions with this man have been around 3 in the morning. The first night he came in looking for a room for him and his dog, I told him I couldn't help him because he had no money but gave him a number to call for victim services and vets canada that often pay for people to stay in situations like this. I also called him a cab that gives free rides after 2am. \n\nThe next day, I come into work and he is staying. He had called one of the numbers I gave him and vets canada was paying for his room. All good. 3am rolls around and he stumbles out of his room and starts yelling at me for not giving him a room last night and for calling him a cab. Apparently his dog attacked the cab driver and was taken from him, for which he blamed me. \n\nThe next 4 days he proceeded to harass every staff member. He yelled at everyone, would watch porn on the business center computers, he made the front desk staffs lives hell for those 4 days. He also got meals paid for by vets canada, so he got to eat at the buffet located in the hotel, but he would wear these oil covered gloves and touch all the food, literally running his hands through the rice, so the restaurant started to refuse to feed him. I still tried to help, I told the buffet to just pack up some food to go and it could be delivered to his room. \n\nWell, he eventually harassed vets canada so much that they called us and told us not to extend his stay. I thought that was the end of it. Until he came in 20 minutes ago asking to use our public washrooms. They are public washrooms, so anyone can technically use them but I told him no because I feared that if we continued to let him in the hotel, then we would never get rid of him and he would continue to harass everyone. So am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Hi! \n\nSo to start, the deed is done. My wedding was in May of last year and I stuck to my guns and did not invite my cousin, but my mom brought it up recently since we're coming up on our one year anniversary so I figured I'd ask; AITA?\n\nFor my wedding my husband and I decided to have a smaller (40 person) wedding located in the state we moved to rather than either of the states our families are from. I come from a really large family (5 aunts/uncles on my moms side and 3 uncles on my dad's, plus a shit load of cousins) so we had to be pretty selective about who we invited. We knew due to the location/timing a lot of both of our families wouldn't be able to attend, so we both created lists of definite yeses, nos, and maybes to determine who we could reasonably invite and not overload the house. I invited both of my mother's sisters (Sally and Kate) and a named plus one for each. I figured Sally and her +1 were not going to be able to attend, and we based our invitation and headcount on this assumption. \n\nBoth Sally and Kate attended my sister's wedding in 2015 but they traveled as a pair then. Unfortunately Sally has some pretty serious health issues and would be unable to travel for my wedding, and the same for Kate's long-term partner. Kate told all of this to my mother rather than me, and insisted that if she was going to come to the wedding I needed to invite her daughter Jan and Jan's two kids so that Kate wouldn't have to travel alone. \n\nFor a lot of reasons that I don't really feel the need to go into Jan and I do not get along. No one in my immediate family really likes Jan or being in her company, and none of us have met her children. Due to these reasons as well as the fact that we simply did not have room for two unexpected guests and that we didn't invite any of my other cousins I decided not to invite Jan and her kids to the wedding. I knew this meant Kate wouldn't attend, but I chalked that up to it being her choice to not want to travel solo.\n\nWell, this really pissed Kate, Jan, and my mom off. My mom pestered me for a month straight to just give in and invite Jan, but I wouldn't budge. Neither Kate nor Sally officially RSVP'd, and I haven't heard anything from either since - not even a congratulations. Jan posted some snarky stuff on facebook about knowing who your true family is as well. These actions kind of hurt me as these were my two favorite aunts and I had been close to them growing up, but my mom thinks it is a reasonable reaction for me being a jerk and not inviting them. So AITA here?",

      "description": "I (23M) have two younger brothers 20 and 21. I used to smoke pot with my brothers and at school. Quit completely, for health and career reasons. Nothing wrong with my health, just know smoking cant be good for you. However, we all used to hit vapes and I quit that too... for the most part. I'm a hypocrite because while I tell them I dont smoke anymore, I actually do hit vapes when I'm drinking. I drink most weekends. \nI tell them I dont smoke at all, becuase I'm their eldest and know they look at me to set an example. They might not say that to me, but from what my mother says and how they behave I know they do. Monkey see, monkey do. They smoke pot currently and I wish they would realize it's a waste of time and money. Not knocking anyone who does, especially for medicinal purposes. You do you. I just hold my brothers to higher standards because were very close and i want the best for them. However I know when you smoke pot you're not doing so as often with as much smoke and it's not physically addicting. However, I worry about vaping becuase I know it's something you experience withdrawals from because nicotine is physically addictive and smoking is just not healthy in any form. While I wish they wouldnt smoke pot, I know they could stop if they wanted to. However vaping is consuming an addictive substance through smoke, which is unhealthy mentally and physically to be dependent on and society, friend groups, etc. are pretty tolerant of vaping today. A safe alternative to cigarettes. I dont really think it's safe, but the verdict is out on that for the most part. \nAITA for lieing to my younger brothers that I dont vape at all in hopes to set a good example and steer them away from potential health risks and addiction. Again, I dont smoke pot but i do vape when I drink. Not often but I'm still a liar when I say I don't vape at all.",

So my friends (there are 3 of them) and I would always have problems when they wanted to hang out and I wanted to stay at home and watch wrestling. In fact, it happened so much that it seemed like they only wanted to hang out on days I had show (which was about one Sunday a month). \n\nOn one day they wanted to hang out and play Super Smash Bros. and I really wanted to do that, but I had a show.

So 2 comes and I want to leave, but my friends convince me to stay. I decide to because there really isn’t much on the pre-show. So 4 rolls around and I want to leave, but my friend goes on a complete rant about how I’d rather watch wrestling and not hang out with them and how it’s fake. So I awkwardly stick around for another hour. \n\nThat was that and we never really brought it up again and there was never another scheduling issue again. But, just a few days ago my friends wanted to hang out again, but as usual there was a show. It went better than last time because I actually had a bunch of homework to do before and after the show and one of my friends had homework to do as well.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "CONTEXT - I'm 15, my brother is 18. He drove us home from school. The garage door was closed and the alarm was on so my brother told me to enter from the back door to turn the alarm off and open the garage door so he could park. Now, our alarm is a little old, so for the key presses to be registered you have to press the buttons with a tiny bit of force, and my brother specified this. So, I entered the house and I had like 30 seconds or something to shut it down before it goes off and my parents were automatically called and told that there's been a break-in. Now here's where I'm a little foggy on the details: I entered the password with what I assumed was enough force, it didn't work. I did it again, this time I pressed the buttons harder, it didn't work. There were a few more failed attempts after that, so the alarm just went off. Now, in retrospect I think I pressed the button hard enough, either I didn't or my mother who set it up in the first place made some sort of mistake, but I'll never know for sure.\n\nSo I opened the garage so my brother would come in and try to set the damn thing off. He came in all confused, and I immediately apologised if I fucked up and told him I did exactly what he told me. He tried to enter the password a few times, and it didn't work for him either. He called me stupid and called up our parents to help him fix the issue, so he goes back into his car to talk without the ear-piercingly loud noise of the alarm system. He came back all pissed trying to fix it, and after a few attempts he made it stop, however our parents were still being called by the automated system. Apparently, in my panic while trying to enter the password for the millionth time, I accidentally reset the alarm so it would ring again, but for some reason it was silent (as I said, it's a little old). My brother was trying to fix it, while at the same time shouted at me, telling me that I should go cook (it was decided from before that I would make launch). After a few minutes I asked him if our parents are still being called, and he angrily said yes, and told me to shut up and cook. It eventually stopped though.\n\nAll throughout launch, he was pissed off and shouted at me like every 5 minutes. I told him that I did exactly what he said, and that I was sorry if I did make a mistake, but he just kept yelling at me and kept on telling me that I fucked up and that I'm stupid. He was mad about every single fucking thing I did:\n1) The food was raw (while I wasn't in the best state of mind at that time, I will admit it was my mistake) and I offered him my plate, in which the meat wasn't raw but he insisted that we should eat together (still yelling and in an overly angry tone, but I appreciate him wanting to do that). \n2) I asked him if he wanted me to give him some bread, and the only bread we had was for some reason in the freezer. He angrily muttered that I should put it back in the freezer, and I just didn't understand what he said since he muttered it, and he shouted that I should put it back, blaming me for not being able to hear him.\n3) He sluggishly and lousily said that he forgave me, but told me that I shouldn't fuck up like that again. But then he yelled at me, complainimg that I wasn't \"cheerful enough\" (as if he was through the fucking roof).\n\nWhat really infuriated me, is that he sluggishly (and still mad) asked me if I would be able to buy a snack from a kiosk close to us, or if I would fuck it up again. I, fed up, told him that I would make it, and he said that I would just fuck up (It was an expression that doesn't really have a direct translation in English, but it's a rude way of telling someone that they'll act incompetent when doing a task given to them). A minute after that I told him that I was going upstairs, and he angrily said that I'm going nowhere, and thay we were going to the kiosk. I said, infuriated, \"Oh, I thought that we've established that I'm  an idiot\", to which he responded \"Well that's because you are one\". He then said that he was going alone so we wouldn't have to lock the house up, and as he was getting ready to leave he said he's sorry, more sincerely this time but still pissed, and told me to stop fucking up. He was gone, meanwhile I was back home kicking and punching furniture as a form of releasing my anger, and also keep in mind that the whole time I was holding back tears because I was pretty much my brother's toilet paper for like 45 minutes straight for something that might not have even been an honest mistake.\n\nHe came back all chill and playful (his usual behaviour when we're together), as if none of this happened, which I can appreciate 100%, but I can't help still being mad, and I bet that he's still convinced I'm stupid, which is why I'm writing this.\n\nI know he still thinks so because he hasn't got the best of tempers, and whenever I make a mistake he just calls me stupid and incompetent, and in this case it went on for way too long. I fucking hate it that he thinks that, but there's nothing I can really do about it. I just wanted to ask you guys wether his forgiveness was enough or not.",

      "description": "I have a sister who is five years older. Our relationship has never been great. She thought her own poor life choices were a reason why I got further and not that I worked and got scholarships and good grades. \n\nIt became even worse a few years ago. She didn't even come to my wedding. She told us it was because her young kid was too little to make the drive(like less than 2 hours) and it couldn't work with their work schedules(over memorial day weekend). We later found out this was a total lie as they already had a vacation planned at Myrtle beach(8+ hours away). Too many other various other small things of her slighting my wife and I.\n\nThe tipping point where we cut contact was three years ago at Christmas we were trying to set a meetup for dinner. To set the stage we all live at various points in the state. We live at the very south part of the state. Sister lives kinda the middle, parents live NE. We recommenced meeting up in the very middle to save my parents, who would have to drive the  furthest, some time. My sister didn't want to do it. Basically said wants to meet up withing 20 minutes of her house tops. When we pushed back(we are driving over 2 hours as well, this would be making them drive only 45 minutes) they told my parents they would not be having dinner with them at all if we were there. That is when I cut contact with her on social media and have not talked to her directly since. That was over three years ago. \n\nI know it was over three years ago because sine that time I have had a second child. My sister has not once called to congratulate me, to ask how either of my kids are. To ask to have our kids meet(we live an hour away). Nothing. \n\nWith that setup out of the way. My sister apparently wanted to create a collage photo set of all my parents grand kids (I have a second much older half-sister as well). She sent me a out of the blue \"hey bud can you please send me an updated picture of your kids for a present for our parents\". I did not respond at all. Eventually my half-Sister contacted me and asked me what was up trying to guilt trip me. I told her that if my sister cared that much, she can come drive to our house and get the pictures herself. \n\nNeedless to say. She did not come and get them. The present apparently just had a duplicate picture of her kid in it.\n\nAITA?",

I said yes, and asked who it was.\n\n[Start]\n\nHer: \"[Her name]\nWho the hell would you think it is\nman? The Jerry Springer show?\"\n\nMe: \"Well, I wouldn't know.

Just isn't really a concern\nfor me at this time. Why do you\nask?\"\n\nHer: \"Just wondering. I've got a lot on\nmy plate is all. I'm fighting for\nsomeone in jail who's innocent by\nmyself. No evidence to convict\nthem, they took my phone, now\nthey're coming after me and it's\nsuch a mess. I actually had a\nfamily, they love me.

I quit high school\nbecause the AP's would stalk\nme, look at me sexually, and\nmake my life a living hell. So I'm\ntrying to finish it online.\"\n\n[End]\n\nNow... I found some of these messages.. weird. First off, she immediately asks me if I found a girlfriend. Not sure what that was about, but it just seems like a weird way to talk after just starting a conversation to me. Then when I dont respond for more than a few minutes, she sends another message. Then another. \n\nAnother thing, is about the whole \"fighting someone in jail\" bit. I know family issues happen, but I have a hard time believing this. Same thing with the \"dropping high school because of the AP staring at her inappropriately\" part. The AP at my high school is a female (last time I checked, anyways, I dont go there anymore), and there's only one AP. Then, some classes you have to take in person as they cannot be taken online.\n\nI asked a friend on discord what he thought about these messages, and he agreed with me that something didn't seem right. I discussed it with him for a bit, before coming to a conclusion to block her number and move on. She seemed to me like potential trouble from these messages, and I wanted no part in it.\n\nTL:DR\nEx girlfriend texts me, I find some of her messages to be off, and I block the number.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I are a lesbian couple and have talked about having children. I never really wanted a child but if it’s with my current girlfriend, I think I would be okay with just one. Of course having children is going to be way into the future as I’m not ready to have children yet. \n\nHowever, we were talking about this topic and we get to the point about Down Syndrome. I asked her, if the fetus had problems like Down Syndrome, what would you do?\n\nAt first she said she would abort it but then her view changed within 20 seconds and said she’d want to keep it. I told her that if the child cannot do anything by itself, lives in pain, and ultimately just doesn’t have good prospects for a suffering free life, I would like to abort it. \n\nI wouldn’t say this was a pro-choice/pro-life argument, but it seemed like she was super into pro-life as she said things like “who do you think you are to end a baby’s life” etc. \n\nI told her that’s fine if she wants to keep the baby, but I wouldn’t want my child to suffer if they were born with fatal diseases, no limbs, no mobility, etc. \n\nAnd before I get roasted, I completely understand and acknowledge that people who are born with disabilities can lead a promising and independent life, but not everyone is the same. I may sound selfish but other than not wanting my child to suffer, I also don’t want to be bound into taking care of a disabled child because I may grow to resent them. \n\nShe got pissy even though I showed her facts and told her as a nurse she should understand that doctors advise people to abort, not because their monsters, but because they’re thinking for the best of the child and mother. But she wouldn’t have it and said that all the doctors she met was just trying to protect the hospital from lawsuits or whatever. \n\nShe got mad and isn’t answering my messages or calls. I love her but I don’t know if it will work. I want to save this relationship because our opinions may change in the future. But we’ve only been dating for a little less than two years and I’m not ready to have babies. \n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "Okay, this is my first time ever creating a post on reddit so if anything is wrong I'm sorry!! I'm a long time lurker of the bad roommates sub because, well, I have bad roommates. I thought about posting this on that sub but figured this is a more appropriate place since I am mostly wondering if I am the wrong in this situation.\n\nMy roommates are typical messy roommates who cant be bother to clean a thing. A few months ago our fridge contracted a horrible smell. It smelled like someone literally took a shit in the fridge. Whenever the fridge was opened, for even a second, this smell would creep out and linger in the kitchen for what seemed like forever. Roommates would open the door and say, \"it smells in here!!\" but would any of them take the initiative to figure out what was causing the smell? Of course not. So one day I took it upon myself to get rid of the horrible smell. I decided to take everything out and throw away anything that was expired or moldy. There were so many containers full of old, moldy left overs I nearly puked. I sucked it up, got everything bad out of the fridge and Cloroxed all of the shelves and surfaces. I sent a snapchat to my roommates to let them know I was doing this. They didn't say anything, no thank you or concern as to what I was throwing away. To avoid the smell coming back and having to do this disgusting chore again, I made this a regular chore for me. At the end of every month I go through the fridge and throw away anything that is expired or moldy. I've been doing this for over 6 months with no problems.\n\nAbout a month ago (beginning of Nov.) roommate's mom took her grocery shopping. Roommate's mom bought her a lot of healthy (perishable) food, stuff she wouldn't typically buy herself (apples, carrots, orange juice, squash, grapes, ext.) now roommate is hardly ever home because she spends most of her time at school or her boyfriends house, she is also the one who is notorious for letting things go bad in the fridge. The grapes (looked like they were never touched) went bad after 2 weeks so I tossed them, nothing was said about this. The apples ended up being thrown away, and the carrots are still sitting in there unopened. So the orange juice sit in the fridge (unopened) all of November, at the end of November I do my normal fridge cleaning but leave the orange juice in there (even though it is expired) because it has never been opened so I figure it could still be good for awhile since its still sealed. We had a snow storm this past weekend so my BF and I bought a bunch of food in case we were snowed in. I rearranged the fridge to accommodate all of our new groceries and noticed the expired orange juice was still in there unopened. At this point I figured she clearly isn't going to drink this orange juice and it is now over a week expired so I threw it away. It is now a whole week since I threw it away and now there is a note in our fridge asking where her orange juice is. I wish I had a picture of the note it basically says, \"who 1. threw my orange juice away or 2. drank my orange juice I didn't get even one drink blah, blah, blah\" There has been no discussion about this although we have seen each other in person at least 3 times since the note went up.\n\nWhen I threw it away I felt like it was really wasteful but it was expired and I figured nobody wants to drink expired orange juice. Also, it sat in there for over a month (expired for at least 2 weeks) and she never wanted it and now that is gone she all of a sudden wants her orange juice so bad. Also, it hasn't been in there for a whole week and she just now noticed so I don't think she really cared about the orange juice all that much. She also didn't pay for it, her mom did, so its not like she is out any money. It also makes me mad she put a note in the fridge when I was standing in the kitchen with her when she hung it up, she could have just asked me??? I guess mostly I'm just wondering if I am in the wrong here. I feel like some people are going to say to just let her throw out her own bad food but if I did the whole fridge would be full of expired food and like I said, it hasn't ever been a problem and I've been doing this the majority of the time we have lived in the house.\n\nA little side story (her petty note put me in a petty mode) the squash her mom bought her is still on the counter and yesterday I looked at it and its covered in mold, instead of throwing it away I put it in clear view, you know, just in case she likes expired squash as well as expired orange juice. \\*insert eye roll\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Sorry this post is so long! Any feedback is appreciated, I don't like confrontation, and I feel like what I did wasn't bad but I would like an outsiders opinion! Thank you!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This is so petty and dumb I just don't have anyone else to talk to. So I have this group message between some of my friends and friend's friends. My roommate who ive been friends with for about 8 years likes to make it a habit of collecting unflattering pics of me. Usually just pics of when I was drunk in college years ago or pics he took of me with the flash in my face. Anyways he posted this particularly unflattering pic of me on the group message board. I mean im not a vain person but to me it just feels like why else would you post an embarrassing picture of someone if not to embarrass them? I asked him privately to stop posting pics of me on there and that I thought it was hurtful to just post an unflattering picture of me cause its a mean spirited joke. Anyways, we have been arguing for about three days about this. He says I have some nerve to even ask and that I'm questioning our friendship and his integrity by thinking that he would post the picture to embarrass me. On top of that he tells me he's been showing the picture to a bunch of other people to see if they agree with him. I just feel like im being highroaded here. I see it as if your friend is embarrassed by something you would just apologize and explain it was just in fun and keep it moving. What should of been a simple incident has really blown up into a giant fight, we just renewed a lease but I don't even know if we will be talking after the fight we had. Am I in the wrong here for even telling my friend I thought his joke was mean spirited or am I just being sensitive? ",

She seems to have really opened up to me, and has made it clear several times that she didn't have a boyfriend and her parents told her not to date in college until sophomore year (she's a freshman, I'm a sophomore). She's come to me with very personal problems and I've been there for her, she even invited me to go with her to  Canada during spring break just the two of us. We had talked about doing something on Valentine's day, but never made a concrete plan. Yesterday, she left me on read at Noon, I thought nothing of it thinking she probably had classes. Sent her a snap a few hours later and she left that on read too. At around 9 I saw her with another guy, and got mad. She got mad when I left her on read that night and said that we never made any real plans, and that I shouldn't be mad. I had bought her some things for Valentine's day and was going to ask her to make it \"official\" that we we're dating. AITA for being upset?",

      "description": "To save some people some reading here's a TLDR;\n\nFormer Ex asked to be brought to a party while in town visiting and hooks up with one of my friends while he was drunk.\n\n  \n\n\nLong Boring Story:\n\nWe dated for a while but ended it as she moved out of town. Long story short we still talked a bit but nothing more than friends. Some time later she comes to town to visit (this was highschool so things are a bit less exciting) and asks for me to take her to a party as she didn't really keep contact with anyone.\n\nI agree and fast forward to the party I'm having a good time socializing with friends and whatnot, but since I brought her I hadn't seen her since we walked in door. Chalking it up to the party being large I paid it no mind, and stayed mostly sober seeing as I was DD that night.\n\nOn the other hand, the other friends I had were much more intoxicated and eventually breaks off from the group. Long story short she was sober and he was drunk when they went and hooked up in my car. I'm aware of this and keep my cool for the most part, and when we leave to hop to the next party I leave the drunk friend behind, however petty it may have been.\n\nThe rest of the night goes off without a hitch, and the next day I get a few texts from him apologizing and I respect it.\n\nOn the other hand the girl texted me that same night first claiming she was disgusted with my drunk friends. Then moved on to claim she was drunk as well at the time (though she drove her and a friend to and from the party).\n\nAfter not responding o get another flurry of texts from her then her friend ranging from excuses such as the drunk example, to eventually calling me an asshole as she had driven 4 hours from her home town and now she wouldn't be able to go to any more parties in that time.\n\nNeedless to say I stopped contact with her from that point on, but after discussing it with other peers later in life I always wondered if I overreacted in completely cutting off contact, or if there was more blame to be shifted to my drunk friend (of whom I still know and am in contact with).",

      "description": "So unbelievably pissed off right now.  I really do hope that there is some part of this situation I am not seeing, and that I am the asshole, because as it stands I am ready to cut this branch of my family tree off and never speak to them again.\n\nMy (female) cousin has 3 kids (actually she has 4 but she gave one of them up for adoption when the kid was a teenager.  But that's neither here nor there.)  The two older girls are preteens and the youngest boy is 6.  Anyway she and her live-in bf have been having money troubles all year.\n\nI will admit, the two older girls were OK when they were younger but they are both turning out snarky and sarcastic and I don't have a lot of love for them.  But the 6YO is a sweetheart.  I visited for Thanksgiving and saw that his mom and her bf are constantly screeching at him and giving him punishments for the stupidest of slights: \"you left your coloring book on the kitchen table so go to your room without lunch\" or \"you didn't immediately say Yes Ma'am when I called your name so now you can't play outside\".  I spent Thanksgiving Day playing with him and I love the little guy.  He's so creative and bounding with energy.\n\nCousin's mom told me that Cousin was having to delay Christmas this year because they didn't have money to buy gifts.  (My aunt is on disability and had already stopped giving presents of any kind years ago when her children became adults.)  She said my cousin's older girls knew that they were going to get gifts in January instead of December and were OK with that.  HOWEVER.  The 6YO still believes in Santa Claus, and so would see his friends and neighbors getting presents from Santa and think Santa \"skipped\" him.  They were going to deal with the issue by telling him there is no Santa Claus.  (I was horrified at this.  What a terrible way to find out.)\n\nApparently a local charity was giving away used bikes, and the 6YO was looking forward to possibly getting one, but his name wasn't drawn and he was disappointed.  His Christmas letter to Santa only mentioned the bike.\n\nI found a decent bike online for $100 that would be there in time for Christmas.  I asked my aunt if she could put it together (she's handy) and she said yes, so I went ahead and ordered it to be shipped to her house, as she is their neighbor and I didn't want 6YO to see it before Christmas morning.  Note that I normally don't order anything for my cousins and vice versa, because there are so darn many of us.\n\nI called and told Cousin that a bike for 6YO would be arriving at her mom's house.  She was pissed.  Why didn't I order something for the other two girls as well.  I told her money was tight with me too, but I really wanted the 6YO to have Christmas magic a little while longer, while the other girls would be happy with presents later.  \n\nShe said that 6YO would be calling me to tell me thank you.  I told her to please tell him Santa sent it, don't mention me at all.  That's the whole point of the gift.  She insisted that 6YO is going to know I sent it.  Wouldn't take no for an answer.\n\nI tracked the package on Fed Ex and saw that it had arrived at my aunt's.  I called to ask how the setup was going.  Aunt was very vague, said Cousin's BF had borrowed her tool set earlier (\"I forgot\"), so she had allowed them to take the bike box home with them.  OK, fine.\n\nCousin texted me later that BF was having trouble putting the bike together.  OK...\n\nThen she texted \"the bike is missing some parts\".  ?? It's brand new!  But I guess that's a possibility.  I asked her to send me a list of what parts were missing, and I could talk to the manufacturer and get them to send spares.  (she never did.  Claimed she wasn't sure what they were.)\n\nThen she texted that since the bike is missing parts, she's not going to give it to 6YO until after Christmas, when she can fix it, because it's unridable and it would be cruel to give him something he can't ride.  !!!\n\nTHEN the kicker.  Today, 3 days before Christmas, she texted me that she had sold the bike to her neighbor for $20.  I told her that the whole \"bike is missing parts\" thing was bullshit, finally she said \"well it's also because 6YO got in trouble for hitting his sister\" and was being punished.  I was PISSED.  She told me I had no right to interfere with her parenting, or her punishments, or her plan to \"make the little shit grow up\" by telling him the truth about Santa, that I was being mean to her daughters by only buying the youngest one a gift, and that I should have just sent cash but \"you wanted to play the family hero\".   (I asked what she spent the $$  on and Cousin said \"None of your business\", so I'm also curious - is she correct?)",

      "description": "Sorry this is novel-length, I'm really bad at organizing my thoughts.\n\nSo basically I (F21) have been pretty close friends with this guy (M26) for a couple years now. We hooked up a couple of times this February but I eventually told him that I wasn't in a place where I wanted to be sexual/romantic with anyone but that I truly enjoyed his friendship and thought he was a lovely person. He took it really really well and we remained good friends.\n\nHowever, a couple months later, he found out through mutual friends that I had been dating around a little bit and he started to make moves again. I would always shut this down by like trying to physically avoid his efforts-- I once literally booped his nose and backed away to avoid him kissing me, which I realize is really immature even if it's kind of a funny anecdote-- and if he didn't get the hint I would occasionally re-state that I wanted to be friends and didn't want anything sexual to happen.\n\nSo fast forward to earlier today, I went over to his house to do some vegan baking (which I realize was probably too intimate a setup for someone who I have these kinds of interactions with) and he flat out asks me at the beginning if there is likely to be making out later, and I said no.\n\nHowever, once the brownies are in the oven and we're just kind of talking in his room, I notice that he's getting really physically close to me and I kind of look away and try to just keep the conversation going because I'm afraid I know where this is headed. Right on cue, he starts kissing me. I kind of don't react much and he gently pushes me back onto his bed and gets on top of me. I feel uncomfortable but like start kissing him back a bit almost on autopilot (for reference, I have a history of experiencing sexual/relationship violence and sometimes fall into bad patterns where I do things I don't really want to do which I realize is bad and confusing), until he pushes things a little too far and I finally tell him to stop and he does. But afterward he kind of just lies next to me on his bed like stroking my body a bit until I get up to check the brownies because I feel really uncomfortable and skin crawly. Throughout the rest of the evening it's a lot of him trying to initiate things and me kind of awkwardly dodging him until I eventually tell him I want to go home. He is always really polite and accommodating.\n\nHe's not a bad guy at all and whenever I am really clear and assertive he absolutely respects my boundaries, so I feel like I probably just need to grow up and learn how to express what I need more clearly. It's just often really difficult for me to do that in the moment, and I often end up either not giving a clear verbal \"no\" or even sometimes end up giving what could def be misconstrued as a non-verbal \"yes\". I also spend time with him because he is legitimately a really close friend who I don't want to lose but I feel like me continuing to agree to meet up with him could also be super confusing (one of my friends even heard about this meeting and joked about how \"come bake at my house\" is overtly code for \"come hook up with me\"). I'm worried that my behavior is both causing him emotional distress and potentially messing up his ideas of consent because I sometimes seem to respond to him being too persistent. So, am I an asshole for causing all this confusion?\n\nTL;DR: although I have told my friend I want us to stay platonic, I am not super assertive about it, sometimes respond in an encouraging way to his advances, and keep spending time alone with him so I'm worried I'm unfairly encouraging romantic behavior that I don't want.",

      "description": "I work in a mental health clinic as a sort of triage therapist - we do assessments for walk-in clients, get them set up with services, make referrals, do crisis plans, that sort of thing.  Our team has about 12 people, of a max of 15 or so. I've been here 3 years and never seen it fully staffed. Over the last few months, I've been talking with my b/f about us moving in together and it effectively has to happen this spring or we wait a year, so it's going to happen this spring, and would involve me moving about an hour away. I'm an openly gay guy (this will be relevant later), but most people don't make that assumption on meeting me. Upon starting here, there was a very vocal \"expectation\" - but not requirement - made that clinical staff is expected to give a month's notice.  I've told my coworkers/direct supervisor of the rough plan, but things have progressed and a real chance I'll be quitting a lot sooner than this spring.\n\nWhy I think it'd be NTA for me to quit - The company has a history of screwing people over who put in a lot of advance notice.  I've seen this happen twice in my department, alone - they announce yearly bonuses or quality of life changes that only apply \"if you haven't put in your resignation yet\" and then wouldn't pay them out, even if you were 2+ months from leaving - again, I saw this happen firsthand.  Further, I feel a little like, \"Screw these guys,\" as when I'd interviewed for an internal position, the director had told me, \"We don't want someone who's a gay as a supervisor.\"   I haven't reported it to HR (yet), as I didn't want to ruin my referrals/look spiteful for not getting the job.  Unfortunately, there weren't any witnesses/I didn't record it, but I do plan on reporting it as soon as I have another offer.\n\nWhy I think it'd be YTA for me to quit - Until I officially put in notice, they can't start looking to hire a person to replace me.  These positions historically are hard to fill and take a good month to train someone.  I have a great team, it's a hard job, and I don't want to screw them over.  Plus, it's not massively \"professional\" to quit suddenly. I don't have any reason to think that yearly bonuses/raises are coming, as they're almost always in June/July, so I realistically don't think I'd miss out in that arena.\n\nSo...judge away.",

      "description": "I don't really know how to write this so I'll just say what's on my mind. My parents are Christians and I don't really know if I believe in God right now. My mother has noticed and has tried to convince me in the last few days. Shouldn't really be a problem but she just won't leave me in peace. She will follow me and talk to me anywhere I go in the house. She tried to force me to promise that I'll try to return to Christianity again. I don't like promising to things that I don't want to do. Maybe this has stressed her out. \n\nSo today I was doing my own thing on my phone. She tried to ask me what I was doing cause she saw some pictures (Manga). I don't want to tell her what I'm doing because firstly I'm kinda annoyed by her constant tries to convince me to be a Christian and secondly if she finds out I'm reading manga my everyday life and privacy would be in danger. I want to keep secrets too. So I don't answer her question. She tells me that I am her son and should answer if she asks and that I'm disrespecting her. I tell her that I have secrets too and don't want to tell her everything in my life. She starts crying histerically and saying that she would've never dared to disrespect her parents like that and that Satan is making me do this. Guys I'm shaking because I don't want my mother to cry but I also value my privacy. Also I want my words to have weight. I want my no to be a no. If i give in this time I feel like she would know that I will  give in again. AITA? Should I really share absolutely everything with her? I feel really manipulated but maybe I just expressed myself wrong? Am I the asshole?",

I say as long as were doing everything we should, theres nothing wrong with spending it on things we really want.  after a while, the conversation got heated.  She asked \"why arent you just happy with what we have?  why do you need all this extra stuff?\"  so.... AITA for wanting to quit saving so much and start spending money on the things we/I want?  ive told her that she can spend money on a big ticket item she wants, but we both need to be in agreement- so if she says no, I wont do anything.

      "description": "So basically I was with my ex for three years till I broke it off in October. We are both at seperate colleges. I broke up for three reasons. One was the distance, we were long distance and both of us were feeling emotionally worse off than when we started dating. Second was that I had found out a year into our relationship that she had been sexting my high school best friend through out that time and she lied to me about hooking up with him after the time we started going on dates and a few days before we officially started dating. When I found out, I was going to break up with her but she begged me not to so I stayed in the relationship (there's more to why I stayed but I won't go into it) and tried to get over it but never fully did. And third was that in October she wanted to go on a break but wanted to remain exclusive to each other and I agreed but about an hour into the break I found out she agreed to go on a date with a guy from her work. So we broke up in October and about a week later she started fully dating her friend from work. Now she has repeatedly texted me like once a week upset about me liking my different friends pictures. To give it more context when we were dating she went through old pictures of my friends to see which ones I had liked before we started dating and got upset about it and eventually made me delete my  Instagram. Now after we broke up I made a new Instagram and she now goes through some of the girls I follow (she doesn't follow me and I'm private but she follows the people I follow so she can go through their likes and see my name) and gets furious and texts me how I'm terrible and how I misled her. The last instance was last night where she texted me 10 texts at 3am about how I am horrible for liking girls pictures. Also she is still dating her work friend they have been together five months and he doesn't know she texts me at all. So am I the asshole for liking pictures on Instagram even though she gets mad at me?",

      "description": " \n\nHey,\n\nSo a quick summary:\n\nI'm in a relationship with my boyfriend, it was wonderful at the start, then things became bad, he started to control me because of my past, accused me of actively cheating, calling me names for my past, being aggressive towards others. Then I wanted to break up and started flirting with another guy and fooled around with him, which was ABSOLUTELY a bad idea and I have told my boyfriend about that and we agreed to stay together, but so his accusations and calling me names continued. I'm not bad about that, it's still something I am unhappy about but it's my fault.\n\nSo that's the situation, and here how it's now, some months later:\n\nHe keeps on saying I'm cheating, often when I go to work, during work or when I come back. He can see where I am, and because of gps which is not always accurate, he calls me and says \"where are you, you're fucking with him right?\", etc and when I'm not answering, it's getting a lot worse. But I'm telling me here, I did this, it's my fault, I have to accept it.\n\nWhat I'm annoyed about is that his mood can change so suddenly, which also happend before I cheated. One moment we are happy and joking, I look at him and hes like \"you fucked someone today right?\", and then starts to call me asshole etc.\n\nAlso I'm saying myself I have to accept that he's calling me names etc, but it does hurt, and I'm thinking of the future and I know he will never stop doing that, so what's the sense of staying with someone I've hurt so much that he will torture me my life with calling me names and sometimes being aggressive towards me?\n\nSomething unrelated to the cheating, he is often fighting with other people. When something is not right, he shouts at them. We have a neighbour, who is blocking the entrance for our car, and he instantly gets aggressive, calls him names, shouts at him etc. I tried to talk with the neighbour, but he was getting aggressive towards me for talking with him and trying to discuss the problem. This is the same for anything where someone is not agreeing with him, shouting at him, calling them names etc. He even did this in front of the police once.\n\nI feel like I'm living with an antisocial person, and this makes me feel bad about myself and how other look at me.\n\nI would have left already if this would be always like this, but it's not.\n\nWhen we're at home, it's all fine, we have some fun together, we can laugh and cuddle. But if something is not alright, like me not cleaning up the room but instead playing games or me not giving him a kiss when he comes back, he's angry and either shouts at me or ignores me and I'm wondering, what his problem might be. That's his favorite two things, either being aggressive and calling me names, or ignoring me and making me wonder what I did wrong again.\n\nAnd another moment, he's laughing, making fun of what just happend and kisses me. I'm totaly confused by this and can't make my mind up.\n\nI'm thinking of breaking up but I just can't because it's not always this bad, and I fear that if I tell him that I'll break up with him, he cries and says that everything was a joke and that he loves me and then I can't say no.\n\nI feel like that I went to early into this relationship, that I did not get to know the whole site of his. Now I see him being antisocial and aggressive towards neighbors and his family and it's also affecting me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what I want to know is  \n\n\nAITA if I break up with him now, or do I deserve it because I cheated?  \nOr AITA for not breaking up with him, because I do not deserve him?",

      "description": "I have known my friend for around 6 years and I really love her. She's smart, sassy and funny. However, she can sometimes be more of a taker than a giver when it comes to support. In February, I was kicked out by a friend/landlord out of the blue. We'd had a fairly insignificant argument - as far I was concerned - but he saw red and threw me and my dog out. I had nowhere to go at first, as my parents have two dogs of their own and mine is a rescue that hasn't really been socialised. I was absolutely heartbroken, as I thought I was going to have to give him up. I was texting my friend, telling her exactly what my ex landlord was saying when she replied \"You're going to need to tell someone else, I can't cope with your shit right now.\"\n\nI was taken aback and, honestly, pretty hurt. But, I took the hint and stopped trying to talk to her about this traumatic period of time. Last week, we met for coffee and she was really quiet. I waited for her to say whatever it was that she wanted to get off her chest and it turns out she'd been mad at me for weeks about me trying to talk to her about my housing situation. She still felt I was in the wrong, because I should have known she wasn't feeling OK (she'd never mentioned it at the time, despite me always checking in and asking her how she was).\n\nFast forward to today. I was supposed to go to her house tonight for a bridal party sleepover (she's getting married in September and I'm the Maid of Honour) as we're having hair and make-up trials in the morning. Around 3 hours ago, I text her and said I couldn't make tonight, but would still be there at 9am for the hair and make-up. I have multiple sclerosis and I'm having a bad day (pain and fatigue). If I'm being honest with myself, I could probably push through, and part of me feels like I should. I just really didn't want to be around her while I'm not feeling great.\n\nSo, AITA?\n",

We aren’t super close but we spend a lot of time with the same group of people. \n\nSo here is the problem:\n\nI don’t really care much for her boyfriend, let’s call him Tom, because I don’t like how he treats people. It’s doesn’t really matter either because he is almost never around—he lives 3 hours away, and doesn’t visit that often.\nLong story short, Grace found out I wasn’t too keen about Tom and I apologized for how that knowledge entered her frame of reference (I was drunk and spilled it), and I admitted that I was an asshole for bringing it up, and apologized profusely. \nShe forgave me for that, but told me that we probably can’t be friends if I don’t become his friend/try to get to know him.\nI made it clear that have no intentions of spending time getting to know someone that I never see and don’t really like in the first place. \n\nSo, AITA?

      "description": "Some context:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night I went to a dinner at a nice restaurant for my birthday with me, my girlfriend, and a friend of mine with their date. It was our second double date with them, and I love all of them to bits but on our first double date (which I organized and paid for) it essentially became a miniature roast session with all of them ganging up on me. I let it go, because I didn't wanna ruin the double date and plus in my mind it was just harmless fun to them but it was getting under my skin some. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast-forward to the birthday dinner. Everything was all good for the first hour or so until the conversation turned into some weird sexual topic that involved my girlfriend spilling our sex life out to them in detail, which I was *not* comfortable with at all but I didn't know how to tell her to stop and didn't want to turn my own birthday dinner awkward for everyone. Then they started talking about theirs, and eventually the conversation turned to me. Then it became another roast session because I'm \"vanilla\" and not really into kinky shit, which my girlfriend has zero issues with until I guess it becomes convenient to chuckle at and turn into a talking point. My girlfriend is a good person, she's more than I could have ever imagined in a person and for that I love her dearly, and the feelings between us are mutual. However, it just sort of feels like she doesn't know she occasionally crosses lines whenever having a conversation in public with other people, especially about things I would consider private. We finished the dinner with me feeling a little shitty and upset, the only hint that she has about my feelings on the way they talked to me/about me was that I told her it was \"jarring\" and that's about it. I don't know how to approach this. AITA for letting it get to me? ",

      "description": " \n\nI was followed and mugged by a man a few months ago and it gave me a mild concussion and a huge host of anxiety issues that I'm still dealing with today. I am seeing someone for this but progress is slow and going through this in your 40's as a woman is terrible. Last Thursday I was walking home from the gym when I see this young guy and he keeps staring at me, and he's kinda following me. I immediately get super scared and I'm on high alert, I cross the street he crosses and I'm just trying to listen to my music and stay calm. I go into a starbucks to be safe and get a coffee, after I come out he's right there and is about to say something or reach into his jacket pocket and I slam my boot into his balls super hard. He hits the ground right away and I notice how young he is and that he's dying on the ground and holding my wallet and through like tears and coughing saying your wallet, your wallet I found your wallet. I immediately gasped and was like OH MY GOD I'M SO SORRY. I guess I dropped it infront of the gym and he was trying to catch up to me to give me it. I was so so sorry and kept saying sorry but this young guy was literally in the fetal position crying. I asked if he needed me to call and ambulance but he said no and I asked how old he was he said 19 and I was like oh my god did I just neuter this nice young guy who was just trying to help? I forced him up after like 5 mins and took him into the starbucks and got him water, juice and a sandwich. And was so sorry, I was like almost in tears because I didn't mean to do that to him it just really seemed like he was following me and after my last incident I couldn't take any chances. He was still like crying and holding his groin and I basically begged him to let me get my car from home, which is like a 2 min walk away and I'll drive him there or I'll get an uber for him there. He said no its ok and was like very scared of me, after some persuading I gave him $50 to take a cab from the starbucks to the hospital and pleaded with him too. I also got his number because I really want to make it up to him because he returned my wallet which had $400 cash (I never carry this much cash but I loaned some money to a co-worker and she paid me back in cash that day and I didn't go to the bank yet) with everything inside including my cards and I kicked his balls for no reason.\n\nI told my wife about this and she said that I'm an asshole for assuming some young guy was trying to hurt me and that I could have ruined his chances of having kids over my paranoia. This made me sick to my stomach and I'm so worried about the guy. I guess it was shitty for having blinders on and not realizing he was trying to yell at me saying I have your wallet or wave me down. I really want to make it up to this guy, like anything. He was wearing a basketball team hat so maybe some tickets?\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "We have been together for 2 years now and I live in a one bedroom apartment. My boyfriend still lives at home. After about 6 months of dating I asked if he wanted a key to my place and he said no because he didn't wanna live there. And after that I basically moved in with him and his parents for a year because my boyfriend didn't like to be in my tiny apartment. I even got my own key there (I don't have it anymore because he lost 2 of his own and had to take mine)\n\nI always felt like I was in the way and that I was a guest who overstayed my welcome at his parents house. They never said I wasn't welcomed or anything and I even gave them money for food and rent while staying there. Tho I never had space for my things and my stuff just went on the floor. And it was always messy in our room because of all the extra stuff.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I started working night shifts only and I couldn't get any sleep with everyone around that didn't work during the day, so I moved back to my appartment. My boyfriend has been to my place 7 or 8 times since I moved out(my place is a 5 minute walk from his so it isn't that far). And the only time we get to be with each other is if I go to his place. \n\nIt never crossed my mind that he wanted a key to my place after all even tho he doesn't even like it here. Am I really that inconsiderate for not thinking about it? I mean I get why he would be mad but I don't see why it was such a big deal.\n\nWe're also looking to buy our own place as soon as we got the money. And he is getting his own key to my appartment. ",

      "description": " 2-3 years ago I made very good friends over the short amount of time we became very close like family. I was always there for them (visited if they were feeling bad, talking to them, just being there etc.)\n\nEnd of last year I was going through a very, very rough phase of my life. I told them about my situation and asked for support, something I usually don't do. I ended up being neglected. I talked to them several times and explained that I needed some chats n' banters to keep my head off. I was always told \"yeah sure\" and \"sorry\" and that they will do better in the future, they didn't\n\nFriend 1 (now called F1) got a girlfriend during that time\n\nFriend 2 (F2) got a boyfriend. Also F2 made up with other friends that were very toxic for her. They were jealous when she did stuff with other friends and made her feel very bad and guilty for it\n\nF1 always posts what she does do on social media (which I rarely use) and never talks to me. When I ask \"how are you?\" I get an answer but that is about it\n\nF2 does the same or contacts me when needs smth. Also sorta stalks her friends to talk bad abt them behind their backs (even the ones she made up with again) \n\nI asked both why we have so little contact since it upset me. F2 stated she is having a hard time with written communication. I couldn't get my head around it since she always posts on twitter. I asked her why that is easy to her and told her in advice it isn't meant to be offensive, I just want to understand. She felt attacked right away\n\nI never asked for anything special. Never asked for anyone to visit me, never asked for smth that costs money. I only asked for them to listen and talk to me from time to time. But I guess they are both too self centered. Maybe it's an only child thing? idk\n\n**Long story short:** I feel left and replaced\n\nI tried to address the issue (calmly) several times in hopes to solve it. Even wrote letters 2-3 times so they could read it in peace and don't have that pressure of having to reply instantly. Nothing changed\n\nSeeing them on social media (the rare times I check) just dragged me down so I decided to block them everywhere, even their phone numbers, to move on and try to get better on my own. If that friendship is so important to them, they can still send me a letter\n\nI'm at my limit but I still don't know what I did was justified and can't help but feeling bad for blocking them\n\nF2 already saw I blocked her due to her stalking behavior and blocked me everywhere too as response\n\nF1 didn't respond at all, p didn't notice until now",

      "description": "I'll try keep it short but theres a colleague where I work who's in his mid-50's, he had a stroke a few years back and lost a lot of the feeling down his left side. As a result he's on a crutch and his left hand is basically useless. \n\nAnyway, he's a tough bugger - a stubborn one and an \"old school\" kinda guy. When I met him I didn't like him but I quickly learnt what kind of character he is and I've learnt how to get along without letting him get to me. Mostly he just comes in quietly, stays in his corner of his office and gets his work done. \n\nSince his stroke obviously his mobility is very limited so when I come to make my morning coffee I always make him a tea and we have some short banter. Generally I ignore the millennials around him complaining that the LUMENS in the fluorescent lights are too bright or some other issue that life is unfair to them. You can't breathe without one of them calling HASHTAG ME TOO or barking on about gender wage gap, being vegan or not recycling properly. \n\nAnyway, today I go in with my guy's tea and he's not there... just a couple of young female colleagues. I ask \"where is old school guy?\" and they say \"where's the racist, sexist you mean?\" - so I said \"ah well i'm gonna drink this tea I made for him since he's not here\" and they pipe up by saying \"yea you're his bitch aren't you?\" - so I said \"no, the guy has limited mobility so I make him a tea every morning\" and as I was walking out they said \"yea he's not that limited\".\n\nI'll bet you he could make a tea if he really tried, but it would take him around half an hour and he'd probably burn himself. I don't align myself with his racist / sexist undertones (I know when push comes to shove he has a good heart and behind his ego he would want the best for everyone), but the guy can't do everything himself. Am I the asshole for making him feel welcome and trying to make his day a little less shitty? ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been living together for 3 years (in communal/flatting style places), 6 months ago we finally got our own place together, just the 2 of us and it's been great.  Anyway recently he had his best friend move in with us because he got kicked out of his own place and had nowhere else to go.  I was under the impression (from limited talks because my partner's not great with communication or organization, and this all happened very suddenly.. like within 24 hours suddenly) that the friend would just be crashing with us for a week or two while he found somewhere to live.  But the next morning the guy turns up with all of his worldly possessions and fully moves in, he's been here since and it seems like he's here to stay.   My boyfriend is pretty happy with the whole setup, he admitted he sometimes missed having other people around when it was just us, and he's loving getting to spend so much time with his best mate.    \nI'm not handling it well though, I like the guy and it's nothing personal, but I really don't want him living here.  My issues are that I have pretty severe social anxiety issues, and now I'm anxious all the time because there's always people around. (they bring other people around daily too)  He spends all of his time in the living room (he doesn't work or study) with his volume turned up loud watching youtube/anime/playing games or playing guitar.  I've ended up just spending most of my time in bed because I don't want to go out to the living room.  He doesn't pay any rent or help out around the house in any way, he doesn't even clean up after himself.  This is a really small house too, with only 1 bedroom so he's converted the entrance way into his bedroom.  The living room is full of all of his furniture and stuff, so I had to move a lot of our furniture and stuff into our bedroom to make room for him.. so now every room is basically a narrow track between stacked piles of stuff, and it's a pigsty because I can't keep up with the cleaning on my own.    \nI've spoken to my partner about all of my concerns, he doesn't want the friend to move out but said he will ask him to leave if I reeaally want him to.  He's tried asking the friend how long he's planning on staying here but he hasn't got an answer.    \nIs there any way I can resolve this and salvage my own sanity in a way that would make me less of an asshole?",

She picked a European country.\n\nOur schedules have conflicted a few times so the trip hasn't happened and it's not scheduled to happen. My wedding is happening next year, which has added another conflict. I scheduled my engagement party for her fall break (she's in grad school) and my wedding for her spring break so she will be able to come to both and help out and do the whole maid of honor shindig before the actual wedding. I feel I was considerate in doing this so it wouldn't interfere with her studies.\n\nWe are on a family trip now and yesterday we had dinner with our parents and she asked about her graduation trip. My dad told her that because of the scheduling and such and because of the cost of the wedding, this would be her graduation trip because a trip to a European country is not financially feasible and the next time we will be able to schedule a family trip will be in the summer of 2020 at the earliest. She started crying and told my parents that they always play favorites and that they are picking me over her. She also said it was unfair that I got a graduation trip and she didn't. I told her she was being a spoiled brat because she's not entitled to this trip AND my parents paid for her to study abroad in college and I didn't study abroad so she should be grateful she got that experience.

The class was supposed to be run by teacher A, but he had a medical emergency in December, so now we have a sub for the rest of the year. Teacher A was decently obese(hence the med emergency) and his tests were online-only, meaning that pretty much half the class had separate documents on a device to cheat off of. \n\nSo the new sub comes in(teacher B), and she’s pretty laid back. She lets us sit wherever we want and her class is pretty chill, so naturally me and my friend always sit together. Her tests were ALL fill in the blank and multiple choice. This is important because my friend had maintained his A grade the whole year cheating off of a separate word document and now needed other means to get his grades. This meant that now he was always cheating off of me during formal assessments. I didn’t really have an issue with this, but now he asks for answers from me all the time. It’s getting quite annoying to be honest. Teacher B doesn’t really care about the cheating(as I mentioned before she’s very laid back) and I feel as if my friend is using me. We’re very close, but I feel like I’m about to reach my breaking point. I don’t like being taken advantage of, and I’ve tried discussing this with my friend previously but he’s brushed it off. This has made me feel that he doesn’t consider my stance on this and only keeps me as a friend just for the grades. However, we have been great friends for a while so I think cutting him off might be going too far but it might have to be the best option. WIBTA if I did this?\n\nTL;DR \nFriend in history class cheats off of me all the time, despite me requesting him to stop. We are very good friends, but I am considering cutting him off.

      "description": "BIL is not a bad person by any means. He cares for my sister, he's a responsible adult, he's a good father to my neice and nephew, and he gets along well with the entire family. Most days I like him. His biggest flaw is his sense of humour. Off-colour paired with sarcasm so strong that we can never tell whether he is serious or not. Not harmful by any means, but very annoying.\n\nHe jokes with everyone, but he likes to tease me the most because I can't help but react strongly. His favourite thing is hiding my phone. If I ever let go of my phone, he will silently snatch it up and hide it somewhere. Once I realize it's gone, he makes me guess where it is. Most of the time, it's somewhere innocent like a random cupboard or under someone else's seat. \n\nThere has only been a few times where his jokes genuinely upset me, but even then dealing with my sister and my BIL can be exhausting for me. Part of the reason I put up with it is because of how many times they help me. I work hard, but I don't have a secure source of income and can barely pay my bills. Sister helps by giving me a container of leftovers whenever I visit, or she asks me if I want any old clothes or accessories that she is throwing out. While it's very nice of her to do those things, it makes me feel like a charity case. \n\nFast forward to now:\n\nBIL took my new phone and hid it in one of those wet whipe containers that he thought was empty. There were no cloths, but there was an inch of cleaning liquid at the bottom that he didn't notice. My phone soaked up that liquid like a sponge and died almost instantly.\n\nMy sister yelled at him promising that they would pay for a replacement. BIL wouldn't even apologize. He was frantically researching ways to fix my phone (store it in rice, getting help at the apple store, etc.) and muttering something like how he can't believe he's going spend one of his rebates on replacing my phone. Did I mention that this all happened on his birthday?\n\nMy applecare expired a week before and my phone plan can't give me any better offers so the only thing I can do is buy a new phone at the apple store. I get the oldest and cheapest generation that they have, which ends up costing almost $700. I buy applecare and a new protective case at my own expense. \n\nWhile I would have rather this not happen at all, I'm kind of glad that BIL learned his lesson and maybe he'll leave me alone. Does this make me an asshole?\n\ntl;dr BIL's sense of humor gets on my nerves. One day, his prank ends up costing me my phone. I think the guilt and the cost to replace my phone will teach him not to pick on me. Does it make me a bad person if I'm relieved?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She is in a bad financial situation at the moment, which we all as a group completely understand so we attempt to do cheap restaurants or other activities because she’s really really focused on the cost when we go out.\n\nFor example, in the group chat without my girlfriend, the convo went like this:\n\nFriend 1: Let’s split a small gift like $4 each, what do you guys think?\n\nFriend 2: Yeah I’m down.\n\nCheap friend: No 😪\n\nFriend 1: yeah she’s so cheap sorry.\n\nFriend 2: Anyone else?\n\nMe: I’ll buy the gift you can pitch for a balloon cause she likes that.\n\nCheap friend: CHEAP BALLOON.\n\nFriend 2: okay I’ll make sure it’s cheap.\n\nMe: I can pay for your part (cheap friend) it’s no problem.\n\n(End of Convo)\n\nShe then didn’t reply, but I paid for that which she let me, she ordered the smallest cheapest thing which was $5 and then said I’m not gonna eat dessert because it’s expensive, and we all said oh okay, because I was gonna pay for it all anyway.\n\nI didn’t tell her that though, I just let her believe she was gonna pay her part so I didn’t tell her further that she could eat the dessert even though I offered originally.\n\nMy girlfriend was very upset because she does a lot of errands for her, and feels it’s like a waste of gas and time now since she isn’t worth $4 for a gift. I told her which I feel bad about but I think she should know if a close friend is being kinda mean in my opinion.\n\nI understand she’s in a bad financial place, but I believe you can still be chill and like explain sorry guys I wish I could but I can’t. Because I offer to pay which I understand she feels bad for but we want her to come.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "My ex is upset that I want nothing to do with him or his new girlfriend. He keeps telling me that I’m overreacting and we were broken up when they got together. \n\nEx and I broke up before the holidays after 3 years together. It was dysfunctional, but not abusive. We kept in light contact through texts over the holidays, no fighting or anything, no seeing each other in person. I was a little sad, but everything seems pretty okay for a break up. We just didn’t work. Cool, right?\n\nAnyway, he starts sending me pictures of a group of people and some kids over the holidays. I’m not really noticing anything weird at this point, I’m happy he’s out doing stuff. He starts a group chat with me and one of the women because, “we have a lot in common” and thinks we’d be great friends. I keep up the text to be polite and she seems cool. She’s super into talking with me and apparently we’re in the same line of work. \n\nFast forward to last week. He mentions that he’s moved into a new place and that the kids in the pictures are starting to call him dad. \n\nExcuse me, what the fuck? \n\nI don’t understand and go digging on FB and find out he moved in with this woman two weeks after we broke up. He just met her a couple weeks before we broke up. And HE ACTIVELY INTRODUCED HER TO ME BECAUSE WE’D GET ALONG. \n\nLike this woman knew I was the recent ex girlfriend and she’s texting me and trying to be my friend???? And he didn’t fucking tell me they were together?? Who the fuck does that???\n\nI AM LIVID. I said some really ugly stuff and ripped into him about being an asshole and just fucking cruel. That I want nothing to do with either of them because it’s all fucking slimy and fucked up to play this weird game of not giving me all the facts. \n\nHe kept saying it wasn’t a big deal, he doesn’t understand why I’m upset and that I’m overreacting. That we were broken up and that became, “official” after he introduced me to her in the group chat. \n\nI told him that I never want to speak with that woman again and he responded that she was going to be very upset because she really likes me. What. The. Fuck. \n\nHe also keeps reaching out to me, asking how I am and sending me stupid memes. I’m not responding. \n\nSo, AITA? I really don’t think I am, but this feels like a fucking twilight zone episode and it’s messing with my head how casual they are about this. \n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to spend quality time with my younger cousins without caring for our intellectually disabled cousins?",
      "description": "This has been eating me up inside for a few months now and it was only yesterday, after a family gathering, that I was finally able to articulate what's going on.\n\nMy mum's side of the family has always been close. She's the oldest of 4 siblings, and has 2 sisters and a brother. Myself and my other cousin T are only a year apart, and we're older than all our other little cousins. We're now reaching to our mid to late 20s where we're finally coming into our own and have some disposable income. Since these kids were born I've always wanted to be a good older brother to them... but here comes the challenging part.\n\nAs before, my mother has 2 sisters and a brother. I'm an only child. One sister, D, has a daughter and a son.\n\nHer brother, J, has 3 kids, who are now entering their teenage years. These kids are honestly lovely and I enjoy spending time with them, and would like to get to know them a little better. They're all developing fantastic personalities and I love playing games with them and generally introducing them to new stuff (new movies, board games, etc).\n\nAnother sister, G, has two daughters, one of whom is quite severely disabled (let's call her D1). We're talking non-verbal communication (so basic sign language) and an inability to understand what's going on around her. Her younger sister is also disabled but less severely, and importantly, she listens to instructions and behaves, for the most part (let's call her D2).\n\nThe issue comes when we try and include D1 in activities. When the kids were younger (4-5), this wasn't much of an issue since they were all enjoying the same sort of activities... but now that they're all teenagers, it's clear it's becoming a lot more difficult to accommodate for D1/D2. Watching movies becomes challenging as their attention span simply won't care for it, and playing games becomes difficult too. As the only adult in the room, you're instantly responsible for their wellbeing and it's rough when they don't listen. Instructions like, \"D1, don't blow up that balloon\", or \"D1, don't pinch D2, that's not nice - D2, move away from D1\" are _completely_ ignored.\n\nThe issue here is that I want to spend time with J's three kids, but since our family is quite tightly knit, I'm worried that me spending with them will invite criticism from D1/D2's parents. I want to take them to the movies, or play some games with them and talk to them like adults and just foster a caring relationship with them, but I honestly don't want to do it if I'm expected to nurse two other children that are difficult to parent.\n\nPart of me feels like a huge asshole for it since it's obviously not the kids' faults they were born with heavy intellectual disabilities, but as the other 3 kids mature into adults, the gap between all of them is just going to get wider.",

      "title": "AITA for making the bride refund me for my bridesmaid dress after she kicked me out of the wedding?",
      "description": "The bride is my cousin. She is very selfish, spoiled, and childish. \nI moved in with my aunt and uncle (her mother and father) in order to attend school. Within that time, my cousin and I became very close. She even asked me to be the Maid of Honor in her wedding! (Which later I found out, she also asked the other 2 bridesmaids to be the MOH. All of us said yes.) \nAs time passed, I began to realize how shitty of a friend and person she was.\n\nEvery topic had to be centered around her life. The only interest she took in my life and my own personal struggles was when she wanted to share the details with our other friends. \nIn one specific instance, I was seeing a guy I knew my father disapproved of. After telling my cousin that I didn’t want my father finding out about our quick ‘fling’, she got drunk told him 2 weeks later. \n\nThis is when I learned I could never trust her. \n\nIf I hung out with anyone else in her absence, she would come to me crying, asking why I was upset with her and why I didn’t think to invite her. This happened on multiple occasions with one of the bridesmaids in her wedding, which I began to get very close with. \nOur friend, Anna, was the friend I never knew I needed. She was charming, supportive, and upbeat. This was a stark difference from my cousin who was constantly negative and self-centered.\n\nThen, I accepted an internship and have to move away for 4 months. The wedding is going to be while I’m away. I tell my cousin that I will fly in for the wedding. In my last few months of staying with my aunt and uncle, I knew I had to be very strict about how I delegated my time. I admit I was very selfish. I wanted to be with Anna and my father more than anyone. I would spend many nights bouncing back and fourth between the two. \nAnna and I would go to the mall or have sleepovers. When we would go out, we would shoot my cousin a text inviting her. She always had a bullshit excuse like “I have a class tonight so I need to take a nap” or “My fiancé and I are packing (Granted, this would be a solid reason if we knew she wasn’t actually packing.)” \n\nFinally, a week before I left, my cousin asked me every single day, “Are you going to be able to take off for the wedding?” To which I reply, “I am honestly not sure. They are very strict about days that I take off, but I will just leave and get reprimanded if I have to.” \n\nI move all of my things 2 hours away, to my mom’s house, so we can leave Saturday to head to my internship. (A 14 hour drive)\nAs soon as I arrive to my mother’s, my cousin sends Anna and I a text. And I quote, “Do yall even wont to be in my wedding, because neither one of you have treated me like you would like me around  for the pass month or so. I will give u the money back on ur dress.”\n\nI replied, “Anna and I are friends, just like how you and I are friends. We didn't kick you to the curb. We asked you to come along more times than I can count - you just always had something else you had to do.\nWe understood that. We never got mad and upset at you for being busy - just like we never expected you to be upset when we continued our plans without you being there.\nIf you don't want me in your wedding, that's fine. It's your call to make. I just think you picked a very opportune time to kick me out. You should have told me to my face. And yes, I would like for you to pay me back.” \n\nShe texted me a giant guilt trip about how she always felt left out and unwanted. I know she’s simply being manipulative, wanting me to feel sorry for her, but I do feel sorry for her. I’m starting to feel guilty for her paying me back. \n\nAITA? Should I return the money? I’m still out of the wedding, but I feel guilty or taking her money.",

      "description": "So a little bit of context. Me and my mother were born in England but her parents (my grandparents) were Pakistani immigrants. About 5 years ago, my grandfather sadly passed away and we held the funeral in the UK where he lived for the past 60 years and that was very hard on my mother who loved him a lot. \n\nThere’s a Muslim tradition that I’m not 100% familiar with since I don’t follow Islam anymore where the deceased has a funeral event every year in their home which happens to be Pakistan. I went Pakistan 2 years after he passed and hated the experience. The country itself wasn’t really the problem it was just me. I couldn’t speak the language, I got badly sick the whole 2 weeks and the power outages made days feel like a hot hell.\n\nNow my mother who held off for a couple of years to go again is saying she wants to attend her fathers funeral this year and she can only go if I come with her because she doesn’t want to go alone. I immediately felt guilty because I don’t want her to go alone and I don’t want her to not go at all all because of me, but at the same time, my mind is set that I’m not going back. I told her I don’t think I want to go and she’s been upset with me that she’s not able to go then.\n\nI tried to compromise that I am willing to go for a week but if it’s longer than I can’t do it and she says we can’t go for less than 2 so I said then I’m not going.\n\nI’m willing to do anything for my mother but I had such a hard time going there and when I came back I never wanted to go back again (absolutely not the country’s fault). \n\nAITA for not allowing my mother not to go to my grandfathers funeral because I’m not willing to go to Pakistan with her? I feel awful because we all loved him but my mind just keeps strongly stopping me every time I try to think about braving it.",

For starters, his sleep schedule is fucked and he lives off unhealthy junk foods. I hear him every once in a while bragging about going to bed at one - four in the morning to bed.\n\nA buys McDonalds from the shopping centre (we catch two buses, one which drops us off at the shopping centre, and the other which takes us home). He eats unhealthy amount of food from there, living off of the stuff.\n\nRecently, me, my crush and A went to the cinema to watch a movie, and A has talked throughout the whole movie, not understanding the concept of shutting up during a movie. He gave us unnecessary attention and embarrassed me because I had to keep telling him to be quiet with him not listening.\n\nThe cinema was fully booked, too.\n\n\n\nNow unto the more dark stuff.\n\nThere have been times last year where A has said that he wants to rape me and initiate sexual intercourse with me.\n\nNow my parents found out about the rape thing and took it to the vice-principal at my school, (we’re in the same school) making A stop. (My parents occasionally look through my phone if they feel something is suspicious. They have stopped, stating that they trust me and understand that it’s an invasion of privacy.)\n\nHe has apologized for the rape messages, but recently he asked to chat on Discord so we can have another conversation about sex “if my parents don’t look through my phone anymore”.\n\nThere has been another time (Before the rape comments) where A has tried to swoon me into blowing him on the bus when there was no-one else, saying that “It’s not sex so it’s not illegal” (we’re both underage where I’m from so sex is in fact illegal for us.).\n\nA has also told me that he has gotten his dog to lick his dick so he can get off, but then told me that he has done it a long time ago.\n\nHe has told me about his kinks and fetishes and how he has over 2.5 GB of porn on his phone. I don’t want to know about that kind of stuff, dude!\n\n\n\n\nI feel that A is not a good friend, at least not for me. His past makes me uncomfortable, and I feel he didn’t learn from the rape comments experience, which is proven by him trying to re-initiate a conversation with me about sex.",

      "description": "I just got into college a couple of months ago, and since I'm a dude myself I started hanging out with the dudes around. Before I knew it we were going out every day, hanging around and such. Problem is, they're massive assholes behind everyone's backs. They're constantly talking shit about every girl/teacher/literally everyone they have an argument with. They fabricate stories and even say \"Oh dude I touched that chick's back\" every 2-3 sentences. I've never been one to talk like that since my best friend and my only real friend throughout high school has been an asexual dude that never talked about such things so I was never exposed to this sort of stuff.   \n\n\nSo, recently I started going out more and more with the girls in my class. Just casually going out for drinks and such, and I found myself talking about all the stuff they talk about, basically ratting them all out for the hypocrites they are. The girls have stopped interacting with those guys and are now constantly mocking them. I stopped responding to their requests too because going out with them is just boring and annoying at this point.   \n\n\nAm I The Asshole for alienating them and basically snitching all of their private talks?",

      "description": "Hey so before i begin this i just wanna say I appreciate when my gf does anything for me even if its just poppin up at one of my lectures with a bottle of water - she's very kind and thinks about me a lot.\n\nHowever....\n\nI've noticed she does this thing where she'll do you a 'favour' that ends up requiring you do to more work than you wanted to in the first place. Its like you said you needed a new shelf and she goes out and buys the materials to build a new one but you just wanted to buy an already-built-shelf and not figure out how to build it. You appreciate the gesture but it's a little annoying you have to do this task you didn't want to do to begin with.\n\nThe best example of this is when she made pancakes. Ive been watching what I eat because im pretty out of shape and learned its due to overeating and sugary foods. My gf knows I've been being careful because ive been declining eating out and snacks. However I'm having a rough week emotionally and she offers to make pancakes for breakfast the next day. I decline. I'm trying to be good with my eating habits. She asks again later that day and I decline again. When she asks again later that night I get annoyed because I've had to decline a food I enjoy multiple times and she ends up pouting.\n\nThe next morning I have off so I just want to sleep in but I'm woken up and told to come downstairs for breakfast. At first, I'm flattered and hoping she's made the scrambled egg recipe I've been enjoying.\n\nBut no. Its the pancakes I declined multiple times the day before. When i don't look excited, she feels hurt and says she made them because I've had a rough week. Although I appreciate the food, i feel guilty eating the pancakes because of the diet (as this sugary breakfast kills half the calories I'm on) and feel guilty because she can tell I'm not enjoying myself. \n\nAfter breakfast she asks me to clean everything up and seems surprised when I look upset. But 1) i didn't want the pancakes and I made that clear and 2) the kitchen was a disaster. So not only did I get a breakfast I felt guilty about (without asking) but i had to clean up the kitchen too. Not how I wanted to start my day off.\n\nThis isn't the only instance. Shes done things like buy plants for people who don't want to take care of plants, cooked more unwanted food then asked to be cleaned up, or refusing to take no for an answer when you dont want something. You have to tell her no multiple times when she offers you something. Some times I want to shake her and say \"I'm not being polite! I really don't want that!!\" but it tends to fail or she feels hurt because you get annoyed (this doesn't just happen to me, I've seen it done to friends and family).\n\nAITA for getting annoyed by her favours? How do I even begin talking to her about this feeling? She's kind of an all or nothing person and I feel like she'll be really hurt if I do anything.",

      "description": "Hi! Please excuse my grammar, english is not my native language. Also I know it might sound silly or obvious, but I do feel conflicted.\n\nFor some context: Cisco (28M) and I (26F) met at university and have been good friends for about 5 years now. We did our first internship together and when we graduated, we both started working at the same building. He is a pretty amazing person. He has driven me to the airport, hospital, took care of my drunk ass, helped me move. Good friend. I had a crush on him when we first met but he had a gf so I never really pursued it. \n\nJanuary of 2017, just before he broke up with his gf we got really drunk together and hooked up. We were both complete messes at the time and I know it was wrong. We remained good friends and hooked up a couple times more (after he broke up) but nothing more than that. \n\nI met Betty (26F) at our building because she and Cisco were going out for a while. A few months later she and I became friends, hanging out a lot. I never mentioned Cisco and I hooked up, as far as I knew they were no longer going out and I never felt I needed to tell her. \n\nEarly this week she invited me to a party and mentioned Cisco might come and that they would still casually meet, but she didn’t really know how he felt about her. She was into him. \n\nAt that point, I felt I needed to “warn” her. Yes, he’s sweet and all but to please be aware he would not take it further. He told me multiple times he was not planning to be in a relationship anytime soon and was going out with a few different girls. And that he knew the way he treated said girls led them to think he wanted more so he was clear from the beginning. I told her all that over text. She kept asking me questions and I kept telling her some stuff I knew about him. Later I realized I overshared and told her “please don’t think ill of him. It was all complicated and we can talk more in person”. \n\nI wake up today to a huge text from her. He pretty much called me a terrible friend, “spilling” his secrets to others and that she didn’t know what my intentions were but she thought it was mean that I told her about him and I. That i’m not trustworthy and that she only kept me talking to see how far would i go on “betraying my friend”, which felt like plain manipulation. She said we shouldn’t be friends anymore and told him the same, that she didn’t want to associate with “that kind of people”. She went on about us hooking up last year. It was harsh. \n\nI later called him, explained and apologized. He didn’t care a bit. \n\nTo me, it was girl talk with a trusted friend. She didn’t see it that way. She thinks I was on some kind of agenda. \n\nAm I The Asshole?\n\nTL;DR: I told my friend the guy she fancied didn’t want a relationship. I went on and overshared stuff about his life bc I’m friends with him. She thinks I did it make him look bad and cut ties with both of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This time we went to a ramen place that we frequent to, we each ordered our own, and started eating. \n\nI begin enjoying my meal and then one of my friends gets quite annoyed at me for slurping. She said that she hates it when people do that, and that it was quite disgusting. At first I was really taken back, because this was always how I've eaten ramen and nobody once voiced their dissatisfaction with the way I eat, but come to think of it I realized she might not have been there for all the other times. It wasn't like obnoxious slurping (or so I think). I wasn't going out of my way to make as much noise as possible. Its just the noise that you make when you eat noodles that are longer than your bite size. \n\nAt first I agree, and I tone it down the best I can. I start biting my noodles short (which I personally feel is extremely unsatisfying). But the damn noodles are hot, it's spicy, I know they are excuses but I keep slipping up time to time to finish some longer noodles, which then of course she picks up on the sound and calls me out on it every time. \n\nAt this point, I was honestly quite annoyed. I wasn't slurping spaghetti, okay? Its a damn bowl of ramen, we are eating in a restaurant among friends, let me just enjoy the damn bowl as I please. Maybe I shouldn't have lost my shit, but I said that she was welcome to leave if it was bothering her so much, and continued eating like I usually would. \n\nThe atmosphere got quite awkward after that... and she did leave, which then of course made me feel bad afterwards. Which sucks, because it was our lunch out and we were having a good time hanging out beforehand. Was I the asshole here? Feel free to be blunt with your words.",

I set up a chore rotation to keep the house clean that 2 roommates mostly ignore, 1 of them barely uses the common spaces so its not a big deal. \n\nOnly 2 of us have regularly bought household goods like dish soap, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, etc. Neither if us has asked for compensation for these.

While I was getting ready, she sent me texts asking for another confirmation (which I did not see). I arrived at the restaurant and found out that she had not even left her place and was 45 minutes away. I decided to go home. Our transcript is below. The reason she refers to me as having a “track record of disappearing” is because I did not respond to one of her text messages until a day later.\n\nMe: [Restaurant name] at 7PM?\n\nHer: 7:30 🤔 (This is the text I liked)\nHer: Sounds good!\n\n3 hours later...\n\nHer: Erm..\nHer: I know you “liked” the message Mr. Millennial but ..\nHer: Considering your track record of disappearing and the fact the place is 40 mins away I feel like I should get confirmation before I make a move \n\nMe: I’m en route \n\nHer: I said when you didn’t respond for a min I thought perhaps you flaked so I undressed. I’m on my way now but the place isn’t close so I was wondering where you are in case you will be waiting \n\nMe: I’m at the restaurant \nMe: I told you that I would meet you at the restaurant \nMe: On top of that I made a reservation...\nMe: [I post image of reservation from OpenTable]\n\nHer: Wasn’t aware you did, we last spoke hours ago. I was ready on time I explained I wanted to confirm we were on before I left. \nHer: Would you like to cancel \n\nMe: I did confirm that 7:30 would work for me\nMe: The reason I didn’t see your subsequent texts was because I was walking my dog, finishing up chores, and getting ready to meet you tonight\nMe: I’m heading back home\n\nHer: So yes you would?

      "description": " \n\nSo I am a sixteen year old girl from Denmark, I've been in a commited realationship with my boyfriend since i was eleven, since I am almost 17 that means we've been together for almost six years give or take.\n\nOur anniversary just rolled around and I wanna break up. See he didn't really do anything for me on our aniversary, other than giving me 100 danish crowns in cash, which he just pulled out his pocket and handed to me. No romantic gestures, no loving words, not even a single \"I love you\". I'm just so fed up with his unromantic way of treating our relationship.\n\nIt goes farther than that though, for example in 2018 we promised to give each other christmas presents, since we both could afford it, well the last day of school before christmas rolls around and I hand him a gift. He put it in his backpack, without a word, and didn't have anything for me.\n\nHe also has never given me a birthday present, or invited me on a date, not a single one. I forced him to go a date for the money he had given me on one of our anniversaries, which was the second time he has given me anything.\n\nIn total, he has only given me FOUR gifts in the span of our six year relationship, and whenever I ask to go on a walk, or do anything other than play video games on his computer, he doesn't want to.\n\nSee the video games are also a part of the problem, whenever I'm at his house, all he does is play games on his computer while I sit and watch, he does this till long into the morning hours, and I normall go to sleep a little earlier than that. So when he finally does go to sleep he wakes me, and every time he does I KNOW it's because he wants to have sex. It's the only thing that we do, that makes us seem like a couple.\n\nI'm fed up, I've had it. He doesn't love me the way I WANT to be loved, but am I the asshole for wanting him to be more romantic?\n\nBtw, I don't talk with him about it, because he takes any critique very personally, but even if I am in the wrong, I still want out of this relationship because the love is simply not there anymore.",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom...\n\nMy sister [18] has been going to a University out there and has been living in the dorms for almost the entire year but as soon as she starts her second year, due to the cost, she will be looking into apartments or housing outside of the University dorms. My parents are now looking into houses out there to avoid the financial burden of paying for her future living arrangements in a Los Angeles area, to have my mother cook her meals, and so that either I [21F] or my mother drive her to school and home.\n\nI understand why they would want to move out there considering our father (who is the sole provider) would be paying for our bills where we currently live and for hers out there. However my problems with this is I am expected to pack my things and leave the place I have lived my whole life, a place where my friends are, the rest of our family lives, and a place I genuinely like living. I'm not exaggerating either because my parents are planning on selling/renting our current home and both are talking to me as if I have agreed already even though I have not said yes to leaving.\n\nDon't get me wrong I see the value of moving to a city where I will have better opportunities, I can always make more friends while keeping in touch with the ones I have now, and I finally can learn to drive in a real city with actual traffic. I can't help but see the down sides though. I am unable to financially support myself in order to stay, they continue to have my car under their names (even though I pay for the insurance and the tags or registration) so they might use that as something to make me move, and if I do leave I will only be there to make HER life easier like when she comes home. Another important note is she has not learned to drive and refuses to claiming WE (our parents and me) are to blame for not trying harder to teach her even though I tried and in return she messed up my car. She also refused to take public transportation because \"why the f would I take a bus.\"\n\nTLDR, I'm asking if me not wanting to move to Pomona to make my SISTER'S life easier makes me an asshole.",

      "description": "This one is hard. Currently I'm living with my mother in a house her father bought for her. She is currently jobless due to her various syndromes that make it hard for her to work and is currently trying for disability.\n\nCurrently I am the one of the two people in the house with a regular income, the other being her boyfriend. He takes home a little more than I do after child support from his previous marriage and taxes (according to him, I've never seen his paystub). They also had a child together recently and he is just over a year old.\n\nSo the people in the house consist of me, my sister who is in high school, her friend who got kicked out of his house, my mother, her boyfriend, and my half-brother.\n\nI have been paying my fair share around the house to help keep it maintained. Currently my bill responsibilities are water, internet, electric when it falls behind, groceries occassionally, though I also buy my own food seperately, and repairs to the house. This lets me save a bit in the mean time. The boyfriend pays electric, for the cellphone plans of everyone in the house, Netflix.\n\nRecently I found out no one has been paying the property taxes and we are about 10k USD behind and need to pay about 3.5k before the end of the year or the house will be foreclosed on. I was asked to pay the back taxes recently and running the numbers I'm not sure I can afford that and everything else, especially when I could live in a single bedroom apt for far less a month and have more freedom over the household.\n\nWould I be an asshole if I said \"no, sorry\" and moved out?",

      "description": "So my parents got a divorce around a year ago and, while my dad is supposed to see me a couple times a week, I'm 17 and I don't. I try to find excuses out of nothing just so I don't need to see him anymore. I haven't told him it's because I immensely dislike him as a person, but maybe I should? I'm hoping he'll get the memo.\n\nEssentially, I hate how he treats everyone except me and my younger brother. He adores and loves us, but I can't stand him. My older brother isn't his by birth, but my dad raised him since he was 6 and has despised my older brother. He won't admit it, but the way he acts, talks to, and treated him made me sick. My dad would always yell at his face, get pissed when we'd try and defend him (and call it \"talking back\"), and even agreed with my older brother (who suffers from depression) when he said that he'd rather kill himself than do whatever shit my dad wanted him to do. He always berated my mother over the dumbest shit (occasionally going out for some drinks with friends, crying in front of us children, etc etc) and after the divorce would constantly shit talk her in front of me.\n\nA month or so ago, he was insanely drunk and brought me outside just to talk about how awful my mother is, and how my grandma is \"an evil bitch\". I, after those remarks, told him to stop talking and I walked away and, to his credit, he DID apologize a bunch for it - but only after I pointed it out to him. He always pegs himself to be the victim, and would try to convince me and my younger brother that my mom is selfish and evil (she's a fucking elementary school psychologist for Christ's sake). \n\nHe's insanely paranoid/controlling about everything - to the point where I was 30 minutes late from a club for school and he yelled at me about how he thought I was dead. Now, he thinks my new job at a restaurant has led me to doing drugs and ignoring school simply because I have a C in an AP Calculus class AFTER I SKIPPED PRECALCULUS.\n\nI don't know, I feel bad about \"ghosting\" my dad, but on the other hand is it justified? Should I try to ignore everything and say \"fuck it, he's my dad so I have to live with it\"?.\n\nTLDR: I've been ignoring my dad because of how abusive he was to my mom and brother, AITA?",

      "description": " So, here's the case: My (22F) brother (23 years old) has ADD, is overweight, does not care about his body hygiene and is socially awkward. So, he's not the type of guy, girls fall in love with.\n\nStill, he's my brother and i love him. So i was really happy when he told me, he got a girlfriend 4 years ago. His girlfriend (who already was 28 years old at that time) was working/studying in the same special needs apprenticeship when they met. She has epilepsy. \n\nSo, at first i was really happy for them and wanted to meet her, since she made my brother happy. However, i soon realized what kind of person she was. In the 3 years they were dating, i only got to meet her twice. The first time, i politely introduced myself to her, but she just hid behind my brother in silence. So later, when we all were sitting at the family table talking and laughing together, she just sat there staring at her feet. I thought that it was a little bit strange, but didn't want to push her into talking, since she might feel a little bit uncomfortable. However, later that evening when our paths crossed, she grabbed me and told me in an angry voice \"don't ever come near my boyfriend again. He's mine!\"\n\nAfter she left i confronted my brother and he told me, that she told this all of his female friends and gets jealous very easily, but he still loves her. I also found out that she also told my mother to keep her distance to her son. My brother, naturally, still talks to us and \"did not keep his distance\". \n\nAnother story my brother told me was when she called him and said, that she felt sick and wanted him to come visit her to make her feel better. So my brother, like the good boyfriend he is, drove almost 3 hours to her parents’ house (still lives with her parents) using public transport because he hasn't got his driver's license yet, just for her to tell he as he arrived, that she doesn't feel sick anymore and wanted him to leave her alone. So he drove home again. At home she called him again and said, she felt sick again and wanted him to come over. As he refused, she got angry and called him an asshole. \n\nThat was the first time, i asked my brother why he was still in this relationship. He replied that he still likes her for who she is. He also told me that whenever he asks her to come over, she isn't in the mood or too busy. Also, whenever they were on a date, she invited friends and only talked to them while calling my brother \"disgusting\" for wanting to kiss and hold hands. Also, she always demanded expensive presents, like jewelry and electronics. She even wanted him to buy a house for them to move in together. Even though my brother was still financed by our parents and she never gave him anything in return.\n\nAfter my brother told me many more stories like that i told him he has to break up with her, or get her to change and treat him better. He started crying and telling me that he knows, but also that he is afraid to never find a girlfriend again and dying alone. I told him that it is better to be single, than being in a toxic relationship. \n\nIt took him 4 months to finally break up with her. He was devastated, but she didn't even care and soon got into another relationship.\n\nNow, one year later my brother has no job, no girlfriend and is living at my parents’ house, thus having no social life. I don't see any chance for him finding a new girlfriend. I feel bad for taking away his maybe only chance of a future family life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Throwaway because I will be discussing what's essentially my life story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m 25 now. Growing up, my mother worked while my father stayed at home. Even though my father was at home, I cooked and cleaned for myself as long as I can remember. We lived on the country-side for a while where I thought our level of poverty (150% below the poverty line) was pretty standard. There was usually enough to eat, only yelled at and hit when I maybe deserved it (they weren’t able to logically reason how to properly punish a child) but all-in-all, I think I had a good, adventurous, childhood. When we moved to the city when I was 13, I got a paper route and started to pay for things like Christmas presents, and food and clothing for myself. We moved again when I was 15 to a good school district where I met a family (The Smiths) who had me over for dinner almost nightly and encouraged me to join extracurricular activities and to think about college. A year later, it was time to move again. My mother said my brother (18 y/o) was able to pay rent and because they were moving into a two-bedroom apartment, I would have to sleep in the living room. As a 16-year-old teenager, this was devastating. \n\nThat night at dinner with The Smiths, I told them the situation and they were taken aback. After they spoke privately, they invited me to live with them in order to finish my high school education in the school district. My father didn’t seem to care, and my mother was initially upset that “this fancy family was stealing me away.” I asked if I would ever be able to get my own room and they said no and maybe staying with the Smiths was for the best. That night, they released my cat outside and said I could leave whenever. (I later found my cat and The Smiths let me take her with).\n\nThat semester, I moved in and felt like I had support, love, and structure for the first time in my life. It was wonderful. My mother seemed to only call me once every month or so and I only heard from the other members of my family VERY rarely. I attended college and am finishing up my Doctor of Physical Therapy degree this May. During my college career, my mother would only call every few months to ramble about herself or to ask a medical or financial-related question. They didn’t contribute to my college education besides letting me fill out their taxes so I was able to get the education-credit. Additionally, I was on her insurance plan for 1 year before affording my own. \n\nI still feel so much resentment for them not trying to fight for me, and yet constantly weigh that against them knowing The Smiths were able to take better care of me. I kept in contact with my parents, but I feel like my real family are The Smiths. They’re always checking in, they STILL have my bedroom for whenever I come home, they treat me like one of their own.\n\nNow, the last time I saw my mother, she was displaying some mild cognitive decline as well as some motor impairments that MAY suggest early-onset Parkinson’s disease. I asked her if she still sees her primary care provider, which she does, and I implored her to schedule a physical. At this point, I realize I may be responsible for her when she eventually gets too old or sick to work. My brother lives close to their home, but he has two young children he is providing for. I know it’s only a matter of time before she starts asking me to “lend” her money. Am I the asshole for wanting to cut my ties with her completely in order to save myself time and money later on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would love to gain the perspective of parents and older adults, especially.

I've held back politics from family for a really long time despite very strongly held beliefs because it's impolite and causes rifts. I know some of the extended family have supported Trump in the past and today was my breaking point.\n\nWhen I saw the president had threaten violence against the left I decided I had to say something. I feel everyone has been stuck in a wait and see mode while things degrade because what happens in the news hasn't effected them yet. It was a threat directed at people like me from the most powerful man on the planet. I decided that it was time to raise the issue with those that are closest to me that I know don't all agree with me.\n\nI am aware that wide spread violence is an outside chance for America and that targeted violence (like the MAGA bomber) has been most of what the president has inspired. But. Somewhere between nothing happening and being dragged into the town square you have to say or do something and this was my line.\n\nMy mother has been distraught that I posted it because it might insight conflict on what she terms as 'her connection to her family' but I don't know how I'm supposed to sit at Thanksgiving with people okay with a president that threatens violence against me. The threat is more latent than a guy with a gun to my head but backed (potentially) by the most powerful military the world has ever known.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe family text is dead silent, my mom is distraught, I'm stressed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

We then got back together 4 years ago and have a 2yr old girl. Our son is ADHD/ASD and am his registered carer and worked fulltime until we had our daughter 2 years ago. I'm now in Crohns flare up and struggling with depression (which is why I'm now questioning myself) and am a housewife whilst I am ill.\n\nMy SO hates his job, but as he is not able to drive and has no qualifications he is kinda stuck. He works 35hrs a week over shifts anywhere between 6am and 11pm 4/5 days a week.  On his days off he sleeps in and I make him breakfast when he gets up, then lunch is broughtto hkm and then I do dinner. Hes never once got up with our daughter or son at night or in the morning. He then on goes the xbox and he plays until stupid oclock the following morning. All the while I am doing the school runs, childcare, chores, shopping, visiting family all by myself with our 2yr old nearly always with me. He has never had to do single thing with the house. I am the decorator, handy woman, taxi driver, organiser and the one that does 99.9% of the childcare. I often spring surprises on him to cheer him up and because I love him, like a mcds brekkie or a new Xbox game to show how much I appreciate him.  On the other hand, I buy myself my Christmas/birthday presents from him and mothers day is usually something from his work and he hasn't gone out of his time or way to get it.\n\nToday is his day off and payday. It's been a hard month and I am feeling low and am in pain. I cannot remember the last time we did anything together or he left the house on a day off. I feel like an arsehole as he is the main provider and works his arse off despite hating it so much.  He sleeps in the dining room 6 out of 7 days, doesn't go out with me, and never helps with childcare, and I'm lonely. I tried talking to him about it and I've been told I've now ruined his day off.... am I in the wrong?\n\n",

We both applied to PhD programs and she got into several while I've been rejected by about half of the schools I applied to. Granted, I might get into one, but I have a bad feeling that I won't. I've been stressing out because, even though I know I could work after finishing my master's, a part of me will feel like a failure for not immediately going into a PhD program because that's what's expected of me by my family.\n\nOne day, my friend and I ran into each other and she spent almost an hour basically talking about how tough it is to choose a school. I'm so proud of her for getting into these programs because she has worked so hard for everything she's gotten, but it still annoyed me. She makes it seem like such a tough decision and I get that, but also it felt insensitive to talk to me about that when I haven't even been accepted to one PhD program yet...or at all.\n\nI know that part of the reason she got accepted and I haven't is because she took a year off school before master's to get work experience. I just went straight for my master's.\n\nSo, AITA? Any thoughts?",

I have body image insecurities, being only 90lbs, I'm trying to gain weight but it's a process due to a few medical issues. They will find photos of me and post them, saying how \"sickly\" I look and how I apparently look like I'm on meth, which obviously isn't true. It'd be one thing if I didn't know about it, but I always end up coming across the comments somehow. I just mentally cannot handle the comments about my body, I feel sick every time I read them. If I didn't want to keep in contact with select friends and family, I'd probably stop using Facebook altogether. I've asked my husband to take all photos of me down if he's going to continue his childish game because he apparently doesn't know how to lock down his profile. He thinks I'm overreacting.

      "description": "So my mom has been in my life for maybe 10 of my 20 years? And that's being generous. For those 10 she was high or in jail for most of them.\nFor the years she was there, my mom would steal my prescription medication just to get a quick high.\nAbout five years ago she got arrested for possession of marijuana. After she got out of jail she had a child. For these five years she lived with an abusive man and had _another_ child with him, since she could CLEARLY take care of the other three. (/s)\nShe had been living in a different state for years, and even went AWOL a few times. Recently she got arrested for shoplifting some candy bars. Turns out she had a warrant out for her arrest _for shoplifting_ in my state, so the cops from her state transfer her here. After she gets out she gets my grandfather to call me and tell me how much she misses me and wants to see me. She asks if I can go over to my grandparents house to meet her. (By now I have moved out and am living with friends.) I was a little skeptical, but eventually said yes.\nIt starts off fine enough, her saying how she missed me and weaving a sob story of how her and Bob(not actual name of her boytoy) are getting evicted from their house, and how my baby sisters are in custody of Bob's exwife. She starts off saying how my grandpa is going to drop her off at a bus to go back to her state, but then starts making excuses. \"Oh, I dont have a phone. You need a phone to do anything now a days.\"\nEventually it gets too late for her to grab a bus. She starts asking my grandparents if she could stay one night. Now here is where I make a huge mistake. A bus stop isnt far from where I live, so I foolishly tell her she can stay a day and get on the bus tomorrow. (Getting the ok from the actual owner of the house.)\n_Sigh_\nWhat starts as one night extends. She then starts asking me to buy her a phone. And I mean pestering until I say yes to get her to shut up. She also gets pissed whenever I refuse to buy her food. Even though there is food at the house, she \"doesnt want to impose on the owner.\" Despite the owner giving her the ok to eat.\nSo eventually Friday comes around. I have a Dnd session on Fridays with some online friends. I've been doing this for about a year now, and told the owner of the house(and my mom) id be busy on Friday.\nDoesnt stop her from barging in every ten minutes. Eventually the internet goes out, and I find out Z, the friend of the owner of the house who DOES NOT PAY RENT I MIGHT ADD had turned off the internet because i wouldnt spend time with my mom. He then threatens to kick me out (something he CANT DO) unless I spend time with my mom. I tell him to mind his own business and go back to my room. \nGranted the days my mom had stayed I spent the bare bones amount I could with her, but I just didnt want to spend time with someone who had been stealing from me my whole life.\n\nWas I the asshole? \n",

We were both there for each other for EVERYTHING. Every milestone you could have in as a teenager into adulthood. I deeply care about her and I currently have uneasy feelings about her boyfriend/fiance (i don’t know). They have only been dating for like 7 months and she announces that she’s pregnant. At first, like any other person, I’m ecstatic and about to cry about the news! I was genuinely happy for her and then reality checked in. She has a full ride scholarship to our University, she’s very intelligent and has almost all A’s. She says she will still finish school but i’m unsure about that or at least it’ll be so difficult. She doesn’t have a job. She’s also almost broken up with her boyfriend several times (she comes to me every time she considers it) She even emotionally cheated on him (texted some guys because she got bored of him). Her parents are completely against the pregnancy and being terrible to her which causes her so much stress and has caused her to be cut off from her family. Now I feel like she’s rushing her life; she says “Me and (BF) are getting married” “we are getting an apartment together” like she’s 19 turning 20 this year, only has been dating him for 7 months, and almost breaks up with him every month. I haven’t expressed any disagreement with her and have been super supportive...however I told my boyfriend that it’s fucked up but getting a miscarriage is the best thing that could happen for her. (she would never get an abortion). I said I have literally nothing to gain or lose from her having a child but in her best interest she shouldn’t have a child. My boyfriend was totally upset with me saying that in private and said it was messed up and rude. Then the other night she called me at 12 AM saying she wasn’t pregnant anymore. She was bleeding and went to the doctors and found out she had a miscarriage. I cried and was sad because that is a traumatizing thing to go through and I feel horrible for her. Now my boyfriend is saying I am a horrible friend and that i was just faking being sad because obviously I wanted her to have a miscarriage. I tried to explain that I wasn’t HAPPY it happened I just want the best for her.m even though it’s tragic her future has so much potential.\n\n",

      "description": "So some backstory: I've known a group of friends for exactly ten years now. There was one friend in particular who we'll call D. D was very problematic and hated me in the early years but eventually we became close. I was one of the few friends D genuinely liked, as he manipulated everyone else.\n\nA few days ago, I received news on his Twitter that he had committed suicide. The posts claimed to be from his husband who said he didn't know how to use Twitter, and that D killed himself on the 18th. Naturally, since I and his friends were all so close, we were devastated. I nearly had a panic attack and some friends were crying nonstop.\n\nA few days later we obsessively looked for any information regarding any obituaries for D or confirmation that he was dead. A friend of mine managed to get a hold of one of D's uncles. \n\nThe uncle confirmed that D is alive and well.\n\nIt gets worse. Seconds after it was confirmed he's alive, D's Twitter was deleted. And a few hours later his other social media accounts went down too, which is especially shady since the husband claimed that he didn't have access to his other accounts.\n\nWhile the rest of D's friends are relieved that he's okay, I'm personally really hurt. I feel like this is the last straw for him as he's done some shady things in the past and this caused me and my friends all great pain. If I ever see him again, I don't know what I'm going to say to him, but I don't know if I want to deal with him anymore. This was a friendship that lasted ten years and this whole situation feels like a big slap in the face to me and my group. I don't know if I can forgive him.\n\nWIBTA if I cut this friend off?",

We meet via mutual friends and I've known that I liked her for a few months now. \n\nAbout three weeks ago I was completely honest and told her through text how I felt about her and that I've been wanting to tell her for a while now that I liked her and asked how she felt back. She told me that's she glad I got that off my chest but proceeded to tell me she didn't feel the same back and saw me as a friend only. I was a little hurt because I really really do like this girl and was hoping that she would like me back. After I asked would she say yes if I asked her out in which she responded, \"Probably not.\" \n\nI didn't take that as a clear no so over the pass three weeks I've been talking to her still over text and throwing hints that I wanna ask her out and every time I bring it up she would give the same \"Probably not\" response. \n\nThough the pass week everytime I call her she won't answer and she barely responds to my texts anymore.  About two days ago was the last time I asked her if she would say yes and she just told me she didn't didnt want to talk to me for a while and that she'll cut me off if I continue to ask. I told her that I understand and that I'll stop bringing it up for now.\n\nNext week our friend group is planning on going out somewhere to hang and I'm planning on asking her out in person maybe in front of our friends and see what she says because I truly believe she's just too shy to say yes and think she needs a little motivation. I think of myself as a decent  guy and never have been rude or disrespectful to her the 2 years I've known her. \n\nAm I the asshole for continuing to pursue her? I am giving her the space she asked for.  \n\n",

      "description": "Hi there, this is my first reddit post so I'll try to be as descriptive as I can. So a few months back I had gone to an artist I really liked to ask them for a commission. They agreed and I started to talk to them about what I had wanted done.  I tried to be as polite and friendly as I could as I one, really liked their art, and two understand how stressful being an artist online can be. Communication always seemed to be a bit slow, which I could deal with, but eventually nearly a month had gone by and I still hadn't heard anything. For me communication is pretty important, especially when I would've been spending quite a bit of money to get my artwork done. I was a bit nervous about getting the progress emails, and I simply didn't want to wait months on end to get my art piece done.\n\n I contacted them to inform them that while I thanked them for their time I was going to cancel my commission, and I informed as to why as I think it's important to give a reason; that the communication was a bit too lacking for my tastes and that they appeared to be a bit too busy to finish my commission by the time I need it to be done. They replied saying that they had been moving housing situations, something they hadn't told me about, and there were other people in front of me on the list, another thing they didn't tell me about. They then accused me of thinking they were a machine, and stated they'd refuse to take any more commissions from me. It had all seemed very passive aggressive. And I don't really mind if they don't want to take commissions from me, it's their decision but it had me thinking whether I was in the wrong or not. I guess it's just been eating at me as of late.

      "description": "Been married to my wife for five years. We are very comfortable around each other. I also love my wifes ass, and am still very attracted to her. It has sort of become an unspoken thing between us that if I see her cooking or standing with her back turned I'll playfully grab her ass, she will feign surprise and then giggle, laugh, or kiss me. Sometimes she will grab me back.\n\nKeep in mind that we have been married for five years and have gone to several events together. I have done this before and no one said anything, and both she and I enjoyed it.\n\nOk, so because her family couldn't meet up with us for news years we had a belated new years BBQ at her sisters house. Me and my wife are tag teaming the grill. I see her at the grill, and I grab her ass, she responds playfully. Later I am pulled aside by her sister and her husband. \n\nThey say that I shouldn't be sexual in front of their children, who are admittedly younger kids. That was her husbands position. \n\nMy sister in law takes it a step further into what I imagine is crazy territory. She says that I shouldn't be groping her without consent, even if she does approve of it later. She tells me if her sister didn't like what i was doing after the fact, that I could technically be jailed for sexual harassment and rape. For grabbing my own wifes rear. Now I am from texas and they are california implants, so we disagree on a lot of things, but I never thought they would hold positions like that.\n\nI am at their house and I don't like fighting, so I apologize and move on but I am silently angry throughout the party. I told my wife and she said her sister was completely in the wrong. Well come to find out my sister in law told the same to my mother in law, who agrees that im apparently a creep.\n\nAITA for groping my wife at a family bbq?",

      "description": "Okay so awhile ago I made a post about the incident I'll describe below and besides getting down voted into oblivion a lot of people left comments that I was waking up deciding to be a victim and got called unreasonable and one comment that the mods deleted because it was so rude. So it's clear a lot of people didn't agree with me\n\nNow, onto the story. First thing I'm autistic and in my early 20's second here's the scene, I'm waiting in line at a restaurant to place my order before I sit down, I'm next in line when I felt a hand touch my arm and some random old woman I don't know says \"What are those?\" at first I thought she just wanted a closer look and turned my arm so she could see it better and said \"oh these?\" she grabbed my arm and turned it to see the rest of my sleeve and said \"all those tattoos\" while shaking her head.\n\nAt this point I was freaking out a little I don't like confrontation and she was still touching me, then she said something about her granddaughter and basically scrunched my shoulder. I looked at her like she was crazy and literally ran away to go hide in by my mom who had already ordered.\n\nI felt kind of violated and decided to make a post about personal space because you should respect personal space no matter who you are. Obviously I didn't feel threatened by this lady but her touching me still made me uncomfortable and I ended up having a fit later in the day. The reaction I got on my last post made it seem like i was the asshole for being upset so Reddit AITA?",

      "description": "Ok, this is a little bit lengthy but I'll try to make it short.  \n\n\nAlright, Here's what happened. So, I don't like this girl named Mercy(Not real name), she is very egotistical, rude, entitled , and bratty. She has a gaggle of followers who are basically clones of her. I don't like them either. So, the story starts when, in English , we have a assignment to write a argumentative essay. I chose to write about how a certain political belief is unnecessary, and stupid. Go up to present my report. And the girls apparently don't agree with me. They decide to handle this discussion with dignity and respect as they interrupt me as I'm speaking, and start yelling at the teacher to stop letting present my report.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStrike one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next incident happens when we are in bible class ( we are in a christian school) and for some reason we are praying, as a dumb  joke with my friends, I flip my eyelids as we are praying. The girls hear my friends laughing, and get very upset. As we transition to another class, The girls are yelling at me about how I was disrespectful. Then in the class I am threatened with violence if I don't \"Shut up\". I go to office about this, and they bring the girl who threatened to \" beat the crap out of me.\" Is in the office. She denies doing anything wrong and refuses to apologize. I try to make peace, but she is not having it. Then her twin sister walks up to the door. This is the crap that went down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOffice lady: Hello?\n\nTwin: Oh, hey this is my sisters stuff.\n\nOffice lady: Thanks.\n\nTwin: Hey Gavin(my name)...\n\nOffice Lady: No, Twin this is not your conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, the twin sister tries to push open the door with force. I know this sounds like crap that belongs in r/thathappend But, I'm not joking. Office lady pushes back and locks the door.  After that she tells us to go to our class. As I'm walking to Literature class the girl is yelling at me insults, pretty petty ones at that. But then shes says this:\n\n\"Can you not hear me? I guess you'r just like the rest of your family.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I am very open talking about my families hearing problem. My dad needs hearing aids, my grandmother is deaf, and my aunt also needs hearing aids. I think I told her this once through a group discussion (dumb decision) . I proceed to scream at her telling her to shut up about my family. The kids from the bible class hear and open the door. And I walk to class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStrike two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis incident is pretty short. I get called to the office because of \"Disturbing reports about my behavior.\" I'm pretty worried about it, and sit in the office for fifteen minutes as I wait for the office people to finish up. As they tell me to come in they tell me basically this.\n\n\"Mercy's parent's emailed us that you said that her original parents didn't want her.\"\n\nMercy is a adopted girl from Ethiopia. I said none of what they described. I tell them that that never happened. I get sent to my final period and as I go home my parent get a call saying that Mercy's recount of the incident was inconsistent. \n\nStrike three.\n\nSo, I'm trying not to make this sound like a SHP, but I honestly am looking for verification. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\nGet into massive drama with these girls, I am rude, and they insult me about my family, and tell fake stories in the office.  \n\n  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ",

      "description": "My wife has a habit of doing this and I've told her in the past that  it makes me uncomfortable so today I stood my ground. When we finish shopping at the grocery store, we will get in line and after a while she wanders off and starts picking up more stuff (mind you it's usually just one or two items, not a whole cart full). I'll be at the self checkout ringing up the purchases and she will walk past everyone in line and add her extra stuff to the cart. Today I told her to put it back or go to the back of the line. As far as I'm concerned it's cutting, I get upset when other people do this and I feel like a total hypocrite when I let her do it. She told me I was being irrational and that nobody cared. I told her that it didn't matter and I wasn't going to help her cut, if she knew she wanted to grab more things then she should have done it before announcing that she was all done and ready to go. It's a minor issue, we didn't get into a fight and she took the item (a tray of muffins) back. But I'm curious what others take on this is. AITA?",

Fine, I understand this game is a pet peeve of hers and I do my best to never touch this game around her, and I've been doing a pretty good job of not playing around her. \n\nTonight though, she was on her laptop watching a television show and not really socializing or talking to me much (I have no problem with that at all). Because she was watching her show, I thought it would be okay to pull out my phone and play the game.\n\nThe second I opened up the game my girlfriend smacked my phone out of my hands and it landed on my face and hurt kinda bad. Out of instinct I angrily said \"Are you fucking retarded??\" To be honest, I was shocked those words came out of my mouth, and she was too. She was pretty hurt about it, and for the first minute afterwards I sort of defended myself saying \"You shouldn't have smacked my phone out of my hands that really hurt my face\" but afterwards I felt really bad about what I said and apologized. \n\nShe's mad at me and offended at what I said even though I tried explaining it was an honest slip of the tongue mistake.\n\nAITA??",

      "title": "AITA for not being able to forgive my father after he cheated on my mom?",
      "description": "It was around 4 years ago, I was 14 at the time (now I’m soon-to-be 18). My dad cheated on my mother with another woman, who also had two little kids (I have a younger brother). It was devastating for me, because we always had a special relationship, so I couldn’t accept it at first. He left home shortly after to live with this woman and because my mother told him to. He was seeing us every other weekend. \n\nLong story short, this woman was insane. So he came back. I don’t remember quite how it happened, but I think mother forgave him. But he never apologized to her, ever, not even to this day. And he became such a dick to all our family. He began drinking so much that one time he came without his phone and cursed at us telling us that it’s our fault (that’s what’s irritating about him - he loves himself so much that he thinks it’s everybody else’s fault, but not his). And it kept happening. Before that I had never intervened any fight my parents were having, because I was scared. But soon enough I started to feel disgust towards the person who once I have considered important, so I became much more brave. And I got into personal fights with him, and then he told me how miserable and stupid I was and that I have no friends.\n\nSo one day he came home drunk as hell, like, CRAZY drunk. I was in my bedroom, when I heard my mom and him having a fight (my brother was asleep). He was telling her how shitty of a person she was, how fat she is, and he was laughing while telling that, and that’s what made me so fucking angry. I was filled with rage and disgust and so much hate towards father. I remember screaming at him and asking him to leave this house immediately. I could not take it any longer. So he went to his parents’ house to spend the night, but came back next evening. And he just could not understand what he did wrong, why are we so angry at him. It felt like I was about to throw up, because I was filled with hate. How can you be that delusional? How can you so easily betray your family, your wife (now ex-wife) and your children, and then not be able to accept that it’s your fault? \n\nMy mother forgave him. When I asked her why, she started crying and said that it’s because of my brother, that maybe it would be better for him. I still don’t understand that, but maybe that’s because I’m not a mother. \n\nHe isn’t paying bills, you can say he isn’t working at all, he gets money once a three months or something, so my mother is an only source of the income. Father is always annoyed with her. He doesn’t care for me at all. I want to be a biologist, and I have to pass on chemistry, too, but he always told me that chemistry is shit and he never understood it, so it would be better for me to become a mathematician instead (my grandad - his father - has a PhD in physics and math, and father also was a math teacher long ago). He is also complaining about my mom to ME, and when I tell him that I don’t want to listen to his bullshit, he starts telling me what a burden me and mom are and how tired he is because of us even though he’s, quote: “not touching anybody”, like some fucking angel or something.  Then he tells me I’m stupid and how he is annoyed with me talking like that to him. And if I cry, he will tell me: “Just fucking stop, I never said a bad word to you”. \n\nMy mom now says that their relationship is better than before. I love her so much and I want to support her. But it’s been bugging me for months. I think I’m going insane. My bf tells me that I should just let it go, because we are going to leave for uni soon, but I don’t feel like I can. Maybe I don’t understand something? Maybe I am the a-hole here and I just don’t see how he’s improved since he came back? ",

      "description": "AITA for sleeping with my brother’s boyfriend?\n\nTo make things clear, I’m a 17 year old girl (almost 18, senior in high school), and my brother is 18 and openly gay. His boyfriend is also 18, and I always assumed he was gay until now. They’re both freshmen in college.\n\nI’ve always been fairly close to my brother, and he invited me to stay with him and his boyfriend for the weekend. I got there on Friday night and the three of us hung out and smoked and stuff. My brother went to work in the morning, so it was just me and his boyfriend in their apartment.\n\nHe started telling me about his and my brother’s sex life, which I thought was weird but didn’t really say anything. He asked about mine, and I told him so was a virgin. Things escalated from there and he ended up asking me to sleep with him so he “could be sure he really didn’t like girls.”\n\nI feel like I should have said no at this point, but I didn’t because I don’t really get a lot of attention from guys. I think I just got really red and changed the subject. He dropped it for a bit, but then he started saying that it would be humiliating to go to college a virgin and that I should just get it over with. I’ve thought the same thing before, so I ended up caving and sleeping with him.\n\nIt was pretty awkward during and after, and we both agreed to just forget it ever happened. I left on Sunday and started getting bombarded with texts from my brother ten minutes after I left. I guess his boyfriend felt guilty and told him. My brother was being really mean, so I just told him I didn’t care and blocked his number.\n\nMy mom made me talk to my brother on the phone last night. He said me and his boyfriend were equally to blame for this situation, but I disagree. I I don’t think any of this is my fault and this is all on his boyfriend. I’m not even sure I really did anything wrong. It’s the person doing the cheating whose job it is not to cheat. That’s on his boyfriend. I also confronted him about how he and his boyfriend have an open relationship, but he said that’s different because they usually talk about who they’re sleeping with. I didn’t apologize because I don’t think I have anything to be sorry for.\n\nI also want to make it clear that I don’t feel like I was raped or assaulted in any way, as the age of consent in my state is 17. His boyfriend is only like a year older than me.",

      "title": "AITA for snapping at my bf in front of his friends? [UPDATE] (also, AITA for the new developments?)",
      "description": "Hi everyone. A few people asked for an update, and I found the time and energy to write one, so I thought I would make one, but **this is pretty long**. My original post can be found [\\[\\[HERE\\]\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a1zy3p/aita_for_snapping_at_my_boyfriend_in_front_of/). TL;DR of that post was my bf and “friends” occasionally made sexual jokes about me even though the jokes made me uncomfortable. Even though I told my bf to stop before, my post was about snapping at my bf at dinner with friends to stop the jokes. My bf got mad at me, told me not to speak to him like that, and called me emotionally abusive. That’s the gist. Pretty much all the comments said I was not the A-hole. Thanks to everyone who commented on that.\n\nI posted that on November 30 I believe. It’s now December 3rd, and even though its only been a few days, a lot has happened. So much stuff I never expected that I can’t believe its happened. It’s really been a whirlwind since I made my post. Some people wanted an update so I wrote down some of the stuff that happened so I could remember it all.\n\nTo keep this post relevant to the sub, I’m still asking for feedback about if I am the A-hole for anything, etc. **A TL;DR is at the bottom.** AITA?\n\nFirst off, I went to break up with him on the morning of December 1, though it quickly turned into a mutual breakup as my now ex didn’t seem upset about breaking up. It was surprising actually, it was very civil. He even said something like “we had rough times but in the future I will look back at us with fond memories.” This surprised me a little but I just wanted to leave so I essentially just said “same” and left. Only a few minutes after leaving I felt a huge weight had been lifted off my chest.\n\nAnyway, later that day on December 1st, I was just doing some stuff to relax, like watching funny youtube videos. I tweeted something like “I just laughed the hardest I have in a while, it felt really good” and thought nothing of it. It’s like me to tweet random pointless things so this wasn’t out of character for me. A couple hours later, I get a lot of angry texts from my ex (I didn’t block his number because the breakup seemed civil and I just forgot about it). He was attacking me for my tweet, called me a machine with no emotions, like a robot, and said other things like “just get out of my life you absolutely mean person.” He said I never actually cared about him. There were some cuss words in there and a lot of caps lock. I just kind of freaked out, tried to deescalate the situation, etc, but my ex was having none of it and eventually stopped replying. I did too and tried to ignore it all. By this point our “friends” knew about the break up.\n\nSo yesterday on December 2nd, I woke up feeling bad/angry about the situation so I messaged all my “friends” that I wanted to talk about some things with them. I didn’t say it but I wanted to talk about the jokes and one other thing: in the couple of months before the break up, I noticed that my friends kept ditching plans with me to do them with my bf. For example, twice I asked everyone if they wanted to see a new movie together. They said yes and we set a tentative date. However, both times I would message them about the movie, and they revealed they had already gone to see it with my then bf. This happened twice, even though the second time I offered to buy all the tickets. Nothing like this happened when one of the guys would make plans.\n\nThey agreed to talk. It went well at first but my ex didn’t show because, as I later found out, he was “too scared” of me to come. Anyway, the talk went well and I thought most of the issues there were resolved. At the end of the talk my bf texted one of the guys and said he was too scared to come because I emotionally abused him. To my knowledge this was the first time the guys heard this because they didn’t know what my ex was talking about.\n\nWe left the discussion and one of the guys went over to talk to my ex. Soon after I got a message from this guy. He said he wanted me and my ex to talk things out. I was skeptical and didn’t want to but he kept pressuring me to do it so I gave in. This guy told me to basically let my ex “walk all over me” by not arguing with my ex, because my ex was feeling too sensitive and upset for confrontation… so why would he want to talk? But whatever…. I just did it so everyone would get off my back and to try to get some closure. So yesterday night I talked to my ex from like 11pm to 1am. A lot of stuff was said and I don’t remember it all. But a few things stood out to me.\n\nFirst, my ex defined me emotionally abusing him as a couple things: the incident at dinner, overall emotional incompatibility, life goals that were already interfering with each other (?), clashing personalities, and finally that me “abusing” him was “not my fault.” So I was very confused. I don’t think these count as abuse?\n\nI then tried to tell him how I felt. These included: he brought up his struggle with mental illness when we would argue and I felt like he would try to manipulate me with it; he got frustrated at me when I didn’t want to spend all my free time with him; told me asexuality was an “issue” to “get over” when I was questioning myself; and finally, he would pressure me into sex. He did this a decent amount. He would say he needed sex to relieve tension and feel better. When I would cry during sex he would get upset as well but then convince me to keep going by saying “we’ll both feel better if we finish it” so I just always gave in and obliged. I rarely wanted sex with him, especially more recently, but always consented just to get him off my back. I felt gross doing this but I thought it would’ve been better to just deal with it. I didn’t tell him all of this because I didn’t want to make him mad, it’s just how I felt. Especially being pressured into sex in a past relationship, it really sucked, but I’m glad its over now.\n\nANYWAY, when I tried to explain ANY of this to him, he would not take any responsibility for it, even though I never said “I blame you for \\_\\_\\_\\_” or anything. One thing I remember is when I told him about feeling pressured into sex, he said that he only ever did something like that because he felt neglected or because he was frustrated with me for “something I did or didn’t do” in the time between sexual encounters. I felt really bad about this but didn’t really know how to respond so I did kind of end up letting my ex “walk all over me.” I also didn’t want to make a scene because we were in a semi-public place and didn’t want to look weak by leaving early. Also I was worried if I got angry he would have more evidence for me being abusive. Eventually it ended and I left.\n\nBefore I left he told me that his family, who I have met and got along with, now hates me.\n\nI thought (hoped) that could be the end of things but earlier today (Dec 3) something else happened. I tried reaching out to a couple of the friends I felt closer to, but something was weird. In a couple of classes I had with the guys, they seemed to avoid me more than usual so I asked what was up. They said my ex was really “messed up” by what happened and they want to focus on making him better so can’t focus on me, or something. They mentioned that my ex had been in their room crying for a few hours. I told them that I was being falsely accused of stuff but they were all like “we don’t really know what happened but (ex) is more torn up than you so we need to be good friends to him.”\n\nSomething about this just rubbed me the wrong way, so after I was done with classes I wrote a document that was basically a letter to the group chat. It basically said that I was being falsely accused and my “friends” were blindly giving in and devoting themselves to my ex. I told them that I was cutting them off and told them to not contact me again.\n\nI did this kind of at the advice of redditors who commented on my original post, and partially on impulse, so I feel kind of bad about doing it. They might think I was being an emotional, rude bitch and shit talk me behind my back? I don’t know. None of them have contacted me, so that’s good obviously, but I can’t help but feel that I am owed an apology. But it really hurts because I’ll see some of them in class, and I’m basically left with no friends. These guys were my only friends at school, all I have are some acquaintances left, nobody I could text and be like “hey want to hang out?”\n\nSo while I’m happy about the break up, I feel so crappy because I have no friends left and it almost feels worse. I’ve just been watching funny youtube videos and doing homework. It’s been helping, but at this point I’m overall just numb I guess?\n\nAITA for any of this? And once again thank you everyone for your helpful comments.\n\n**TL;DR:** lots of stuff happened. My now ex continued to accuse me of abuse. “Friends” weren’t helpful. Ex wouldn’t take any responsibility. So I lost the ex, lost the friends. I’m now basically alone.",

      "description": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband has... or, had a cat which he adopted several years before we got together. We've since gotten a couple more, but he always considered that one to be his original fur-child. I loved her too, which is why it guts me to share what happened last week as I was returning home from work one night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cat is a full black cat, and she roamed around outside often - something that I always didn't like and made me nervous, since we live in a fairly busy area where there are a lot of cars going by. It was dark when I was driving home, it was night by the time I got off work and as I was coming down the street she darted across the road just outside our house, I didn't see her in time and... you already know what happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt absolutely horrible and I immediately parked the car in the driveway and broke down in tears. I couldn't even look at the cat without wanting to vomit - she was definitely dead - so I went inside, and my husband was also out at work so I was desperately trying to calm down and figure out how I was going to tell him. A couple hours later I'd calmed down a bit and was trying to draft up something to say, when my husband storms inside and starts yelling and swearing, going on about how some fucker ran down the cat, saying he was gonna be the shit out of whoever did it, etc. I understand he was just angry and really upset - normally he's the calmest person I've ever met - but at that moment his rage completely shocked me and I just sort of froze up, and I didn't have the heart to tell him I'd been the one to kill his precious cat, even by accident. I was worried he'd turn that anger on me, so I just let him think it was some random person and grieved along with him when we got her out of the street and buried her in the backyard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was about a week ago and the guilt has me eating me alive, but I feel like saying something now after all this time would be even worse than admitting what I'd done right from the beginning. So, AITA for not telling the truth to my husband about his cat?",

      "description": "So I've been friends with this girl (we're both in our early 20s) since we were toddlers. We had our ups and downs in our friendship but always stayed by each other's side. There were times when I felt like I was her \"side\" friend - she had moments when she wouldn't want to hang out but that was mostly in middle school and I guess we were all terrible back then. Through highschool and the beginning of college we relied on each other and saw each other nearly every week. Idk what happened recently but it seems like our friendship just disappeared overnight. She started trying to make a career as an \"influencer\" on instagram but didn't come far. She basically gave up on college, found a job in a bar and became extremely self-centered. We used to have normal conversations but now she can only talk about herself and it's really hard for me to just start a dialogue with her. She would also send me litteral essays as sort of \"updates\" on her life as we now live in different countries. It always felt kind of narcissistic to me but I let it slide at first. Then I realised that when I messaged her back she would almost never answer me. The essays were all I was receiving at that point. I then decided to just give up - she wouldn't take me seriously anymore and only used me as someone who would listen to her endless problems. I stopped responding to her messages as it was leading nowhere. It makes me really sad and angry at the same time to give up on a friendship that used to be strong but I have other friends I can rely on now and don't need the negativity.\nSo is there something else I could do? Or AITA for just giving up without an explanation?",

      "description": "Burner account cause friends know my main account \n\nBackground, I'm currently a junior in high school, friend is a senior. We were real close friends for 3 years. This happened a couple of months ago, but a recent argument with someone else brought it up again and I've always been worried I was in the wrong. Now I have the tool of this sub. \n\nSo me and her had an argument a few months back to which she blocked me for a petty reason (I already got judgement from others on that). A month goes by and I finally find I'm unblocked, ask her if she's still mad, and she says no. After this though, I have to initiate every single interaction, from talking to texting to spending time together (which she always declined). She didn't even say hello in the halls. Only on 2 occasions does she show any effort, once the day after I texted her where she came over and sat with me for the final 10 mins of a study hall we share and the week before Christmas break. \n\nShe asked to spend time with me on the coming Saturday but I had to decline as we had plans with family from out of town and would be gone the whole day. So over the first few days of break she occasionally sends me memes when we're not having a conversation, and those we do have I initiated. \n\nFast forward to the day after Christmas and she blows up on me (all through texting mind you) for never talking to her, never spending time with her, etc despite me always asking and texting nearly every other day. When I call her out on this, she responds with \"well you could say hi once in a while\" which rather confused me. \n\nOnce we both calmed down after more arguing, I tell her that if she's not going to put in any effort then neither will I. She reads this and blocks me and it remains that way now. I've made no attempt to fix it this time. \n\nWhich I why I come here. As I said, recent conversations brought this up again and I've had some people tell me to get into contact somehow and others say not to and I'm at a loss. I'm worried I didn't do the right thing, and am seeking more mature judgement. So, AITA for not trying to fix it this time? \n\nTL;DR friend gets mad at me for “not giving them enough attention” despite me initiating anything we do, blocks me when called out and given a choice \n\nI apologize for any formatting, grammar or spelling errors. I'm on mobile and its a bit late where I live. ",

      "description": "So this incident happened quite a while ago (around 5 years back) when I was in 6th grade and it was brought up recently when I told a really close friend of mine about the whole incident hoping to laugh over it, but he said it was an asshole move and that what I did was basically damage to property.\n\nSo back then I used to live in an apartment complex where I used to play with a bunch of my friends every evening. That is, until this woman moved in. We used to play cricket (a pretty popular sport in my country) right beneath her block and she would scream at us for absolutely no reason whatsoever- she once complained to one kid's parents and lied that our ball had damaged her hatchback. This one time the ball had landed in her balcony and she refused to give us our ball back.\n\nWe then decided to play football (or soccer) in this little field we had in our complex. It was pretty far away from this lady's house so we figured she can't possibly complain about that. We were wrong. This woman walks by our freshly mowed field on her evening walk and goes \"Don't play football here or you'll ruin the field,\" and goes on to say, rather angrily, that she needs the field to be in perfect condition so that she and her friends could walk on it. This pissed us off big time because there was A LITERAL PAVEMENT near the field where she could walk to her heart's content, but we decided not to make too big a deal out of it so we moved on to cycling (for which she yelled at us for riding too close to her car) and then onto badminton (for which she screamed at us for being too close to her plants, which she had planted real close to the badminton court in a spot that wasn't technically even her's).\n\nAt this point we had decided enough was enough and that we had to do something about her and get revenge. So I, along with a bunch of friends hatched a plan where three of my friends stood guard while I poured superglue into the old lady's car's tires. And that is exactly what I did. I squeezed every single ounce of glue out of my tube of superglue into the lady's four tires and made sure she couldn't fill them up without breaking the nozzle. \n\nMy reasoning was that she'd have to fill in her tires sooner or later and then she'd realise that her tires are fucked up and that she'd have to pay to replace all four of them and by that point she wouldn't be able to trace the deed back to us.\n\nWe quickly made our way out of there and I'm still surprised by the fact that we didn't get caught. I had attained legendary madlad status among my friends. Thankfully nobody snitched on me so that was cool.\n\nLooking back on this I kinda understand that the whole thing was a pretty rough thing to do to a late 50s, early 60s woman but imo she totally deserved it for being an absolute bitch to children.\n\nTL;DR I poured superglue into an old lady's tires because she was being a bitch about me and my friends playing.\n\nAITA?",

I told him that I wanted his support in a major decision, he’d be living there too and I wanted his input.

We live a couple hours away, but later this week we're driving up for the funeral services and staying for a night at a hotel. There's a wake and then a funeral the next day, and I know that in-between services, he's going to want to be at his parents house. I totally get that, and I really do love his family. \n\nHere's where I kinda feel like an asshole. I want to support him, but anytime there's the potential for us to spend more than 10 minutes at his parents' house, I get real anxious.  His parents are hoarders, and the house is filthy. They have a whole bunch of cats, and the litter box rarely gets changed, so the whole house smells like cat pee, and the bathroom situation is gross. When I'm there, I feel like I don't want to sit on or touch anything, because everything has a layer of dirt/pet hair on it. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and part of that is I'm a bit germaphobic, so it's really hard for me to be in the house for long periods of time. I've never been rude about it at all, and just tried to deal with it, but it seems to get harder every time. The easiest thing for me would just be for me to stay at the hotel, or for his family to come chill with us at the hotel. WIBTA if I don't stay with him at his parents' house that much? I want to be supportive, but I don't know what to do. Last time I was there, I had to dip out of Christmas early because I was on the verge of a panic attack (I said I was just tired, and everyone was understanding). I also know I should talk to him about this, but I don't want to add another thing onto his plate. As I type this out, I feel like maybe ITA, but I'm still curious about outside opinions. ",

      "description": "Been talking with a girl from tinder for about a week and a half.  We've met up once, had an awkward first kiss, and have kept in medium contact over the holidays (around 2-3 texts a day).  It's my first time on a dating app since my breakup a few months ago, and I've been having some decent success. However, I don't really know the scene, and since I'm far more used to being in the relationship I always wonder about how I should be conducting myself.\n\nThis girl is very cute, but is very much a different \"type\" than I'd normally pursue (which is nerdy, cutesy/innocent, awkward).  She's very sarcastic (which fluctuates between witty and pessimistic), she goes \"out\" far more than I'm used to, and she likes movies but doesn't seem like too much of a nerd.  I don't really know what this would mean for our long term prospects, but honestly I'm just trying to casually date, so that's not at the forefront of my mind.\n\nSo, being a straight up kind of guy and feeling like I can share more with her, I said \"you know, you're not my usual 'type' that I commonly pursue but I'm really enjoying this and looking forward to seeing where it goes\".  To which I received silence.\n\nThis morning she messaged me to tell me that what I said was \"offensive\" and that I'm basically saying she's not good enough for me.  I'm a pretty sympathetic guy, so I *can* see how she could take this the wrong way, but damn if there's not another part of my psyche throwing up red flags at this very moment.  Normally (in a relationship) I would just exhaustively talk to my partner to resolve the tension between us, but that's not really an option in the newly dating world.\n\nSo, AITA and should make it up to this girl?

      "description": "So I'm a student and work part time at the night shift at a very busy grocery store. A few coworkers and I like to show up half an hour early to work to play dominoes in the break room. A big part of us playing dominoes is the mind-game aspect of it. We like to confuse and insult other players to get them to lose their focus on the math involved in the game. Basically a lot of trash talking.\n\nAnyway, I'm playing with two coworkers before work last week, we'll call them E and P. We're all playing, talking smack to each other, making fun of each other and having an over all jolly time. We're cracking jokes about sexual relations with each others mothers, insulting each others' intelligence etc. etc.... All lighthearted in the spirit of the game. \n\nSo as we're playing, P puts down a domino and E says, condescendingly, \"It's ok P, everyone makes mistakes.\" And I say, \"Yeah, E, like your parents.\"\n\nSuddenly E and P go silent and shoot me the dirtiest of looks. I realize I must have gone too far and instantly apologize. Neither E or P talk to me for the rest of the game (5 min) and as we go to clock in as our shift starts E tells me, \"I didn't like that joke.\" I say \"I'm sorry, I went too far. I shouldn't have said that. It wasn't funny.\"\n\nThroughout the day I'm getting nervous, because that sort of reaction is not normal for the kind of joking we do. I go up to P later to ask if everything's OK and P tells me, \"You know E was adopted, right?\"\n\nMy heart sank instantly. I had no idea. \n\nI feel awful. If I had known beforehand that E was adopted I never would have made a joke like that. It was not intended as anything personal, just run of the mill trash talking. I feel like a jerk and that I ruined our friendship. I've been trying to find a way to apologize and explain myself, but E still won't talk to me. I want too let E know that I respect them and had I known their circumstance, I never would have made such a joke, but they won't give me a chance to explain myself. Anytime we're in a room together, E leaves before I can get a word in.\n\nAnyway, do you think its possible to redeem our friendship? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "A little context: \n\nI am a 16 year old male.\nI spent the majority of my Christmas holiday in Budapest, Hungary.\nI was there with my mother and younger brother.\nI only see my mother about twice a year as she lives in a different continent (my parents are divorced and I live with my father). \nMy mother has been a smoker for 25+ years. I have tried to talk her out of it but have failed each time.\nWe had been having a wonderful time in this beautiful city up until this point.\n\nSo...\n\nFor Christmas eve we had nothing really planned and expected to spend it in our holiday apartment as we normally don't celebrate such an occasion. My mum decided that it would be nice to have dinner at a nearby restaurant. I initially disagreed saying that everything would be closed due to the holiday. However it was eventually settled that, by the slight chance a restaurant would be open, it would be a much better evening to go out rather than being stuck inside an empty apartment.\n\nWe wandered the streets for a while and, in time, found a restaurant that was open. I noticed that a sign on the door stated that reservations had to be made prior, however I ignored it and proceeded into the restaurant with my mother and brother. Once in, we were told to wait as a table was being prepared. We waited around 10 minutes before eventually being led to a table at the back of the restaurant.\n\nThings seemed to be going well as we discussed what our next endeavours were as well as commenting on our surroundings in the restaurant (which included a very loud group of people sitting next to us) etc. Our orders were made and we continued to talk. My mother popped out for a cigarette leaving me and my brother at the table. Our food then came (not really important to the story, but I highly reccomend chicken paprikas) and we began eating. \n\nAfter a while my brother and I wondered what was taking our mother so long. \n\nShe came back into the restaurant with a stranger she had found outside. She commented that he was looking for some place to have a drink and that she offered him a seat at our table. I thought nothing of this at first but slowly started to get concerned.\n\nMe and my brother introduced ourselves as he sat down. My mother initiated a conversation that took up most of our time at the restaurant. \n\nHe mentioned that he was only in the country for 12 hours and that he had just arrived and had to be heading to a bus later.\n\nThe conversation continued until my mother decided to go outside for a cigarette leaving me and my brother alone with the man we had just met.\n\nAwkwardness would ensue as the conversation came to a halt. His questions also became a little bit more personal (directed mostly at me).\n\nMy mum came back telling us that the restaurant was kicking us out due to some prior reservations. We abruptly shook hands and said goodbye to the stranger (my mum seemed like she was in a hurry).\n\nAs we walked back to the apartment I began questioning my mother on her decision to leave us alone with the stranger (I have to admit I did this in an agressive fashion and that I fully regret my approach to her). She replied that everything turned out fine and that I was mature enough to deal with any situation that could have arised. I brought up certain scenarious that I would have no control over (eg. If my little brother was being touched under the table) and mentioned that this was unlikely to happen in her presence (my mother is quite intimidating unlike myself). She continued to deny that there was anything wrong with the situation putting an emphasis on me having to be responsible over my brother in any situation and that it was a sort of test of my courage. \n\nI began to get frustrated telling her that it was entirely irresponsible to leave us. She would then comment that I was like my father (she would often does this when she gets angry at me. I loathe the fact that she relates me to her vision of him; a narcissistic perfectionist. I often feel extremely sorry for my father who is set with the task of caring and bringing up me and my brother by himself with little help from her).\n\nThe argument continued almost all the way back to the apartment. The increasing tension and anger led her to walk in a different direction. I continued on the path to the apartment, turning around and seeing my mother jingle the keys and flick me off as she walked further away. I told my brother to continue to the apartment as I assumed she would not abandon us.\n\nWe got to the apartment eventually and waited for around twenty minutes until she came back angrier than ever.\n\nWe got inside and continued to argue. I told her that she is ironically too immature to be telling me to mature. She mentioned that she would refuse to talk as \"it is better to harbour anger inside you than taking it outside\" (my mother's second tongue is English and this quote is entirely misquoted), to which I responded that it was \"some bullshit\" she found on Pinterest. I continued to hurl insults at her \"spirituality\" (where she sought her answers. This was mostly in books about empathic abilities, chakras, indigo children, astrology, tarot cards and whatnot).\n\nI also mentioned a previous argument I had with her\n...\n[This happened about a year ago. During an emotional conversation I opened up to my mother and told her I was suicidal and found life utterly meaningless. We would get into an argument later on where I used the cliché line: \"sometimes I wish I was never born\" to which she responded \"well go and kill yourself then\". This would go on to impact me greatly (she has not apologised since)]. \n...\nand told her that she was so stubborn that she probably wouldn't have regretted saying what she did. She proceeded to flick me off again and walked out the door.\n\nI asked whether my brother agreed with me and found that he was on my side of the argument.\n\nMy mother would come back in an hour looking slightly tipsy completely ignoring me. She proceeded to the shower where I could hear her sob quietly. At this point I had to put in my headphones to mute the sound of her crying. \n\nI waited for her to exit and immediately apologised and was greeted by another \"fuck off and go to sleep\".\n\nA few hours later after going to my bed (which is the sofa in the living room), I heard my mum go to the kitchen. I got up and attempted to apologise again and I was met by the same fate.\n\nMy brother then came out about 20 minutes later telling me he had nightmares about the stranger and that he was scared about whether he had stalked us home or not.\n\nIt's now on two months later and the situation still lingers in my head.\n\nI want to state that, depsite being personally insulted by her first, I believe I was completely in the wrong for using ad hominem that had no relevancy to the issue and I have apologised multiple times - I have still been greeted by a blank silence .\n\n\nI also noted a couple things about the stranger:\n\n- He was tall, a little on the heavier side and had a clean look about him (he was clean shaven and had a new haircut). He was intimidating throughout the ordeal.\n\n- He greeted my brother saying \"You must be _____\". He then proceeded to greet me with his own name (which was also my name), and THEN asked for my name as he shook my hand. I responded to which he was surprised stating \"Oh. that's my name too!\". I found this quite odd at the time as I assumed my mum had told him our names prior (as he greeted my brother with his name). I would later question myself whether this may have been an incidental coincidence to \"break ice\".\n\n- He spoke broken English as it was his third language. He spoke quite confidently but lacked a sizable vocabulary. He would often look to either me or my mother to finish his sentences when he spoke. \n\n- He was unnaturally aggressive. He would often correct us when we spoke about certain topics that came into the conversation. (Eg. \"Our family originates from the South of ______ \" to which he would reply \"actually that's the East of ______\" and then continue basking in his prowess as he explained to us our history; to which we were already fairly familiar). I don't think much of this however, as he seemed to be entirely out of place as demonstrated by his certain mannerisms.\n\n- He would be quite physical with my younger brother at times, often nudging him and touching his hair for an unusual period of time and even kicking him jokingly under the table.\n\n- He noticed that my brother was uninterested in the conversation and offered to \"fuck off\" to which my mother said that everything was okay and that he should stay. I found this very bizzare as it was entirely unexpected.\n\n- He would ask very personal questions to me specifically. This included: \"Do you smoke weed?\" and \"What is your Gender and what are you interested in?\" (Insinuating my sexual preferences). I have to add that I have been told that I have certain feminine features, but this did not garner a question about my sexuality. I did not answer his question. I also found it quite bizzare that he asked these question as he was told I was 16 and that I am not very sociable (by my mother of course). I have yet to mention this to my mother as she was not paying attention at the time.\n\n*Furthermore, I would like to state that this may or may not have any pertinance to the issue at hand*\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I commented on my mother's irrational decision to leave me and my little brother alone in a restaurant with a complete stranger. We argued, hurling insults at each other, which ultimately led to me making her cry.\n\n\nNote: I apologise for the unusual length and structure. I am writing this on my phone as I am still in the process of building a new computer. It is also my first time posting to this subreddit and fourth time posting to Reddit in general (though I have been using the app f",

Another friend told me that she knew someone who had a crush on M, but she would only tell me if I gave her my word not to tell anyone, especially not him.

So she told me it who it was (let’s call that person S) and I stood by my promise and didn’t tell anyone. M eventually found out that S had a crush on him and also that I knew it but didn’t tell him and was really mad. I didn’t really understand his frustration as I didn’t think I did anything wrong. I knew that he wasn’t interested in S and I also really didn’t want to break a promise I gave. So now I want to know from you if I was a asshole ore if it was ok.",

      "description": "K(26F) was always on the fringe of my college friend group. She's pretty socially awkward but she came as a package deal with S &amp; was nice. She could've fit in, but her constant lying got in the way. Ex: We'd invite her to parties or bars &amp; she'd pretend she was too hungover to go out. Sometimes she'd say she changed her mind &amp; had gone to a different party without us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe hit a turning point with her last summer. The group planned a hiking trip in Peru. The permits for the trail &amp; mandatory tour guide were expensive &amp; we had to get them months early, so we all committed to training. Most of us are in shape, so we weren't too worried, but we still wanted to make sure the hike wouldn't be an ordeal. K sent our group text weekly training updates but seemed visibly worried the day before the hike. She ended up being voluntarily hospitalized for altitude sickness &amp; refused to give the rest of the group updates on what was happening to her. My friends &amp; I tried to explain her situation to the tour company to get her a refund. They called the hospital in front of us, confirmed that she was fine to hike, &amp; refused. We were embarrassed already, but even more so when she showed up ready to start the hike without ever acknowledging the huge lie she'd been caught in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hike turned into a nightmare. She fell hours behind the rest of the group, even with us carrying her things. We'd go ahead so we could grab lunch with the other hikers in our group &amp; then double back to reach K again &amp; bring her water refills. Our guides told us to go ahead &amp; let them stay with her. For the next 4 days, she'd enter camp hours after everyone else, delaying the meals for everyone &amp; not really acknowledging the guide/porters who were working double time to help her. She even had to be carried down the mountain by porters in the dark because her pace was so slow. I admire her for persisting in the hike but we (not to mention everyone else in our hiking group who hadn't signed up for this) got fed up with her making self-deprecating jokes constantly instead of just acknowledging she hadn't trained/thanking people for waiting/apologizing for the huge inconvenience she'd caused everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of our mutual friends wrote her off after that, but I've always felt bad for her since it's clear her lying is fueled by insecurity. I had lunch with her for the first time this year &amp; she started telling more ridiculous stories. I'd pretty much had it by then &amp; excused myself. WIBTA if I just called her out on all of the BS she's told us or is it kinder to slow fade her out of the group like the rest of my friends have done?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I have a friend who lowkey irritates everyone by BSing all the time and highkey ruined a trip with her behavior. WIBTA if I called her out on lying or is this a time when it's better to just let things go?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I went to Japan specifically after I had been told not to by my [hypocritical] club",
      "description": "This story is a bit complicated.\n   To begin I'm 17 and an exchange student in Taiwan.  While applying for the exchange process I selected my top countries those being; Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and India. (In that order) the order is important because the club I applied through tried to give your top choice to you based on grades and language skills. \n   After the strenuous application process I was selected to go to Taiwan. I won't lie, I was a bit disappointed but after delving into the language and culture of the island I was really excited to go. \n   Once there I met up with the family that would look after me for the year. I absolutely love the family I'm with. The mother is a bollywood/yoga instructor and the father is an easy going man who works with stocks. I have a host brother about 6 years younger than me who's main goal is to become the next Michael Jordan, he's already half way there cause his English name is Jordan. \n    About a month into my exchange they told me the club president had prepared a cruise to japan close to the end of the exchange and the the members of the club would like me to come. I accepted of course. I then spent 3 months on cloud nine.  I took up japanese classes on top of the chinese language course, my taiwan high school, and home country's schooling requirements. I ended up understanding Japanese fairly easily. Quite a bit of it comes from chinese and it's honestly easier to read/write/speak than chinese. I figured a trip to japan would help me better understand Taiwanese culture.  Considering  at one japan occupied taiwan. (Theres still japanese influence today due to close distance and immigration) \n\nFast forward to around December. Several fellow exchange students had been caught breaking the rules at the New Year celebration in Taipei.  One went to the hospital after drinking too much and passing out. She was fine but this led to everyone being questioned. Most of the students drank including myself. They decided to only punish the students who over drank and put them on house arrest. The rest of the students were let off the hook without repercussions. But during the drinking investigation a bigger issue became the focus.  A student (let's call her L ) came forward with a sexual [misconduct] allegation (I dont know how to call this. From what I know it was consistentual) . The perpetrator was a leading club official (I'll call him G). L claimed that during the first meeting G had come to her saying he wanted to take her sight seeing. After a few trips together, they slept together. The main issues with this were that he was a married man with children (infidelity can be punished with jail time here) and that the girl was under 18.  Shes technically legal within certain conditions. L then produced evidence with explicit texts and photos from him. They quickly and quietly removed him and we were told to keep quiet about it. Police weren't involved and our host parents weren't even informed.  The thing is that G had been the main orchestrator for events for the club for years. Apparently he admitted to having other exchange students sleep with him years prior.   Ultimately they covered everything up ignoring the laws and regulations in the country  and club regarding the issue (they never even informed his wife or fellow members in his club)\n\n    This pertains to the Japan trip I promise. \nEarlier this month my club reminded the main club of the upcoming trip. They quickly shut it down under the premise that the trip's last day landed on the same day of a mundane dance practice. My club pressed harder saying they'd already paid for my spot and said my host mom (the dancer) could catch me up on whatever I'd miss in the 3 hour practice. \nThe main club denied again saying that club events take priority. (Both events are club events btw) and that they could not bend the rules for me. \nThe rules state that I can travel internationally if and only if a club member or a host parent is with me. Both of which will be. Regardless of this they continued to deny me saying I would be sent home for breaking the rules and that the dance practice is more important to understand Taiwanese culture. I've already attended 3 of said practices and have memorized the songs. I'm unbelievably frustrated it's as if they're not giving me the actual reason . Ive tried comprising but the chairman wont even listen. The chairman is quiet and only speaks chinese everything is translated by his assistant. Maybe something is getting lost in translation. But under what rationale would a dance practice be a greater cultural experience than a trip to Japan which is a major influence on Taiwan? Couldn't I just make up the practice when i return?\nI asked what the punishment would be if I went anyway. His assistant told me I'd be sent home early for breaking the rules. Which now leads me to the who affair with the exchange student. The chairman cleaned up the affair with complete disregard to the rules for himself the student and the perpetrator. \nI've considered using  this against him. But I dont want to be THAT ASSHOLE. News of the affair would shut down the district cutting off a significant amount of foreign funds. He could also lose his position in the club. \n\n\nAgain, I'm not THAT ASSHOLE. but the thought did briefly cross my mind. \n\n\nI'm going to contact my district back home for leverage and I've come to reddit to see if I'm just being petty and should just take 'no' for an answer.  So AITA. any ideas that could be in my favor? When will I ever get another prepaid trip to Japan?",

      "description": "So I lent a friend of mine £500. He needed it to see him through til the end of the month and promised to repay me on payday. \nNot a problem, I trusted the guy and knew he was good for it. \n\nPayday comes and goes, no sign of the money. I sent him a message about it. He said “oh yeah, sorry I forgot, I’ll do that now” \n\nTwo weeks pass and still nothing. I message him again. He said he’d send me the money. Still nothing. He was then avoiding me so I wasn’t able to see him face to face. \n\nI messaged him again and he didn’t reply.\n\n7 months have passed since the day he promised to have the money back to me by. I’ve not been able to get hold of him, nor have I seen him. \n\nThis weekend just gone, I was out at a restaurant and I happened to see him as I was being seated at my table. He was on what looked like a date. \n\nNow at this point I could see he was acting kinda boasy because he had ordered about 5 starters. It’s worth noting that this is a pretty pricey restaurant. So I decided I’d go and say hello. \n\nI pulled up a chair at his table and started chatting to him about how he is and how I am etc. \n\nI then proceeded to pick up a fork and try a bit of the food. He looked a bit shocked, but it was good food so I tried something from one of the other plates. At this point his date (I’d learnt that this was their second date) said to me, “excuse me, but this is our food. What do you think you’re doing?” \n\nI looked at her and said “Well since I’m pretty much funding this meal, I figured I may as well sample what my money is getting.” \n\nI then said to my friend, “it was nice to see you, I’ll leave you to it. We can catch up another day.”\n\nI then left to go back to my table. The people I were with, a party of 10, had very mixed reactions to my behaviour. Some were in favour of what I’d done, others not so much. \n\nSo I’m asking you lot, AITA?\n",

      "description": "Ok. So from the title i'm gonna assume that i'm going to get ALOT of YTA's here but please bare with me.\n\nSo for context this happened maybe 10 years ago. late teens early 20s. Me and this friend (who ill call john) had been friends from school since we were around 15 years old. We had our group of friends and we were all young single so we would hang out maybe 2-3 times a week, mostly nerdy stuff occasionally going out drinking...long story short we were all a bit boring.\n\nNow about John. He was home schooled until he was 15. When I first met him social skills were not part of his personality. Thats changed a fair bit since then however. He's also very religious, church on Sundays yada yada. Until the moment we had this had never caused a single problem. I'm an atheist (as is most of our group) and he had never tried to shove it down my throat. All good.\n\nSo when we were in our early 20s we both still lived at home paying minimal rent. I was saving for a house so my parents said that because I wasn't wasting my money on trivial crap I could stay to help me save and his parents were just very accommodating. \n\nNow i'll point out im a big believer that if you want somehting, and getting it wont harm you or others you should get it. case in point, if i wanted a new car for say 10k, I have 10k but its for my wedding then that would harm someone, wont get it. but if we had that 10k, we were financial stable and no use then I don't see the harm. More to this later.\n\nAround this time one of our group moved states for work. John and him were very close (he was Johns best man at his wedding a few years ago) so of course John went to visit him. When he got back he told us that he wanted to move to that state as he absolutely loved it there.\n\nMe and John talked about this a bit and ill admit I didn't really want him to go, just had another close friend move and i didn't want to lose another one. But that said I could also see that this wasn't just a little thing he REALLY wanted to go. \n\nI've always been the friend good with money and he'd asked me a few times in the past for money advice when it came to bigger financial undertakings so I assumed he'd want me to work out what it was going to take.\n\nSo I did some maths and worked out that to be able to get over there and not live out of a box on the street he would need something like $5000. Now John lived with his parents and worked full time....Should be easy really.\n\nSo I spoke to John and told him this. At first he was happy but told me he didn't have that. Then told me he was $15000 in debt because of his car (instead of buying a new car he bought an old one full of issues and spent insane cash trying to fix it up).\n\nSo I told him that he could do what he wanted but to get over there without bankrupting himself he would have to do alot of work.\n\nand to this day I still remember his response \"No I wont, I'm just gonna keep doing what i'm doing and if God wants me to move then he'll give me a way\"\n\nI was a bit flabbergasted I asked what he meant and he basically explained that he agreed with me on what he would need but wasn't going to save and was just going to basically sit there and wait for a miracle to allow him to go with no work. he believed he's a good person and God would allow this.\n\nI told that if he put in a little effort it could be done in a year quite easily and he again told me he refused to give up his hobbies and God would do it for him\n\nFast forward 6 months and me and him were hanging out and he was in a bad mood...asked why and he's told me its because he should have been given a way to move by now and that its not fair. Mind you he's now 23k in debt towards more car stuff.\n\nI dunno I sorta snapped. I told him to grow up and that if you want something to work for it and that his belief that god will fix all his problems is holding him back from living his life. If he would accept that if you want something you have to work for it he could have been on his way to living there, instead his belief that god would do it for him has stopped him from being able to realistically do it at all.\n\nque fight. things were said\n\nLong story short we made up a few months later. I apologized but honestly not because I actually thought i was wrong, I just wasn't going to lose a friend over something so petty.\n\nJohn still hasn't moved, still likes working on cars and is married now (and yes attempted to throw in my face that god got him to stay so he could meet his wife....which is his way to justify not going) But I just ignored that one.\n\nSo AITA for telling him that his religion is holding him back? \n",

      "description": "This is a bit of a two-part story, but both follow the same theme: it feels like my mom just expects art from me.\n\n\nStory 1: the cow pictures\n\nI spent about a month taking photos of cows and fully developing the film and prints myself. I was so proud and they came out beautifully. I took my project home to show my mom, and I was trying to tell her about these cows that I got to know and how I figured out how to befriend them. The entire time I was talking, she was just picking and choosing photos and arranging them on the table. When I finally gave up trying to talk to her about the project, she just goes, \"what do you think of this arrangement?\".\n\n\"Well...for what?\"\n\n\"For the office I think, although they could go in the hallway too\"\n\n\"Well I'm keeping them and putting them up in my dorm\"\n\n\"Oh....well can you make more?\"\n\n\"It would take like...at least 10 hours\"\n\nAnyway, to sum up the rest of the conversation, she actually offered to pay me to print more. BUT WAIT! When I said I'd be up for that, she said she was kidding and couldn't believe I'd make her pay and blah blah blah. Like okay, I've had a ton of art stuff I've made over the years which I haven't cared about, so when she took it without asking and hung it up, it didn't bug me. But these are my cows, man. They became my friends. \n\nFast forward to this semester, about a year later, guess who's redoing some room in her house...my mother! And oh Jack, you know what would look perfect on that one wall? Lemme guess, my cow photos. Long story short, 3 times in 3 weeks she's asked for the damn pictures. They are hanging up on the wall at my apartment in a place of honor, and no, I don't even have one. And no, I don't want you sending the film off somewhere else because I don't trust it not to get damaged. Although there are companies that would print them safely, and likely have secure shipping methods, I just don't want her to have them anymore and I know it's at least partly out of spite.\n\n\nStory 2: the portraits\n\nFor an art class I'm in this semester, I drew a self portrait. I didn't have to draw a self portrait, since no one else had to draw themselves (everyone had to draw a boy and a girl in the class and I'm the only girl), but I decided to draw it because I knew my mom would want it and I could use it as a Christmas/birthday gift for her. I never mentioned this plan to either of my parents, although I did send them a picture of the drawing.  When they came up to visit me about a month ago (same time as the most recent cow altercation), at lunch, this sentence came out of my mother's mouth: \"you know Jack, it would be SO NICE to also have a portrait of Brother as a gift for Christmas\"\n\nLike what. All my whats. First off, you can't ask politely for something? It literally wasn't even a question. It was just a pasaive agressive statement. And who said you were even getting my portrait? I thought it would be a nice surprise, but if you're expecting it...that just ruins the whole point of gift giving.  Maybe I'm being too picky and I'm just bristling easily?\n\nI just feel so used. But I know she just likes my art and wants to display it. I made a decision to not draw my brother. For what it's worth, I did ask him for a selfie for reference, but he's a lazy SOB and won't even do that. I am going to draw my dog instead since that's something I actually want to draw and it's not something I'm feeling compelled to draw.  AITA for not getting her what she's asked for even though I'm the only one who can in regards to both the portraits and the cow photos? I feel like an asshole about it, but I think if it wasn't my mom, then I wouldn't feel as bad.",

Since Steph owns a plumbing company we called her to ask for repairs (we paid for it in case anyone thinks we we EP’s / EK) and she said sure.\n\nSo when she came this morning I was getting my stuff ready to study for an important test worth 30% of my grade in English. I said hi and turned to my desk but then I heard John say hi. I wasn’t expecting him to come and I don’t think my grandma was either. I greeted him and went back to studying and he went to the living room. \n\nAfter about ten minutes my grandma tells John go in to my room and a told her I’m studying and I’d rather have no interruptions (keep in mind I had planned all my weekend plans around these 5 hours studying and me and John had never had anything in common as he is still In year six and I’m in year 8) so my grandma tells me to just study later even though I had made plans with my friends for about the time they were going to leave so I say no I’d rather get a decent grade and I thought that was the end of it. After they left and I got back from my plans I was told by my aunt (who was also there) that I’m a horrible friend although I never made plans with John, we don’t go to the same school and never have since he lives 20 miles away and we have next to nothing in common.\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "A little backstory, I'm currently a college senior and I'm finishing my final year in school and I'll be graduating in December. When I was younger, may 6 or 7, my parents had a rough divorce that ended with my mom absolutely despising my father. According to my dad, my mother used $10K of my college fund to hire a lawyer and divorce him. The fund the money was in worked off of the stock market and that $10K would most likely be worth more than double that today. I've confronted my mom about the money and she would make a hissy fit, punish me, and just shut down our conversation completely. But, never denied actually taking the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, since then my mom has remarried to a man who is currently a high school teacher/ former state senator. My mom and my step-dad take in at least a combined $160K+ every year. Also, my step dad has two other sons who he paid their college tuition completely for 4 years at a University. In the 6 years my mom/step-dad have been married they: bought and remodeled a house, have hired a landscaper to makeover their property, purchased my mom a new car and have currently hired an architect and builder to build a house on a property my grandmother gave my mom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, now where does this all come in you ask? I attended a community college my first two years out of high school to save money. Then transferred to a University with a much better program for the degree I'm receiving. I've put every dime I've earned from internships, to even a job I had washing dishes this past winter break, toward my tuition bills. I don't receive any scholarships from the school because to them I'm a white male who's parents take in over $160K+ a year and don't deem me as eligible for financial aid. Now, I'm having issues paying my tuition for this semester as my job money has run out, I've taking all the better loans available to me, but I'm still coming up short. I've asked my mom about the situation and her solution is for me to take out terrible loan that has an extremely high interest rate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm slightly upset, because, I know my mom can afford this. She has plenty of money to go and make other frivolous purchases, yet she wants me to go into extreme debt so she can clean her hands of my situation. Am I justified for feeling slighted here? Please reddit, let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My mom and step-dad make plenty of money, but would rather I go into extreme debt than help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Long post, beware. Will try a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nFirst, some background, as this is kind of a long story. Bear with me please. \n\nI [26M] used to be friends with \"M\" [23F] and was for some time. We even had a small fling which I cut off as I didn't want a relationship with her, and she wanted a relationship. Fast forward a few years, and she started dating \"D\" [28M] who lives in the UK (We live in the USA). \n\nM and I lived together for about two years during their relationship. Eventually, M paid for D to come visit her. All expenses, including food and everything. D didn't have a job and refused to get one. D and I were friends as well, and we had a good time. Come to find out later, D had been sexting with another girl on M's laptop while he was visiting. I found out after he left when M came to my room completely destroyed and in tears. She admitted that he was mentally abusive and manipulative as well. \n\nI comforted her for the next week or so, making sure she was getting better. I was her pillar, along with a group of mutual friends on Discord. D completely ostracized himself from the group of friends, and none of us cared. He had hurt M so bad, we were practically vengeful (no one actually did anything vengeful, we are protective though).\n\nI moved out to live with \"C,\" [27M] my best friend and also a friend of M. My girlfriend [26F] moved in as well. Fast forward another year, and this is when things go bad.\n\nM got back together with D, much to the disappointment of the friend group. I was confused and a little upset, seeing as I was hands on in getting her back on her feet, I stayed out of it, however, as it's her choice. \n\nEventually she starts freaking out in the Discord chat because two of the friends were concerned about her being unemployed and matching her sleep schedule with D, which meant she slept during the day and wouldn't be able to find a job. She said she was happy, but started in on them saying \"of course this is about D, none of you like him.\" It continued for a bit until I stepped in.\n\nShe sent, \"If you truly ever cared about me, then you would see eye to eye with my relationship with D.\" \n\nI was unbelievably pissed. I had done so much to support her and help her feel better about herself, and she was really going to say I don't really care? I admit, I flew off the handle. \n\nI said, \"What's fucked up is that I held you while you cried for hours and listened to you and reassured you for days, only to have you tell me I don't truly care. Fuck this. I'm out.\"\n\nI left the server and never went back. Apparently afterward, M absolutely exploded on everyone and went on a tirade. I saw none of it but heard from C about it later. \n\nA week or so went by and I calmed down. I texted M and apologized, and explained how what she said had hurt me, but I understood. She texted back scolding me for being angry, telling me \"for your information, D and I broke up already,\" and didnt apologize once for what she said. I apologized multiple times and empathized with her side, and I truly do, as she felt like her support system was turning on her. She ignored me after continued scolding, and I said \"I apologize for what part I had in it. We all made mistakes and we all hurt each other.\" I haven't heard from her since. \n\nI didnt text her after that, feeling stung again because she didn't apologize or even try to patch the rift between us. Today, C asks me if it's ok if M comes over and stays for a few nights to hang out. I said it's fine, as she has nowhere else to stay in the city, but that I wasn't interested in hanging out. \n\nSo, dear reader who made it this far, am I the asshole in this whole situation? I think I'm not, but I can see where she is coming from. Maybe I'm just not getting it.\n\nTLDR: helped friend get over abusive cheating boyfriend. Gets back together with him, gets mad when I'm upset when she says I dont care about her, and ignores me. I'm now refusing to hang out. ",

      "description": "Basically I (27F) have been in a relationship with someone (30F) for well over two years. \n\nWe have had our struggles lately with the last year being an absolute nightmare. She’s very inconsistent, unpredictable, would ask for breaks randomly and then change her mind within a week for unspecified reasons. Recently she got an executive position in a company and works herself to absolute exhaustion. Needless to say, she has been extremely neglectful to our relationship and refuses to compromise, I’m basically stuck with ‘I’m busy and I can’t be as attentive’. I have already made up my mind and decided to leave but I feel guilty over doing so. \n\nYou see, in order for her to deal with the pressure of a high position, she picked up the habit of taking drugs to catch up. She’d take anything from coke, speed, keta, and everything in-between. She’d mix shit, take it with alcohol, bing on an ungodly amount for days on end. It’s really self destructive and it’s getting extremely out of hand. \n\nShe absolutely refuses to seek treatment. It started off as  ‘I’m not an addict I can stop if I wanted’ to ‘I can’t stop now I’m too addicted’. I’m ashamed to say that I’m honestly starting to resent her, partly because she has a very young son who just started kindergarten. He is extremely attached to his mother and absolutely adores her and she’s neglectful to him as well. \n\nThis week alone she has been hospitalized twice for her addiction. This was a breaking point for me, I began to unload all my resentment onto her; I told her that she’s a self destructive mess who needs to get her shit together and seek help. That she had to think about her family and son and at least try for them, and how she’s hurting everyone around her who actually gives a damn, and I finally said I’m done. She told me how she hates who she became and is really depressed, I straight up said then do something about it; get yourself some therapy, start a drug treatment plan, do something, anything. I ended the conversation with me basically stating that I have no sympathy for her anymore, she somehow keeps bringing this shit to herself, just quit your stressful job and start taking care of yourself, get out of this never ending cycle. \n\nMy BFF thinks IATA and was being too harsh because addiction is not something she can control. From my point of view, she has always been self destructive, if not with drugs then it’s whatever else she can take advantage of. That’s just her. \n\nI think even if she sobered up this relationship is beyond saving as those past two years honestly made my hair turn gray, but I genuinely care about her and want to know if my approach was an asshole move. \n",

Also, that’s a STRANGER she’s leaving in our apartment and all my valuables in MY room can be stolen since the doors don’t have locks and it’s an old apartment.

      "title": "AITA for letting my friend meet with sugar daddies",
      "description": "Sorry for formatting issues, I’m on mobile. \n\n\n2 years ago my SO and I moved a couple states away. My [23F] best friend [22F] (let’s call her M) came to visit us. M is a free spirit, and loves meeting new people. She told me she wanted to sign up for an app, like tinder, that matches women with sugar daddies (SDs). I encouraged it, thinking that it would be fun to sit around and swipe left/right on rich, older men with her. A few days pass, and M matched with a man who wanted to meet up and told me she was planning on it. We’re both protective of each other, and I told her why don’t they meet up for dinner at my work (I’m a server) so that I can meet him, too. She was totally down with this, and planned to meet him that night around 7. \n\n\nSo, I’m taking care of them for dinner. Let’s call the man C, was polite, a little shy but I think was just nervous. While I worked, she texted me saying he wanted to bring her shopping after. I told her to meet me in the restroom, and there I told her if she’s going she needs to turn on her “find friends” tracker on her phone so I can locate her in an emergency. I tell her to send me his license plate #, and if anything seemed off to text me immediately. So she leaves, turns on her tracker, sends me the number, and I’m feeling at ease. M wasn’t out long, and everything went well! \n\n\nHalf way through her stay, we took a trip to Vegas. M, again, matches with a man she wants to meet. I tell M the same rules: tracker on, if she goes anywhere send me his license, if they go to his room send me the room number. I drop her off, and she’s texting me the whole time, keeping me updated. Again, I felt completely comfortable since we were in contact the whole time. She, again, came back around midnight and that was that! She told me she had a fantastic time but that the SD thing wasn’t for her.\n\n\nNow, M has an older sister [26F] (let’s call her T). We’re all close, however, my loyalty and deepest friendship lies with M. But T has been like a big sister to me in the past, and I care about her a lot. Anyways, M calls me and says T found out through the grapevine that M had been dating SDs, and T wasn’t mad at M for doing it, but was furious at me for letting her. Now, I understand since M is her little sister, but I also didn’t even THINK to tell T. M is an adult, can make her own decisions, and her dating/sex life is private and she trusts me to keep it that way. But M says to let it blow over, and T will be fine.\n\n\nThis was over 1/2 a year ago, and I still haven’t talked to T. Although this isn’t out of the norm, b/c communication between T and I has always been face-to-face or occasional text. But a couple weeks ago, I realized I hadn’t seen T on social media, so I check her pages, and I’ve been blocked on everything. I haven’t tried text but if she’s this upset, I don’t want to. Naturally, I’m upset b/c I do care about her but I have to know if I’m deserving of this. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for making my girlfriend choose between me and her guy best friend?",
      "description": "My girlfriend \\[20F\\] and I \\[21M\\] are at an impasse over her guy best friend. For six months, my girlfriend received anonymous phone calls and text messages. The calls were from an anonymous woman who would say horribly personal things and threaten to kill me and my girlfriend. This went on for months and then she started sending my girlfriend child pornography knowing that she had been repeatedly sexually abused as a child. My girlfriend has PTSD resulting from her childhood experiences and this experience exacerbated her flashbacks, nightmares, and anxiety. The threats continued in more personal forms including notes slipped in her backpack, letters in the mail, and pictures of her and I on the campus of my university (we go to different universities about an hour apart). The police eventually tracked the calls to a woman out of state and arrested her, but the stalking continued for several more weeks before my girlfriend's guy best friend \\[20M\\] turned himself in to the counseling staff at my girlfriends university (he attends the same university as her). The school set up a facilitated meeting with him, my girlfriend, a counselor, a police officer, and a school administrator. They all grilled him about why he would do this and he basically said he met the woman who was arrested online and she egged him on to do this stuff. He gave a sob story about how he doesn't have any friends and how his parents are getting divorced. He told my girlfriend he felt bad about it and that's why he gave her such nice birthday presents (her birthday was only a couple weeks into the stalking). He said he ended up in the mental hospital in the summer because of how bad he felt. They gave my girlfriend the choice of whether she wanted to punish him through the school, legally, both, or just let this go. She decided to let it go, but they left the door open for her to pursue charges. She even got dinner with him after this whole meeting. When she told me about all of this, I was furious. I had made a lot of sacrifices so that we could get through this and am still dealing with the emotional impact this whole thing has left on me, but she's just willing to invite him back into her life and mine.  She defended him saying he's going through a lot and he did turn himself in, but the police already knew it was him before he turned himself in and were in the process of getting a warrant. I felt like he was pulling a master manipulation on my girlfriend as he's done similar stuff in the past (i.e.  threatened to kill himself if she didn't date him). She seemed to forget the impact that this had on her( she ended up in the hospital with an ulcer from the stress that this caused). I told her she had to choose between her relationship with me or him because I can't continue this relationship with him in the picture. She was upset, but chose me. I eventually convinced her to pursue charges through the school because I know legal stuff was too severe in her mind and I felt like he needed to be punished in someway for the damage he did. I think he got off pretty lightly. But, in the past few weeks my girlfriend has been upset and said she heard through a friend that he ended up in the hospital again. She says she misses him. On Thanksgiving, she got a message from him saying \"forever thankful for you\" and she ask me if she could respond and I reiterated that it was him or me, which made her pretty upset. I understand her feeling of missing a friend, but I just can't be flexible on this. AITA here?",

      "description": "So I'm a high school junior who has to ride the bus every morning with a bunch of middle schoolers, as my particular high school doesn't have it's own busses and just picks students up from middle schools. My bus stop is at a 4 way intersection where people tend to speed, so everyone getting picked up just stands in the yard of the house on the corner. This morning I'm walking to the bus stop as usual, and I cut across some of the yard to get to where I stand. I suppose I didn't see the owner of the house, because he approaches me and starts to lecture me on how disrespectful I am for not acknowledging him, and how I apparently walked on his yard like it was his living room and how he could have me arrested for trespassing by standing in his yard, despite the 10 plus middle schoolers standing around. I only respond with \"yes sir, I apologize\" as he continued to lecture me for another minute before leaving. I don't think not realizing he was there is too disrespectful especially since he didn't call out to me, and I highly doubt that he could actually have me arrested. AITA?",

My Mum really like sto keep stuff in the house clean, like seriusly clean, she cleans when she doesn't have to etc... Because of her leg being broken she can't really do these jobs anymore so that leaves me and my sister to do them  (My Dad got divorced a while so he isn't here).  \n\n\nSo on Friday Night I get home from school very late and all my mum does in bombard me with jobs, I was expecting it but not as many jobs as I really expected, like 2-3 hours of jobs thta actaully didnt really need doing. I didn't have time to get on my computer or anything, just had to go straight to bed after preparing and eating dinner for us all. My sister never help becuase she is always 'studying' but in reality she doesn't really care about her grades and just watches netflix most of the time yet my mum beleives she studies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom Friday I thought today (saturday) I was gonna have the day off or something or not do as many jobs, but I was wrong, my mum slaved me around all day, I had to do jobs consantly, normally I would be ok doing some of the jobs for my mom but 2 things really pissed me off, 1, my sister saw me doing all the jobs and just went back to her room, 2, I have the most homework Ive recieved all year this weekend which would take hours to do and my mum won't let me do my homework.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen she asked me to do the next job after already like 4 hours ish of doing jobs I said No, I was already really exhausted and I needed some breakfast, I also needed to get started on a couple of essays whch were really important, my mum proceeds to start trying to guilt trip me saying that 'I dont love her enoguht' and that 'She Does Everything For me' and stuff like that, I jsu tget really angry and just shout out saying 'Im not doing any more jobs' or something along those lines. I then go to my room and later hear her crying.  \n\n\nI've apologised and stuff but personally I dont feel like I'm the asshole here  \n\n\nTL;DR OCD Mum made me do hours of jobs when I ahd lots of Homework, shouted at her and then she cried\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My long distance girlfriend recently moved out from her ex-boyfriend/baby daddy’s apartment and into her own place.  He regularly visits using the child as an excuse.  He has never been this involved, even when they lived together.  He drops in whenever he likes and walks into her home without knocking.  She doesn’t have a problem with this behavior because if the door is unlocked, he’s welcomed to come in.  She leaves him home alone to hang out with their child while she goes to work, shopping, etc.  I said she’s making it too comfortable for him and before you know it, her son will start asking if he can spend the night.  I was right and the child asked and she allowed it.  He slept in their child’s bed with him.  She didn’t tell me about it when it happened but insists that she did.  We got into a fight about it and I asked her not to allow him to spend the night anymore.  I had a feeling he was going to ask again because he became ill and it was obvious he would use that as an excuse, which he did.  I asked her what she would say if he asks to spend the night again and she said she would say no.  Hours later, he was back in her home spending the night because his doctor said he can’t be alone for the evening so she allowed him to spend the evening again in her home.  She doesn’t think there’s anything wrong with it and I shouldn’t be concerned.  I ask what would happen if I lived there and her response is usually something like I don’t live there and if I want to be treated like her boyfriend then I should move out there.  Am I the asshole for not wanting her ex to be spending the night in her home?  Coming in and out of her home and hanging out with her all the time after they’ve broken up?",

      "description": "Ok, so I want to start this post by stating two things: 1) I'm sorry if the title is wrong or confusing, english is not my first language and I had trouble making that sentence, if you could correct me I'd appreciate it. 2) I love my mom more than anything in this world, we've had some problems and we're going through a rough situation but I don't blame her at all for this. 3) There's a TLDR at the bottom. \n\nSo my mom and my siblings have been in a pretty rough situation for a couple of months now. My mom lost her job and our father is a crackhead good for nothing, our family doesn't really help us and we've been all alone for a good time, my grandfather (who was the only one that helped us) passed away recently, and left my mom his motorcycle, my mom, not being able to find a job, decided to work for Uber Eats and has done so for a couple of months, it's not like we can live from it because we don't have Wi-Fi or anything like that but she makes it work. God I love that woman.\n\nNow, the problem started about three weeks ago. We got our light and water services cut off, we couldn't even afford food and if we did, we couldn't cook it but, magically, out of nowhere, big buckets of chicken would appear out of nowhere, pizza, tacos, all sorts of food. My brother and little sisters were happy because we haven't been able to eat that delicious food in a long time, so I just let it slip and thought she bought it.\n\nAfter a week or so of that I asked her where she got that food from and she confessed to me she accepted Uber Eats trips and when she got the food she cancelled them so we could eat something, she said she felt terrible but if she didn't do that we wouldn't be able to eat. I got pretty upset and exploded over this, we got into a big argument and I called her a thief, I went to my room and I could hear her cry.\n\nI told her if the problem was so big I could get a day job and study at night but she said if I do this I won't be able to graduate and to see me do it it's her biggest dream.\n\nI feel really shitty and I don't know if I'm right or what. I know she's just doing what she has to do, but I feel extremely disappointed and embarrassed so, AITA?\n\nTLDR; Family has been in a shitty spot for a few months, my mom has been cancelling Uber Eats trips after getting the food so we can eat something to eat, I exploded and called her a thief.

      "description": "Me and my fiance work night shift at a hospital from 7p-7a. We've been trying to better ourselves after work and trying to workout at home by watching Hasfit on YouTube (highly recommend them!) I've lost around 80 pounds and feel so good about myself. Well yesterday after work we both came home after a tough night and she didn't really want to workout with me (which is fine, I never expect or force her to do it.) She always feels guilty when I do it though. She was wanting to just sit down and watch tv before heading to bed. I told her I was going to go to the spare bedroom and do a 20 minute workout real quick and I'll come down and watch tv after I finished. She told me that I shouldn't work out and instead, I should just watch TV with her. I said she was being selfish for that and that I literally would be done in 20-25 minutes. And it wasn't like I had to drive to the gym, I was only going to the other bedroom.\nTL;DR- I wanted to workout after work and my fiance wanted me to watch tv with her instead, even though she knew I wouldn't take long and would join her afterwards.",

      "description": "We were doing student presentations in a language class, and they have guided questions. During a particularly slow presentation, while people were writing down answers, there would be a pause. During this pause there would be some mild talking which wasn’t very disruptive because the presentation was paused. However during this presentation, when the presenters continued, the talking wouldn’t stop. The teacher told the talkative side to stop twice and even put one of the kids on the other side of the class.  All of this was going on while the two students who were presenting were trying to explain a question that would be on the test. \nThey finally move on and get a few questions ahead; however, One of the girls in the back that sits 2 rows behind me who was one of the people talking very loudly the whole time shouts out\n\n “Wait what was the answer to question x?” \n\nThe teacher is normally very open to answering questions if students are listening and not talking, but he just ignored her and stayed quiet because he was fed up. I’m normally a quiet student in that class, however I was in a fairly bad mood and I had absolutely had enough with them so I snapped:\n\n“Well maybe if you weren’t talking so loud you would have gotten the answer when they were explaining it”\n\nThe girl then looks me in the eye and says:\n\n“Excuse me? Are you directing that at me?”\nTo which I respond\n\n“I’m directing it at this whole side of the class, if y’all wouldn’t have been talking so much you would actually have the answers.”\n\nI turn around. This happened this morning and I can’t remember the exact wording but she basically responded saying something along the lines of \n\n“I wasn’t even talking that loudly bitch (I remember hearing her call me a bitch... yeah, in front of the teacher). You need to learn some respect, I don’t listen to those who don’t respect me.” \n\nOr something close to that. The teacher told us both to quiet down and the classroom was extremely tense until the presentation was done. We were allowed to talk for the last five minutes of class and I overheard her telling her friends that sat by her:\n\n“He isn’t even the teacher he has no authority to tell me that” \nand\n “he is such a fucking asshole”\n\nI also got a text from one of my friends in the class with me saying “OP, you just don’t say shit like that. Leave it for the teacher not you cause I honestly thought you were gonna get hit.” I also had a few other friends in band class tell me I was in the wrong, and that I was most likely going to be confronted.\nHowever\nDuring that 5 minute talking period I mentioned, I had a student tell me they felt sorry for what she was calling me and that she had wanted to say something like that all year. The teacher’s aid gave me a smile after class as well, and most of my other friends sided with me and said that even if the teacher would have said something that I had the right to say what was said. \n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "WIBTA if I gift my son a large sum of money without doing the same for my step-kids?",
      "description": "My husband and I both came into our relationship with children. My child lives with us full time and I receive child support. My two step-kids live with their mother (one is in college now though) and my husband pays child support. We're all very geographically distant but everyone is involved to the extent they can be. All of us are lower middle class, with similar incomes and cost of living.\n\nI started a saving account for my son just after I split with my son’s father, roughly 10 years ago. I budget the child support separately and any remaining CS money goes into my son’s savings account. When I told my ex I was doing this, he voluntarily started sending a bit more child support to up what would go into savings. I put 50% of all my son's holiday money in there and his dad occasionally tosses a bit more money at it too. The plan is to gift this money to our child upon some as of yet undetermined adult life event. I project this account will be somewhere between $20-$25K by the time my son graduates high school.\n\nMy husband has gifted two years of college tuition and all major living expenses for that time to each of his two children, paid through a work related benefit. He doesn’t have any additional savings set up for them though and I don't know if their mother does either. It's highly likely that she doesn't as saving has never been one of her strengths.\n\nSo, I was complaining about a banking error in my son’s savings account when my friend made a comment about how unfair it was that my son would eventually be given this large sum of money while my step-kids will not. I was more than a little taken aback. I explained that the savings account for my son had never used joint household money for funding and came directly from the child support I received from his father; It had nothing to do with my husband or my step-kids. She was still quite angry and insisted it was wrong not to be strictly equitable no matter where the money came from.\n\nNow I’m not sure what to think. I’ve always viewed it more like I was saving my son’s own money for him.  The child support was never “mine” or my husband's. My step-kids' mother was equally as capable of doing something similar with the child support she received, especially given that she has always received significantly more in child support than I did. On the other hand, it certainly isn't my stepchildren's fault if their mother didn't do this. It is very likely that they would see this as being unfair and mean too. I'm not willing to short my son and I'm also not interested in being viewed as the stereotypical Wicked Stepmother, but I can't make 40K appear out of thin air in the next several years.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I continue with my plans to save and gift my son with this large sum of money without doing the same for my step-kids?",

      "description": "There's a long story involved, here it goes.  \n\n\n5 years ago, in college, I had a pretty serious crush on a classmate ( lets call her Alice ) , I got drunk at a party, asked her out ( over texts ), she turned me down. So I asked a different girl at the same party ( let's call her Jane ) out who said we should talk about it, I ended up dating  her after a couple of weeks. Alice and I were part of the same group of friends, and she was not happy about me dating Jane. She created a lot of drama about me spending more time with Jane and hanging out a bit less with the rest of our friends. Anyway, in a couple of months Alice and I worked things out and we went back to being normal.   \n\n\nThing between Jane and me were pretty great for an year. But then she started having problems with my friends ( including Alice ). I tried to be as reasonable as I could, but it did cause a lot of fights between us. She knew about the fact that I used to have a crush on Alice so she would say mean shit about her to see how I would react. And i didn't react much because I could understand that she was a bit insecure about the whole thing.  \n\n\nWe graduated, and somehow all of us ended up working in the same city. And as weird as it sounds, Jane and Alice ended up living in the same house. I didn't see much of Alice during this time, but Jane and I were having serious problems, tons of fights, and it was affecting my work, so I decided to end things. Jane didn't take it well, more drama, name calling, angry texts, calls, emails etc.  \n\n\nThen I switched jobs ( 4 months after the breakup ) and it turned out that Alice worked pretty close to where my new work place was. So we started hanging out a bit more after work. Jane found  out and lost her shit, she was convinced that I broke up with her because I was cheating on her with Alice ( and obviously that wasn't the case ). Things escalated further, more crazy emails and texts. And at this point I despised Jane ( she had called my dad up at 3 am to tell him that I'm an asshole ).   \n\n\nKept hanging out with Alice after work, meeting her for drinks etc. And soon enough we got really drunk and hooked up. We are not dating, we just hangout sometimes and if we're drunk enough we hook up. One of Jane's friends saw us while we were hanging out and she obviously told Jane. The shit storm has now reached my social media, where Jane is posting stories about how I'm a huge asshole. And i feel guilty about hooking up with Alice, but it's been so long ( about an year).  \n\n\nAm i the asshole here?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I (lets call her Jessica) had broken up initially about 8-months in after an arguement we had. After we got back together, Jessica said that I wasn't verbally expressive and emotionally available enough. I agreed that I should and would work on it and said that it was something that was difficult because in my household my parents had never said I love you or really been hyper-emotional with me in the 21 years before my first serious relationship. Chinese people show love through acts of service and it's just sort of assumed. To supplement our relationship, we started doing periodic check-ins for us to voice our problems. In terms of showing affection, my strong points are physical affection, spending uninterrupted quality time, and being supportive as well as being a good listener.\n\nWith that being said recently, about 1.5 years after our breakup, there was a tipping point, I had been improving throughout that duration, but things really started to change 1 to 2 months before the breakup. Jessica explained that this change was coming too late and that she felt like she had been minimizing this need for too long, that I had been hurting her this entire time, and that she wasn't down to wait years for change. I should note that this came after a conversation she had with her mom, with the breakup coming days later.\n\nI definitely regret not being able to fix my problem sooner, but in our relationship check-ins she stopped acknowledging the problem for a year, so I thought things were on the right track. Apparently this was her just adapting to the situation because she thought she was asking for too much and that I was snippy with her once when she brought it up. As such she felt like she was doing most of the emotional legwork, but never said anything about it and would always say that she was happy when i asked. \n\nIn terms of my personality; I rarely raise my voice and am always open to talk about things. We never got into heated arguments or said hurtful things, because while we both got frustrated, we still respected what the other person had to say. \n\nThis has been eating at me, and I just want to know if I was the one being a jerk. Any questions I will try to answer as unbiased and as truthful as possible. ",

We have guests in the house. I don’t expect any of you guys to understand, but me and my sister used to go to a church, and we don’t anymore. It is very awkward to see the people from our church that we no longer attend. Especially since once you leave the church you are considered a “fall away” and basically it is a very bad thing to them when you leave the church. Anyways, I didn’t feel comfortable seeing them and saying hi to them and passing by them to make the burrito for her. I knew they would ask me personal questions and make me feel uneasy as it happened before. I told my sister that I didnt want to go out there to make the burrito. It’s nothing against her, I just didn’t want to the see the people and get uneasy. \nInstead she said that I couldn’t make the sacrifice to get her a burrito and all this. I just told her I would ask our brother to get the burrito for her since it’s not awkward for him to see the church people. Instead my sister said “no I asked you to get it”. And persisted me on getting the burrito for her. She then went on to say that she always makes sacrifices for me when she picks me up for school almost everyday, and even sacrificing some mornings to drop me off to school. I really appreciate her for doing things like that to me, and I would do the same to her because it doesn’t have anything to do with confrontation and uneasiness. She proceeded to call me a terrible sister for not making this sacrifice. \nAm I in the wrong here? ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I met on Tinder a couple months ago, and have been seeing each other for about a month. Everything has been going great. We get along great, and he's great with my 16 month old daughter. While we've only been seeing each other for a month, I'd characterize things as \"pretty serious\", or at least headed that way.\n\nAt dinner tonight, the topic of hunting came up, and he asked me what I thought of it. I told him that I was against hunting for sport for moral reasons. He then asked me what I would think if he was a hunter. I said it'd be ok if he had done it as a kid with relatives or something like that, but it would be a deal breaker if he had done it recently (like within the last year) and I'd have to break up with him.\n\nHe said something to the effect of \"what if I agreed with you that it's wrong and agreed to never do it again?\" I said that it would still be a deal breaker I couldn't get past and would have to end the relationship.\n\nTurns out, he's NOT a hunter and never has been, but he was pretty put off (to use his words) by how quick I would have been to end the relationship over something so seemingly small, to him at least. Now he's sulking wondering what \"other things\" I might be willing to leave him for at the drop of a hat.\n\nSo, Reddit. WIBTA for leaving him in this hypothetical scenario, even if he was willing to change his ways?",

      "description": "Buckle in folks, this is gonna be a long one. Throwaway for personal reasons.\n\nOkay, so I have a massive student debt. About $110k total with about $65k in Parent Plus Loans in my mother’s name. I also have a baby on the way. Currently, I’m paying $600/mo toward the parent plus loan. I’ve asked my mother to reapply for income based repayment as her income has changed significantly (she has none) and I really need the flexibility to prepare for child related expenses. (I’m not planning on paying just the minimum, but if I need to do it one month because I have an emergency, I will.) My husband and I are currently living paycheck to paycheck, making decent money, but paying $1000/mo total toward student debt (income based repayment minimums). \n\nShe is refusing to reapply for the income based repayment despite the fact that she makes no payment towards these loans. She also took out the maximum every year I was in college despite the fact that I specifically asked her not to, as our agreement was that I would pay them back. She claims she used the extra money toward me. There’s no way all the money was used for my expenses. She fixed my car once to the tune of about $700, but never helped with rent or groceries, even leaving me homeless for about six months while I was in school. She probably netted about $15k off these loans. \n\nWIBTA if I stopped paying these loans if she refuses to reapply for income based repayments? The loan is solely in her name, so there are no legal/financial repercussions for me. I imagine she will harass me to the point of needing a restraining order if I do this. ",

      "description": "I've been with my SO for three years, and a few months after we started dating, he started to tell me more and more often what bad taste I had in things, particularly in the clothing department. He shops at Nordstrom while I am quite comfortable shopping at Walmart, and, in the beginning, this was a nonissue. However, at some point, he began telling me he didn't like various articles of clothing that I owned and that I should let him take me out to get better (i.e., more expensive) clothing. Aside from once when I let him buy me a coat (his idea, not mine), I've always declined because, for various reasons, I'm just not an expensive clothes type of person. I'd succeeded for while in just brushing off his jabs at my taste because, deep down, I think he really thinks he's helping, but, eventually, I started feeling really self-conscious about what I wore around him, and I even broke down in tears a couple times because I just couldn't fathom why he was even with me if he didn't like the things that were basically core parts of who I am. That was a couple months ago, and after talking to him again about how it was hurting my feelings, he really has gotten much better about it, which brings me to why I've written this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTonight, we were having a lovely time just hanging out on the couch when he said, \"You have really nice feet. You should show them off more often.\" I thanked him and told him that he'd get to see them more this summer when it's warm enough to wear sandals again. At this point, he made a face that very clearly communicated he had some fashion problem with my sandals, and I immediately felt judged again. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and asked him, \"You don't like my sandals, lol?\" with the hope that he would just say something like, \"Nah, babe, your sandals are fine.\" But instead, this was how the conversation unfolded:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim: I didn't say anything.\n\nMe: You made a face when I mentioned my sandals that clearly showed you have some problem with them.\n\nHim: But I didn't *say* anything.\n\nMe: When you make a face that shows that you hate the sandals, that's the same thing as saying it with words. \\[At this point, I, admittedly, tried to be petty and tell him that I hate a pair of his shoes, but, when he asked which pair, I couldn't describe them because I don't actually give a damn about how he wants to dress as long as it makes him happy, and I realized my bluff had been called\\] ...I just wish you wouldn't make faces about the things I wear. I really like my sandals.\n\nHim: But I made a face so I wouldn't say anything bad about your sandals. I just can't win!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for thinking that a face that communicates disdain is no better than using words to communicate disdain, or should I be ok with his faces about my fashion choices as long as he doesn't actually disparage them using words?",

      "description": "Ima explain the situation to you guys as quick as i can. \n\n\nI work in a city about an hour from where i live so i have to get up at 4 am in the morning in order to show up at work at 7:15 am and get home at about 5:20 pm from tuesday to friday.\n\nThere's a bar in the town where my dad lives where all the people from my town usually meet up to have drinks and party. This bar is basically owned by the people of this town and there's no regular barkeepers and bartenders so the members of different local clubs, like the football team, the local union and so on, need to do the services in this bar, and the club that is in charge of the bar changes every week. I hope you get this, it's kinda complicated. \n\n\nSo friday it was the turn of the club i'm member of and nobody of our club had time to do the service except this one girl that i kind of like and myself.\n\n\nKeep in mind that i get home at 5:20pm and shift at the bar starts at 6:15pm on fridays.\nI had no time to eat at home so before i got home from the city i work in i had to grab something from mcdonald's, which i don't like and try to avoid, and had to eat it at the train station. \nWhen i got home i had to shower as quick as i could, tried my best to look a bit presentable to the people, rushed off to my dad's place and then went to the bar. \n\n\nI really didn't want to work there because i'm very bad at barkeeping and also didn't want to put all that damn stress onto myself right after work but i did it anyway because i didn't want the girl to have to work all alone. The place was crowded anybody had so difficult orders that i always messed up. To me it was a complete catastrophy. The girl did a terrific job. But she had to leave at 11 pm because she had to get up early the next day to drive to a concert she wanted to see. I was glad that the dad of a friend of mine helped me out after she left til all the people were gone. \n\nI was really exhausted because i had been up for 20 hours at that point. \nNow i kinda hoped that this girl would maybe appreciate that i wanted to help her out right after i got home from work. But i didn't get a \"thank you\", in fact nobody thanked me for my efforts that evening. \n\n\nLike i said, i kind of like that girl and we're kind of friends and i really wanted to help her out. But now that she didn't show any word of appreciation for my efforts i'm not quite sure if she'd do the same for me if i was in a stressful situation like that. And now i'm mad at her. I didn't tell her that i'm mad and i didn't complain or something. But am i the asshole for even being mad at her in the first place?\n\n\nI know that i did a really bad job. But i tried my best. \n\n \n",

The topic was unprovoked and we were just hanging out in my room , and the girl started crying and I ditched everyone else to try and help her . Later on that night , we were watching love Simon ( great movie I'd recommend it even though I barely got to watch it ) and in the middle she had a \" panic attack \" even though it really was a panic attack and she was screaming in the middle of the movie ( I'm glad I didn't take a seat in the theater ) because the scene when the came out to the father was like her experience coming out to father ( even though they had said that they never came out to their father ) and from my sister, I was told that CF was testing them on if they anxiety ( even though CF hadn't even been tested professionally for it )\n\nA few months later\n\nCF started to talk about stuff that made me really uncomfortable and no matter how many times I asked him to stop they would just carry-on the next day like I never asked , now this may seem a little off-topic but I have been professionally tested for clinical depression and anxiety and the thing I struggle with is selfharm and a could be sent into a relapse from being shown selfharm or being talked about it , and I have told CF about it and they still talk about it and show their \" selfharm scars \" even though it's looks just like one Catscratch on their arm. And they also talk about selfharm suicide and a lot of sexual stuff which that doesn't bother me as much as the other two\n\nNow two months ago I had enough of their BS and I told him straight out in the face in fourth hour that I cannot befriend them anymore the next day on Monday during fourth hour I was called to the counselors office , apparently they had asked to go see the counselor because I had one stop being friends with them and when I told them why didn't ly them anymore , selfharm suicide and all that stuff , they just said \" I've been getting better I haven't talk to that stuff in weeks ever since I got my therapist \" and since there was a teacher there/ counselor I was too scared to say no and I didn't want to still be friends of them .\n\n Now I'm kind of forced to be friends I'm still in there still on their stupid ",

      "description": "Ok so, one of my friendship groups includes 5 of us. 4 of us are into the NBA and basketball in general, and as a result we regularly play 2v2 scrimmages at a local court.\n\nNow the other member of our group, let’s call him Todd, has no interest in basketball and therefore is understandably terrible at it. Also, Todd doesn’t have his drivers license - keeping in mind that we’re all 23 years old and the legal age to get your provisionals in Australia is 17. \n\nThe problem is that on several occasions when Todd has found out that we have been playing these 2v2 scrimmages without him he gets salty, and posts passive aggressive messages like “thanks for the invite” in our group chat. However, we have still continued to play without him.\n\nThe obvious reasoning as to why we don’t invite him is because of his basketball skill level. When we’ve invited him in the past and played 3v2 it’s unfair because the team with 3 will always get an open shot because of the extra man, and if we play 2v2 then the team with Todd on it will be severely disadvantaged. Quite frankly, it doesn’t make our scrimmages competitive, productive, nor fun.\nOn top of this, his lack of having a drivers license means that one of us has to pick him up, which turns a 15 minute trip one-way into a 40 minute one, since he doesn’t live on the way to the court.\n\nWhile I can understand why he gets upset because he feels as if we are leaving him out, playing basketball is the only time we don’t invite him when we hang out. We still regularly go out as a group, whether it be grabbing a bite to eat locally, or getting drinks in the city, and we invite him every single time (and yes we have to pick him up).\n\nAre we being selfish because we aren’t inviting him to one specific activity that we do as a group, or is he acting childish?",

      "description": "Longtime browser first time poster. TL;DR at bottom. \nBackstory: my grandfather has a bit of a gambling problem. He has highs, where he buys us all expensive Christmas/birthday gifts (I got a new flatscreen from him one Christmas) and then he has lows where he's COMPLETELY wiped out, can't even make his minimum credit card payment of $50. I've helped him out before last year with making minimum payments on time, seeing as he was newly retired and I got my first ever office job (30k, nothing too fancy). \n\nHowever. Tonight he calls me asking for a much larger lump sum, cash, he needs ASAP (tomorrow morning). I understand he probably called other people for help and I'm the last resort, which is why the call is so last minute. I also understand it must be serious if he's calling me, his grandchild who he doesn't really otherwise call. But I've been sick with bronchitis the last two weeks (literally have taken 3 days off work just this week) and have spent quite a bit on doctors visits and medications, not to mention keeping my own bills and payments on time. I told him I'd loan him no more than how much I've loaned him in the past, but I feel guilty because I know if I really wanted to give him the full amount I could. (I would just be seriously broke after).  Side note- he does repay me. It usually takes him anywhere from 2-4 weeks to repay me. But he usually adds on a little extra \"interest\" as he puts it. \n\nTL;DR -&gt; gambling addicted grandfather who usually buys me expensive gifts now needs a large lump sum of cash asap (within 24 hours) that I technically have but don't want to give to him for fear of not being able to take care of myself. \n\nAITA?",

My wife and I are both in our 30s and my kids are 9, 7, and 2. We’ve had the dog for almost 2 years now. \n\nWhen I finally broke down and told them they could get a dog, I also told them that I want no part of it. They will be responsible for walking, feeding, and cleaning up after her. For the most part, they do a pretty good job. \n\nThe only reason I am really asking this is because my wife always gives me a hard time because I pay zero attention to the dog. I’ve had dogs all while growing up and I’ve just never liked them. My wife will get mad because she’ll come home from work at night and the kids will be in bed and the dog will usually be in her crate. Not locked in her crate or anything, we just have developed a mutual understanding that we don’t get along and she’ll go to her crate because that’s her area and we’ll both be out of each other’s hair.\n\nNow I don’t hate the dog, I just kind of nothing the dog like she’s almost not there.

(as well as generally doing all sorts of other things for her as we live together- which I view as my responsibility and happily so)  \n\n\nUsually, I drop her off on a flat area on the side of a street. Before I turn the corner to get to that point though, there is a big set of lights as you come down a hill. They last a really long time. Today, because we were running late and I needed to get to work, I said before we get to those lights, \"if we get the red light here you are going to need to get out, I really need to get to work\". We did hit the red light.  \n\n\nShe says that the slope is dangerous and that she doesn't want to get let out there, but when I park the car, take out her mobility item, and then turn to face her to help her out of the car, she never waits for me to assist her. As I said, these lights take a very long time, so if she chilled and waited for me, I could easily assist her much more safely than the way she is doing it. I do not think that this method is dangerous.  \n\n\nThere is a significant time saving by doing this (if we catch the red light) because we don't have to wait for the light \\*and\\* the transfer of her to the street, we get them both done at once.  \n\n\nFor reference, I was late to work today even with this change, I would have been significantly later without it.

      "description": "Sorry for the long post I am trying to include as much relevant information as I can. \n\nLet's get a couple of statements out of the way. \n\n1. I am a pretty blunt person, very type A, and am often considered the asshole. \n2. I only care about what other people think of me to the extent that I use it as a self modifying tool (if I am the asshole I then identify what it is that I need to adjust in myself)\n3. I am constantly working on bettering myself for others for myself (see statement 2). I know this does not excuse any behaviors I do, but it explains why I am here asking about this. \n\nIt is possible he might find this post as he does sometimes browse reddit but I doubt it since he's not really aware of this sub. But if he does I hope he knows I am asking because of genuine care for him and our friendship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's get down the the question. I have noticed over the several years we have been friends that my friend (let's call him George) has some peculiarities that could put him as very high functioning Aspergers. I majored in a branch of psychology which was not enough to by any means diagnose him, but enough that I notice some tendencies and know that since George is so high functioning a diagnosis could have been missed or overlooked. Most of his \"quirks\" are acceptable and do not hinder our friendship or his social interaction in general. He understands that sometime things are  considered inappropriate in general social situations, but does not really know what those are specifically, so he just goes into \"safe mode\" where he doesn't say anything controversial at all, even to those he considers friends. I do not think this is by any means a bad thing, but it means he is uncomfortable opening up to us and therefore limits our friendship. I do not say this because I am assuming I say it because after several years of friendship with George he expressed to a mutual friend that he is afraid that I will \"be done with him\" and then he will lose all his friends because of it. Let me explain this statement. I run a meetup group where most of our interactions and socializing are done through there or with the \"core\" people and those that have been removed from the meetup group are usually no longer invited to things that are off meetup. I then had a discussion with George about how I hope he trusts the strength of our friendship enough that he can talk to me about things that bother him, concern him, or he is wary about and he, by the end of it, agreed that he felt he could. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night we were playing a game and as I was setting up the arena he kept running over the traps I placed consuming them before their intended purpose. This in itself is not a problem or even a deal let alone big deal or small deal. But it is a habit of his. When Diablo 2 was a thing, one of his self proclaimed favorite things was to min/max a character, join a group of hardcore characters (when you die you lose everything, even the character) and help them quest and such and then drop a bunch hydras (stationary \"pets\" that do damage for you), port back to town, and then enable PVP having the hydras kill the whole party and everyone loses all their things and their characters become unplayable. Again, it's a game so it's not like people's lives were ruined or anything but people still put considerable amount of time and effort into leveling these characters. He did it just to have them lose everything, he did not gain experience, loot, or anything else from them dying. A second example is how a friend just discovered an elephant sanctuary that was taking volunteers. Let's call this friend Jane. Jane was never going to go to this sanctuary as she could not afford to stop work to volunteer all her time. This was very clear, even to George. Regardless, he spent about 10 minutes going back and forth with Jane about how \"you'll just be shoveling poop. It's not like they're just going to let you play with the elephants\" to which Jane would tell George \"I know that, but like, why do you have to ruin my nice fantasy?\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo last night when he did the very very minor running over my traps just to waste them because he knew that I only had a limited amount of them I made a comment/question of \"why do you do that? Does it make you feel nice to ruin things for people or do you get some sort of something else out of it?\" to which re flippantly replied \"yes, clearly I just like to ruin peoples lives because I'm just evil\". So, a non-answer. \n\nMy question is this: would I be the asshole to press him again today about it? I don't really think this behavior is so bad that it would really interfere with our friendship (or if it did, would be very minimal) but I also want to address a thing that I see as unhelpful in his learning to better interact with friends and strangers. Also, it irritates me a little bit. But the big ass caveat is, that is not my place to make him address a thing that he does not want to address himself. He did not come to me asking me for help, so WIBTA for offering this advice anyway? ",

She lives in another state so he bought a plane ticket for the next day and we canceled our trip. I totally understood this and I stayed behind to take care of our pets. So he gets there and its not nearly as serious as the family members have made it seem. That side of the family has a history of drama and I'm honestly not surpised. Since his mom is doing well he buys a ticket back for Saturday which was the cheapest flight so I'm at home alone for the whole week. I'm basically homebound because a huge snowstorm hit our area and I am having a hard time coping with being alone so suddenly. I am dissapointed at missing the trip, angry at his family for all the drama they cause, and lonely. \n\nNow the problem is that my husband is out having a great time. He got tickets for a comedy show and he is hanging out with his friends and he rarely calls me. The thing that pushed me over today is that I've only talked to him for a few minutes today and he said he would call me after he got back from vivisting his mom in the hospital but he didnt. He went to his friends house for hours. He is barely replying to my texts and I finally asked him when he was going to call and he sent me a picture of him playing poker with his friends saying \"Later, I somehow found myself in a poker game\" and I am just so upset. It's been hours since he said he was going to call me and he never told me it was going to later. \n\nI am just feeling so alone and I feel like he is having a vacation while I am at home missing out on our planned one. I honestly want to tell him to forget it and not even call at this point. I know he is probably drinking and I don't know if I can put up with that right now. \n\nSo AITA for being upset about this? I know his mom is in the hospital and I understand why he flew out but now I'm really feeling like he is having a great time and forgetting about me. ",

I do not do the same, but I do sarcastically joke at the expense of some things that are related to Turkish culture if I am sure that most people won't care. Here's where my best friend comes in. Let's call him \"Hasan\". Hasan is a **VERY** patriotic Turk, it's to the extent where if I even criticize a Turkish military general from World War fucking One, I am a racist and my country has no real history. So, one day I said something along the lines of \"Nasretin Hoca is for fucking 2 year olds.\" (Nasretin Hoca is a Turkish folklore hero.) and this boy was fucking **PISSED**. This guy starts yelling at me about how \"Your country is filled with 2 year olds!\" and \"You are a racist pig you dirty American!\"  \nNow, I am a simple human. If a man is a cunt to me, fuck him. I didn't even talk to him for 2 days and didn't answer any of his calls. I then said things that *I'll admit,* were *kinda* **sorta** ***maybe*** racist. \"Yeah, yeah, look at the fucking guys who killed hundreds of thousands of Armenians for no reason telling me I'm racist.\"  \n\n\nAITA here?",

I have been fully supporting him and myself (f23).\n He smokes cigarettes and is an ass when he doesnt have them so ive been buying them for him as well. \nThe past 4 months he hasnt even been looking for a job, and literally does nothing besides sit on the computer. No cleaning or laundry, sometimes cooks. \nOur relationship has not been well the past few weeks, and if it was anyone else i would have broken up with him already. \nI have tried communicating my concerns and things needing to change. And nothing has.\nIn turn, it has made me only feel worse about everything and dread coming home.

      "title": "AITA for using the ‘n-word’ in a college class discussion on the power and impact of words in minority cultures?",
      "description": "I’m a white gay male in the United States. I was in class at college, and we were discussing the power of words in cultures, particularly in minority cultures.\n\nWhile we were all discussing the word ‘bitch’, a black female classmate voiced her frustration with “gay guys calling girls ‘bitch’, and because the guy is gay, that makes it okay?” She went on to say that if a gay guy casually calls her bitch (context of something like, “bitch, please...”), that she would then see it as okay to say similar things to him, except with the word “faggot”. \n\nI personally do not believe in the concept of “taking the power away from words” by limiting its acceptable use to the group of people who were oppressed by its use against them in the past. I personally detest hearing other gay men calling one another ‘homo’ or ‘queer’ in a casual way like that (I have maybe once or twice EVER heard the words ‘fag’ or ‘faggot’ used that way). I believe a group of people trying to take the power away from a word by publicly using it amongst themselves, while demanding no one else use it (and further condemning anyone who does), only further segregates the group in a collective society. \n\nI knew this would be a controversial issue, but I felt the classroom was an appropriate place to have a real dialogue about it (especially since it was on-topic with the lecture that day). So, I voiced that I disagreed with her view. I explained my stance very much like I have here. I went on to say that I feel calling a gay person ‘faggot’, is akin to calling someone ‘n-word’ (I said the word itself). \n\nI felt that in an academic environment where the power and impact of words is at the core of the discussion, that it was necessary to convey the argument by relating the powerful reactions we can have to these words. However, my classmate did not seem to see it that way. She said she couldn’t believe I actually said that to her. I explained as I just did here, about the environment we were in and the discussion at hand, and that I felt it was not out of line, reiterating I felt it was important for comparing the impact of the two words. She simply said, “fuck you, asshole”, and walked out of the classroom. \n\nNo one raised their voices or anything; she and I were both calm throughout the exchange, even through to her leaving the classroom. After class, I asked the professor if it was inappropriate what I said. She said she agreed with my point about being in an academic environment while discussing the power of such words, and that she felt the impact indeed had value for equal context. \n\nI never heard anything else about this incident. However, my classmate never came back to the class, and I hate to think I caused her to drop a class over this. Was I an asshole to use the n-word like that?",

      "description": "TLDR: My 15 year old daughter says she is a creature that she found by watching/reading Harry Potter. I've banned all Harry Potter related material and have canceled a planned family trip to Universal Studios . My daughter is having a meltdown in response but I'm not budging. Am I the asshole?\n\nMy family moves a lot due to my husband being in the military. My daughter's mainstay friends are mostly online but recently she's got into a new crowd at school who are... unusual to say the least. I try to encourage in person relationships so I've kept my mouth shut about their behaviour and have even been chauffeuring them to whatever they have planned for the day as well as giving them all pocket change for whatever catches their eye when they're out and about. I want my daughter happy.\n\nOne of these new friends has gotten my daughter hooked on Harry Potter which in itself isn't a bad thing. I was so happy she had found something new that excited her that my husband and I were planning on taking her and the friend to the Wizarding World for her birthday. I love when any of my family members branch out and try new things and I wanted to encourage the new interests she was developing. When we announced this to get things started to get weird.\n\nAll of a sudden she was wearing only black, her headbands with a unicorn horn, and wasn't changing her clothes at night. She would go to bed in shoes in all if I didn't stop to catch her at night. She has her own debit card that is connected to a bank account that she puts her money in. She used it to buy a pair of shoes that look like hooves. She tried to wear them to school but I managed to convince her that her feet would hurt too much so they've been blessedly sitting in her closet. My husband laughed it off as a phase but I was worried. Then she started answering questions in noises best described as \"person who has only been vaguely described what a donkey is tries to recreate noise\". She even used to play a game with her online friends every Wednesday but now she's not talking to any of them at all. She told me that they were being mean to her but I've never seen them even argue about little things so I don't know how much truth is there. I hated being around her and I hated myself for feeling that way. She didn't feel like my daughter at that point. I felt like she was trying to impersonate her new friends instead of just impressing them. Does that make sense?\n\nFinally she pulls us aside one day and tells us that she didn't feel she is who she was born as and I think \"Okay! That explains so much. She wants to transition to a boy. We can start that and go through all of these bumpy patches as a family\" But no! She tells us that she's some mythical creature from Harry Potter. I exploded which wasn't appropriate for me to do, I admit that, but I stand by everything else. I told her she wasn't allowed to go watch the new movie, read the books, or watch the old films anymore. We took out everything Harry Potter from her room and I canceled the trip we had planned. My husband thought I had overreacted but he stands by me.\n\nMy daughter has completely gone off the rails. She's always been a good kid with a fairly even temper. Now she's yelling at us over every little thing, constantly tells us off, and is just plain miserable to be around. She told me I've stripped away her identity but I feel like I'm saving her from developing any social issues later down the line.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking that she needs to distance herself from something that has reached the point of pure obsession?",

      "description": "I have known this person since elementary school although I never considered us friends. After highschool we hung out a coupleof times with mutual friends but again I still never considered us close. He started inviting me to meet up for dinner or coffee frequently and I would make excuses until I felt guilty and went. Every time he would over divulge personal information about his mental health and how he knows he could trust me because I'm a good friend. I only did these one on one hangouts maybe 3 times. I've dealt with my fair share of \"friend breakups\" and mental health issues and didn't want to cause him pain but words can't describe the emotional weight he added to my life.\n\nHe started calling me from a psych hospital halfway across the country. Cool, I can have some room to breathe. Except these phone calls keep coming and lasting sometimes an hour. He would over share with me and not give me room to respond or say I didn't have time to talk so eventually I just stopped answering his phone calls. My therapist encouraged me to not give him too much of my attention too because I was feeling so guilty about not wanting to talk to this person. \n\nFast forward to now, 2 years later, I'm moving back to our home town where he is. I didn't want him to know because I didn't want to get sucked into this cycle again. I blocked him on Snapchat which is my only other social media and I guess he noticed because he texted me a bunch about it today. I haven't replied and don't plan to. \n\nAITA for blocking someone partially due to how their mental health effects me?",

If you wait for them to finish showering, change and free up the changing cubicle, that could be a 30 minute wait and I need to catch a train right after that only runs every 40 minutes so I can't wait.\n\nThe asshole part is that I will change in the changing room full of people's stuff and if they come back, and they can't change. I overheard people saying I am an asshole for changing in the cubicles because I should wait or move their stuff. I don't want to move their stuff because the entire area is disgustingly wet and their stuff would get soaked if I put it on a bench.\n\nMy husband says to change in the shower but there are only 4 showers.

(i have a high D). i ignored it again and told her i got an A+ on my chemistry test and it brought up my grade by a letter grade. she made another rude comment along the lines of my D. by the way, she usually doesn’t care that much about my grades and she knows i’ve been working hard to keep them up. i just went to my room trying to avoid any conflict again.\n\nafter a while she came to my room and asked why i was grumpy. i just shrugged because i didn’t want to be mean. she started laughing so i turned around and started yelling, (once again out of my character). i told her that it’s rude that she makes me and my sister feel left out compared to my brother. i told her that i didn’t like being left home alone so much and that i never get to spend time with her because she’s always either not home or watching tv with my dad. after getting all of my anger out she said “i’m sorry you feel that way” and walked away. \n\nam i the asshole? i feel kind of bad looking back at it",

About half a year ago he was diagnosed with cancer and he’s been on medication since. \n\n\nThis week he was messaging his ex-wife when my grandma, whose the sweetest woman I know, wanted to see his messages, perfectly reasonable in wanting to. My grandpa gets pissed, rips off a cabinet door and starts yelling at her. My grandma then calls my mom to come over and of course she does. My mom brings her husband and my grandpa gets even more pissed that my mom went to interfere. He tries to go and choke her, they never had a good relationship, when my mom’s husband goes to break it up and he ends up getting choked. My mom breaks them up and they leave. I didn’t know about this until I was in the car with my mom when she told me this story. Apparently the reason he was so upset and frustrated is that nobody went to visit him and he took his anger out on my grandma. She then told me that we won’t be in contact with him, we’ll never see him, and we won’t be at his funeral. \n\n\nI didn’t think anything of it and went home. However, I think the reason he’s pissed is his medication, but that’s a reason, not an excuse. I still think we should go to his funeral but my mom doesn’t want us to. So WIBTA if I didn’t go to my grandpas funeral?\n\n\nTL;DR my abusive grandfather lashed out at my mother and grandma and now i won’t be at his funeral. ",

      "description": "Posting from an alt account, sorry it's kind of long.\n\nMy school has study rooms in the libraries that I always book to study in. They're fairly large meeting rooms that can fit about 4 to 6 people comfortably, but because my friends and I are on vastly different schedules, I usually end up booking and studying alone in them. How this system works is that every night (at 12AM exactly), the booking for the following week opens (i.e, today is a Monday, the booking for next Monday opens etc), so how some students including me have learned to game the system is to camp on the page and refresh as the clock hits 11:59:59, usually meaning that we will definitely get the time slots we want.\n\nThe system only allows each user to book the room for 5 hours max/day, which works out well for me, because my breaks between classes are 4 hours usually.\n\nThe main reason why I always book the room is because I have massive social anxiety. When I study in the communal rooms, every time I squeak the chair or drop a pen or even type too loudly, I feel like everyone is staring or complaining even though reason tells me that they probably don't care. Another reason is my classes are usually from 9-11am then 3-5pm, my break coincides with the lunch crowd (meaning that more people are there fighting for communal study room seats).\n\nRecently though, my friend told me that people have started complaining about \"certain parties hogging the study rooms\". I understand how 1 person in a 4 man room might be ridiculous so sometimes I'm ok with letting a couple of strangers join me in the room, but other than that, I don't see a problem with it. I'm only booking it for 3 to 4 hours max, 3 days a week. I don't see this as \"hogging the rooms\" non-stop. Besides, if other people want the room, they can duke it out with me over the booking system at midnight.\n\nAITA in this situation? Should I just give up the rooms and find somewhere else deserted to study instead?",

When we first met she had him as her profile picture on insta, I[M18] eventually asked her to change it. I felt kinda bad about it but it was still pretty weird. This guy[M16] doesn't seem like a bad person, and ive spoke to him before. She has told me a couple times she is not interested in him and likes him as a friend. (She has known him for a number of years, about 7?)\n\nThe thing that scares me is she told me she had a crush on him about 2 years ago. I have no problems with her talking to him, or having pictures of him on her insta, its just the profile picture thats a little weird for me. \n\nWe go to school in different countries but we still visit quite often, and keep in contact daily via text/facetime. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated, what to think about the guy or if im just overthinking.

      "description": "So for background, I'm a 21F and my friend (we'll call her Kat) is a 20F. We're both in college, and she has a job, I have an internship. \n\nI loaned Kat money in the amount of close to $1,400 so that she could buy her \"necessities\" for college: a new laptop and a new phone. Now, I only loaned it because she promised she would pay me back monthly and I knew she had a long-time job, so she was capable of paying it back. So in the store (Best Buy) when she decided she wanted a new laptop and phone, we made an oral agreement that Kat would pay me back $170 on the first of every month (it was easy to remember) because it divided pretty nicely into an 8-month installment plan. This was also because Kat said she needed to learn responsibility anyway, so this was good practice for her. \n\nSo the first month, we decide that since the month ended in 2 weeks, she could begin the payment plan the first full month. On the first of that month, she tells me that she can't pay me and that she needs a few days. I agree because we said that as long as she communicated with me, it's fine. So I let it slide, because that's what we agreed to. \n\nThe second month, she tells me she can't pay me on the first. So again, I say okay, I understand. On the 5th of Month 2, she pays me only $130. So, as a concerned friend, I text her and tell her that you know, bills need to be paid in full. I only wanted to educate her, but I get a response along the lines of \"Well, I only have $20 left this week\", and \"I didn't sign a contract binding me to the first\". At this point, I was kind of fed up because she had a whole month to figure out how to pay me back, I've seen from her snapchat stories that she's been buying a lot of makeup, and even if we didn't have a written contract (I have taken business law, I know how they work), I expected her to be respectful of our arrangement and friendship. \n\nInstead, I've been dragged through the past few months with her not wanting to pay me, making excuses (her bank was hacked into, some company took $100 from her, she doesn't want to pay), or just plain threatening me with harassment even though I only ever texted her that she's forgotten to pay me that month. \n\nAt Month 7, she says \"And our payments are done :)\" quote. Yeah, she decides later on after doing terrible math that she only owes me around $113. At this point, I'm fed up, I tell her to keep the money for her next abortion since she clearly has no intention of wanting to pay me back in full and I just move on. \n\nExcept now, her family members keep harassing me when I go into restaurants to eat with my family. If I go on an interview with a potential employer (for internships) and any of her family members are there, they actually do harass me and the potential employer, and I'm left trying to explain the situation and remedy it. The really angering fact is that they are spewing lies about the whole past situation, and are affecting me when I only ever had good intentions when I loaned the money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for loaning money and then throwing a hissy fit? Or am I justified? I can't tell who's wrong or who's right, but I'm getting harassed when I go out, and it's no longer just an inside situation.",

      "description": "I've dated this guy in the past and he recently came back into my life. When he did, he was in a better place (he suffers from depression) and seemed to have improved himself a lot since we last were together (about a year). We're in two different states so we've been hesitant about jumping into a relationship, so we've kept it casual and flirty. However, he keeps getting more serious saying \"You're the only girl I can see myself with\" and constantly reiterates how much he likes me.\n\nThis was obviously everything I wanted to hear because I truly like this guy a lot. But, in between saying these things, he would say he never wants a relationship again with anyone, or would get very distant with me and hardly say two words to me. His depression has gotten to a point where I feel isolated and shut out, and it feels like him and I have no communication or sense of hope for a future.\n\nI ended up telling him all of this and how I wanted to end the romantic aspect of our relationship and keep it platonic until he was in a better place, and he flipped. Told me I had no idea what \"place\" he's in and I shouldn't be diagnosing him. I apologized for how I phrased it and told him I wasn't trying to diagnose him, just express to him how the way he's been acting has affected him. It's been over a week and he hardly talks to me at all, and when he does, it's only a few words at a time. He told me he doesn't really see a future with me anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for expressing to someone how their mental health is affecting me? Should I have been more patient and understanding, or is he in the wrong for shutting me out after always telling me to communicate with him?",

      "description": "On multiple occasions, my SO will tell me that I´m autistic, that I need help, and that she is going to get me this help. \n\nFor background info, we both have people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in close family, and we have lived together for 2 years. I have been tested as an adolescent during the time my siblings were diagnosed, to be on the safe side, but the psych team determined I did not meet the diagnostic criteria. SO knows this. SO is also a first year psych student. \n\nThe times she tells me I´m autistic are times where she feels I don´t show emphaty for what she´s going through in the right way. It was one time she asked for space, and I gave it to her, and it boiled to an argument over me not caring about her. She said it´s fine, because I was autistic, and it´s not my fault. \n\nThat sort of thing happens a lot, she says I don´t have empathy for her and I tell her I do feel for her, but she needs to tell me what she needs from me in those situations, because people need different things when they´re going through some stuff. I can´t recall ever getting a good \"this is what I need\".\n\nWe also had an argument over some kids being upset at a rule my work implemented. I work in a grocery store and during school hours, school kids are not allowed to use self-checkout because of numerous incidents with scanning too few items etc. It´s a rule the store manager and principal of the school right next to us agreed on. I said I didn´t understand why those kids were so angry, when they know as well as us that stealing has been an issue with the school. They resorted to name-calling us employees and showing the finger. I found it all amusing that they were so angry over something seemingly so minor, but my SO said I didn´t have empathy for the kids, and that it´s unfair that innocent kids are being punished along with the kids who steal. I mean, I get that, but we´re not really taking away any major rights from them. They can still shop, they just have to go to a cashier. But my SO said because I couldn´t empathize, I was autistic.\n\nI´m not good at small talk, and the comment often comes after a taxi ride, when we meet someone we know in public, or when we´ve had visitors/been visiting someone, because I´m not great at talking with people. I acknowledge this, that I often can´t keep up a conversation, but I don´t find it grounds for a diagnosis. \n\nI´ve told her I don´t like the accusation, time and time again, but it keeps on happening. It´s not that I find something inherently wrong with having that diagnosis either, it´s just that it isn´t me, and I also pride myself on having a great sense of empathy (which other people in my life tell me I have). \n\nSo AITA for being angry in this situation? A part of me tells me that I should get tested again, as an adult, and that maybe it comes from a place of real concern. \n\nDon´t know if this is enough info, first time poster/redditor, sorry :(",

      "description": "Hello all, first time reddit poster so I apologize for any mistakes. \n\nThis spring I planned a trip with a group of friends and my SO to go to stay in a cabin for a few days. I was the one who searched for the cabin and initially paid in full the 350 dollars for the cabin. Due to this, my debit card is the one that will be charged if anything if anything happens while at said cabin. My friends are paying me for their portion of the cabin which is no problem--all of them are reliable and I know I will see the money eventually. \n\nThe problem came after I booked the cabin and one of my friends wrote in my group chat that he was bringing weed to the cabin. I had assumed he was joking and it was not until my SO told me that my friend had actually bought the weed that I realized that he wasn't joking. We live in a state where weed is illegal (or else I wouldn't care) and I am a very paranoid person. I told my SO that I was very uncomfortable with everyone smoking in the cabin. In the rules (which I sent a screenshot to everyone in the group chat) it clearly says no smoking in the cabin. Yes, they could smoke outside, but we have no idea how close the other cabins will be to us and I would prefer not getting kicked out of the cabin on the off chance that our next door neighbors smell the smoke of the devil's lettuce. We were already planning on drinking and I have heard horror stories of some of my friends cross-fading and did not particularly want to deal with that either. All of my other friends on the trip have/or do smoke weed so they were on board and I felt like the kill-joy when I told him that I really didn't want him bringing it on the trip.  My SO even got a bit snippy with me when I told him that I was uncomfortable because my friend had already bought it for the trip. \n\nI don't have anything against people who smoke weed--my paranoia is just through the roof and I don't really wanted to get fined or kicked out of the cabin in the very small off-chance that we get caught. Am I the asshole for being too paranoid about this? ",

      "description": "So, backstory as this happened awhile ago but it still kinda bugs me to this day over whether it was the right thing or not. \n\nI used to have this friend, let’s call her Vicky, and I met her through a mutual friend and we got along famously. We had great convos, always laughed and enjoyed ourselves and whatnot, to the point where I developed a bit of a crush on her. However, her friend informed me she had a BF and I immediately recognized and respected that (I’m not a home wrecker) so we just continued being friends. \n\nWe would talk on and off for a long time but it was truly cemented with how good a friends we were when she came to my school. Because of this, we would hang out almost everyday and our friendship grew into almost being best friends, essentially. We would talk about everything (from our mental hang ups to her BF issues) and would even hang out outside of school a lot. I even went to her house a few times and met her family. I thought everything was going well, but it changed.\n\nSo, it went downhill after one week where we made plans to hang out after not chilling for a couple weeks. It was the day of our hang out and I texted her just to reconfirm, she didn’t respond to me for 6 hours (I was already dressed to go) and she responded with a very obvious and flimsy excuse as to why she couldn’t hang out, but I accepted it and didn’t push her. We talked briefly after this but then she just completely ignored me for over a month. \n\nIt really tore me up because I thought everything was great and I couldn’t understand why someone who I thought was one of my best friend would just completely ignore me like this. Many of my other friends told me to just leave it and ignore her, but I wanted to give her another chance and not feel like a wasted my time so I texted her and we got to talking again for less than a day, until she again ignored my text again and she never responded to me...\n\nFast Forward to school starting as this occurred during the summer and I run into her and she just pretends like nothing changed and everything was cool. I was infuriated. I wanted to chew her out so badly, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I asked her why she did this and she came back with an excuse about being busy and studying, but to me, that doesn’t justify almost 3 months of being ignored. You couldn’t find 5 seconds during that time to text me back and let me know you’re even still alive? A wave of realization hit me, why should I be this upset over someone who obviously doesn’t care about me? And I just accepted it, honestly, and I walked away. I still see her around the school every now and then, and I completely ignore her almost everytime and pretend like she doesn’t exist which is kinda shitty but idk what else to do. \n\nMy question is, that I feel like what I did was completely justified, but I wanted to know some other opinions. Was I the asshole here? Sorry for the length, btw. \n",

      "description": "Background is that I’m not a huge fan of mental math (would prefer reading and verbal conversation) and my in laws have this annoying habit of including weird hand signals and math equations during normal conversation. For instance, I recently asked my MIL how old she was so she asked me how old my mother was so I told her 58 and she said “I’m ten years older minus 4 years.” Like what? Another example is if I ask the cost of something they will use hand signals. Like if the number was 680 they would use one hand to make 5, then 1 finger, both hands to make 8 and then either make an “o” with one hand or use both index fingers to make an X to indicate zero. So I get totally frustrated and say “Can you just TELL me the number?” And they act like I’m stupid for it being able to figure it out from their confusing sign language. ",

      "description": "WIBTA for calling the sheriffs office for my neighbor parking in front of my house? \n\nWe moved into our house in June. According to the HOA, and the police dept says people aren’t suppose to park in the street. The streets are narrow and school buses, and emergency vehicles can’t get by when people park in the street.   There’s cutaways I’m the street so you can park there if needed and we all have driveways big enough for 4 cars. Our neighbor does it on a regular bases in front of our house. I would normally be bothered by it but they come home late at night. So my wife and I go to bed and the car isn’t there but most nights that my 1 year old son wakes up around 11-12 at night they are parked there the next morning. So it seems like they are interfering with my sons sleep. We’ve talked to the HOA, and they’ve said there’s nothing they can really do other than call the police to come give them a ticket but they’re not willing to do that. \n\nWe’ve asked our neighbor politely twice now to stop parking there, they are waking up our son at night when they get home, and for a short time (2-3 weeks) they do stop. But it always starts back again. I’m getting tired of it and refuse to not be taken seriously about it issue that involves my son. \n\nWould I be the asshole for telling my neighbor, “we’ve asked twice now, this is the third time, I’m not going to ask again, next time the police will be involved” ?

      "description": "We have been together for around 5 years. The past 3 years he has gained a little weight which is no big deal other than the fact he snores incredibly loud. His father has sleep apnea and I believe he does to. It sounds like a chainsaw cutting down trees that stops only for a few seconds and continues with vengeance. He refuses to see a doctor about it and he says I’m over exaggerating even when I show him a video of how loud it is. We tend to sleep separate because I have a habit of waking up in the middle of the night and it’s impossible to go back to sleep when he is snoring. I feel like the asshole because he’s upset I won’t sleep in the same room but I have told him countless of times to see a doctor as it sounds like he could die in his sleep, but he refuses. I believe it is putting a damper on our sex life because I can’t even cuddle and fall asleep with him without the thought of waking up and getting annoyed from his deafening snoring. I have tried earplugs, listening to music with headphones, etc but i don’t think that’s fair to me I should suffer. It is also extremely embarrassing to deal with considering we went on a cruise with my family and I had to share a room with my sister and her husband because you could hear him in the cabin hallway...Am I the asshole? If I’m not how do I get him to see how frustrating it is for me :( I feel bad because I can’t imagine he feels rested by the way he sounds and tosses and turns.",

He talks about the same stories, the same shit, and every \"conversation\" is just another lecture. He only talks to me  by yelling, and when he calls for me its usually because ive done something wrong, anything. He constantly does this, day after day. They also tell me not to compare myself to others, but compares me the most to smarter people and others\n\nMy mom is okay, shes just there, and backs up my dad or backs up me, a mediator. \n\nThen theres me, i dont like being around my dad because of this, and i try to avoid him. He talks about racial conversations at a restaurant and in public, and he says them REALLY LOUD. ex: Were in a mediterannean restaurant, and he talks about how all of them are poor. \n\nI also dont care for catholicism. My mom is a huge catholic, made my dad convert, and she goes to adoration every tuesday midnight and church every sunday, dragging me along with it. Its not that i dont believe in this, its just i dont care for it.\n\nI game on my PC mostly, enough to say ive locked out conversations with parents. I dont like to talk to them because they think every single conversation is a lesson. \n\nAlso, Im quite athletic, I do Cross country, soccer, and track/volleyball. (so dont assume im not). I also get decent grades, 4 A's with 2 B's (usually), and they dont care too much for that (sometimes). \n\nAITA? what can i do to better my relationship with my parents?\n\n",

      "description": "some background, im a newish (9 months now yikes) developer at a large company, a couple weeks after i started the company had a new hire picnic sort of event, and I went met some people they seemed chill. One member I met invited to a get together over the weekend, and it was pretty much a board game night, we all brought some brews and played board games. It was all pretty chill, I don't think I made any weird faux pas or offended anyone, but we talked about doing like a korean bbq dinner sort of thing at some point, which i was cool with. As it turns out they went and made a private group channel on slack (communication/collab app with reactions) but I was never invited to that group. When I ran into the member who invited me initially I asked about the korean BBQ, and he said they already went and said we made an event in the slack channel (the one im not a member of), and I said oh im not a member, and he said oh well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso yeah for some reason they never invited me back in the group, I didn't bother asking why, I don't handle rejection well (\\[ADHD reasons \\] RSD ([https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/adhd-emotions-how-they-affect-your-life/](https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/adhd-emotions-how-they-affect-your-life/)), so I moved on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe problem is the members of this group are still part of my overarching org, im on a team within the org, and they're on another team within the org (i think 3 of them are actually on the same team so they sit in the same area etc), I've made my group of friends at this point so idrc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow my boss recently asked me to talk to one of the members about the stuff that she's been working on, because it's related to what I'm working on, and me (still hurt and confused about why i was rejected and excluded from the group in the first place) refused to, and am currently figuring out the implementation on my own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand yeah im a male, i could \"grow some balls\" in regards to the situation but fuck them, its not the exclusion that makes me angry, it's the fact that i was never told why. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to work with any of them? Should i confront and ask why? Is it even worth it at this point ( i assume it is because professional stuff). ",

      "description": "I know that headline wasn't terribly clear. What I'm trying to say is that he's constantly going in my pockets/purse/bags and taking things that I've hidden for a rainy day. Now, I feel like all our things are shared, so I am NOT upset that he is grabbing cash or smoking some of our \"out of sight, out of mind\" stash. I'm upset because then when we're out of something and we need toilet paper, or a pack of smokes, or some diapers, I get all happy because I figure it's taken care of, I go to the stash, and it's gone. I've had an awful day, we're broke and out of bud, I go to get the emergency bag and there's a stem and two hits of shake left. He figures because it's \"his\" money that he can do what he wants and he shouldn't have to tell me shit.  (I'm a SAHM most of the time, and pick up part time jobs here and there.) But these are sometimes things I've saved for a while, money I've put away for any number of things. And what's pissing me off is he doesn't think he should have to tell me! I just want a heads up! Like, \"Hey, I took that $10 out of the secret pocket of your purse.\" So that when I'm $5 short at the grocery store I know I have to put something back instead of searching like a crazy person for money that isn't there. Or retracing my steps thinking I dropped it. It hurts my feelings that he doesn't see how disrespectful it is. I feel incredibly unimportant and I want to know if I'm crazy or he's a dick. ",

      "description": "Long post. Sorry if it’s a rant. Obligatory “I’m on mobile.” This just happened so I’m really overwhelmed. \n\nI just wanna start this off by saying I’ve had one of the worst weeks I’ve had in a long time. With severe health issues, family drama, and personal stuff, I have been on edge a lot. My friends know this, and this all still blew up. \n\n\nI’m in a group chat. This group chat has some of my best friends in it, and when we see something silly online, we take screenshots and send it to the group chat. I saw something I disagreed with, sent the screenshot and whatever I thought about it. I’m not sure if it’s important, but the post was someone confusing anxiety and anxiety disorders, and sounding kind of strange about it. Seemingly unimportant. Willing to share if asked. Anyway, a girl in the group chat who I am the least close with started defending the post. Which is fine, but I explained why I thought it was ridiculous. \n\n\nThis leads to the next part of the story. The girl then brings up, “If you’re against social media, why do you follow people who post everything they’re thinking all the time?” Valid, I suppose, but these are people that I know and feel almost obligated to follow. We all have those people. I will acknowledge I was getting defensive, but why is it this girls business? Who CARES?\n\n\nBased on this, AITA? I’m not necessarily looking for input on what I said. I want to know if it was valid for me to defend my social media presence. Sorry if this makes no sense. I’m still overwhelmed. ",

She responds oh I forgot to tell you that I want to take this dance class (she a dancer so it's like training) tomorrow movie is now a no go. I'm like ok that's fine. She then asked if I would on Sunday and I said I wanted to watch football cause playoffs and why an I forced to miss what I want now. She was like ok cool. \n\nToday, I even force her out of bed today to go to said class when she was trying to snooze alarm too many times. She calls me to say class was cut short and now is mad for going at all but again brings up me changing my plans and doing some stuff I'd do tomorrow, like grocery shopping, so we can go. She does this in a super condescending way and says I'm being too into routine for having the grocery day and calls me inflexible. I say that's fine but at least acknowledge how inconsiderate this is in that you want me to change all my plans because you made choices. \n\nAlso, I was willing to go by the end because she actually told me the wrong tikes initially and I found I could make it work with playoffs timing but we got into an argument over her approach thus her being like fuck it I'll go by myself.\n\nAm I the asshole? Should I just have been like ok whatever?",

      "description": "Please bear with me, it’s quite long.\n\nA bit of context: I’m in the second to last year of high school. My grandmother, the sweetest person alive, lives in a cottage cottage by the sea but she won’t be there for a couple of weeks in June-July because she’ll be visiting a friend. Since these dates coincide PERFECTLY with the end of our huge national exam, she told me I could invite 4-5 friends to spend a week there to celebrate the end of our exams, which would be the coolest thing (someone would also watch over her house while she’s gone)! \n\nI have more than 5 friends in my friend group, so I couldn’t invite everyone, and I had to make tough decisions about who I should invite. I was telling them about 1 by 1, telling them not to tell the everyone else to not hurt the feelings of those I couldn’t invite, and then came last weekend. \n\nI recently got to introduce some of my friends to D&amp;D, they loved it, and told our friends that couldn’t make it. One of the friends I was going to invite has kept asking me when I could host a game for her. We scheduled a game for last Saturday, after she made us reschedule thrice, and at 19h25 (session was at 19h), she sent me a text saying she had forgotten that it was her godmother’s birthday and her family was going out for dinner with her. Normally, I wouldn’t mind too much, it happens, and we still had an awesome evening, but I remembered her using the same excuse before. The same night, there was a party at another guy’s house, some friends had cancelled to go there, which I totally understand, and they told me in advance, so I made the connection quickly. \n\nMonday I asked about her evening, she said they went to a restaurant and she had a good time. I asked one of the friends who went to the party, he said she showed up around 19h15, and later when I saw the guy throwing the party, I asked him if R had confirmed her presence of just showed up. He said she had confirmed she would go three days earlier. I was quite mad about that. I absolutely understand wanting to go to the party and not some nerdy game, but she was the one to push me to organise the session to introduce HER to the game, made us reschedule thrice, and she lied about it. Just a heads up 30min earlier would’ve been fine, or even at 19h30 if she had said she had gone to the party instead, I wouldn’t have minded. \n\nI haven’t told her about the trip yet, and I can only invite so many people, I’m considering cutting her out and inviting someone else instead. WIBTA if I did that? Am I being petty and overly salty because she lied to go to a party? She’s usually a good friend, but her pulling off this sort of thing is not unheard of. \n\nTLDR: Friend asked me to organise a D&amp;D session for her, doesn’t show up and lies about going to another guy’s party, I’m thinking of cutting her out of a holiday, which she doesn’t know about, and inviting someone else because I can’t invite all my friends.",

I complained coming in that snot rags dont count as recycling neither. \n\nShe corrected me. They werent snot rags; they were cum rags she wiped up after we had sex.\n\nI immeadiately disagred, but she wanted to listen to a podcast so i respected her wishes. \n\nAfter it ended she was noticably silent. I asked her whats wrong. Apparently SHE is pissed at ME for chewing into despite her helping wash dishes.\n\nWhat the actual fuck? Is this abuse? This feels like abuse. It was disgusting, and she refuses to acknowledge any fault and still insists its okay because its recyclable.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "Please help me figure out if I'm the asshole in this situation. I sure feel like one, my friends tell me I'm not one, but I'm hoping for input from outside sources.\n\nI wasn't able to make it to my family's house for Boxing Day because I had to work, so they decided to do a Christmas/birthday celebration this Sunday. Every time I go over to their house (2 hour drive from me, or an hour long ferry ride that's about $40 there and back since I take my car) since my grandpa and uncle died 5 years ago, it's been weird and depressing. \n\nThe weird and depressing part mostly centers around my aunt. She likes to dominate the conversation, but dominates it by talking about her grief counseling, her now ex-boyfriend who became deeply involved in the Sasquatch community and cheated on her and just general whining and complaining about anything and everything. It makes my dad and his significant other visibly irritated and my grandma tries to cater to her. My aunt and my dad's SO always end up in some sort of minor conflict, because eventually she tells my aunt to quit ruining the mood, and no one else in my family is willing to voice to her that she's being a huge bummer. I just sit there and stare at my phone, because I have nothing to add to the conversation and the only thing people ever want to talk to me about is my job, but when I do end up talking about my job, nobody is particularly interested (why would they be? No one wants to hear about my tenant's not paying rent or a recent insurance claim I had to file for 10k worth of water damage). My uncle doesn't make the situation much better, because he is a born again Christian who loves bringing up Jesus at every opportunity. My family has a habit of talking over one and other, not actually listening to anything that anyone is saying and it's frustrating for me to deal with, as there's one or another event happening every month that I'm expected to attend, since I'm the only grandchild. Every time I'm there it's just sort of sad to be around, and I have to spend the entire day from 8:00am until 7:00pm taking a long drive, paying for gas/toll roads or ferry fare and then sitting around and listening to everyone talk at each other, and to watch my dad be obviously on edge. Also, in the past five years, they stopped cooking meals for these get togethers and just order a bunch of Little Caesar's pizzas. \n\nI'm on call 24 hours a day and I'm also chronically ill. It's so easy for me to make an excuse to not go because \"something at work came up\" or \"I'm having muscle spasms and can't drive 120 miles\", but I've used those excuses to get out of the last two gatherings and have gotten texts from my aunt about how \"disappointed\" she was that I didn't show up. \n\nI just quit a job where I was working 4 tens, so I'm readjusting to only Saturday/Sunday off, and my weekends are super valuable to me, I like to sleep in until noon, watch Netflix, read and hang out with my dog. I'm a super introverted person, weekends are a time for me to \"recharge\" before I go back to work, and these events are always really draining on me. It's much easier when they have family stuff at my dad's house, since it's about a 30 minute drive from mine and I can go for a couple hours, he cooks great food, I can bring my dog and then head home. \n\nAm I taking my family for granted? They're not bad people, they're just hard to be around sometimes but not for any \"real\" reasons. Am I an asshole for just telling them I don't want to go? \n\ntl;dr: my family lives far away from me and they are depressing to be around. I work a ton and want to spend my weekends relaxing at home instead of spending one of my two days off driving for four hours to be in a depressing situation and eat Little Caesar's pizza.  ",

My dad came downstairs and got upset telling me to get out of bed. I got up... then went back to sleep. This happened several times with him yelling at me every 5-10 mins, I explained that I had been up all night, that I didn’t want to argue while I was tired and a little unstable, plus I had homework that I needed to get some sleep to do. My plan was to sleep til 3, but I never communicated this. My dad persisted in his efforts. I locked the door and he yelled and banged on the door, then got my door key, opened it up, and kicked me out.\n\nI left, and eventually he called me back because my mom said she was afraid I’d relapse back on the street.\n\nI think I’m the asshole, everyone I talk to says I’m the asshole, but idk... I guess I just want outside opinions. Maybe we’re both assholes? But I did break the house rules.",

      "description": "     Last February I discovered that my husband told me he was working late when in fact he was having drinks with an ex girlfriend. I was angry and hurt, and also began to question every other time he told me he was working late, or going out with the guys. Before this incident, I trusted him without question. He was apologetic, and I asked that he cut off contact with this person. She has a history of pursuing married men, and in fact they broke up when he proposed and she confessed to chatting with a married man.\n     Last November, I discovered that he had not cut off contact, that they had met several times, and when confronted he insisted that he only agreed to delete her number. He claims that they are just friends, that I'm overreacting, and that I should trust him. He will not stop seeing her. \n  I have asked him to just tell me when he's seeing her, as the lying and secrecy are what I cannot stand. He agreed, but now every time he leaves the house I wonder. I'm losing sleep, I have trouble enjoying sex, I have a hard time getting out of bed some days. I don't want to leave my marriage, as we have a child together. He is a good father, and treats me with respect and consideration in all other aspects of our life. I adored him, and he broke my heart.\n     My closest friend says I need to tell him that I'm not over this issue, that it haunts me, and that it's affecting my life. I believe it will not change anything, and that I will just be more hurt. I can be kind to him for the sake of our child, but I no longer have the trust or respect for him that I once had.\nAITA for hardening my heart and living in this marriage as if nothing has changed? I believe he thinks we are ok. \n",

      "description": "I guess it’s more like, WIBTA.  I come home from work and go into the living room to talk to my 17-year old niece who’s visiting from out of town (I’m 41, in case that matters).  She immediately says, “Eww, you need a shower!”\n\nMind you, I take a shower every day.  It’s true that I walked home from work, but it was only a mile and it was 50 degrees out, so it’s not like I’m sweating up a storm.  And I really truly don’t think I smell bad.  I know they say you can’t really smell yourself, but I’d think if it were as bad as my niece says, I’d smell *something*.\n\nSo I roll my eyes and go in the kitchen to take off my shoes, then go upstairs.  As I’m going upstairs, she then yells, “eww, I can smell you from here!”\n\nSo now I’m like, why should I go back downstairs to spend any time with her?  I legitimately have work to do (homework and laundry), but she’s leaving on Saturday and wouldn’t it be... I dunno, rude or mean or something to completely ignore her tonight?\n\nIt’s ridiculous, I know - she’s 17 years old, but she is making me cry.  (I’m pathetically overly sensitive.)  So I don’t want to go back down.  And if she knows she made me cry, she’ll start laughing- she’s that kind of person.  (Not a bad person - just a teenager, and aren’t they all horrible?)\n\nI know I’m ridiculous, but AITA?",

I just started a respiratory program in school so I knew my schedule was gonna be busy and my parents are both live ins for their work so I also take care of both my younger siblings, my grandma and my disabled uncle. Anyways months before our anniversary I let my boyfriend know that I had class that day so I wasn't gonna be able to celebrate with him and he said that he understood and was ok with it. I felt really bad so I planned a weekend get away for the both of us to celebrate Valentine's and our anniversary together this weekend and I thought everything was gonna go well. So it's the day of our anniversary and my boyfriend surprised me by delivering flowers to my house and I called him excited saying how thankful I was for the surprise then he kind of changed his mood and said that my reaction wasn't what he expected and that his grandma is mad because I couldn't even see him today. I was at a lost for words because I really was happy with the surprise and I thought I made it clear to him why I couldn't see him yesterday. He told me his grandma said that it wasn't fair that it was only him chasing in the relationship and that I don't put in the same effort as he does... and it really upset me because my boyfriend and I already talked about our weekend and I had a surprise gift for him that I've been working on all week which I had to ruin and show him early even though it wasn't done to show him that I'm also putting in effort in our relationship...

      "description": "TL:DR Fiance of 7 years has been seriously depressed for over half a year straight now, every time I try to help, talk or be close to him he says I am wrong in some way and things are my fault, and it is starting to really suck the life out of me so much that I am even thinking about breaking up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiance and I have been together for over 7,5 years now. He has always been moody and hard to approach as well as really blunt. I on the other hand am not. We are really different and we communicate in really different ways. We have both grown and learned a lot during our relationship, but in the past 5 months I have started to wonder if he is the person I want to be with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe moved in together into my apartment about 8 months ago and that is when his depression started. He stopped smoking weed (after 10 years of use) and tobacco (after 17 years of use) when he moved in with me. I was fine with him smoking for example on the balcony, just not indoors. He insisted in stopping though, and he stopped kinda in one go when he moved in (with occasional use).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few months were hellish and he was going through some other deep shit too, but it felt like he was connecting that shit to me. He was telling me how wrong i was doing things, helping him in all the wrong ways and how I should be doing things better. I understand that he was, and still is, going through deep shit and I need to improve my communication. So I tried to give it to him and grow even more than i had in the entire relationship to be able to be there for him. He started to become angry about me seeing my friends and he started to pick fights about the smallest little things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 2,5 months after he moved in with me, I was in a concert with old friends and met a really amazing person. He seemed like all of the things that I wished to get at that moment. In a way I wanted to leave my fiance for him but the thing is that I am not willing to throw away a relationship and hard work of 7 years just because I clicked with someone. But the idea of who I want to spend the rest of my life with really stuck and that I am not happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have promised to myself in October that if this relationship is the same in about a year I will brake up with him. I know everything wont ever be perfect and I don't want a picture perfect result in a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nATM if he is away for a few days I feel better, more energized and happier. Things are not sustainable. Not as bad as in the summer but not good either. I don't like living with a person to whom EVERY day is a bad day and what I am doing is not helping at all. I and him feel taken granted for, my needs are not met either and the only feedback I seem to get is that I am not enough and that I do not understand him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to keep this as short as possible but there is a lot of things going on. Thank you for the help. At the moment I don't know what to do and who is supposed to change.",

Realizing that I am not being taken seriously, I decided two nights ago to tell her brother about it all, in hopes that she’ll listen to him. When she discovered what I did, she became furious, telling me it wasn’t my place, and saying that I’m overreacting and that she knows her limits and that she felt fine to drive each time. I had a zero tolerance policy on this, since she lives in a major city and Uber is so readily available, AND I have offered to pay for her Uber every time she needs it rather than her risk the drive.\n\nAm I the asshole here?

      "description": "I fell in love with Ashtanga yoga a couple years back thanks to an amazing teacher who now has a different schedule. There are 2 other choices, a guy whose classes are uncomfortable full and who unintelligbly barks out poses like an auctioneer on red bull  and this other lady who I heard good things about.\n\nI have gone to her class 3x now and her teaching style is fine but my problem is I am distracted to the point of not getting what I should out of class because she is skeletal. I dont mean skinny, I mean there is no explanation for this womans appearance besides anorexia or chronic illness. She is bone and sinew and skin and her hips are more narrow than my 3rd graders. She looks like a holocaust victim, except wearing heavy full face makeup and neck to ankle workout clothes.\n\nI have a hard time looking at her, frankly, and even listening to her reminds me of how she looks because her voice is raspy. I should be focusing on my breath, clearing my mind, focusing my energy, and instead I want to know what is wrong with her and whether anyone has tried to help her.\n\n I am liberally minded, in a diverse area, and have never given more than a passing thought to people who are differently featured, abled, or of different body habitus than I.  I am normal and do have passing snarky thoughts about people who have made unfortunate choices but generally I dont focus on appearance. I have searched my feelings and the best answers I can come up with are 1) most yoga/fitness instructors are fresh-faced examples of glowing health so the difference is jarring and 2) I am a natural caretaker and her appearance reminds me of that of my father when he was wasting away from cancer. \n\nFor my health and well being I need to go to yoga and am hoping that over time I will get used to her but my inability to stop focusing on her is kind of upsetting me. Is it a normal human reaction to be disturbed by someone who looks this way or am I just fooling myself about being judgmental?",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm F (40) my friend is M (40). We'd been bf&amp;gf on and off over the last 13 years. We've stayed friends and hung out when we weren't bf&amp;gf, until the last 4 years, when we kind of drifted off and only saw each other out socially about once a month. We always still talked, and there are obvious feelings between us, but we never got back together again as bf&amp;gf.\n\nWe met each other while he was living in my home country. He decided to return to his home country, for an undefined period of time, maybe forever. From the time he told me he was leaving, until he left,(only about 2 weeks time) we were in almost daily contact again.\n\nA couple of days before he left, we got back together, romantically, and spent a really nice night together. We realized that we wanted to be together again, but with his new plans to leave, we obviously couldn't do that right away.\n\nAnother friend &amp; I drove him to his home country. The plan was to hang out for a couple of days, and then he would stay and we would drive back. \n\nThe last night, we were out at some bars and my friend got really drunk and asked me if I wouldn't mind going to a strip club. He lied to me and said our other friend was who really wanted to go, and he wanted to go for his friend. I was pretty drunk, and I told him that although I had never been to one, I wasn't judging, that they were just working, and as long as he didn't leave me alone, or disrespect me, I would be ok with going.\n\nAs we were in a country that is not my home country, I had NO idea that the strip clubs where we were are actually brothels and clients can touch the girls.\n\nMy friend seems to be an out of control alcoholic. I learned what a gross drunk he is, when 1st, he asked a stripper to lift her skirt, and he kissed her on the butt. Ok...this is starting to not be so much fun. A little later, he asked a different stripper to sit next to him and spread her legs. She did. He then stuck his hand in her panties and started touching her.\n\nAt this point I freaked out, kind of smacked him in the shoulder and asked him what the hell he thought he was doing? I then proceeded to storm out of the club and my other friend and I waited in the car until he finally came out about 15 minutes later.\n\nHe refused to see why I might be upset. He kept drinking. I was really upset and kept bitching at him and accused of throwing away our friendship. We got back to the house, and there wasn't too much more talk. He basically was so drunk he couldn't talk.\n\nWe ended up leaving to drive back about 7 hours later. He never sobered up. We had a very sad goodbye, and just left him there. Everyone was crying.\n\nNow its been a couple of weeks and we haven't talked since the day we said goodbye. His phone seems to not work there, and he hasn't contacted me any other way. I'm afraid he might be mad about how I acted in the club, and for yelling in the car afterwards. AITA?",

I also go to school full time and am also a student athlete for my school. I guess you could say that I was spoiled as a kid, but I was always grateful for the stuff that I received. Now I do believe that my parents care about me deeply, but I think they go about it the wrong way. Like imagine hardcore Asian tiger parent stereotypes of strict. Like they would get so mad at me for asking if I can stay out late that eventually I just stopped asking and stayed home the entire time. Recently I came home drunk (not wasted, but a little tipsy) and the went full on ballistic. I was 18 btw. And I didn't drive home that night either, I got a ride from a friend. And they've always been pretty strict about not being home (in middle and high school, I had to be home by 7pm. A 7pm curfew in high school.) Weekends were also a pretty big no-no. They were usually spent at home because \"We are going to do something later\", even though we never did. Also, I was often called an \"unappreciative, spoiled brat\" for wanting to spend time with my friends rather than my family. So AITA for getting mad at my parents for really limiting my social life if I had an otherwise pretty good life? ",

      "description": "This is a couple days old but I’ve been feeling conflicted about it since it happened. So a couple days ago as I was leaving one of my classes I say bye to my friend, and another friend we’ll call G says “wow, you aren’t going to say bye to me? Ouch.” She didn’t mean it in a mean way, but it’s pretty annoying, and this happens to me a lot. I turned around and awkwardly said, “oh, uhh bye?” It was painfully awkward. When I get home I put on my story a PSA saying “hey can you not do this” because oddly enough this happens to me at least twice a week from different people. Well, G got angry. Very angry. She texted me saying I don’t know how to take a joke and how I shouldn’t call her out on my story. At first I tried defusing the situation saying that I didn’t say it towards her specifically, but she was still pissed. That was enough for me and I ended up succumbing and got in a fight with her. For context, she has a really bad habit of constantly mocking my sense of humor and taste in music, saying that both are terrible any time I show anyone in her vicinity a meme or song, as well as just usually calling me stupid. She does this all under the guise of “sarcasm” and “joking”, and I ended up unloading all of my pent up anger about it on her. I really really *really* laid into her. At the end of my tirade I said verbatim “if you haven’t noticed, these past few days I’ve been purposely avoiding you, and I’d appreciate it if you did the same.” All she texted back was “thanks for making me cry, dickhead.” I left it at that. I came to mutual friends to try and get advice on the situation, and they all told me I was in the wrong for yelling at her and for putting the PSA on my snap. They all told me I had to apologize. I eventually relented because I realized I’d destroy my friendships with all of them if I didn’t, and so the next time I saw G I stumbled through an apology I didn’t mean, feeling totally humiliated. She thanked me and things have gone back to normal since, but when I mean normal I’m saying the continual bullying. Every once in a while she’ll give subtle hints to the things I said to her, throwing them back in my face, but never outright saying it. Am I the asshole? I feel like at any time I could’ve just apologized and ended it before it spiraled out of control, and I guess in retrospect the PSA was kind of passive aggressive, but I still feel like G’s response was out of proportion to the situation at hand.

      "description": "I feel like im gonna get told im just looking for validation or like i should just know the answer, but ive grown up with the mentality of minding your own business, dont but in, leave it be etc.\n\nBut i cant. I found out when my housemate and her ex were together the ex was at times physically abusive. My housemate is still in love with her despite the break up (ex initiated it and yet is still ALWAYS here) and wants to get back together but especially after finding out about the abuse, all im seeing is red flags.\n\nIm the person who will strand themselves in an unfamiliar city with no way home because someone i was seeing MIGHT have hit me. I cant fathom staying with someone who actually does.\n\nBut thats what my housemate is like, she gets attached and even when she knows its wrong cant detach.\n\nI only met them two days after they broke up when i moved in, so i never met my housemate when she was happy and settled. So far shes been grumpy and moody and drinking a lot, but shes also terrified of change and trust me when i say shes been through a lot of those in the last couple weeks.\n\nSo theyre broken up... And the ex is constantly around. Under the guise of finding the dog (puppy they got together was stolen) but shes here way too often and with her daughter even so i call bullshit.\n\nANYWAY they were arguing the other night, ex was yelling at housemate to help her look for the dog, housemate was saying no because she doesnt want to get in the car with the exs brother. Ex wasnt listening and eventually i (i was in the lounge 2 metres from the argument) spoke up and told ex that housemate said no so leave it.\n\nIt didnt help at all, just got told to butt out by the ex, but didnt escelate anything either. I later apologised to housemate for overstepping my bounds but she said it was fine and my other housemate thanked me because shes always been too scared to say anything. (Ex is one of those chicks who LOOKS like you dont want to be on her bad side. And ive seen evidence that she lives up to her appearance)\n\nAs much as im told i was fine and perfectly in the right to speak up, i still cant help but feel i had no right as it wasnt my battle to pick and im not sure its even any of my business, happening in my house or not.\n\n(Further info, im on a months trial so i dont even officially live here yet)\n\nAITA for stepping in on my housemates argument with her ex?",

      "description": "There's a fairly long backstory here but its relevant to the post so bear with me (TL;DR at bottom).\n\nOur neighbours over the back bought their house a few years ago and proceeded to almost completely demolish it and rebuild it much larger. We were fine with that - there was a lot of noise and dust for a couple of months but it was only temporary. As part of the rebuild they installed solar panels on the roof, high level security flood lights and lots of windows (this is relevant later). This was all fine except one of the security lights shone right into our house. Next time I saw them, I asked them if they could angle it down a bit so it wasn't shining into our house. They moved it a bit but it still shines in. We've got used to it. The solar panels and windows also reflect the sun into our house from time to time. That's to be expected if you live near other people. Houses have reflective surfaces on them.\n\nThen they asked if they could remove our hedge and plant a new one on their land. I agreed because TBF our hedge was a bit old and badly maintained. So then there was no boundary between our garden and theirs. Fine but their dog kept coming into our garden and leaving \"little presents\" and their kids kept knocking balls in and trampling our flower beds to get them. I mentioned this to them, they apologised but nothing really changed. I didn't bother mentioning it again. \n\nThey then asked if they could trim one of our trees that was overhanging their garden. I agreed and offered to do it for them but his brother is a tree surgeon so they said they wanted to do it - fine. We were out when the brother came round and we got home to find he'd removed 3 of the trees in our garden. I was annoyed but didn't say anything in the interests of neighbourly relations. They were self-seeded trees anyway, not as if we'd bought and planted them.\n\nThen nothing else happened for a while. This year, we decided to have an extension built on our house and took the opportunity to have solar panels fitted to our roof as well. They were installed a few days ago and whilst they were still being installed, the woman from the back came round to complain to the builders that the solar panels were causing glare in their house.\n\nI was pretty gob-smacked. They were complaining about something that they had installed years before us, not to mention the security light that ensures we don't just get glare during the day but through the night as well. I've just ignored it and haven't been round to see them.\n\nTL;DR neighbours at the back install solar panels and security lights which glare into our house. Then complain about us installing solar panels that glare into their house.",

      "description": "This is actually my first post, I really wanted to share this story because it has been on my mind for a week. I'm on mobile so I am sorry for the format.\nTo get to my school I have to take the subway, and transfer one or two time to get to my school. \nSo the first train trip I was running late, and instead of going to the last station, I went to the station before it to get to school close to onetime,  even though it meant not getting a seat for my ride.\nWhen I had to transfer trains, my legs were hurting from standing. (Also to the fact that I am on a sports team and my legs were killing me from doing a few laps). \nThis is the time I should explain the layout of the train. It had 3 chairs a gap and 2 chairs perpendicular to it I sat on a chair at the end of the 3 chairs, and a guy sat on the other end so there was a seat in between me and him. (This is important to note).\nStops go and pass until it was 2 to 3 stops until I  reach my stop. The train is pretty crowded now, but the middle seat is still open. Then comes this lady.\nI'm not trying to sound rude, but the only way to describe her was very obese. She proceeds to walk near to the middle seat. Note that the middle seat is for an average - lil thick person. But she puts down her bag. I though she was going to put her bag down to hold onto the pole. I was wrong.  She begins to try to sit down in the little seat. She actually though she could fit in.\nShe sits on half of my leg. I kid you not half of my leg was enveloped by her leg. I was literally sliding out of my chair in the process. So I quickly stand up.\nLady: you dont have to stand up sweety theres enough room to sit. \nMe: I'm sorry but you are taking up a part off my seat and I was getting pushed, it's fine if I stand for a bit\nShe didnt say anything to me after that, but muttered very loudly about me being rude and that I have plenty of room to sit.\nOnly one of two people stared a little at me, but it didnt matter as I got off in two stops. This made me think if I'm the asshole.",

Also, she was very self conscious but has become more defensive and starts conversations about politics at uncalled for moments all the time.\n\nNote: all names are changed.\n\nSo, the night of the event. Friday night. This friend, Laura, texted, “oh my f*cking god. New Zealand will change their gun laws, idiots. Without guns the citizens now can’t protect themselves. Well sh!t.” My friend Amy just replied with a light hearted signal that she didn’t want to argue. This isn’t really important. I said, “Look, I’m not going to argue about this. Now isn’t the time to use death for a political agenda.” She countered by saying that she was just expressing her opinion and observing that the government was, “playing right into the terrorists’ hands.” At this point, I was pretty annoyed with her. Meanwhile, Amy is joking like, “I’m gonna kill you😂” because we argue a lot and we decided that for the most part it was best to avoid it. At the same time, I said, “they aren’t. And you are being an asshole to those who lost their lives and their families. Stop.” Not one text later, I said, “Sorry, I just don’t want to talk about this.” And she explodes. She told everyone to f*ck off. She said it sure f*cking looked like I was sorry. She told Julia, who was just innocently sending cute stickers like she always does, to f*ck off. She told all of us that she were the reason she was moving. \n\nThe next day, I apologized. Later, she said she expected everyone to apologize. No one else did anything wrong though. I told her this today, after she ignored us the entire day. I told her she was handling her problems poorly and also that if she wanted to remain friends, we expected an apology too. After all, those of us who were involved did the same. She said she wouldn’t apologize because she had an outburst because of what YOU (we, just showing for emphasis) did. Note that I only wanted her to apologize for telling her long-time friends to f*ck off. I’m fine if she believes the rest. Oh also when I confronted her about wanting an apology she claimed that she didn’t, but that was the point of not talking to us?? She expects us to do something, cause she is obviously not at all in the wrong? She blamed the fact that she told everyone to f*ck off... on us... and she is acting very entitled... and she is blatantly avoiding us (she has a whole plan for the week)... and I’m really p!ssed about it! Sorry for being lengthy, I wanted to explain in detail. \n\nSo... AITA?",

We usually just laughed or said oof.\nBut on one of the nights at camp the girl said something at one of the bonfires about some sad stuff in her life and my friend turned to me and said oof. I'm usually a calm and collected guy but when he said this I just got really mad. Yelling at him that he was being a dick and that he should be more understanding. \nBut now that I look back on it I can see that I just yelled at him out of nowhere for something that we were both previously doing. Am I the asshole?\nI did apologize afterwards but I dont think he forgave me.",

      "description": "Sorry I’m on mobile, on a throw away, and that this is a long one. \n\nMy close friend and I are both very fiery, passionate people, as are most of our friends. However, when we have conversations, either between the two of us or with multiple people, she dominates the conversation. She’s constantly cutting people off to add on to one of her previous statements, or entirely talking over me or someone else when we’re trying to add on, refute, or interject. \n\nShe’ll go on a verbal tirade, and after finally taking a breath, get mad that “no one is contributing to the discussion.” \n\nI’ve brought up to her that she bulldozes over me or someone else trying to start a sentence, and she just repeated “well no one ever says anything.” Trying to explain to her that we’ve all stopped talking because she won’t go unheard completely goes over her head. \n\nAm I the asshole for giving up? Are we all (as friends) the assholes for letting her talk into empty air? No one wants to engage with her anymore because the entire dialogue is her just droning on and on. We were all continually getting in half words or half statements before her starting up again. \n\n“Have you—“ cut off. \n“Did you know that—“ cut off. \n“My other friend—“ cut off. \n\nI don’t honestly know why she’s still invited out with us since everyone either tunes her out, or just waits for her to wear herself out before we start real conversations everyone can participate in. I feel like such a dick because she’s just not understanding that she needs to chill out and listen to everyone, and also because I honestly can’t stand her incessant need to dominate the conversation. \n\nWe’ve been friends for years, but her impatience, unwillingness, or ignorance in hearing other people out is hitting a critical level. \n\nAITA for wanting everyone to get a fucking chance to speak?",

Right now, all of them are ready for chicks, but we don't have a rooster so they're just nesting in random places.\n\nIt was getting late, so I tried picking up one of the chickens to move it to the coop (foxes, and all). \n\nChicken starts flapping and stuff, as they do when getting picked up while thinking they're sitting on a nest of potential babies. Dog comes over, misreading the situation, and tries to nip at the chicken as a meal.\n\nThis causes me to drop the chicken, and close my hand around their mouth, as a sort of \"No, bad!\" gesture. Maybe too rough, maybe not. I don't *think* I was too rough, kinda more like a tight squeeze on someone's arm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a bit, dog is backing away from me, ears drooped, walking like they're afraid of me. I'm scared I closed my hand too hard, and the dog's kinda hurt, and I did the wrong thing. \n\nThis is the first time I've punished them in this sort of way, if that changes anything. I haven't slapped 'em, bumped their nose on purpose, or tugged their tail. This is a first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut yeah, AITA? Or is the dog overreacting, and it'll be fine after a while?

      "description": "I live in the US and in the south, if that makes any difference.\n\nMy boyfriend and I go to a variety of restaurants because we love trying new food. Hawaiian BBQ, Thai, pho, Cajun, pretty much anything. Often, living in a smallish town in the south, the restaurants that serve these foods are going to be small businesses, holes in the wall, stuff like that. So naturally there aren't going to be a *whole* lot of tables and when it does get busy it can be hard to find a place to sit.\n\nMy question is whether it makes me the asshole for getting annoyed when random people will pull up a chair without a word and join us at our table. People of all ages, races, sexes, and so on have done this and I can't figure out why it's so common; I'd never have the audacity to do that to someone. I totally get that it can get packed and people just want a place to sit, and I would absolutely not say no if they asked 'can I sit here?' first, but it irks me a ton if they just sit down, especially if they start eating there next to us too. I've even once had someone sit on the edge of the seat of our booth once and I was blown away by it. \n\nI never say anything to them, though, because it's not worth starting a scene about, although sometimes I wonder if I should at some point, especially if they sit down with food and start eating. Surely it wouldn't be so bad to say 'excuse me, we're on a date and we'd like privacy' or something...? But my boyfriend disagrees when we speak about it after. Don't get me wrong though, he's just easygoing, so I'm not asking if he's the asshole, but rather the strangers that help themselves.\n\nMy boyfriend thinks it's no big deal and that I shouldn't be bothered by it, I think it's rude for strangers to just have a seat and not say shit.

      "description": "I've made an alt account to post this as I don't want to be identified.\n\nThis story starts from, well - the day I was born.\nMy siblings are a good 10-20 years older than me, so they were in their late teens when I was born. One of my brothers who ill call J befriended my father who was an alcoholic and abusive asshole. My dad got him his first job on a construction site, but the friendship kind of corrupted him. He turned to hard drugs and became an alcoholic. \n\nThere's a lot of people involved in this story, and I don't know if I'm in the wrong in any of the scenarios so please, hear me out.\n\nMy brother spiraled. His mental health was worse than ever and he became abusive himself, only when he was drunk though. When he was sober, lovely but troubled man. He used to sit with me, tell me everything. He would tell me how depressed he was and what he thought his dreams meant. He told me about messed up stuff from his childhood, and although i'd been slapped, punched, pushed, etc by this man, I had a genuine understanding of what he was going through. He had never had a gf, until about 5 years back. He was almost 40 as this point. She was a horrible, nasty woman. He started to go to college, she changed his mind and he went back to drugs again. We found out that she had had her name changed by the courts after an 8 year sentence. We never found out what she did. Anyway, she turned vapid, proper mentalist. She attempted to stab my brother, failed and she'd pace back and forth in the hallway with a knife chanting that she was going to kill my mum. My brother dumped her, but she came back with 'i'm pregnant'.\n\nMy brother, being surprised and amazed that he had to chance to be a father went flying back to her. Sure beats prison, which he'd been to a few times for minor offenses committed while drunk. \n\nThe girlfriend, who ill call R moved in to a caravan in my mums back garden with J for Christmas. After a few weeks, my mum started trusted them to come in. R would insist on washing dishes for my mum, etc. Next thing I know, Christmas eve. I'm playing fallout 4 upstairs in my room and my brother comes waltzing in drunk. This has always been kind of scary for me as I'm a girl and my brother was a lot larger than me, he had hit me before. I have really bad anxiety, so its not often I stand up for myself. \n\n\nSo, he comes in and he goes \"Mums crying downstairs\" while laughing. I look at him and stand up and scream \"if you've fucking hurt her, I'll kill you' and I run downstairs to check on her while my brother sits in my room, having the audacity to ask me for a lighter for his cig. I run down, and my mums in tears. Next thing I know, R comes downstairs after me and my mum. She's very pregnant at this point and she was getting aggressive. She was very, very drunk and on speed or something. She was jittery and telling my mum she would kill her. R pushed my mum, so my mum shoved her back (for her own safety). \n\nR started the whole \" I'm pregnant! You hit me!\" \nMy mum fired back over the alcohol and drugs and how she was killing her grandchild. Things really kicked off there, so my mum called my other brother, who we'll call Alam. Alam and his wife Deye turn up, arguing for them to leave our property. Some really horrible things were said, I recorded everything for safety. Luckily no one was badly hurt. \n\nFast forward about 7 months, still haven't seen my brother and I haven't seen my nephew either. I'll call the baby J JR. I ended up moving north to be with my SO, so I left the family behind. I was done with the drama. Then about a year later, I get a call from my mum. She's hysteric, sobbing, can't even speak. I immediately know that something bad has happened. She tells me that J had died on the streets alone because he had OD'd. He was homeless again and turned to drugs. He barely got to know his own son. \n\n\nI remember watching the footage from that Christmas eve, over and over again, knowing that was my last interaction with him. Screaming, death threats, the latter. \nI feel guilt for not reaching out after that night, not being the support I used to be. But I also don't because of the stuff he put me through. It's tough. \n\nNext thing I know, R has full custody over J. JR and is calling my mum, threatening to kill the baby if she didn't come and get him. \n\nMy mum picked up the baby and basically raised him for his first year, going to court over and over, trying to save her grandson from this psyco. R threatened to firebomb my mums house, so she wanted to move for safety. My other brother and his wife then took custody of J JR. My mum followed me up north and frequently visits down south to see J JR. \n\nNow I'm worried, because it seems my brother wife doesn't want my mum to see him. She makes every excuse possible. My mum spend hundreds of pounds a couple months back to visit, and she only got 10 minutes with her grandson, the only remaining part of her dead son, is his son. It's so sad, and I can't help but be angry at my other siblings for not defending our mum. She's being excluded for moving for her own safety. \n\nThe funeral, R decided to come up to me sobbing (yes, she was allowed at the funeral) \nShe tried to put her hands on my face, saying my name and asking if I was okay. I looked completely through her and shoved past, not even batting an eye. She made the entire funeral about her. \n\nShe then tried to steal my brothers ashes so my mum couldn't scatter them. \n\n\nIt sounds dumb, but I can't help but feel guilt over it.  Over not reaching out to my brother after things went south, for being angry at my family for excluding my mum. Although, being angry at R, for literally ruining my brothers life is justified, I just don't know if my thoughts on others involved are justified.\n\n\nSorry for the novel, but I feel like the ass. I feel like I won't stop grieving until I know it wasn't my fault our last interaction was so toxic and violent. \n\nSorry \n\n",

      "description": "Actively looking for input here, this is such a grey area.\n\nMy mate (call him K) and his girl, (call her E) broke up a few months ago. Fairly serious, they were together for a couple years but not living together or anything.  Things were bad at the end, and of course I stayed neutral and supported K bc he’s my bro but in the end I honestly sided with E because she’s also one of my good friends and he got way over-the-top nasty with her.  \n\nI’d be lying if I said that I haven't been crushing on E for awhile, she’s gorgeous, I really admire her as a person and we get along great. She’s not seeing anyone right now, is happily doing her own thing and has responded positively to mild flirtation from me. K is still acting petty and rude towards her whenever we’re all hanging out in the same group, but he’s also actively hooking up with other girls rn (he always tells me about his exploits aha), so... I think he’s getting over it?\n\nWIBTA if I tried to start something with E in the near future (Assuming she’s interested, of course)? On one hand, the “bro code”, but on the other, she’s not a piece of property and he doesn’t own her.  Should I ask his “permission” first? What do you think, reddit?",

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I have been dating for a long time, close to 3 years now. For context, we both go to the same university and actually live in the same complex. I've had an extremely busy week, and she has been sick for the entire day of the incident.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started my day with the usual how are yous, turns out that she might've gotten food poisoning from her food the night earlier. No throwing up, but still general nausea and she decides to stay home from all of her classes that day. I don't have that option, and today is a busy day. I go about my day checking in, asking how she is, texting normally just like every other day. I have a long interview that is about an hour away by bus, so by the time I get back in her area I'm tired and overworked. She texts me asking for ice cream from a store nearby. It'd be a 30 minute detour for me but a 4 minute walk for her, but I agree and buy it for her. At her place, I give it to her and we hang out for about 30 minutes, but then I say that I've gotta go do my work that was due later that night. She says it's ok, I say bye, and I work for a few hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround an hour or two into me working, she asks if I can come by and sit around with her. I tell her that I'm sorry, but I have multiple things due tonight. She then says \"its fine whatever\" and later comes back with \"you don’t seem to understand that i wanted you to take care of me or check in on me.\" \n\nWe talk and she says that if I were sick, she'd have asked if I needed anything. \"i just don’t know why i have to ask you for stuff like everyone appreciates when people are thoughtful and do things without being asked that’s what like love and romance is.\" It started to feel like she was A) disregarding my legitimate excuses for being gone all day and B) ignoring my attempts to help her as much as I could, a la texting, asking her how she was, buying her ice cream when asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being delusional? Should I have been more spontaneous when I knew she was sick? Maybe instead of asking how she was I could've just asked her what she wanted or something, I dunno.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: GF asks for me to get ice cream for her, I get it, later she remarks that I do not do enough spontaneous things for her",

I literally say like 5 words the whole time and she just talks and talks. It's ok, I know she needs to get things off her chest, but I can't the thought of having those constant phone calls every day just becomes exhausting. My free time is limited as well, and like I know she doesn't really have any one else to talk to but to lose like 20 minutes at least sometimes more to her every day calling me to complain about something that happened at work, it's exhausting and frustrating. I don't say anything, because I know she needs it for her mental health, and because I genuinely love her, and I don't not enjoy talking to her, but every day, for 20 minutes at least a day, I'm getting constant negative energy because she needs to unload all the negativity she has accrued from work onto me, and it cuts into my already limited free time. I hang out with her a lot, I go to school, I have a job. My job is a lot more low stress than hers, and I don't really have anything to complain about. She also has a terrible family, and for some reasons I don't want to get into right now can't afford to move out, so when she calls me and it's not about work it's about her shitty family. Again, I get it, she needs someone to talk to, I'm the only person she trusts, her family really sucks it's not petty dumb things she's complaining about, but holy shit, it's exhausting. It saps all the energy I have out of me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's not to say it's a bad relationship, it's not, she's a funny, loving person when I'm with her, she can be funny on the phone sometimes, I genuinely enjoy hanging out with her, it's just the constant negative energy I get from her every single day she has work, or when something shitty happens at home, which is frequent, it's exhausting. I know it comes with the territory, and I know she feels bad for constantly complaining to me about things, she's self aware, she's not dumb. She just needs the emotional release. I get it. It's just tiring. I don't know if I should talk to her about it, because I know she would feel really bad she was making me feel that way, and I would also feel bad because I'm not the one with the problems. But it makes me so tired every time she does, I literally will put the phone down sometimes and be angry, or just put the phone down sometimes and let her vent without actually listening to her, because that's how much I'm participating in the conversation.

The car is electric and cost to power it is very cheap.\n\n\nNow here’s the issue:\n\nThis past semester I’ve failed a course and I’m at risk of losing my internship that I’ve worked hard to obtain. I’m broken every time I see my grades. He says the only way for me to understand what I did is to pay back the credits I failed. I fully understand how I possibly fucked up my immediate future but I haven’t been able to afford anything since he wants to me to try to be partially finically independent. The past summer job was only able to cover the last 6 months and I’m still on the hook for the next 6 and the 6 after IF i start my internship. \n\nI also feel He’s been unfair as of lately. I pay for all my leisure expenses from video games to dinners with my gf. Since I haven’t been working I’m almost out of funds yet my younger brother for the most part gets everything he asks for no questions asked. This holidays I wasn’t able to afford a christmas gift for my gf and felt ashamed to bring it up to her. I had to cover my expenses out of my account for the secret santa my family forced me into while my brother had his fully paid for by my father. I feel the extra burden of paying the credits is alot specially if I am to have no job while studying and may not even have a well paying job this coming summer.\n\nI understand my dad wants to teach me a lesson, but is it really the right way? I’m young but I feel this is a lot to handle.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for not wanting to pay the credits?",

      "title": "AITA for saying yes when my bestfriend asked me to cheat on her boyfriend with her?",
      "description": "So the other night or so an unsuspecting me was contacted by my bestfriend, let's say Taylor, telling me about how she was experiencing relationship troubles. Nothing out of the normal I would be happy to help her out and be there for her, then she started sounding desperate for someone to be there for her asking \"please answer I just need someone to talk to right now\". I was pretty worried that she was sad as she had just gotten out of a little bout with depression (and self harm) so I really wanted to make sure she was ok, thinking she was in a really bad state over something he had done. I did the bestfriend thing and asked her what was up and are you ok trying to reassure her, which she then goes onto to say she needs to do something to rebel against her boyfriend and wanted my help because he can be a really controlling person. I agreed to do something and my mind was on the innocent shit like we could just hang out go on a mini bestfriend date to make her happy. She then starts to get a bit more seductive about what she wants to do in order to rebel. I play innocent tryna come up with more chill cute things we could do, nothing truly boundary pushing. It gets way more seductive from her at this point and I'm kinda see where she is going with it when she says she is up to do anything and would like to see me tomorrow, stuff along the lines of there won't be any regrets. I start kind of flirting back taking this as bit of a joke until she says wants me to come over tomorrow before he gets back from work, I played along with that letting puberty hormones get the better of me but still thinking we are only gonna get drunk or fuck around with his shit idk. Then she says if I come over tomorrow we are going to fuck, plain and simple I was pretty shook like the fuck. Then she starts asking if I liked her in that way coz she thought I was still crushing on her and if so tomorrow could be so much fun. I caught on that it might be her boyfriend trying to get some sort of confession out of me coz he asked me that the other day. So I said as much. She sent me a selfie to prove it was her, then a video to really get me to believe. Then the photo got a bit more risky when she sent a photo of her in a bra kind of pulling it down a bit. She asked for one back so I sent a shirtless pic. Ahh and then she sends me a photo of her boyfriends face then a bunch of other shit, like her and her bf in bed laughing together. I realised what had happened here and was caught out I guess. They didn't seem mad or whatever so I made a joke about it then said goodnight. Woke up to an apology from her and a message from him calling me disgusting a perv just some fuccboi that wanted to fuck his girl as soon as she wanted it.\n\nNow I know saying yes to wanting to have sex with my bestfriend was fucked up and as a man I can admit that but some history into why I would have gone through with it\n\ntaylor : I was in love with her for a solid 3 years, like real hard. Went through a shit time coz of it battling anxiety and depression till I got over her. Now the entire time I wanted her she said there was attraction from her too making it worse, but it was pretty bad for her as well. So I still have some feelings and basically can't say no to her. She has stopped being friends with me 3 times, once because I tried to get with her when she was single after saying she wanted to take my v card from me. So she knew I would definitely have sex with her if she ever asked. During our conversation mentioned in the main part she had pretty much said she wanted to cheat which Idk in my mind is just about identical to actually going through with it so there wasn't much point to me saying no to save the morality of the situation. She was also the one trying to initiate the whole sexual thing. Once she wants to do something like I guess cheat on her boyfriend nothing I say or do will convince her to anything other then go ask someone else to do it really. There are plenty of examples of her just looking for a yes man. \n\n\nThe boyfriend: im guessing his it was his whole idea and was behind most of the texting and then the threatening afterwards. He has always pissed me off coz of his behaviour and personality, controlling of his girlfriend and always emotionally manipulating her to do what he wants and sexually assaulting Taylor once upon a time, so this may have factored into my whole agreement to actually say yes to her. \n\nNow my bestfriend has pretty much stopped talking to me and cancelled plans and shit, and the boyfriend has said he has gone around and told my friends and his that I am a disgusting perv and shit telling them I wanted to fuck his girl. \n\nId have to tend to agree with his judgment but he seems to have forgotten: I wasn't the one to initiate anything, she had already said she had wanted to cheat when they were trying to catch me out, if this whole thing was a real life situation would I really have been the most fucked up person and not the cheater, he knew I was once in love with her and would do anything she pretty much asked anyway\n\nI'm sorry this is long and probably contains biased and irrelevant information and self justification, but AITA?",

      "description": "I don’t think of myself as a helicopter mom. I do focus, sometimes to a fault, on my kid’s psychological health. I remember my first funeral. It was traumatic and has stayed with me. My grandmother told my youngest son this year that he will die, and he had a legit breakdown. I handled the situation well, until he said \"if I did, please don’t let them close my eyes.\", while sobbing.\n\nI was close with my great aunt and love her dearly. She passed away today after a long fight.\n\nAm I being selfish for getting a babysitter for the boys while my husband and I attend her funeral? I already know some of my family members will be very angry with this decision. I know this because they actually have already been to a funeral (when they were babies, too young to remember) due to them guilting me into it by saying they \"needed them there to get through it\".\n\nI’m sorry for the rambling. Your advice will not fall on deaf ears, as I am really conflicted here. My husband is 100% on board with them not attending.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my roommate I can no longer be on a lease with him?",
      "description": "I moved in with a friend of five years this time last year. I should note that, at the time we moved in together, he had been crashing on my couch rent-free for four months without even offering to help with bills or groceries. Being stupid, I thought that rather than kicking him out, I would help him out by paying the majority of rent so that he could afford his own room. I realize now that this was a mistake. He was depressed after a break-up and I wanted to help him back on his feet. \n\nIn the year that we've lived together, he has paid rent at least a week late 9 of 12 months. 6 of the last 6 months have been paid late, and the last two months were paid over three weeks late. Also, he owes me money from past bills I paid for him (he didn't pay any utilities or internet for the first six months because he kept \"forgetting\" to budget for it). \n\nI should point out that I have repeatedly offered to make up the difference if he lets me know ahead of time, so that it doesn't hit our credit. Time and time again I have asked him to communicate with me about his finances so that I can arrange to make rent on time (I'm a freelancer, so the hustle is constant and I have an amazing regular client that I can make money with quickly), and each time he has refused and said it's none of my business. I disagree. We are on a lease together, so I feel his inability to pay his part of rent on time is my business. \n\nI should also note that each time his part of rent is late (all nine times), I have found out about the unpaid balance through an eviction notice posted on my door. This is immensely stressful for me and I have told him as much, repeatedly. He insists that it isn't a big deal and I'm overreacting. \n\nNow, back to the situation itself. He's paid the past six months late, and has lied before when asked about payment status point blank. This month, I got yet another eviction notice and calmly asked him what was going on. He was full of excuses and told me not to worry because he would have it on his next check. Then, I asked on the day he got paid and he told me it was paid in full. \n\nAt this point, I called the office to talk to someone about transferring alone to a one bedroom unit in the complex. The manager informed me that there was an outstanding balance of $230 (so not paid in full after all) and I could not transfer with an unpaid balance. I moved some money around, paid the balance, and set up an appointment to view one bedrooms and pay my deposit later this week. \n\nI then texted my roommate (the only way I'm able to contact him anymore. We used to be close, but he's been avoiding me more and more over the past several months) and told him the truth: that I couldn't be his roommate anymore and when the lease is up at the end of the month, I will be moving out and he will need to adjust accordingly. I am in the process of saving and boosting my rental history to move with my partner across the country, and the past year has already set me back several months on that timeline. I feel like I'll be stuck here forever if I'm always paying his bills, and I said that (though more kindly and in a way that didn't sound so blamey). He responded \"cool\" and hasn't said a word to me since. \n\nMy roommate works with my partner (she got him a job with her company after he got fired from his last one), and he will talk to her at work but not at the apartment. He has elected to take the bus to work (takes longer and spends money he should not be spending) instead of riding with us in the mornings and ignores us completely, to the point of hiding in his room and being as silent as possible rather than acknowledge my partner offering him a ride. \n\nHe has also gotten a (former, I guess) friend of mine to side with him and she is no longer speaking to me because of whatever he said. The part that upsets me most about that is she knows how many times he's fucked me up financially and still believes him over me. It makes me wonder what his version of events is. \n\nMy partner and I are really hurt (we were both close with him before) and don't understand why he's reacting like this. He's being really petty and retaliatory, like he believes something was done to him. I feel like I made a concerted effort to help him, communicate with him, and provide assistance when I could. Also, I'm positive we would have been evicted by now had I not paid my rent on time every single month. I'm not proud of telling him over text, but he never answers his phone and I've physically seen him for about 30 minutes over the past month. He hasn't exactly made himself available to talk to. \n\nSo, AITA for saying I've had enough and refusing to renew the lease with him? ",

She loves company, loves the friends no matter what and asks for people to come to them for help. (I don’t have a problem with the help situation, I try to help others as well). \n\nWell, to start off, her friends don’t make any responsible choices such as excessive underage drinking at every available opportunity, housing drug addicts and dating just as irresponsible guys. \n\nFor the guy friends she has, they bang anything that walks, smoke an drink and don’t care of anything they own, they look her up an down whether I’m there or not and I find them a threat and she uses the excuse “I’ve known him since I was a little girl!” Meanwhile, I’ll drop any body for her because in my eyes, a relationship I value is more important. I’m an asshole on that part, yes, but I see it as organizing my priorities. I tell her that she needs to get her life together and focus on herself instead of being so into everyone else’s life when they only come around when they’re in the slumps or wanting to drink and she just doesn’t understand what I mean. \n\nThere’s more, finer details to this story and issue but that’s sums up the majority.

      "description": "Backstory: I’ve only been in one other relationship and that one lasted a year and was fantastic. I thought that she would be the one, but then I was forced to move and we had to break up because long distance wasn’t working. Fast forward to today, I’m in a new relationship with a nice girl, but we’ve been dating for about two weeks, and it feels like she’s done so much for me when I physically can’t do the same for her. I’m working constantly, and I don’t get any free time. She tries to be nice so much that it becomes overbearing. Using nicknames so much that it feels like she’s replaced my name with them. And generally being both standoffish and too forward. The thing that prompted me to ask this here is she asked if I was free Saturday, and I freed up some time and said yes, to which she replied “My grandparents are going to love this!”. She never once mentioned I’d be meeting her grandparents after knowing her for only a few weeks. I promptly said I really wasn’t comfortable with that and that things have been moving really quickly and felt uncomfortable. I feel like I was being rude though, I just want her to be happy... just doesn’t feel like a good fit to me.",

      "description": " I tried posting this before but it was way too long so this is the super condensed version.\n\nI stopped talking to my mother exactly a year ago because her relationship is toxic to her and everyone around her. Since entering this relationship she's neglected my two siblings (currently aged 13 and 14) to pursue her own \"happiness.\" She's also a hypocrite (\"my kids come first\"/\"no one else will ever discipline my kids\"). Her boyfriend is an alcoholic with neurological damage as a result of being assaulted prior to meeting my mother.\n\nMy grandparents and I have continually tried to help her leave him and get out of her situation but she continually refused, despite the drunken arguments, occasional physical violence and police involvement, after which she has regularly called crying saying she's going to leave him.\n\nI stopped talking to her last year after one such incident, my sister called me after midnight on a school night, my mother called me back and asked why I had to get involved and I lost it, letting her know how mad I was about everything, and she hung up on me.\n\nSince that event, she's tried reaching out to me a handful of times, one attempt was six months after she hung up on me in a message with the apology of \"I'm sorry for brainwashing you into believing that all men are bastards.\" This made me incredibly angry because it's NOT the issue, and even if it were she didn't make me hate men. She made me hate women, LGBT people, people of colour. I won't get too deep into it but as a queer person, that's something I can't forgive even aside from my actual issue.\n\nI've now resolved to not speak to her until she realises she's the one in the wrong and apologises, something that I doubt will ever happen because she hates being wrong and doesn't apologise. My grandmother and sister have repeatedly asked me to talk to her again but I refuse.",

      "description": "So here's the story. I was waiting in line at CVS to pick up a prescription. I was pretty much the only white person in the line, and mostly everyone else was black. I am a white guy in my 20's. Obviously this does not matter in itself, but you'll soon see why this is relevant.\n\nIt was a bit busy at the pharmacy, and I had been waiting in line for a while. Directly behind me in line was a black lady, maybe around 60 years old, playing soul music at a pretty high volume on her cell phone. It was pretty annoying to me, but I didn't say anything for a while because I didn't want to be seen as  \"the white guy\" who tell the black lady to turn off her soul music. My brain just made the association of telling the black lady to go to the back of the bus, like I am denying her of something that is culturally significant to her. \n\nNonetheless, she could tell that I was obviously agitated by it, as I kept turning around and looking at her. At this point she was kind of dancing around in place and looking to another black lady behind her in line for validation, and she got a \"you go sister\" kind of response, thus further cementing my fear that I would be seen as the white uptight asshole for making her turn it off.\n\nNonetheless, I could not handle this kind of disrespect. I asked her to turn it down, and she didn't really give me much of a response. She seemed to hit a few buttons but there was no noticeable difference in the volume. So I turned around again and said, \"you know what, can you please turn it off altogether? You're not really supposed to do that in a public place.\"\n\nShe gave me some attitude but turned it off. I felt like I was getting glared at by everyone afterwards.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Info: my husband and I are currently having some issues with his parents (HP). This only involves us and our child, so we have been trying to be adults and keep it to ourselves.\n\n\nHP, however, have made it known to his younger brother (YB) that we are ignoring them, refusing to go to family dinners, ect. Which we are, but they didn't tell him why we are doing those things. YB confronted my husband and he did confirm that we were having issues, but said that those issues did not involve him. They have always had a great relationship and considered each other best friends. After a bit of back and forth, YB agreed to stay out of it since it didn't involve him.\n\n\nFor months their relationship went back to how it was before.\n\n\nOne day (months later) my husband asked YB if he was coming to our daughter's first birthday (we hadn't had an RSVP from him yet). He told my husband no, that it \"wasn't worth the haul\", and wasn't a big deal. \n\n\nGranted, the party was going to be around 45 to 60 minutes away for him (we had it closer to my side of the family because my grandpa is terminal and is unable to travel far. We didn't want him to miss what was probably the only birthday he will be able to make it to for my daughter).\n\n\nWhen my husband told me, we were both upset. Me being friendly with YB's wife, sent her a text message apologizing for the drive, but explaining the situation with my grandpa. I was told that they were busy being newly married, who just bought a house and didn't only want to see family for \"special occasions\" and that it would be easier for that bond to be there if we didn't just stop going to family dinners (referring to the issues with his parents). I reminded her that I had frequently invited her and YB to our house for dinner (for over 6 years I played host, even before my husband and i were married or had any issues with the family) and that they turned down the invitations more often than not. Told her I didn't want to fight, just that we were upset, but told her to take care.\n\n\nThe day of our daughters party, YB texted my husband all day about how he was \"just chilling in his basement\". Obviously not busy. Never said happy birthday. Never sent a card. Never any acknowledgement.\n\nI was upset by this and unfriended YB's wife on Facebook (YB doesn't have a FB).\n\n\nEver since then, YB has told my husband that I was hateful and it was stupid for us to be upset about something so small as a birthday. YB's wife made a post on FB about how selfish my husband and I were (without mentioning our names) because we expect people to just show up for us on a day when they may be busy, rather than rescheduling. \n\n\nI feel like they purposely skipped it to \"get back at us\" for either not telling them the details of the issues we had with his parents OR just the fact that we are \"upsetting\" his parents.\n\nI know my daughter won't remember but it felt like a big day for us. So AITA for being upset that they didn't go or even acknowledge it?",

      "description": "About a month ago, my best friend and my ex's (siblings) mother had committed suicide. We weren't broken up for very long when it happened. He was feeling guilty and responsible\n\nOne of the ways I tried to comfort him, was a kiss. But, he thought it meant we were back together. The whole thing was so fucked, but I had to tell him what was up.\n\nWhen I told him that the kiss didn't mean we were back together, and I was trying to comfort him. He got mad. Not for not being together, but for kissing him in the first place at a time like that. He yelled, a lot. He's hated me ever since for fucking with his head like that and he was mad I didn't tell him right away. I didn't mean to. I try to tell myself that he doesn't really hate me, and that he's just grieving, but I don't know anymore. It hurts, because I still have a lot of love for him. **I did want to get back together at some point, but that was NOT the right time for either of us.**\n\nAfter that, I still went over to his place a lot, for his sister. She's my best friend and she went through something seriously traumatic. I wanted to be there for her as much as I could, and my place isn't an option.\n\nMost people would think it's wrong to go to their exes house after a break-up, but she needed me. She hated being alone. She would have nightmares, so I would sleepover whenever I could. She only has brothers, who she doesn't feel can really comfort her. She didn't return to school for the next semester, but I come over after class and everything.\n\nThe last time I tried to come over, my ex's older brother basically kicked me. He said that it's nothing personal, but it's best if I didn't come over for a while. It was really implied that it was because of my ex. I was shocked, but I understood. When I was going to leave, my best friend asked why I was leaving. I explained it to her and she got super fucking angry.\n\nShe stared telling her older brother about how it's her house too, and that she can have whoever she wants over. At this point she's yelling and her two OTHER brothers come down to calm shit. She said that it's not her problem if \"ex\" gets in his feelings every-time I come over. Then he started calling her a selfish bitch, and some other shit I can't remember. She told him to \"be a man\" and get over me. It was awful. I've gotten into really bad fights with my sisters, but they never involve or in front of others too.\n\nI just pulled her aside and told her to get some air. On our drive, she told me that they've been fighting about this a lot. I had no idea. But she told me that she invites me less often, but she's not gonna stop, that'd be unfair.\n\nI'm literally so torn right now and I have no clue what to do. My house isn't an option because it's a lot of people, in a small apartment. She was fine going over before, but ever since her trauma, she gets overwhelmed. I hate that I'm causing any more heartbreak and drama in their family. I just want to do what's best for everybody.\n\nSO AITA?\n\n**TLDR:** My ex and his sister are fighting about me being over so often. She really needs me to comfort her after some serious trauma, and my house isn't an options. She gets nightmares, so I sleepover when I can.\n\nEdit: I know nobody asked, but their mom is doing a lot better. She's not home yet, but they all talk to her.",

      "description": "Yes, I know how stupid that seems. It's a long story.\n\nTL;DR: Abusive mom threatens suicide, I try and get her to not do that, she doubles down on the threat, and it winds up looking even worse. I can't summarize, I'm sorry.\n\nI live in a house I'm becoming increasingly certain is abusive, under my mom. We were fighting again, and she stormed out of the house. As she was leaving, she yelled out that she hopes she dies while she's driving, and I think the worst part there is that I'm used to that. I had to get the garage door for her as she left, since the remote doesn't work. I don't know what prompted me to try it this time as opposed to all the others, but I refused to open the door unless she said she would drive safely. My thought process is hard to explain, but I'm still not sure why I thought it would work. Anyway, there was a brief back and forth of \"open it\" and \"no\". Then, she turns on the car in the garage. When I still don't open it, *then* she gets out and opens it herself, and only at that point did I realize that me not opening it after her turning on the car could technically look like an attempt on her life. Particularly considering there werr some similar incidents between her and an abusive ex. Anyway, she left, and that was about half an hour ago. Did I fuck up in not opening the door there? \n\nI know this looks like a bait or troll post, but I swear this is real. I have enough self-awareness to notice how ridiculous I'm being, but that does nothing to actually counteract the ridiculousness. I mean, unless my judgement is off and I actually am in the wrong here, in which case please tell me. Thank you. I'm sorry.",

      "description": "So backstory: I am F25 with a F26 wife. We have one daughter F1 conceived via sperm donor, and I have full custody of my sister, F11, and am working on full custody of my other sister, F14.\n\nI was picking up F11 with my wife and youngest, and she had a friend’s mom who wanted to meet me. Apparently, this mom wanted to meet her child’s friend’s parents before having them over, which to me is totally fine. So, I go over to introduce myself, and she immediately frowns.\n\n“You’re F11’s mother? How old are you?” she asked. I noticed F11 frown; she’s been having a really hard time with the whole no real mom thing (our mother died of an OD and her father is in prison) and even though my wife and I try to be there for her, I know that sometimes there’s no substitute for the real thing. “Are you a teen mother? It seems everyone these days is loose.”\n\n“I’m not her mother. I’m her sister, nice to meet you.” I said.\n\n“And why’s that? Are you sure? Were you raped?” She fired off, and I. Saw. Red. As I type this, I’m still pissed.\n\n“I don’t know why I even bothered introducing myself, it’s clear you’re nothing but a stuck up bitch?”\n\nAnd then my wife came over with my daughter, and I found my sis (she ran off to play with her poor friend), so I told her the mother or her friend was being rude, and that it was fine if they hung out at our house, but unfortunately the mother was being rude about our situation.\n\nSo, am I the asshole? Wife says I wasn’t but as I grew up in an abusive environment I feel as if it’s my fault. Also  I’m sorry if the details were blurry, I wrote this while feeding F1 and she kept batting for the phone and Km sleep deprived.",

Other members of her family are like this as well, some more violently vocal than others. \n\nWell, for our wedding we have decided that everyone we invite can bring a plus one (subject to our approval of course). \n\nI thought about it for a really long time about my older brother and his husband (they've been married 3 years) and I don't want his husband to attend with him. \n\nThe drama if they attend together has the potential to get out of hand and that is something I don't want to have to deal with on my wedding day. My fiancé also agrees with me on this. \n\nWe can't not invite her parents and we can't not invite my brother so we felt our only option was to not invite his husband.\n\nWho knows what could be said or done if he attends and yeah, we're being selfish but it's our wedding. \n\nI'm really not sure how he'll react though. It took my brother a long time to accept himself and  I'm sure this won't feel good but at the same time maybe his husband won't want to attend anyways.\n\nI have nothing against my brother's husband. He is a lovely man but we are just trying to have the day go smoothly. \n\nWhen we extend the invitations out I think I'm going to go to my brother in person and ask him not to bring his husband for all the reasons above.\n\nSo WIBTA if I asked him not to bring his husband?",

      "description": "I’m a first year in college, and I used to be a coleader of a club in my high school. Every winter, I offered to host a party for the club members, and it became a sort of tradition. I thought my responsibilities ended once I graduated, but some of my senior friends currently in the club hit me up and asked to use my house again to host.\n\nI don’t have anything against them, I love my junior club members and I made sure they didn’t mean to make me provide food or anything. But the way they proposed just rubbed me the wrong way. (Some of my other friends in college (jokingly?) volunteered my house without my knowledge, so I’m kind of irked at them as well.) Like, none of the current leaders volunteered to host, so instead of pressuring each other they just expected me to be able to host the party. I don’t think they really understand how exhausting it is, especially for me/my parents to deal with cleaning up afterwards.\n\nI thought I was done with having to host stuff; I don’t want this to be a precedent for the club in the future. I’m a huge pushover so I agreed to host if absolutely nobody else could host it, but I still feel kind of resentful, and I’d feel guilty if I straight up cancelled. Am I the asshole? :/",

      "description": "This is going to be a bit of a long one so warning in advance. Essentially my sister sucks. She's selfish and manipulative and the more she drinks the more selfish she is.\n\nI have a long history of her being an asshole to me especially around drinking and I do NOT want to spend New year's with her. Originally my husband and I were planning to have a nice calm New year's. Maybe go out for a drink or two and then just hang out at the house, but then she whined to our parents that she's sad and lonely and has no one to be with on New year's. When they asked me if she could come to our place I knew that I had to tell them yes because otherwise it causes all sorts of family drama and fighting (despite the fact that I've told them multiple times that I don't like being around her especially when she drinks). \n\nThe main reason that I don't like to be around her when drinking is she is very irresponsible. She likes to go home with groups of guys to hang out with or will leave the bar with them to walk around the city even though I've told her a million times that it's dangerous to do this when we've never met these people before. Her solution is always to drag me along with her and she guilts me into it by telling me that she will just go herself if I don't go with her (which is very dangerous).  She does stuff like this all the time, and her excuse is that it's okay because she's sad and needs to party (long story short she's sad because she dropped put of high school to marry a guy we all told her was bad for her, then she got pregnant and was surprised when he left her for another girl despite him cheating on her before). \n\nI feel like that excuse doesn't make up for her being such an asshole and I don't know why she has such an issue spending New year's with her daughter instead of making our lives miserable, but now I'm stuck with her. \n\nI feel like I'd be able to tolerate her if she was less selfish but she only cares about herself. There was an incident about a year ago that really hilighted how little she cares about me and ever since I find it hard to be around her. Basically I had an issue with a boy not taking no for an answer and she made excuses for him and then slept with him herself a month or two later.... \n\n I know she's going to do stuff like this again and I'm tired of being dragged in to her assholery. Am I an asshole too if I decide to leave and 12:30 to go home and go to bed? I know that she will refuse to leave as usual and will try to guilt me into staying with her but I'm sick of it. Since my husband will be with me we will be fine but after we leave she would be by herself. Do I have to stay with her and babysit her until she finally decides to leave (aka when the bars close) or can I leave her there herself? She's an adult and I feel like after years of looking out for her if she's going to be knowingly unsafe it's not really my problem at this point. So WIBTA?",

For the longest time, the wife and I didn't really give it much attention. Growing up, I played the same way, and the worst I came out with were a couple of fingers dislocating and a sprained knee. Some friends had it worse, but I guess I never considered my son's health until recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that he and his friends play tackle football without any pads or proper equipment every weekend. I got a call this past weekend from my son asking about an emergency. Some of them wear cleats (spiked shoes for better traction), and somehow, one of his friends got stepped on face first by the cleats and was bleeding like no other. He ended up going to the ER and getting stitches, but it certainly made me realize that playing tackle football without any protection can lead to far worse things. I know there's been a lot of discussion about concussions and I feel like that is only more expected if you're not wearing helmets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, I told my son he can't play tackle football anymore. I'm fine if he and his friends want to play flag football, but my son started giving a huge fit. Got into an argument, told me he hates me, says how its unfair because I used to play without pads back in the day,how his friends are still planning to play next week,  etc. My son has been radio silent with me and only talking with my wife. My wife is on my side, but she's playing the good cop in this situation so that he is communicating with one of us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I offered a good alternative to play flag football. It's actually something I still play with some co-workers and it's great. But I just want to know if I made a mistake?",

      "description": "Just some background stuff. I always leave my home unlocked because I live in a small town and I’m stupid. About a week ago when I was a hour away from home, he says “I’m very sorry but, I borrowed $80 for an emergency”,  I said ok but you are paying me back.   1 week later I wanted my money back and text him “do you have my money”? He’s says he will tomorrow because he gets paid. 1 day later.  He posted on his instagram with showing he bought fallout 76 and rdr2. I texted him saying “ hey you have my money” he says he only had enough for bills, but I’m to pussy to call him out. 1 week later I need to pick up my check but only have 15 miles in my car left, I text him saying I need at least $5 he says he’s broke and at work I say ok. He has 2 cars he rotates and 1 was at his home. I drive to his house (we live close) with a syphone and take all most all the gas that was in his car. Then I pick up my check and text him “ I’m sorry but I took the gas out of your pt so no more worry’s about my money”. He texted my saying I need to pay him back immediately( I ignored him) and asking for money in a group chat because I stole from him ( I never wrote anything).\n\n\nAITA for not finding a better way to deal with it? \n\n\nThis probably is unreadable but I’m on mobile ",

      "description": "I tried being nice and helping him though some shit but honestly he treated me like shit so I was done. But he invited me over and just played video games all night and didn’t let me play and ignored my advances on him, he cried saying his ex didn’t tell him happy birthday yet totally ignored my message, he insulted my friend in front of all his friends, he would get blackout drunk a few times a month, he would regularly ignore my messages, I was the last one to be invited to his New Years party, he would point out how oily I was and how much dandruff I have (I have complained to him about these issues I had), he wouldn’t wanna cuddle, and he always complained that I never showed him my true feelings yet he literally didn’t show me emotions. I guess I freaked him out when I tried to get too close so I detached. I didn’t invite him to go to places with me, he didn’t meet my family, he didn’t meet my friends really, I never said I love you and I never intentionally left shit at his place. I tried really hard to not come on strong once he told me I went too fast too quick... i invited him on my vacation because I had planned it already and was going alone and I sent him nudes on the trip and he just said “your booty white” and ignored the message, and then later on I came home at like five am and he fucked me and went to sleep and didn’t even say thanks for my present, ever. I hid my feelings from him in fear of being hurt and hoping I could cope with them. \n\nI texted him why I was mad (the reasons listed above)\n\nHe said: But one that I remember early on is you getting upset with me while you were in Hawaii for not really taking it that serious when you asked if I wanted to come join you (I literally asked if he wanted to go.... he said he couldn’t affford it and I said ok, i just thought it would be a fun thing but I understand... no pressure cause I know this is new, I’m just going alone so thought I’d ask). I made a joke about your tan line like the girl from the suntan bottle because I did not think I was insulting you but kinda being cute everyone has a tanline on their butt (I literally sent him a nude and he said “lol”) and you took great offense yo that and then when oh got back it was like super early and I did not think not freaking out you were back would be that big of a deal because we were going to hang out normal people times soon (he hardly talked to me, fucked me, went to sleep- I was gone for two weeks prior). I said I wanted you to tell me if I was doing things like that because I felt at that point I did not know what I was doing sometimes but maybe you were just more sensitive than I realized.\n\nThen blackout drunk thing was bad (but more for me I just shouldnt be doing that stuff) but as you know people on drugs are not themselves and are very unaware of what they were doing then you played it cool at the time only to leave in the morning and the plan was to just necer talk to me or see me again ignore my calls (I answered his calls... ) and texts forcing me to go and try to get an explanation that could have been a little sign I cared ya know if you just ghosted me and I didn’t give a shit why would I go to your place I would have just been like cool now I don’t have to deal with it \nI am not an alcoholic but I do have issues sometimes with taking my drinking too far and I guess my actions during those times are going to be put under a microscope the most instead of how I am sober. That is fine I was shitty to you those times I got drunk and I am sorry but as someone who said they have dealt with drug issues in the past maybe you could have talked to me about it and how the actual drinking was bothering you and how I acted during states of drunkenness were not okay and I would have listened not just ditch me and make me have to go to your place for you to finally tell me. \n\nSorry for being shitty I get the picture and I apologize. If you still just want to keep being mad and bring stuff up some more that is fine as well if it helps you out. And you can believe whatever you want to believe about me and my appreciation or feelings for you back then I know how I felt and that is fine again whatever helps you feel better. If you want to keep writing this stiff out I suggest doing it on a piece of paper or journal or something cuz me just responding and trying to make you not blame yourself is obviously riling you up and I am not responding anymore.\n\nSorry for everything you are a way better person than me so just take some comfort in the fact you don’t have to put up with my shit anymore.  Feel better, goodbye. \n\nSorry I got frustrated earlier. Telling you I am not responding was a reactionary decision and it does not mean I am mad at you or do not respect what you have to say I apologize. \n\nI still think it’s best for you to just forget about me, I am truly so sorry about us not working out and for doing things that made you upset. You don’t (and probably shouldn’t) respond but I did not want to have the last thing I say to you be while I was upset. You deserve better than that so I wanted to say Thank you for everything 🙏 ",

I suddenly hear loud music coming from the flat underneath me. It's loud enough for me to feel the bass and hear the melody from below. I stamp my foot a couple times (not the first time this issue has happened and usually I get good results i.e music turned down) to no avail. I give it 20 minutes but its enough to distract me from what I'm trying to concentrate on. \n\nI decided to play something relatively heavy and turn it up to 11 to drown her out at least and maybe get my point across. At this point my relationship with my neighbour is past a polite knock at the door and asking nicely. \n\nSo I turn the music on turn it to 11 and she turns hers up to 11 also. I decide this is the right time to go and get some milk so I creep out of my flat and leave the music blaring whilst I pop to the store. \n\nBy the time I got back my record had stopped and there was silence from below. \n\nIt worked but aita ?",

      "description": "Little background before jumping at the question.\n\nBefore her I never had a dog in my life, I adopted her at a shelter, she was 5 at the time, no idea of her race but she was abused, was here for a while, fully sprayed, quite tall and very cheap. I called her Mary and I always wished to travel with a best friend around the world (actually I was saving money for two humans, to go with my girlfriend at the time but we had to break up a few weeks before, so more money for a dog I guess.). And dogs are a girl best friend I heard. For 5 years I travelled with her and did all the continents (except Africa unfortunately) never alone. I always, *always* made sure she was alright, she was feeling good, she wasn't in pain. The only problem she ever had (aside from heavy anxiety the first months) was that she broke (?) her tail or something 3 years ago by waging it on a table. I took the boat with her, plane, car, van, bike, I did hiking, camping, everything, she saw a lot of places and was outside as much as she wanted. My sweetheart had an amazing life and I'm so so proud of her.\n\nNow here's the problem, she died a month ago of old age. My tall girl died at 10. I have a group of friends who had a lot of animals all their lifes and still have respectively dogs, cats and lizards. I already was accused of not being able to bond with her because I adopted her at 5. Then of not liking her because I didn't like to take dozens photos/videos of her (I'm a freelance artist so instead of just taking a picture of her, I preferred drawing her on the scenery we were at.) then, now that she's dead and I said to them that I couldn't wait to save more money to get another dog and do the whole traveling thing again, they're telling me that I never loved her and that getting over her death so fast was \"cheating\". To be honest I don't see how I could be sad, I did my best to make her happy, I made her forget all her bad days, made sure that she was always ok, that she could see the whole world, I absolutely have *no regrets* whatsoever. I gave everything I had to her. Now I just hope that she's in the Dog Heaven telling all the others dogs what she saw and where she traveled.\n\nAll my friends are constantly saying things like \"I had my cat for 15 years and when he passed out I cried for *weeks* because I loved him a lot, you obviously don't like your dog.\" \"I take a picture of my dog *every single day* so I can see her everywhere when I need it because I love my dog, you took pictures of where you were at, not your dog, you obviously didn't like her.\" I'm not a professional Photographer. Taking a picture takes me 1s and it's not that personal to me. A drawing however, is. \"I would *never recover* if I lost my Pitbull, and you're willing to get another dog already ??? You definitely didn't like her.\"\n\nIt's getting on my nerves a bit. But it's not only my friends who are saying this, literally anyone else have the same kind of talk when I talk to them about what we did together and how I wished to get another dog asap.\n\nSo, since my mother and I seem to be the only people ok with me not crying for years over losing a very good dog, am I the asshole for not being sad over her death ?",

She had recently began to date Richard a couple weeks prior to when we decided to go on a short, overnight holiday (With a few more friends of course). During the trip Ann basically blew off Richard to talk to, and be around, me (Which to be fair, was unusual). He began to get progressively more mad at me. He began doing spiteful things to me; treating me like shit basically. He told his side of the story to a mutual friend of ours and she told me to back off. Now, I had been interested in Ann in the past but that quickly faded as she expressed a disinterest. I took this as an opportunity to be closer with her which I deemed fair enough. Fast-forward 2 more weeks and, obviously, they broke up. Our mutual friend sided with me in the end but, the rest of our friend group didn't. I had been ostracised for no particular reason and Richard still treated me like shit. After he'd gone on a short rant spouting catty nonsense I made a remark to the effect of \"Stop being so jealous.\"\n*He Unpuckered his ass containing months of salt, spewing shit everywhere*\nThis was clearly the final straw. He quickly ripped me to shreds over minor things, claiming I was an egotistical cock-block of a human being. Things that he had never expressed in the past.\nYea, we no longer talk.

      "description": "This happened years ago but I thought I'd share. \n\nFriend = F\n\nF started messaging me about how her college is racist and she is failing because of it. We are both Metis and have light skin, so it was odd. People can be very racist toward Indigenous People here but neither of us were noticeably Indigenous.\n\nI asked for details and F said her prof had been asking her \"super hard\" questions during their classes and talked down to her. I asked F if she had reported the prof yet. F shrugged me off and said they \"wouldnt believe her\". \n\nAt first I was like, \"okay fair enough.\" But F was graded on only the midterms and finals which were all multiple choice.\n\nSo I said, \"You should definitely report it. If shes treating students like this she needs to go. How is it affecting your grades though if it gets marked by a computer? Maybe she's asking you the hard questions cause she thinks you are smart and know the answers?\"\n\nI asked mostly because I was hoping that there was some other explanation for it all.\n\nI guess questioning her had angered her. I wasn't trying to offend her and was just trying to make sense of it all. F replied that the professor was just \"really fucking rude.\" \n\nSo I kind of just shrugged to myself and messaged her back, \"Are you sure it's because of race though? Maybe she doesn't like you for a different reason?\" \n\nThis threw F into a rage. She ranted, \"you're white so you don't understand. Your family hasn't been through what mine has been through.\" and \"if you dont believe there is racism in the schooling system we can no longer be friends.\"\n\nI was thinking of explaining myself, but I decided to just go to bed. I know there is racism and wasn't denying it.\n\n(I will state that I dont tend to experience it myself because of my lightskin)\n\n I definitely didn't think it was relevant to bring up our families or my similar-to-her skin colour.\n\nI still feel that she was over reacting.\n\nBut AITA for questioning her accusations of racism?

      "title": "AITA for having a massive problem with fireworks in my neighborhood?",
      "description": "As background, I have dogs that are terrified of loud noises, and I have a sensory issue with loud sudden noises that causes significant discomfort.\n\n- Our neighborhood is on the outskirts of town. It is legal to discharge fireworks here.\n\n- Our neighborhood is under an HOA, which forbids fireworks.\n\n- Our neighbors throughout the neighborhood literally set off thousands of fireworks. We’re not talking the little stuff. We’re talking nice professional quality fireworks.\n\n- This is the suburbs, and there is very little space between houses. The fireworks were set off in driveways  and in the streets. Cleanup was attempted, but not thorough. I have several components of expended fireworks now littering my yard.\n\nThe drama here starts as so many do on Facebook. My wife made a post lamenting the fireworks in the neighborhood. We were told it’s normal around here and that we should have done our research and avoided the area if it was a problem. In our defense, we read through the HOA agreement, saw they were banned, and didn’t worry about it.\n\nMy concern is selfish. I hate having my animals scared shitless, I would like to sleep in a way that supports my odd schedule, and I have severe discomfort around loud noises due to a neurological issue. I feel like I should be able to remain relatively safe from things in my home, but the fireworks in the street in front of and behind my house made this impossible.\n\nIn addition, it pisses me off that we have several severely autistic kids in our large neighborhood, as well as a ton of veterans. A couple of whom definitely suffer PTSD, though I don’t know the specifics.\n\nThe Facebook comments became quite rude, telling us to “fucking leave if we don’t like it,” and to “quit being pussies and enjoy the holiday.” The death threats were obviously a joke, but not appreciated.\n\nAfter reading through pages of comments, I made the (what I believed to be obviously tongue-in-cheek) comment (pulling from memory here) “I am glad to see so many people are so welcoming of loud noises in the neighborhood. Since it’s not technically illegal, I’m sure they wouldn’t have a problem with me setting up a shooting target in my back yard or hunting the deer and pig around the edges of the neighborhood. Who has an empty grill? I’ll bring the meat!”\n\nI realized this could be taken wrong and deleted it less than a minute later. Someone then paraphrased it completely wrong saying I said I was going to start shooting in the neighborhood, and someone else asked them to send a report to the police. I actually wish I hadn’t deleted the comment now so that anyone interested could see exactly what was said instead of relying on the memory of someone that wants me out of the neighborhood.\n\nI absolutely shouldn’t have engaged, and I really wish my wife hadn’t started it on Facebook, but am I the asshole here? It seems the entire community page thinks we should be kicked out of our house for saying no one should set off fireworks inside the neighborhood.",

      "description": "Alright, so, I've been working as a Dishwasher for just under a month at a small, locally owned restaurant. I'm assigned to work with this other guy who's been working there for about two years. He knows I'm new, but let me clarify I'm new, but not stupid. This is a really simple job that involves running dishes through a dishwasher, occasionally scrubbing, putting dishes away, mopping, and sometimes helping bus tables. I was capable by day three. It's really simple. My Co-Wrker loudly complains that we're going to get out very late tonight. (Closing time is 10:00, but dishes don't usually get out until 10:30, because we have to wait for all customers to be out, so the cooks can stop cooking, so they can give us their dishes.) \n\nHe keeps complaining, and the night manager and him are friends outside of work, and they both are standing five feet away from me, whining how much they hate 'newbies'. (They never mention me, or my name, but it's pretty heavily implied.) I'm getting really annoyed. At about 10:00, after 6 hours of listening to him complain, I decide I'm going to go as slow as possible, ask every dumb question,  and  make so many mistakes, we're going to be here way late. If he wants to complain about me being slow, I'll give him something to complain about. \n\nWe eventually wind up clocking out at 12:14, (Almost 2 hours after we usually would) and my Co-Worker informed me that I ruined his plans after work with his friends. I give him an 'innocent' shrug, smile and say, \"Sorry, I guess I'm still learning.\" \n\nAITA? Or was that just the right amount of revenge? ",

      "description": "I went out for drinks with my colleagues after work one day this week and it went a bit later than expected. This meant that public transport (which I normally catch to and from work) was no long an option to get home. While I normally would catch an Uber, in my laziness I decided that catching a taxi would be easier.\n\nI said where I was going and instead of driving to the location the driver started driving, then pulled over and asked Siri to take him to my destination. I stopped the driver and told him the main roads that he should take to get there.\n\nAbout 25% of the way through the trip, the driver exclaimed “oh shit I forgot to start the meter”, I then told him to start it there, which he did. The driver then proceeded to drive to my destination despite the fact that no phone or GPS was directing him there.\n\nWhen we got to my house the driver said he would add $5 to the meter fare, which is about 25% of the total fare. It is law where I live that a calculation device (I.e. a meter) must be used and so I said, no I would pay the meter fare, despite some very minor back and forth, I stuck to my guns.\n\nThe driver then said that I could have the trip for free even though I was still offering to pay the meter fare. I insisted again I was happy to pay the meter fare but the driver said he wouldn’t charge me.\n\nAm I the asshole for asking to only pay the meter fare (and ending up with a free fare), when the meter fare plus $5 would have been pretty close to a full fare?

I don't say anything and go straight to property management (PM) about this to complain. \n\nI tell PM that the two workers iron grinding is hitting my car and PM asks if they damaged my car. I said as far as I know they haven't but they're grinding is landing on my car. Yes my paint is shit and there are dings on it but I feel like it's disrespectful to do this to my car regardless of the condition it's in. PM looked at me after I explained the situation and asked, \"but they didn't damage your car right?\". I walked out after finding out they'll be working there for maybe a couple of weeks. \n\nPM probably thinks this is a non issue i'm sure but AITA for complaining?

      "description": "\\[TL;DR at bottom\\] Okay, a little history first. I was diagnosed with BPD in my early 20s, which was unsurprising given my personal history. I'd had a pretty messed up childhood and was already dxed with a handful of neurological and mental illnesses. I was in a bad place, with a severe drinking problem, self-harming, and suicidal ideation. I was also a terrible horrible person to live with - I take full accountability for that. Regardless of the mental pain I was in, there is no excuse for my behaviour during those years. I was absolutely the asshole, and I'm not looking for redemption in that regard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, fast forward to my late 20s. I'm engaged to the wonderful woman who is now, still, my wife. She's American, I'm British, and she had just spent 4 years earning a degree in the UK. We're talking about me moving back to America with her, but she's frank with me - if I don't get my act together, it won't work out. At the time, I'm filled with despair and self-loathing, but I know she's right. So I do the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life - I admit I need help and I get help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent 6 months in an intensive DBT program, spilling out my guts, facing some very hard truths, and ultimately rebuilding myself from the ground up. The first few months were agonising, but about halfway through, I hit a major breakthrough. I even stopped drinking (I'd been getting blackout drunk every weekend) and went 18 months without touching a drop. I applied my new skills to my relationship, and by the time the 6 months was over, I had stopped self-harming and acting out, and was dealing with upsets and disappointments like an adult instead of throwing a toddler tantrum. It was hard work, but the payoff was amazing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, fast forward to today. I'm living in America with my wife and I haven't relapsed. We're happy. I'm proud of my amazing wife for standing by me through it all, and I'm proud of myself for getting here. I'm far from perfect - I fight my demons daily. But they don't win any more. Which leads me to the AITA:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI often run into people (mostly online, but 'IRL' too) commenting about people with BPD, saying \"they're irredeemable psychopaths\" and \"they're malicious and sadistic and they LIKE hurting people, so they'll never change\" and it stings me. I have had people suddenly turn on me when we're talking about our backgrounds and I mention the BPD (I don't volunteer it all the time, just when talking about health etc). Suddenly they don't trust me and they want to know how many partners I've \"been through\" (just the one, btw. Wife is the only person I've ever been in a serious relationship with and I've known her since we were teens).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA if I defend myself in those situations? I'm acutely aware that some people HAVE been badly hurt by people with personality disorders, and I don't want to diminish that. On the other hand, being told I'm a monster and a disgusting sadistic psychopath by people who believe I'm irredeemable just because I have/had a mental illness is painful. Especially after fighting so hard to better myself. So, AITA if I say I worked hard to overcome my BPD and people with personality disorders aren't necessarily lost causes? I've been accused of \"still being BPD because \\[you're\\] craving validation\" because of it, and so it puts me in a weird spot. I don't want to just agree that, yes, we're all horrible people... but standing up for myself about it seems to make people upset. Asshole judgement please?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I have BPD but spent a lot of time and effort getting help, quitting drink, stopping self-harm and temper etc. I know that ppl with BPD have caused harm to others, but I also feel like it's unfair that all ppl with it are deemed \"irredeemable monsters and psychopaths\" by some people I've talked to. AITA for standing up for myself in those situations?",

      "description": "A few things I should mention me and my guardian have a rocky relationship or one where it isn't really there at all in my opinion as I'll see them maybe a few times a day or sometimes not at all despite living in the same house. Me and my sibling have a small age gap by only a few years we also live in the same house. I'm not lazy, I do exercise in my room, depending on the weather I do go out for walks, I do go out and work with horses, it's not a completely active life style but it isn't lazy either. In my opinion respect must come from both ways, like you should respect the elderly they should respect the youth. This is just so I don't clutter up the paragraphs with information I should've added before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone very recently passed away in my family, they were close, I was close with them, we had plans to go out and have lunch together once they were recovered properly from a few illnesses. They were doing so well and they sadly passed away very suddenly, no one expected it, we even had a holiday planned. It was very emotional, the doctors who worked to save them even teared up themselves when they had to stop which I don't think I've ever witnessed before in a hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hadn't been asleep and my questions were ignored as soon as my guardian was home, I was very annoyed by this so I just went back to my room after they waited for everyone to get out of bed and sit down to tell everyone. That I know was very asshole of me because I wanted my answers so I didn't have to be around everyone else. I fucking hate being around people during mourning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day afterwards I was forced to leave the house, I didn't really want to do much that day, I was upset, I wanted to rest a bit before I was forced to see the world and face hundreds of \"I'm sorry, talk to me for comfort, poor depressed human!!\". Unfortunately I was forced to leave, I was even more upset when I learned my younger sibling was given permission to just stay in bed but I was forced to get out of the house? I hadn't even done anything, as mentioned I don't talk to anyone, I just stay in my room. It's rare to see me out of my room and for some to even see me at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe person who I went to when I was made to leave who said I didn't have to leave today if I didn't want to and I told the truth, I was made to leave, didn't have much of a choice in the matter. My guardian found this out earlier and had a lovely conversation about how they were basically stopping me from being lazy and I should never tell anyone that I was forced to leave the house. I just went back into my room, and didn't come out. I wasn't going to talk to them about this when they were easily turning it into an argument by interrupting me and speaking over me which is something I find rude. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe tone they said it in though has made me think twice, I now feel guilty because I told someone I was forced to leave while my sibling was allowed to stay. Right now I have mixed thoughts of \"I have a right to be hurt that I was pushed away then told off like a child\" and \"I am guilty because I am angry that I was forced to leave for the day\". I know I was an asshole in the beginning of finding out the news but I'm not sure if I am still the asshole for getting hurt and angry by how I am being treated. What does this look like?",

      "description": "I’ve asked a couple people in real life (the thing outside the internet) what they think, but I know my age/socio-economic/political stances have brought me to friends who think similarly to me, and therefore would not be able to give me a non-biased opinion.\n\nBackground:\n\nMy best best friend in the whole wide world does not vaccinate her kids. She was first turned onto this by the “Mommy Group” at her church.\n\nHer church/religious background: my friend was raised in a cult and unfortunately bears the scars of someone introduced to ultra-extreme conservativism at a young age. Even though she fled the cult, she gravitated to a man who made her join his religion to be with him (publicly, I might add as they’d been sleeping together for a while). She gave up dreams to be a doctor for this guy and dropped out of college and used her college savings on a wedding.\n\nAlthough I was sad about this, and even a down right bitch at times, I’ve learned that friendship is about staying supportive through the hurdles. We’ve had gaps in our friendship before from fights that devastated us and it would be too difficult to do this again.\n\nThe Issue:\n\nThe church has “Elders” who manage the church. Enter 7 nondescript aging white guys. The “Elders” (not kidding, that’s their name), have women and male groups split up and it’s clear that while the men talk business and the future of the church, the women have been overcome by anti-vaccine propaganda. It’s very clear that the “Elders” are not involved nor concerned about the stuff in the women’s group, and I really don’t think they know the levels of insanity this group is at right now. \n\nI’m so so tempted to write to the pastor, as my friend (who is very young and impressionable) really doesn’t do anything her pastor won’t tell her to do. She would be personally offended if I said anything to her about her kids. As much as I’m disappointed in my friend, I’m mostly pissed off at the mommy group for brainwashing the young moms. My friend went through post pardum depression and I feel like they knew how to exactly sink their claws into her when she was so vulnerable. \n\nHer kids are truly wonderful and I get upset every time I see a kid with measles because it’s so preventable. A ton of moms now don’t vaccinate and they work together on getting paperwork finalized for religious exemption or they pull their kids from school to home school them. \n\nI worry for her and her beautiful family, but I really want to give a fucking wake up call to the pastor who does not have any idea this is being taught in his church.\n\nI feel like I’m obsessing or being controlling, and I can handle the honest truth as this has been on my mind for some time. I unfortunately grew up ultra religious and I know the pain that comes from that may make me more upset than the average person. \n\nTL;DR: friend’s church has a mommy group that is teaching anti-vaccine propaganda to young, new moms without the churches knowledge. I would like to write an anonymous letter to their pastor to tell him about the uprising of anti-vaxx propaganda from their women’s group.\n\nHoping for clarity ",

She says it's her's and I bought it for her.\n\nI did buy her one, 10 years ago. We used it, and over time it wore out, the motor broke and it was thrown away. We went without one for several months until we needed one again.  I took it upon myself one day to just go out and buy one because we needed one for something that needed cleaned up.  She thinks she's entitled to this newer one, because I had bought her a different one 10 years ago.\n\nAITA for not letting her have this newer one because I consider these 2 carpet cleaners to be 2 completely different items not related to each other or was the act of buying one for her in the past entitle her to this one as well?  \n\nIf any of this is relevant:\nWe've always had seperate finances, so both in question were bought with my money.  Her new place has hardwood floors, so the only use would be for the upholstery attachment or maybe on area rugs, as opposed to my place (marital home which I'm keeping and buying her out of) which is carpet.

I'm in \"recovery\" rn, i'm barely trying but my parents think otherwise. \n\nThings aren't going so great, i'm at home 24/7, no school and no friends as i've become more depressed than ever. Because of this i'm in a bad mood all the time and i take it out on my parents unfortunetly. I do stupid stuff like, not saying thank you, giving short answers or simply ignoring them. Sometimes though i'll lash out by throwing stuff and slamming doors. It's so childish of me,but i just feel really really angry. This has never been a problem before i've started \"recovery\" \n\nMy dad gets pretty frustrated by this, probably because i never tell him why i'm angry.

I know i'm the asshole for all of this but i just keep doing it.\n\nThe actual situation:\nTonight it was just my dad and i. We ate supper and afterwards I had 1.5 hours of surveillance time. We talked about something and i snapped at him. He got irritated but let it go.\n\nMinutes later we were in the kitchen. On my way out i tipped over a chair on purpose so it fell. My dad got really frustrated, he asked me why i was angry but i didn't answer. He  said something like \"oh ok! Let's just throw all the furniture around! There's no problem with that!!\" and he started shoving and pushing furniture so it fell to the ground.\n\nI ran upstairs to my bedroom but he followed. He yelled at me to come downstairs (surveillance time wasn't over yet) but i refused. That's when he grabbed my arm firmly and started dragging me downstairs. I screamed for him to let go. It hurt but it didn't leave a mark or anything.\n\nTl;dr:\nMy dad and i got into an argument bc i was acting childishly, we both threw furniture and he forcibly grabbed my arm.\n\nThis hasn't happened before. Well, he has grabbed my arm like that once when i got angry and refused to eat.  I know I acted like a brat I just didn't expect him to react that way and I got really scared.\n\nSome time later he asked me to watch tv with him. I didn't answer him. He said he \"was sorry for whatever he did\", i just got up and left.\n\nAITA?  \n\n\n",

      "description": "So today I (26M) was at work, and I wanted some cookies from the vending machine during lunch. The first pack got stuck and the machine kept trying to push them to fall so eventually two packs of cookies were now pushed and both fell. I said \"Yes!\" and offered a pack to my co-worker (35~45M) who was on the phone. He declined and continued on his call.\n\nThen I go to the lunch room to enjoy my first pack of cookies and my co-worker comes in and gives me some kind of fatherly speech about the morals of taking something that isn't yours and how I should probably return them to the HR lady to figure out what to do with them while the vending machine operators come in. He wasn't being a jerk but it fell kinda like he was talking down to me, ultimately ending with \"I won't judge you, you decide what you do.\"\n\nMy other co worker was on the lunch room and told me, after first coworker left, that he shouldn't be telling me what to do in that manner. He didn't say anything about what to do with the cookies but what I basically got from him was that I shouldn't listen to people talking to me like that.\n\nSo I really didn't take it personal, but I'm more worried about how I'm perceived in my workplace if I don't return the cookies. I know that on a public one I wouldn't care, but I never thought a 75c pack of cookies would even matter. \n\nFor some context, I received a second smartphone back in November from an online retailer and I returned it, imagining that might cost some poor guy's paycheck, but 75c of cookies I'll take them without thinking twice.

      "description": "I was in NYC this past week doing some business-related stuff. I went into the public restroom of the office building I was in, and there was a mother and a child (about four or five) washing their hands. The conversation went like this:\n\nMother: What do you want to eat for dinner?\nChild: Something sweet and yummy!\nMother: Sweet and yummy? Like what?\nChild: Pizza!\nMother: Oh, I don’t think the pizza in New York is known for being all that yummy. I think pizza in England and Germany is a lot yummier. I’ll tell you what, we’re flying to London tomorrow, and we can have lots of yummy pizza there. \n\nI was confused because I thought New York-style pizza was considered to be pretty fucking delicious by most. I mean, I’ve never even heard anything related to pizza in England or Germany. (It is worth noting that I have lived pretty close to New York my whole life, so I may be biased/poorly informed.) So I chimed in and said, “I couldn’t help but overhear your conversation, but I do think New York pizza is probably more well-known than London pizza. Might be worth a try.” \n\nTo this the mother shot me the DIRTIEST look and proceeded to not respond, while the child eagerly said, “Let’s get pizzaaaaaaa.” I walked out of the bathroom after that. \n\nI recounted this story to my friend, who said that the mother probably just didn’t want to eat pizza, maybe the kid was lactose intolerant, they probably had a ton on this trip, etc. She said I was the asshole for getting involved in this mother’s parenting. I thought I was just being helpful since 1. It didn’t sound like the mother was against them eating pizza; she just seemed to think NY pizza wasn’t all that good and 2. Why would she ask the kid what she wanted to eat unless she was genuinely interested in the kid’s opinion? \n\nI didn’t mean to intrude on a private conversation, and obviously if it was clear that the mother was telling a white lie to the child for parenting reasons (“No, honey, Santa IS real”) I would’ve kept my mouth shut. So what do you think, AITA? ",

      "title": "AITA for being upset at my mom for asking others about my personal life before asking me?",
      "description": "First of all, I'm a pansexual man who has been dating a trans man for just over 4 months. This is my first relationship with someone other than a straight girl.\n\nMy mom, in the past, has told others things about me that are very personal and without my knowledge. It often results in extremely embarassing moments for me where someone will ask me about something I have no idea why or how they know these things about me. \n\nShe also recently outed her brother as gay to me and my sister, which I don't believe he knows she did.\n\nOver about the past 3 months, she has been repeatedly asking my sister about my relationship with my boyfriend, which I have not told my mom we are dating. She told her \"why don't you just ask him\", as I have asked my sister to not share anything about it with her. My sister has told me that it happens almost every time she sees her. She has yet to ask me more than \"Why do [SO]'s parents call [SO] 'her' and you call [SO] 'him'?\" to which i replied he is trans, and it's easy for me to not misgender him since I've always known him as male, and his parents aren't entirely used to that concept yet.\n\nThis past weekend, my sister told me that she specifically asked her if we were dating. The reason I'm upset about this is because I feel it is super intrusive and deceptive to try and find out this information behind my back. I'm officially out of the closet to everyone that I talk to besides my parents, specifically because I know my mom has divulged personal information in the past. \n\nBecause this is particularly personal information, and she has outed her brother to me in the past, I don't feel comfortable with her finding out through asking other people because I don't want to be outed to a few specific people I have not told yet (family friends mostly, parents are friends and I'm friends with their kids). Some of my best childhood friends are homophobic and I'd like to have the chance to explain to them on my own terms, without having them know before I know.\n\nThe day after my sister told me she asked if we were dating, my sister and I both visited my parents for supper and for me to grab a few more things (Just recently moved to my own apartment). The entire time, my mom did not ask a single question about my relationship with my boyfriend.\n\nAs I was leaving, I told her, verbatim \"I don't like it when you talk about me behind my back.\" She either had no idea what I was talking about, or just chose not to respond. So later in the night I sent her a text message saying:\"If you have questions about my personal life you need to ask ME and not [Sister]. I am super insulted that you are going behind my back and I think it's a pretty fucking stupid way for you to lose my trust so please, ask ME anything.\"\n\nI feel like with that text I covered the fact that I know she's asking about my personal life behind my back, that I don't appreciate it, and that she should ask me anything.\n\nIt's been 2 days now, no response yet.\n\nAm I the asshole?

I just don't like promise rings. \n\n\nSo we had Valentine's day plus our one year anniversary. He got us promise rings. I told him to get his money back I wasn't going to wear it. \nHe said I should take it and keep it wherever I wanted (he was visibly upset of course - and I did try to be as kind as I could when refusing the gift he knew I didn't care for). (Btw I'm 20 and he's 23)\n\n\nSo I took it and he was wearing his ring all the time, our friends were talking about it and saying that I was being TA. That I should compromise in this small thing to make my boyfriend happy.\n\n\nSo I said to him I could put it on a necklace or carry with me in my wallet. He got angry asking why I wanted to appear to be single ... \n\n\nughh that was never the point and now he acts like wearing something is a proof of love and commitment that I won't do and he will. \n\nAITA here??? \n",

      "description": "I'm at a college where it's common to be involved in clubs, 15+ units, and working on projects. I met a really cool friend last year, but it became clear than I like to be involved in a lot of stuff while he likes to relax, cook, play videogames, and just do school. Nothing wrong with that, but it's a big contrast to the rest of the group we study with, because they're really involved in things as well. He would complain to me about how everyone works too much, how they keep saying no to hanging out because they're busy, how they would bail, etc. I didn't see it that way because they want to focus on other things and don't want to hang out as often as him. It just seemed like he was complaining that they didn't live their lives how he lived his life. Sometimes I would say no to his hangouts as well since I was busy, and he would say stuff like \" I'm used to it\", \" At least I tried.\", \"Yeah, I expected it\". But he would ask me like every other day. He doesn't have a car so people would have to drive him to wherever we would hang out. The frequency and his responses would get annoying so I Just started saying no because I didn't like how he would try to make me feel bad about not wanting to do something. I explained this to him about how this is guilt-tripping and how those responses are passive-aggressive, but he says that's just how he jokes and that I shouldn't take it too hard. He does it less, but he still does  say stuff like \" I tried.\" and \" I'll keep trying because I think you guys are worth it\". He makes it seem like we're burdens and that he just has to deal with us. I recently told him I just want my own space and I'll probably say no to most of his hangout requests. I just don't want to be around him anymore because he doesn't accept how some people like to live their lives. He recently was disappointed that I wanted to go for a Master's because he didn't understand why I didn't just want a chill year. Sure I get stressed from doing so much sometimes, but it makes me happy and I'm not going to sacrifice that to meet his social needs. We used to message and talk every day, but now I don't respond to his texts unless it's urgent and I just say no to every hangout request. He's still a good friend and I'm sure he means well, but he's pushy and needy and I don't need that in my life. ",

      "description": "My bf(20) and I(f23) had a long conversation about our past relationships and just experiences. He told me he thinks he still loves his ex and he wonders if he made the right choice breaking up with her. No shit, he told me that right after I told him I was raped. Talk about insensitive timing. Naturally, I told him right then that I wasn't comfortable knowing that, like I'd always be number 2 in his mind. He just got wildly mad at me for even suggesting I had a problem with this new knowledge and refused to talk about it. I said if he still loved her to be with her instead, and he just shut down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a week after that, we hung out and I saw that his ex was his top friend on snapchat. I tried to forget that he still loved her and just drop it because I do care about him, but seeing that they talked all the time on an app that doesn't keep messages didn't sit right with me. (Also, after proofreading, he did tell me they talk all the time too. It isn't just my brain going loony mode.)  I asked him if he could stop talking to her as much because I wasn't comfortable with this and again he got mad at me, saying they're best friends and that's mean to her. She's even messaged me and told me they're best friends and not to get in the way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess, what makes me question if I'm the asshole, is that I won't stop being friends with my male friend after this. He's told me I need to but I don't see the equivalence. I've been friends with \"Pete\" for well over 5 years. We never loved each other, we've just been really good friends. Nothing has ever happened between us. We don't even hang out, we just play video games sometimes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't try to police who he talks to, in fact I could care less about any other girl. Does me not wanting him to continue talking to his ex make me the asshole?",

      "description": "To be specific, 3 nintendo switchs. Throwaway for too much identifying information.\n\nMy fiancè works for a big company that rhymes with Malmart, and for those of you who don't know on black friday they get a discount that stacks on top of their employee discount plus the black friday discounts, which means a lot of savings for the employees. One or two days before the Thursday (the day Malmart had black friday this year) and excitedly told me he was putting not one but two switches on layaway.\n\nThis made me excited for a few reasons:\n1. I have only had 3 handheld gaming devices in my life, the gameboy colour, gameboy advance, and a PSP when it first came out.\n2. His only hobby is gaming. Since its his only hobby it is the only thing we do together other than talking or watching shows or go on dates. We are long distance so gaming is the most easiest convenient way for us to bond.\n3. Due to my situation I dont have any consoles, and the last one I owned was a PS3. I don't even own a TV. He has a PS4, xbox360, xbox one, and a Nintendo 3ds. Because of this we can only play games on PC but my little laptop is getting old and has started having issues with running games and overheating, and he only consistently plays one game with me anyway which happens 3/4 times a week.\n\nHe never specifically said the switch was for me, but from the context and tone of voice he seemed to imply it was for me. I found out maybe a week later that the second switch was for his dad because of a text message blunder between him and his dad on his mums phone. I was disappointed, sure, but I'm sort of used to not really being able to indulge his hobby with him unless he's in the mood to play that one PC game with me. However since it was for his dad and his dad's had a rough time over the past few months it was really nice and I'm proud of him for spending his money that way.\n\nFast forward to today when he went and paid off his layaway for not two but three switches. Who is the third one for you ask? His best friend. Who doesn't have a job. Owns all the consoles he owns. That's when I got sad and a bit jealous and feel like an asshat for being this way about how he spends his money. \n\nI just want to give a little more context on why I'm upset about this. I sent him around $300 worth of Christmas presents (and a blanket I worked about 30 hours on knitting) that arrived this morning, he knows what they are, and when asked what he's getting me for Christmas (I'm not a fan of surprises) he said himself. He will be coming to see me next month, yes, but I paid for half of his plane tickets and this is his first trip to come see me. All of my trips to see him were paid for myself alone. He doesnt have bills other than paying rent once a month from living at home and takes home around $300 a week, after bills I take home around ~$100 a week If i pick up extra shifts.\n\nPlease tell me if I'm the asshole and overreacting, I just need to know where to direct my feelings from here.",

We definitely fight much more when we're long distance compared to when we're together, and it's making us both sad to be apart for so long, some days it feels like it's not worth it.\n\nSo A is really great at tech stuff, and already had an internship working with drones and FPGAs in high school, and now he went to this job fair at his college a few weeks back, fast forward to today, he got a confirmation for a job with one of the big 4 tech giants in the US. Problem is, job is in Texas, we live in Virginia, and right now I go to school in VA and he goes to school in Michigan. \n\nI really want to be supportive because this job is going to make A really successful and it's going to set him up for a great life with a great job and a million opportunities. But the only thing is, I'd never see him, not until December this year. The only thing that keeps me happy enough in long distance was the fact that we'd see each other over the summer every year and then we'd be fine. I really don't want to wait around all summer and next semester just to see him 10 days a year (the 10 days our winter breaks overlap). I feel like it's unfair to me because I wouldn't go job hunting thousands of miles away when I know he would want to be with me over the summer, but I also really feel like a terrible person for wishing he never applied for this internship and wishing he never got it so he could spend summer with me instead. He really deserves the job and a more supportive girlfriend, but I think I also deserve someone who wouldn't leave me hanging like this. \n\nAITA? \n\nTL;DR- boyfriend got a great job over the summer, we're already long distance bc of college, now we'll be long distance over the summer too for the next 4 years.

      "description": "Okay, so my wife and I have moved quite a bit throughout our relationship, and as such, thinfs have gotten packed and unpacked and mixed around numerous times. We've been married going on 4 years, and together almost 8, and in that time, we've moved 6 times (needed more room due to pregnancy, helped family, landlord neglect, etc. Not poor financial decisions). We've been at our current spot about a year and a half, and there's still shit packed away. Mind you, some of this shit has been packed away for nearly *three years* (the second last move, we moved into her mom's to lend her a hand due to declining health, so we rented a storage unit for most of our stuff). I've asked her about taking care of it several times, as it's mostly her stuff, because when I left my parents house, it wasn't on great terms, so I pretty much just brought clothes, my phone, and a few other things (not that I had much else anyway), but she always finds some excuse not to do it. The fact that it's been packed away for so long, and we aren't going \"hey, where is (insert item here)? I haven't seen it in ages\", kinda shows that nothing essential is packed.\n\nI've been debating whether or not to go through it myself, save anything potentially sentimental and trash the rest. On one hand, it's cluttering our house. It's not hoarder level, and we're not living in squalor, but the unnecessary few boxes and few bags of jackets/blankets/old clothes that are still against the wall in our kitchen/in our front closet is getting irritating. On the other hand, I don't want to go through it, and then have her eventually want to go through it and get mad that I did it. I've asked her like once a month since moving here. Once or twice I've tried starting, and asking her as I go, and she just gets irked and tells me to put it off.\n\nSo, WITBA?",

In my defense I have bad adhd and I had continuously asked her to schedule a doctors appointment to get me the proper medication witch I only received at the very end of the semester.\n\nSo she texted me saying she was pissed and that she was going to take my phone, and my games although since I got my meds I've been disinterested and barely even play them anymore, besides weekends when i dont take my meds, and she was going to pick me up from my dads early. \n\nAfter some arguing through text. She called me so she properly lay into me. I tried to tell her that everything was fine and I would average my grades out the best I could. After a couple rounds of trying to have the last word and losing she got angry and said \"you haven't done anything with your life\" and \"you're never going to get into college\"\n\nI had finally has enough and told her I didn't care about grades or going to college and if she wanted me to pass then she should have gotten me my medicine instead of telling me to \"try harder\" she got guilty and told me she just wanted me to do better. I told her \"thanks for nothing\" and hung up\n\nI refused to go to her place and my dad somehow convinced her to let me stay.

      "description": "I know that I am the asshole because I blew up on her about it when I should have been calm and should have stepped away from the issue. Don't judge me on that, because I could not have helped that part, but I still need insight on why it's wrong/right for me to feel this way.\n\nI have known my girlfriend (20F) for four years, but we have only been dating for one year. She met my parents a couple of times, and we had a trip last Christmas break where she stayed in a hotel with me and my parents. It was a good time all around.\n\nHalf a year ago, my dad passed away. It was expected, but it still hit me and my mom hard. My girlfriend reacted to the news with shock when I told her. She was there for me when I was really struck by grief, but ultimately, she was over it just about the instant she heard it. I chalked it up to her not having known him all her life, but today, it really made me feel... aggravated.\n\nA couple of hours ago, Stan Lee died and news got around. (May he rest in peace.) The moment my girlfriend heard, she broke down--crying in a way that I have never seen her cry. She was so mortified by this, and I sat down with her, reminded of the day that my father died and the way that I broke down. She started talking about Spiderman, her favorite comic book series. Stuff like how she couldn't believe that such a good man died and how she was going to miss seeing his cameos.\n\nAnd for some reason, I couldn't help but wonder why she never said anything like this when my father died. Sure, she was there for me, but all she did was listen and tell me \"I don't know what to say...\" every time I talked to her about my memories. At the time, I accepted this.\n\nStan Lee is a media legend, sure, but she didn't even know him. My dad was someone that she sat down and ate dinner with. My dad was someone that she met, and she couldn't spare any tears for him. I was very upset. I told her these things, yelling when I said it. She stopped crying and looked shocked--and even in the moment, I knew that I shouldn't have exploded like that. We decided that we will talk about this tomorrow.\n\nLook. Roast me. Tear into me. I feel very strongly about this, but I know that I might be in the wrong. I want you to tell me why I'm wrong so that I can gain perspective on this. ",

I asked my brother the permission and he gave me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, while we were all having fun, barbecuing and everything. Around 19:00, my bfs friends showed bottles of alcohol. They were drinking. I told my bf not to drink but he did it anyway, that idiot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stopped smoking since I promised my brother when I moved in with him, most of my friends were smoking. My bf, even though around me he is cute boy but when he is around his friends he acts like some gangster. He was drinking and smoking and I told him again to stop but he refused so I told him ''if you drink I will drink too'' I drank a small amount of alcohol, it wasn't good anyway but we started having arguments. We than decided not to talk to each other and I started dancing with one of my friends. He showed up and asked if he can dance with me too, I said no, I was half (a little bit) drunk and I left him to sit next to all his friend while he wanted to talk to me. AFTER THAT I don't actually remember a lot but …..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother came and kicked the dudes that were drinking out. I said bye to other kids and only me and my bf were left. My brother was mad at us and he really kept lecturing me how it is bad for our health and other stuff. My bf was drunk so, my brother ended up calling his parents. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother told me that my bf is a trouble maker. My brother was mad at me and my bf, my bf isn't responding to my calls somehow and I am here asking if IATA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if I did something stupid in the party, I didn't drink even half a small cup but still my memory isn't that helpful. Since he drank more than me he will not remember right? why would he be mad? He is 17.",

      "description": "AITA? Backstory: My ex is a real treat.  He gave my older kids eating disorders, tried to brainwash the kids into urine therapy through scaring them that cavities were cancer and we had an epic divorce full of him demanding dirt, which I wasn't about to pay to excavate from the yard.  After the divorce he quit his job (making over 100k with benefits) to be a full time bitcoin trader.  Bitcoin dropped and he hasn't been keeping up to date on payments to me and I am still covering the kids extra expenses completely even when he says he will help.  \n\nI got my older son a cell phone a few years ago and the ex would pay half of the bill, but my son lost the phone so it was turned off.  In June I got my older two phones and my ex refused to pay for any of the bills.  For Christmas this year I gave my younger son a new cell phone case that was military tested for drops and everything (I got the same case for myself) and he broke it while at my ex's house.  I told my son that he couldn't take his phone anywhere outside of our house without a case due to him being 11 and not the best at not dropping things.  \n\nMy ex called me very upset that he couldn't contact the 11 year old on his phone, I explained that he doesn't have his phone because he doesn't have a case.  My ex then went into a tirade that whoever bought such a shitty case was an idiot and the case was obviously shitty and how the purchaser should have done better research on cases and purchase better products.  I calmly said would you like to purchase a better case for our child's phone? Quickly he quipped that the children's phones were none of his concern and hung up on me. For the record my case is doing great and despite my kids dropping my phone, has not broken or been damaged.\n\nAfter that phone call I told my children they are not to use their cell phones to contact (text or call) their father because their cell phones are not his concern, and he refuses to help with the costs. If they need to contact their father they can use my phone or ask me to contact him.  \n\nMy older son says I am putting him in the middle of our conflict because my ex won't take my phone calls and will take the kids calls.

      "description": "A bit of context: in high school, which I'll call LC, I got incredibly sick and basically had to drop out my sophomore and junior year. To be able to graduate on time, I needed to go to a special high school along with my old high school. The \"special\" high school is called OTA. It's filled with students who either were sick and missed a bunch of school, students with learning abilities, and students who skipped school frequently or got expelled from their old school.\n\nThere, I met this kid who I'll call Jake. He was perfectly pleasant, respectful, and earnest. We found out that we shared an interest in writing and talked about potential story ideas every day. He seemed like a great person, and we got along really well.\n\nAt one point, the topic of why we were in OTA came up. I explained that I missed a ton of school, so I needed to make up credits. It turned out that we had both attended LC. I still attended it, but Jake remarked that his ex-girlfriend ratted on him and he got expelled, so he had to come here. I asked him why he got expelled. His response?\n\n\"Well, she told them about my plan to shoot up the school.\"\n\nIt all came back. I didn't know his ex, but I'd met her once, since she was friends with one of my friends and sat down with our group during lunch. I remember how she'd told us that Jake wasn't doing well, and that he was going to kill some students and teachers, and then himself. And keep in mind: in Jake's own words, he PLANNED this. Not threatened, PLANNED. \n\nI was completely dumbfounded. He confessed this to me like he was reading off of a grocery list. I don't remember what happened after that, but I stayed away from him, only speaking to Jake when he spoke to me first. He'd given me his email and asked me to hang out once school was over. When we graduated, I never responded to his emails. I never spoke to him again.\n\nStill, I feel pretty bad. He was such a nice kid. Maybe he was just in a terrible place a few years ago and had a psychotic break or something... I'm sure that he probably still suffered from depression at OTA, and that being ghosted by a supposed friend hurt a lot. \n\nBut in my senior year at high school, there was a shooting at a high school in my city. One person was killed. Hearing one of my college classmate talk about his dead friend was both heartbreaking and horrifying. I couldn't imagine losing people at LC to a shooter. Now, I've seen Jake a few times at community college, and that scares me. I don't think he recognizes me (at least, he's never come up to me). I don't think I'd ever speak to him; not after seeing that poor classmate struggle not to cry as he talked about the shooting. Do you think Jake has changed? Was I wrong to abandon him?",

The only issue is, is that he is leaving for work out of the country for a year and I will not have a lot of contact with him. \n\nHe is starting to get a little hurt that I told him it will be better to wait until he comes back to start officially dating. He understands that it is because I do not want to start a relationship and have him leave a month later for over a year. That is a long time. But he is afraid that I will find someone new during his time away. With his understanding of this, he still decided to ask me out, and unfortunately I had to decline. Not because I do not want to date him, but because of our bad situation. He did not get mad and completely understands.\n\nI tried to tell him that if I am seeing someone, I don't look for anyone else, even if our relationship is not official. While he is gone it does not mean he is out of the picture for me. It would just be hard to start a new relationship and have him be gone for so long with a huge time difference. I would rather wait until he comes back to start a relationship and be able to see each other often.\n\nI know since hes gone for so long, only time can tell to see if we will actually still by talking by the end of his work trip.

      "description": "Context: I've been chronically unwell for a long long time. My friend comes to my house when I'm not well enough to go out. She used to invite me to go out with her but since she moved in with her boyfriend recently, she's just been coming to my house and going out with him and other people, until I asked her why she didn't want to hang out so much. I thought she was spending extra time with her partner and had, you know, forgotten her other friends still exist. She said no, it was cos she didn't want to invite me to things if I might be upset that I couldn't come if I wasn't well. I explained that I was upset cos she seemed to not want to hang out as much and could she please not decide for me what I was well enough to do or not, just invite me and let me decline, as she knows my health changes day to day. \n\nAnyway. This weekend I wasn't feeling well and I asked her if we could hang out, she said yes and came to my house. I wasn't sure how far I could go out, so we went to the beach right nearby.\n\nAfter about an hour she was texting loads, then announced she was gonna go to the pub with her boyfriend and his friend - both of whom are my friends too - for st Patrick's day and she was gonna wear a green top I gave her. She said she was feeling bored on the beach.\n\nShe made no move to invite me to join them until I asked if I could come if I want to and she said yes I could come. I decided it would be too far for me to go in the end. We left so she could go join them. I felt a bit shit about not being able to go but way worse about apparently not being welcome. \n\nThen stupidly, I emailed her asking why she didn't invite me at first, and if it was cos of my health could she, again, not decide for me what I can do, and if it was cos she didn't want me to come then that's her choice. Then I felt like shit for asking her to justify her decision not to invite me cos she doesn't have to invite me or explain. \n\nBut basically my best friend said that she was bored of me and was gonna hang out with our other friends instead, after an hour on the beach, when I was expecting an afternoon with her - looked like she was bored of me not just the beach. And I felt she was only there to help, not cos she wanted to see me - it's hard to be great company when you're not very well but I'm hardly a charity case.\n\nShe didn't reply to my question (I immediately wrote again to say sorry for asking and she doesn't have to answer). I think I've either lost a friend cos she doesn't like me anymore, or I've lost a friend cos I'm being stupid about whether she likes me or not.\n\nIs she the asshole for excluding me from our mutual friends? Or am I the asshole for asking her not to?",

      "description": "As the Superbowl is nearing I'm wondering about this:\n\nOften, when my girlfriend and I (both in our early twenties) do something in the evening that's rather passive - like watching a movie or tv - she falls asleep. It doesnt matter what we watch, and on bad days, she'll fall asleep at 9pm.  If we do different things, for example if we just talk, she stays up much longer.\n\nThis frustrates me. I have told her this to which she said that there is nothing she can do about it and I guess that's true. So I have told her I would appreciate it if she would tell me once she notices she is starting to fall asleep, because I don't like watching movies by myself, that we were supposed to watch together. However she also does not do that either. It has gotten to a point where I honestly do not propose to watch a movie if its later than 9 just out of fear that she falls asleep (and I'll be frustrated). Furthermore, I'm hesitant to agree to watch a movie if she proposes it. If that happens, it's hard for me to tell her that because she always gets defensive about it and makes me feel like I am at fault for getting frustrated at that.\n\nAnother issue with this is that we only have one bedroom and the kitchen to hang out, so if she falls asleep there is not much for me to do and I'm \"forced\" to go to bed as well (not really, but if I have the choice, I'd play Playstation but I cant because the Playstation is in our bedroom).\n\nAnd then about tonight - I'm really excited about the Superbowl and she promised me to watch it with me but I am already expecting her to fall asleep, probably even before the first play. Somehow, that makes me a little sad.\n\nI know that her mom and dad have the same \"problem\" and he is always just joking about it, so I sometimes do feel like an asshole about it. What do you guys think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This is a throwaway account. Pardon me, this is kind of a long story.\n\nSo there's this girl - Let's call her Alexis - who I have been best friends with for three years. We met in our freshmen year of University, and we are both Juniors now. For a while, we were extremely close, to the point where I actually considered her one of my best friends. But as time went on, things began to get tense between us.\n\nSee, Alexis has not had the easiest life. She has multiple mental issues - such as anxiety and depression - that were not helped by her growing up in poverty and with no support network. While I do also have my own share of mental baggage, I have had a comparatively privileged upbringing; I was raised by an upper middle class, supportive family (this may seem like a non-sequitur, but it comes up later). Regardless, I have always tried my best to be supportive of her, knowing about all she has to deal with.\n\nHowever, as time went on, Alexis began to lash out at me (and occasionally other people) when she got angry. In my case, this consisted of her accusing me of being insensitive, arrogant, childish, manipulative, and guilt-tripping, among other things. The worst of these incidents happened in Sophomore year, when she gave me a letter that emotionally blackmailed me and basically tried to make many of my own emotional problems about her.\n\nToday, everything blew up.\n\nWe had agreed to finally sit down and talk about these issues. I was accompanied by our mutual best friend, who we will call Lyla (who has been an active defender of Alexis up until recently). After talking for a bit about Alexis' own problems, we finally got on the topic of her lashing out at me. Alexis told me that she couldn't help lashing out at me, that it was caused by her own horrific problems, and that I should pay more attention to my own actions so I don't say something that can be construed as upsetting her.\n\nSome examples of things I did that she brought up specifically are:\n\n* Telling her to see the new Spider-Man movie (which she interpreted as me ignoring her poverty)\n* Asking if her laptop was still broken (which she also interpreted as me ignoring her poverty)\n* Talking about my plans to go to Grad School after she talks about needing to graduate to survive\n* Calling myself an idiot after she corrected me about something (which she interpreted as guilt-tripping)\n\nThe letter was also brought up, and she basically told me that she was sorry for how she wrote the letter, but not for its contents. In fact, she accused me of being insensitive towards her by having a negative reaction to the letter. She then repeated that she couldn't help herself, and that I needed to be understanding of her, and not act like that she was inferior to me (which I do not do, at least not intentionally).\n\nLater on, Alexis told me that me and Lyla were the only people she really felt like she could trust, and that we were her only support network. Then, she accused me and Lyla of ganging up on her, and went into a full-blown panic attack, screaming about how she wanted to end her life and telling herself that she was a terrible person. At this point, Lyla left, fed up with the situation. I stayed for a little longer, but after a while I decided that I was getting nowhere with her. \n\nBefore I even met with her, I came to the conclusion that I couldn't continue to put my (rather fragile) mental health on the line for her sake. And so, when I realized I couldn't change her mind, I left. As of right now, I intend to stay away from her, to not consider her a friend anymore.\n\nI don't hate her, and I still care about her. But I don't want to be on the receiving end of her anger anymore. Does this mean I'm in the wrong? Am I the asshole for walking away from our friendship when she's this vulnerable?",

      "description": "This happened a while ago (6 months) but I still think about it a lot, still wondering if I was wrong or not.\n\nA little bit of backstory first (I'll split this in two parts, first what led to my decision to forbid her something, and then why I did it), we where in a 2 year relationship (we had a relation ship before that, there was a gap of 1.5 year) and things where starting to get complicated, we often had fights about things.\n\nWe had an big argument about something, long story short, we planned a festival together, something which I've wanted to do for a very long time since she would always go with her friends (which is perfectly fine) but never with me,  so I was really excited for it.\nLet's say the festival date was 5 juli till 8 juli.\nI noticed on Facebook that she put her self on \"attending\" for a party that was on 6 and 7 Juli, when I asked about it, she said to me \"well then you and me just go 8 juli so that I can attend the other party as well\" I told her no, we made plans, ive wanted this for over 2 years and now that we finally have something you just cancel it without discussing anything.\n\nThis led to a huge argument, in which she said that I never come up for what I want, and that I need to stand up more for myself.\n\nNow the next part of the backstory;\nShe had panic attacks, this started because she used XTC 2 years ago (beginning of the relation), she went through a lot because of it, had a lot of medications, and she was finally getting better and learning how to deal with it.\nI've supported her the whole time, would come over instantly every time she had a panic attack, she called my multiple times crying on a station in Amsterdam (40mins by train from my house) and I would instantly travel to her to help her get back to her home.\n\nNow the actual story:\nA week after the first fight in this post, she told me she wanted to do XTC again.\nI thought this was a really stupid idea, but I sometimes do it myself so I can't forbid her to use it.\nI tried talking her out of it but I couldn't, so I told her I wanted to be with her (sober) whenever she was gonna do it, so that if anything goes wrong I can take care of her.\nShe told me she didn't need a babysitter, that she was old enough to know what she wanted and that her girlfriends could take care of her as well.\nI reminded her about the last fight where she told me to stand up for what I think more often, and she told me that this was a completely different situation, and that she doesn't need a boyfriend who decides for her what to do and what not to do (first time that I ever did this).\nWe had a whole discussion and I didn't give in, told her it was either me joining or not doing it at all.\nA week later she broke up with me.\n\nAm I the asshole for not giving in on the situation/forbidding her to do something without me being there? \n\nSorry if it's a hard read, English is not my primary language and I'm a bit tired ATM.",

I am admittedly very bad at answering texts or messages if I’m not close to the other person and it’s not pressing. I put a Nintendo 64 on Facebook marketplace, and after getting a few scam attempts, I basically started ignoring it altogether. I’m in no rush to sell the N64, so I’ve been ignoring messages (asking if it’s still available and other questions about the product). I looked at my inbox after not responding for about a month and a half, and I noticed that someone messaged me 6 times and by the last message they were cursing me out. They said it’s extremely unfair to post something on the marketplace if you’re not actually going to sell, and that I’m “a fucking useless asshole.” They then tried to convince me that I should sell it to them for 30 for putting them through that and making them miss Christmas (I wasn’t falling for the guilt trip). Am I the asshole for this?",

      "description": "Hello everyone! For this stories sake the people in this story will be called Eleanor &amp; James. \n\nI've known Eleanor &amp; James for a few years now as we all work at the same job. I have more in common with James and not much at all with Eleanor which is probably why i get on with him better. \n\nAnyway, i never really realized that she was being toxic until one of my best friends started pointing things out to me after hearing me talk about Eleanor some. I guess i just needed to see for myself. \n\nJust to give a few examples before i start the actual story &amp; the reason i'm posting here. She's often accused James of lying about different things with nothing to back it up with, or she'd say i should only listen to her and not him. I feel like i've become her therapist and all that's done is stress me out and completely drain me. She'd often get irritated because i wouldn't text her back or wouldn't text her when i got home which she often would ask me to do. Everything was so dramatic for her, the smallest thing would seem horrible to her. I often thought that maybe i was the one being toxic and that maybe it was something i did or it was my fault. \n\nThe story though happened last Tuesday at work. I was on break and James and Eleanor got mad at each other and words were had to keep it simple. She told me her story and he told me his and they were actually pretty similar with a few slight differences on both their parts but not enough that one of them was right and one was wrong. \n\nI did tell Eleanor that the stories were different which i later corrected to slightly so she wouldn't think the whole story was wrong. However, even after i corrected that she still won't really talk to either one of us and it's been about a week. \n\nI texted her last night so i could attempt to fix things and find out why she was mad. She said it was because i chose his side over her's and that he was lying to me about her. I told her i didn't realize i was choosing sides here, and that calling any of my friends a liar doesn't fly well with me without knowing all the facts. Then i told her no matter who was present you're going to get slight differences in the same story from their point of view. \n\nYeah, i could've told her his version of the story but i felt like it would've made things worse and i didn't think it was my place to do that in the first place and i was already in the middle of things not wanting to be. If she wanted to know she needs to ask him about it. \n\nAfter all this, i don't know that i want to go back to being chummy with her. I'll be polite to her at work but that's it. I thought once you got in your mid 20s-early 30s all this \"i'm not talking to her\" nonsense would be non-existent. \n\nEven typing this out i feel like i've done something wrong. \n\nTLDR; toxic friend quit talking to me over something at work, is it okay to leave the friendship? \n",

      "description": "So I started dating this girl in college. I'm bi and she was the first girl I ever dated and things were going pretty well. I was her first kiss and we were pretty into each other. So during the weeks leading up to finals week, she found out that she had mono and it was a pretty bad case. She didn't tell me just how bad it was, but I knew that she couldn't really get out of bed or make herself food, and that she had to have IV fluids because she was so dehydrated from the fever. When I came over to make her food or do work with her, she wouldn't seem like she was dying or anything. She was on top of the essays she needed to write (she wrote them when her fever dipped for a few hours) and I was definitely not. When her temperature went up, she would start shivering and I could feel how feverish she was. During the two weeks she was really sick, I bought her groceries once and visited her three times, but she kept asking if I could come study with her (just sitting on the couch with her or something) and make her scrambled eggs because she couldn't stand for long enough to do that.  \nI have anxiety and an eating disorder. These issues get especially bad during the weeks leading up to finals week, and I was in a really bad place. Most days, I would just sit on my bed shaking and trying to write papers. I told my girlfriend I was sick with a chronic thing and really struggling with the amount of work I was doing. She would keep texting me, with motivational memes or updates on how she was doing and I would leave her on read because I just couldn't mentally handle responding. One time I told her I'd call her in the morning but I didn't get back to her until like 6 PM and she was pretty angry with me but I couldn't emotionally handle responding.\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "This one is a bit long but I'll try to keep it short (also on mobile so formatting issues)\nI'm a really good student, or at least I try to be. I get my work done, I study hard, I participate in class a lot, you get the picture. One thing that I'm not good at is group projects. I used to be good at asking people how we will split up the work and trusting them to do their share of the work but now it's getting harder for me to do that and not just go ahead and do some of the work everyday and chip away at the project as a whole.\nThere have been too many partners that wait till the last minute (sometimes this is literal). For example I had a paper due monday that was assigned on Friday. One of my partners said he'll set up the doc that day so we could work on it but the next day, nothing. So I set up the doc. I asked one of my partners if it was cool if I did a certain section and when he said yes I did it pronto. I waited till nighttime for someone to do another (this was Saturday btw) and when there was nothing I did a bit more and a bit more in the morning (Sunday) when there was still nothing added by my partners. At this point a good chunk of the paper was done by me and it was only in the afternoon did I get a text saying how I did a lot. A part of me wanted to say you never told me what you were gonna do so I figured I would do a bit more since I had time to do it. A part of me wanted to apologise.\nI don't tell the teachers about me doing a lot of the project because my partners may have legitimate reasons they didn't work on it. I just don't want to risk hurting my grade when I know I can work on the project. So am I the asshole for not trusting my partners to do their share and eventually doing some (or a lot) of the work for them?\nTldr: I chip away at group projects when none of my partners have worked on it and eventually most of the work is mine.

Unfortunately she told me she didn’t feel the same way, she just saw me as a friend and I accepted it, i have been rejected before. It hurt but I soldiered on, however recently she started dating and mentions off hand she met this guy at a bar, or went on a date and it went well. Stuff you would tell a good friend, and I smile and say I’m happy for her and hope it works out etc. But inside it still hurts, and I’m not going to lie I feel jealous and a little mad even though I have no right to be whatsoever. I’ve started drifting off, not talking to her as much or hanging out just because it’s painful. I haven’t ghosted her because that’s a dick move, but I have told her I need space, though I haven’t told her why. But the thing is I don’t think I can move past it, and I really have tried, I don’t to hurt her because she’s my friend and I care about her but i might start to distance myself for my own sanity and not try to reconnect .

      "description": "My father really wants to celebrate my birthday tomorrow. I get he cares about me and all that stuff, but I personally hate holidays. I think they're shameless corporate cash grabs that have been robbed of any real meaning or history they may have once had and produce unnecessary stress. Like how Christmas is an extremely likely time for people to kill themselves.\n\nI personally think birthdays are similar, it's just a time where people give each other things, not because they feel the other person really wants/needs that thing, or would really want to do something. Usually people just do those because others are doing it, so they feel obligated to do so, kinda like Valentines day.\n\nAnyways, a couple days ago, my fathers wife texted me and asked about what I want to do for my birthday, I said nothing because I don't like birthdays. Today my father himself texted me asking if it was okay to pick me up and go for dinner. I told him I didn't want to and I would rather treat it like any other day. He then said they already picked out a present, and made reservations. I said I am sorry, but I just don't want to do anything, and I also don't need or want anything at the moment.\n\nI feel kinda bad, like I am some ungrateful piece of shit. Am I in the wrong? Am I just too cynical of an asshole that I can't even enjoy my own birthday? Should I just go along and tolerate them to make them happy? I personally have not celebrated a holiday in years, but they still get me cards and shit even thought I tell them not to. I probably should have just expected this.",

Though in the last few years when most if our friends became distant with their own relationships. He filled the void by becoming hyper active in gyms. He regularly posts on Facebook about his super healthy food and is super strict workout routines. Oh and he competes in Spartan challenges every weekend. He's got an entire chest full of these medals. Am I the asshole who thinks he's going overboard with this health thing. I fear it I criticize him on Facebook or even in person I would look like someone holding him back. I know that he has his own Spartan Challenger group that probably push each other for this activity I am just concerned that is taking it to unhealthy levels. Can someone be too healthy??",

      "description": "I'm on mobile yadda yadda. But something's been bugging me for about a year and I need some outside help.\n\nTLDR: My \"sister\" is not my dad's child but begs and pleads for money and I want her out of our lives. AITA for just wanting to convince my dad to cut all contact and let her go?\n\nI'll give you guys some back story. My dad slept with a local bar whore 29 years ago, before my mother was even a thought in his head, once. He lived in a small farming town at the time and she must have been the best he could get I don't know. He never spoke to her again after, chalked it up to a drunken night and left it. Well let's fast forward to about 12 years ago. \n\nI get told one night that I have a half sister and I'm over the moon. I always wanted a sister. I'm stoked. I meet her, and she's about 6 years older than me and heavily addicted to meth. She immediately asks my dad for money and seeing as how he's been told she's his, reluctantly gives it after she throws a fit saying he doesn't love her or want her. We get a call the next morning that she OD'd and we need to get affairs in order because her mom likely has no money and is currently on the streets, we can't find her. My dad barely found out about her 3 days before. \n\nWe go a few years without contact with her. In the time she goes to rehab, gets married, has a kid with a man who constantly relapses and is currently going to jail for possession and distribution. And still only talks to us when she needs money. She's tried asking my husband and I several times and we deny her quickly. \n\nLast year I got grossly suspicious. I stared at photos and compared and contrasted with the rest of the family. She doesn't look like us. Not the same hair, not the same skin, not the same face. She is not one of ours. And then I convinced her to do one of those DNA kits with me. It'd be fun, right? And I'm paying for it so how can she say no?\n\nWell with it my suspicion was confirmed. She is not related to my dad's side at all. I brought it up with my mom (who also is wary of her and always has been), and my mom told me to keep it hush hush from dad. It would hurt his feelings more than watching her go back and forth down the addiction road, and hospital visits when she needs to be narcaned. I'm tired of watching her hurt my dad and drain him of cash every time she needs a fix. I want her gone. She isn't family. She's some stranger that helped roped my dad into a lie that he is gullible enough to believe. AITA, reddit?",

He did apologise but even afterwards when he told me I was beautiful it felt so empty because I just can’t get past what he said. I also hate that it made me reevaluate myself and feel uncertain with where I stand. \n\nAm I the asshole for being upset/mad at him despite him apologising or do I have a right to feel this way?? \n\nTLDR: boyfriend told me he would help me loose the weight that I didn’t think was a problem, opened up all the insecurities that I used to have about my body",

      "description": "I do handyman work, mostly painting, on the side. I have a long time client who happens to be my landlord and is often frustrating to work with. Currently he wants me to paint doors and trim work inside an apartment with tenants currently living there with a two year old. He is notorious for short cuts while always claiming he wants a quality product for his residents. Currently its revolving around a paint for doors and trim that doesn't cover and is a pain in the ass to work with because it sometimes takes three coats to actually cover. It's basically a pre pigmant added paint. Think the stuff they grab and then add pigmant to after you ask for a specific color. \n\nHe and I talked about it after the last job, last week, and he said he would look into getting something different for the next. The next job is Wednesday. He messaged me today and said he's keeping the old paint. I completely feel like I waste my time using this stuff not to mention I will have to work around a two year old when it's already a pain in my ass painting large portions of an apartment with people still living there. Imagine being told you cant use your only bathroom for over 5 hours because it takes two or three coats for the paint on the door to dry.\nWould I be an asshole for telling him that since he still using the same stuff I wont do it?",

      "description": "When a new pair of Yeezys got released, a friend of mine (let's call her Stacey) lined up 40min to buy them. When she got to the front of the line she found out they didn't have her size so she called me and asked if I wanted a pair. I said sure because I genuinely thought they were nice and wanted them (but also didn't want her to waste all her time). I got the shoes from her but didn’t pay yet and when I went home I found out she got them a size down. Stacey suddenly wants the shoes back after I say I could make a profit of off them because she went through all the trouble of buying them so she wants to resell them herself. I don't see why I should because they’re technically mine and even offered money for the trouble of lining up. Ended up having huge argument where she accused me of taking advantage of her and that if I give her money instead of the shoes we were done being friends. Was actually considering giving her the Yeeyzs back until she blew it up and gave me an ultimatum about our friendship over who resells a pair of fucking shoes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe recently found out I sold them and after another argument I got so tired I offered the profits of what I made, but she responds saying that I \"still don't get it\" and how it shows I \"don't really care\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe told a bunch of people about it and basically made me out to be an absurd and selfish dick to everyone. I jokingly called her a dumb bitch who couldn't sell a pair of shoes for 20$ in front of two people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for selling the shoes?",

      "description": "A few days ago, my mother asked me to conduct a marriage ceremony for her, since I'm ordained and can legally marry people. She has apparently been talking to a man in prison for the past 7 months, but this is was the first I heard of him. \n\nThis guy is in prison, I have no idea how they got to talking, my mom has been very vague about the whole thing. She keeps saying that it just will really help her out but I can't fathom how marrying a man in prison will help her. I think it has to do with insurance and him being native American, so he gets per cap or something.\n\nMe and her don't have a very good relationship because she was incapable of making good decisions in the past which included staying in multiple abusive men and just overall lack of care for me and my siblings growing up.\n\nShe has already been married twice before both to emotionally/physically abusive drug addicts. The guy she has been talking to is in prison for battery but she won't tell me the details.\n\nNow, I don't really believe that marriage is some sacred thing, but it is a legally binding government contract that can and has messed up her life and the lives of me and my siblings in the past. So I'm really worried for her and my 2 younger brother and sister who still live with her. \n\nShe has always been very emotionally abusive and I have problems with confrontation. So I feel very pressured to say yes even though I think it's wrong. Like I said, we don't have a very good relationship, but she has been helping me out with rides to work a lot lately and sort of trying in her own way to fix it, but whenever she has been nice to me like this in the past it was because she wanted something.\n\nHer being so vague about everything is really making me question the whole thing. I feel like she might be manipulating this guy for money he probably doesn't have. She has been in a few lesbian relationships for that exact reason. \n\nI feel like an asshole for not wanting to do it. I've heard he talk to the guy and she goes and visits him often, and it sounds like he makes her kinda happy. But it's so hard for me to believe her because of all of her lies growing up. I feel like it could just be another one of her manipulation tactics. She's very very very good at that. \n\nI know this is probably a clear answer to most of you, but I just need a little feedback from unbiased source. I'm a real pussy when it comes to confrontation, especially with my mother. Sorry for such a long post.\n\n\nTL;Dr\n- Mom wants me to perform marriage ceremony to guy in prison\n- I'm questioning her motives and worried for my siblings living with her because of her previous relationships\n\n",

By 2017, it was still working perfectly as I take really good care of my things.\n\nMy parents broke theirs and asked if they could use mine; because I didn’t use it much anymore I said ok. Within a few months, the screen was cellotaped to the keyboard in order to keep it working, the keys were incredibly dirty and the trackpad was.. sticky?\n\nNeedless to say, they broke it around December last year. My dad lifts it by the screen off the floor, tables etc so it’s no wonder. They asked if they could use my new laptop I got for school in August, so I said ok.\n\nI went to use it there and the thing is a shitheap. The screen is all dirty, keyboard is sticky/dirty, and it took 5 minutes + to log into my account.\n\nMy dad (Gen X parent) watches those free football streams online that he used to find off a subreddit, and everytime he watches one we get notifications like “Norton AntiVirus found (insert dodgy name here) web attack”. It’s slowed the whole computer down to barely useable.\n\nI had a go at them, asking to take better care before it ends up in the bin like the last one, and my dad told me I was just picking a fight over nothing, and he’ll stop lifting it by the screen.\n\nAITA or should I just let this go?",

      "title": "AITA for kicking out a couple who brought their baby and toddler to my wedding because I wanted a child-free event?",
      "description": "This couple I’m not very close with but the wife is a long-time family friend so I felt that I should invite her. To be clear, all of my invitations stated that there were to be no children at this wedding. But she and her husband showed up with their infant and toddler (who I think is like 3-4). \n\nAt the actual wedding ceremony, I let it slide. I was preoccupied for obvious reasons. I also thought that maybe they planned not to attend the reception or to have someone pick the kids up before it started. (My niece, who was our flower girl, and a few other kids who had to be at the wedding for one reason or another we’re getting picked up/dropped off after the ceremony ended). \n\nAnyway the reception rolls around (I’m fast forwarding through irrelevant details about the wedding but it was beautiful and everything went as smoothly as could be expected). The couple comes and, lo and behold, they still have their children.\n\nI had many other guests and didn’t really feel like dealing with it so I asked our event planner to go over to them and discuss whether someone was picking up the child as the reception (and wedding, frankly!) were not supposed to have children. \n\nI mean, everyone was drinking and loud and rowdy and  a crying child and another little one running around was not part of the plan. (The infant  already had to be taken out once during the wedding ceremony because of fussiness and the toddler was, from what I could see, already appearing cranky). \n\nMy event planner went to talk to the couple. I could tell they were arguing with my event planner though so I went over to help him. I think they thought I came to rescue them because they started going on about how rude my event planner was. I explained that I had actually sent him over to discuss the children. I reiterated that the event was child-free and said that I had stated so clearly on my invitations. \n\nThe wife gave a sort of apology and then assured me that they were capable of minding their own children to make sure they didn’t get in the way of anything. I said that wasn’t really the point. That’s when my now-husband comes over and he and the other woman’s husband begin going back and forth and things got a little heated. \n\nFinally I snapped and said that they just needed to go, which, thankfully they did without much more noise. Still, the whole scene was incredibly embarrassing which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. \n\nI really hate that my wedding day had to be somewhat marred by this incident. According to my mother, everyone was talking about it and I guess enjoying a little dramatic entertainment. \n\nWas I the a-hole for making them leave?\n\n**Edit 1: Wow um this kind of blew up out of nowhere. Thank you all so much for the feedback. What I’ve gotten from this is that most people think that the couple was rude. There are also a select few who feel that it’s assholish to have a kid-free wedding at all which is...interesting.**\n\n**By way of an update, I have now learned that a few family members felt that it was inappropriate of me to kick out the couple. (The wife apparently is still angry about getting kicked out and the husband is FALSELY telling people that we threatened to call the cops on them). No one has said anything directly to me though.**\n\n**Anyway the feedback here has helped me not to feel guilty about that and just realize that not everyone has the same ideas about tact and manners.** \n\n**Edit 2: Well apparently this went somewhat viral and has now been in articles on Fox News, DailyMail, and Yahoo News. Many thanks to those in the comments who let me know! I had used a throwaway account to stay anonymous and lowkey, but I guess that’s out the window lol. No point in deleting now, so whoever sees it, sees it 🤷‍♀️ ",

      "description": "Me and my partner have been together for 8 years, and are pretty inseparable, I am the step dad to her little girl, and consider her my own.\n\nWe met at university, she dropped out after about a year and I continued on for a second before also leaving. Her reasons for leaving were pretty much a nervous breakdown caused by some pretty nasty family problems, but that's another story. My reasons were financial.\n\nI have been the sole provider of income for the house, on an income that barely allows us to scrape by. In fact, if anything we have just accumulated a lot of debt (I also inherited some of her debt and worked to pay it off initially)\n\nFor all but 3 months of our relationship I have worked while she stayed at home. She has been seeing a psychologist for years now, and I have been as understanding as possible to try and help her through the things she has been dealing with, offering her all the time in the world to study, or train or do whatever she wanted.\n\nThings came to a head last year when my mum got stage 3 breast cancer, although I'm not proud to admit it, coupled with the stress of everything else, it got the better of me and I had a hard breakdown. My company was great and helped a lot, but ultimately I have had to leave (last week).\n\nToday we have nothing, and a huge pile of debt getting bigger by the day. She told me she had agreed to volunteer at one of our daughters school groups on a regular basis, and I lost it.\n\nI asked why she couldn't do what I was doing, and search for work, stating that I too couldn't cope and yet was fully expected to just get on with it - my work has never been glamorous, and the jobs I am applying for aren't exactly what you would call dream jobs, but she says she can't and that although she is getting better her confidence hasn't returned to a point where she can sell herself enough to get a job.\n\nShe asked for help writing a CV, I told her that although I'd help it had to be her to write it, and to be honest with my own job hunt I have been pre occupied. Today she told me it was my fault as she has been asking me to help her with a CV for a long time, and I lost it. I told her that she had no choice. She had to get a job, that I didnt care if it was a terrible job, but that we have literally £10 to our name and no income, we have reached the point where she doesn't have the choice anymore..\n\nSo she screamed, smashed plates and left the house crying hysterically. I know that for my part, I could have been more proactive in helping her, that is definite, I am also struggling hard at the moment though and keeping it together on a daily basis feels almost impossible.\n\nShould I have pushed her.. Or AITA? I really can't tell anymore, but I love her and if I'm wrong I want to know. I can't bare the thought of her breaking down again.\n\nTLDR; girlfriend and I both suffering mental health issues, I expect her to find work regardless as that's what I have to do to survive ",

      "title": "AITA for trying to ruin her marriage?",
      "description": "So, a little background. Names have been changed for obvious reasons.\n\nI had been dating/living with a guy named John for about 4 years. His sister Jane married her high school sweetheart, David. David was smart, kind and had supported her through multiple career changes, medical problems, and just seemed to be a great dude overall. Jane was a little ditsy, spoiled and selfish, and even John had said privately to me that he thought David could do better. He was very close to his family and so we spent a lot of time together.\n\nWe learned through a mutual friend that before they had married, Jane had gotten cold feet and cheated on David with one of her former coworkers. She had broken it off shortly after, claiming that she had just wanted to \"see what it was like\" to be intimate with another man. Fast forward 6 months after the wedding, and she's carrying on a new affair with a new coworker, who also happened to be married. She confided in that same friend that she felt this undeniable attraction to him and that they had discussed leaving their SOs to start fresh.\n\nThis was all very shocking to hear, but I definitely did not want to get involved. I hoped she would put poor David out of his misery soon and just leave him because it was clear to me that she didn't deserve him. However, this carried on for months. Jane played the victim and it seemed to me that her family was completely enabling her behavior. Their parents just wanted Jane to be happy with seemingly no regard for their son-in-law. Jane's best friend it turned out, had encouraged her to cheat because \"you'll always be curious at what could've been\".  At one point, it seemed like everyone but David knew that she was cheating on him. She claimed that she tried to tell David, but he never wanted to talk. From my perspective, at every family dinner I went to with them, it seemed like David would always try to joke around a little and lighten the obvious tension, but she would cross her arms and roll her eyes and make things uncomfortable for everyone. \n\nWhile this was all happening, it started to create some tension in me and John's relationship. John and I had been together a long time and I felt like I could trust him to appreciate my honesty on the matter. I told him that I felt his sister was being a really shitty human being and that David deserved better. She still hadn't decided if she wanted to work things out with David or if she wanted to leave him for the new guy. I thought that David deserved the truth and if at that point he decided to stay and work things out, then so be it. I tried to push John to talk some sense into his sister, but he didn't want the confrontation. John felt I was too opinionated on the matter and that it was none of my business. I tried to convey to him that I saw a parallel between me and David and I was scared that if I was to one day marry into this family, they would turn a blind eye to poor behavior by Jane and John, and David and I would always be treated like outsiders. I admitted that I was frustrated to the point that I wished I could just call David up and spill the beans. I didn't because I knew that it would be the end of me and John if I had. I just tried to avoid the subject whenever possible, and I also started to avoid seeing his family when I could.\n\nFast forward another 6 months and it appeared that Jane and David were working things out. Jane had never come clean about the affair, but she was now pregnant with (probably) David's baby. John and I were on the rocks, and it culminated in a fight where I expressed I could never trust or respect his family for how they'd behaved. John would always make excuses for them or just not want to talk about it. Culturally, as the child, it would be his responsibility to take care of his parents as they aged. We had shared finances, and as the primary breadwinner in our relationship, I began to dread this part of my future if I stayed with John. I ended it with John, and almost immediately called David to tell him what I knew. \n\nDavid did not take the news well. Apparently he had heard all these \"rumors\" before and had confronted Jane about them. Jane denied them and he believed her. He seemed insulted that I would dare make these crazy accusations about his beloved wife. I told John what I'd done, and he also went into damage control mode. He called David and told him not to believe anything I'd said and that I was angry because we had just broken up. \n\nFast forward another 6 months, John and I are in contact now (as friends), but he has stated that he can never forgive me for betraying his trust and telling David. He told me his entire family hates me for trying to ruin Jane and David's relationship. They thought I had no business interfering, particularly because Jane was pregnant with his baby. AITA?",

I told them that I would try to get off work that day but there was no guarantee. I tried to get anyone to cover my shift, but no one could, not even my boss. I told them the day before that I couldn't come. Ever since then they have been very angry with me, and will be taking my truck tonight. This will disable me from working my two jobs. So, AITA for not wanting to skip my job and help my parents?\n\nBackground: I'm a 21 year old college student who works two jobs doing around 50-55 hours a week every day with hardly any day/time off. I live with my friends in an apartment. Parents also work all the time, and have little free time.\n\nBackground 2: I wanted to take this semester off, to save money and work on myself and come back in the summer semester. Parents blackmailed me into going to school by threatening to take my vehicle. It's still under their name for insurance purposes even though I payed them fairly for it 5 years ago. I have to pay the school for the classes I'm taking. My parents disagree with my lifestyle (they don't like my girlfriend or liberal mindset) and are trying their best to control me and keep me in college. I want to learn and graduate soon, I just needed to save more money to keep going. Now I'm working too much to even focus on classes I'm paying for this semester.",

Recently the car wash has been breaking down alot. Before on storm days or or when it was a quick fix id come in one of my days off to make up the hours, which are Monday and Tuesday. Sometimes id just come in and clean it up or help coworkes detail cars the same day. \n\nLast weekend it was broke down all weekend. Theres noone else there on the weekends so I can't go in. Then monday they asked me if i was coming in, i said no. Ended up going to watch the guy finally fix the wash as noone else was there from 5-9. That was fine. Didn't complain.\n\nThen today they texted me again and asked if i was coming in. I said no my shifts are Wednesday-Sunday. Im sick of ending up working a bunch of days in a row because the car wash keeps breaking down. I understand I lose out on money but thats not a big concern to me. They tried to claim I was \"in\" today. Almost as if it is expected of me now. I told them its not my fault the car wash broke down and these are my scheduled days off.\n\nNo one else is held to these standars. Other people miss days and they dont have to go in on their days off. Now i think theyre all pissed off at me because the guy who covers me on Monday and Tuesday had to cover me on....Monday and Tuesday...\n\nThe guy who was telling me im in isnt even one of my bosses. I havent heard from my boss all day i really doubt he cares in the slightest.\n\nAITA??",

      "description": "I was diagnosed with Aspergers (or Autism 1 as it’s now called I believe) at the age of 7. For those of you who don’t know, Aspergers is on the higher functioning end of the autism spectrum, and someone with it normally exhibits anti social tendencies, angry behaviour, sometimes higher intelligence, a tendency to become obsessed with certain things, etc. \n\nSo as a young kid I was hard to deal with, admittedly. My behaviour was unacceptable, but no one was helping me. When I was a kid, they didn’t really have any emotional support classes, they would just throw kids like me into special ed classes. So while I was learning multiplication the other kids in the class were learning the months of the year through song. When I would have an outburst the only thing they were trained to do was yell and send me to the principal.\n\nNow my parents got divorced when I was 8 and I lived with my mom until I was 11 when she sent me to live with him again. \n\nWhenever I would have an outburst, act a way he didn’t like, etc he would scream. Like I was the scum of the earth. He would threaten me. He didn’t put his hands on me (if you don’t count pushing) until I was 14 when he hit me. He took my mom to court for emergency custody because she asked for child support. He looked me in the eyes and told me he didn’t want me. He lied to his side of the family about what happened when he hit me (conveniently leaving out the part where he hit me) to make me look like the asshole. He would get sick of me talking about things I liked and would scream at me for watching things like Doctor Who because I “watched it too much” or “mention the ninja turtles one more time and you’re grounded” We went to therapy weekly, and when my brother and I would complain about they way they treated us “I can’t tell them anything unless you’re a danger to yourself of others” “let me get mom and dad in here before you go” then she’d tell them everything we said and we’d get screamed at so we ended up just having to keep our mouth shut which negates the reason for therapy. Off subject, he also came downstairs and pointed his semi automatic with laser sight at me and my brother as a joke, we had no idea it wasn’t loaded. It was a legit fear that we would go downstairs for a drink one night, he’d think we’re an intruder and he’d shoot us. Anyway\n\n\nHe didn’t know how to handle my disorder, but he had almost 10 years to do so. Go on google. \nDo some research. Realize your army training doesn’t work with someone like me. Realize I’m not normal. \n\nTL;DR - Dad treated me like garbage for not being “normal” and lied to family about things he did to get them on his side. ",

He knows how I feel about tattoos but wants them anyways.\n\nHere’s the kicker:\nI have absolutely no problem with him getting a tattoo. It is his body and he can do whatever he wants with it, and if it means getting a tattoo, go for it. And one day he asked me, “Would you be less attracted to me if I had [insert tattoo here]” and I answered truthfully, and said yes.\n\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for being completely honest with my boyfriend by telling him I’d be less attracted to him for getting a tattoo but being completely okay with him still getting one?",

      "description": "Basically, my boyfriend and me have a policy of not getting too friendly with members of the opposite sex. Throughout the course of our relationship I've cut off all ties with my male friends so that my boyfriend wouldn't feel threatened about losing me to someone. I mostly agree with such an arrangement, since life is all about trade-offs: by giving up some not-so-important relationships, I in turn receive unconditional attention and care whenever I need it. \n\nHowever, today things have gotten a little too messed up for me. A guy from my course messaged me asking me to help him grasp a certain university subject (I had already helped his female friend with that). Without giving it too much thought, I agreed - he had never been even close to flirty with me and I never saw him as a romantic interest. Then my boyfriend found out about this and flipped out, so I invited the aforementioned female to come study with me and the guy as well, so that this would seem less personal and threatening to my special other. \n\nMy boyfriend is still being really cold with me, I've been feeling anxious to the point where I cannot concentrate on anything the entire day, I've tried explaining things to my man, he won't listen, is his annoyance justified? Am I the villain here? Please help. ",

      "description": "Ok so I’m staying over at my best friends house over the weekend. As I’ve done so many times but Ive never had a car, And I just recently got my very own one. And he doesn’t want to do anything, and it’s killing me. I came here to spend a good time with him and go out and eat explore and have fun.but all he wants to do is stay at home and play video games (which we do all most everydayfor hours). Every time I tell him does he want to go out anywhere, or any distance he says no. I have to beg him to do anything, I have offered to let him drive and he still just wants to stay at home. I offer to pay for everything and all I want is him to just tag along. But a couple hours ago we got into a little argument, I asked him does he want to go a mountain peek that I’ve been begging him to go for a while now, and he said no I’m too tired. I was so angry at him for not even acknowledging what I want to do or how I feel, so that’s exactly what I told him. I told him how he is selfish and never cares what I think. Even though I drove 3 hours just to hang out with him and see him. I dont feel like I’m asking for much, just a little bit of effort like he wants to actually hang out instead of sitting on his fat ass all day. ",

During the workshop, we worked on fun stuff with the left side pass. One of my friends kept turning to his right side, so I told him \"LEFT SIDE PASS. LEFT SIDE PASS.\" After that he did it correctly. Another friend of mine said it comes off as rude; my friend whom I corrected didn't find it rude, though. Some people in the workshop also had zero idea of what they were doing. I asked them if they were beginners. The same friend who said \"LEFT SIDE PASS\" comes off as rude said that asking people if they're beginners comes off as condescending; I had only intended to ask a question; I wasn't trying to be condescending. AITA? Or is my friend just sensitive and uptight?",
