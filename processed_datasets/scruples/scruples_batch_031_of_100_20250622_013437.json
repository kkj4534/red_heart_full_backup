      "description": "    The titles a little confusing. So me and my boyfriend had this date at the movies planned, which I was really looking forward to since we never go on dates. He comes around around 5:00 and the movie starts at 8:00 so he lays on the couch and we’re just watching the TV. \n     It’s at this point where he falls asleep. I had just gotten home from a 7-4 shift at the hospital and all he had done all day up to this point is sleep. It’s around 6:00 when I try to wake him up, and he refuses to move. He says he’s not going anymore. I continue to try for the next 20 minutes to get him to move and he refuses to move or talk to me. \n     I still live with my mom and my brothers, so I asked my brother if he wanted to go, so I just left my boyfriend there sleeping and went to the movies with my little brother who loves the Marvel movies anyways. \n    My mom ended up coming home and kicking him out, but now he’s pissed. I’m just wondering... am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I should preface this by saying that I’m an extremely over cautious driver.   I was in a very bad car accident in college that left me very injured and since then I’m a pretty antsy driver and passenger.   That guy who is pissing you off by going too slow, that’s me sorry.  \n\nMy gf on the other hand is a more carefree driver.   To the point that now if it can be avoided at all costs I will not be her passenger.  There have been times when driving where she will just grab her phone and start going through her texts.  One time she actually started going into the next lane just to try to bring up a video to show me of her nephew.  She’s been in multiple accidents over the years, but her side of each of them is that is wasn’t her fault.  I’m not trying to beat up on her, but just from my experience with her I do not trust her to drive my car.  \n\nI’m off work this week.  She doesn’t currently have a car.  I usually drop her off in the early mornings then make my way to work.  I really don’t want to have to wake up early on my week off and I also don’t want her to drive my car.   She was surprised when I told her I didn’t want her to use it.  I explained that it’s because of her reckless driving(an argument we had in the past) and she rolled her eyes as she usually does when I complain about it.  When she asked me what she was supposed to do I suggested Uber.  I genuinely thought that was reasonable, but now she’s angry with me. ",

I had an event last night where he was going to meet all of my friends and it had been planned at least 10 days in advance. \n\nSo yesterday comes and he texts me right before it’s supposed to start telling me he has to leave early because he has school work. I told him that if he had to do work, he should just stay home because it wasn’t really a thing where he could easily leave early. I wasn’t angry or combative in any way, I just let him know that it wasn’t going to be possible to just sneak away. He says that he can put his work off and just stay until the end. \n\nWhen he arrives, he tells me that he now has a group project to do at 10pm. I told him that I didn’t believe him; it was too convenient that he tried to get out of staying and suddenly had this project. He doubled down and told me he didn’t appreciate being called a liar, so I ended things. He’s now telling me that I was a waste of his time and that I’m punishing him for doing nothing wrong. \n\nAITA for ending things with this dude?",

      "description": "TL;DR: AITA for pressing the issue to my friend's in-the-closet cousin about how I need to at some point tell my friend that we were involved?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (M, mid 20's) am friends with this girl (My age) I've gotten closer with over the past couple of years.  I pretty much joined her friend group so we're super integrated into each other's lives and she's pretty much my best friend.  I don't keep secrets from her and trust is a huge deal to her in general (She's currently in a long-term argument with her boyfriend because of a lie of omission related to him hanging out with an ex or something).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis girl has a guy cousin (Early 20's)  from out of town who sometimes visits and comes to our parties so over the last few years I've met him a handful of times and we've had some group interactions.  I've always pegged him as gay/bi and his sexuality is a semi-frequent topic of conversation among our group because he's very attractive but also very shy.  I've talked about having a crush on him with my girl-friend but it was always mostly jest because it seemed so impossible for anything to happen there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways my work started making me travel and I ended up in the town where the cousin lives and he hit me up on Grindr.  We hooked up and started talking and hanging out a bit and he made me promise not to tell anyone back home.  He took me to a gay bar for my first time with his friends and so I got the general impression that he was out to everyone except his family and my friends.  I continued playing dumb in conversations with my friend and brought the topic up less and less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings ended on a meh note (He kissed me secretly on New Year's, then told me he just wanted to be friends and apologized for \"mixed signals\".  Later that week I ended up having dinner with him, my friend, and my friend's mom which was just greeeeeeeeeeeat) and the next time after I was in his town after that I asked him if we could meet and talk. He's flakey and non committal so we talked over text. I told him  I have hated lying by omission to my friend, but it's definitely less important than allowing the cousin to come out in his own way.  I asked him if he could let me know when he comes out, because I would have to have my own conversation with my friend and smooth things over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis did not go well.  He reacted super badly. Some things he said were along the lines of \"Why is this such a big deal? Why do you feel the need to tell her at all just pretend it never happened.\" and \"There's no way she would react badly so why even worry about it.\"  I told him he was only thinking of himself, and he responded that he \"always thought of others\" and this is where I kind of lost my cool.  During our 4 month involvement he had been really really callous and emotionally manipulative to me and I took this chance to say so and point out that he was once again not giving any fucks about me in this situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim: \"I don't ever want to see you again.  I don't ever want to talk to you again\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI later learned through the gayvine that he's \"out\" where he lives in that everyone knows he's gay, and he has gay friends but he doesn't officially live as a gay man outside of nightlife and metrosexual activities.  Essentially if a stranger on the street asked him he would not say he was gay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've talked to a few friends about lies of omission and gotten varying responses about if telling my friend about her cousin and I's involvement was something worth having this argument over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJudge me, and let me know if you need more information.",

      "description": "So a bit of background information I am the fifth of five kids and my brother's (the eldest and second eldest) got a dog when I was 5 months old. I loved that dog ever since I can remember he was my best friend when I was younger but as I got older I did my own thing with friends and all that. My brother's now older don't take the dogs for walks as much as he needs and everyone blamed me for it as if when I was five months I told everyone I would share the responsibility. But recently I got myself a kitten that helps with my mental health (you know what I mean) and everyone in my family still blames me for not looking after the dog when they all say I can not look after the kitten properly this infuriates me like I said I wanted the dog. So Reddit AITA for not taking the dog for walks and such even though I didn't ask for him.\n\nSorry If this had poor formatting this is my first post and I'm on Mobile",

      "description": "In this story, my sister will be K, and my boyfriend will be D. Sorry if my post is weird, it's my first time.\n\nSo, me (F16) and my sister (F20)  are extremely close. I'm her favorite person, and practically her best friend/daughter/little sister. I also love her a lot, but there's just one problem. She hates my relationship. I love my boyfriend (M17) very much, and we both see a future with each other. The plan was for me, K, and D to all live together. At first I thought it was a great idea. But as I get further along in my relationship, I'm noticing that she seems to not like the fact that me and D are dating.\n\nFor example, just today D made me a little origami heart, and I wanted to tape it to my wall. K did not like this, and said things like \"now I'll have to look at it\" and \"your brother doesn't put things that his girlfriends give to him on his wall.\" Note that me and her have to share a room. I was honestly pretty offended and a bit hurt. I told D about it because I needed to rant. He also thinks she's being ridiculous, especially for a 20 yr old. She's done things like this in the past too.\n\nI'm now starting to think that the 3 of us living together wouldn't be a good idea. If she can't handle an origami heart, how is she going to handle me and D interacting in general?\n\nHowever, I have no idea how I'd break it to her. She's a big people person, but is also pretty awkward, and doesn't make many friends. She'd be devastated if she had to live alone, and I'd feel really bad. And I know it might also sound stupid that I'm considering choosing my highschool boyfriend over my own sister. But, although I've known D for 7 months, and have been dating for 4, I feel really close and safe with him, and he's already helping me be a better person. I love him, and I refuse to let him go because of my immature sister.\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to live with K in the future anymore?",

Anytime people were nice to me as a kid they usually had an ulterior motive, like they wanted something I had or they were setting me up for some cruel prank. \n\n\nI'm also still dealing with some trauma from an ex-girlfriend who liked to tell me all the time how much she loved me, but would turn around and beat the shit out of me if I did something she didn't like.\n\n\nCut to this summer, I met someone that was oddly nice and very friendly, constantly checking on me and inviting me places. I was immediately suspicious and told her that, I just don't do well with people who are so nice so soon. She assured me that she \"loved\" me and that I was the \"best friend\" she had ever had. Occasionally she would ignore me and it turned out it was because she thought I was mad at her and she was feeling insecure about our friendship. Everytime I would go out of my way to reassure her that I enjoyed her friendship and I wasn't mad.\n\n\nRecently she's started dating someone, which she didn't mention to me, her old roommate told me about it. Since then it was like pulling teeth trying to get her to even text me back, which I figured is weird but she's busy and newly involved so whatever. \n\n\nI'm a struggling alcoholic, which I told her, and I had a relapse. I know I can be just awful when I drink and I know I texted her a few times when I was drinking, but I don't know what I said. There was definitely distance between us and I felt like it was my fault, so I threw out all my liquor and apologized to her.\n\n\nI thought we were back on track with our friendship, she started coming into where I work and she would give me hugs and talk to me again. \n\n\nA few weeks ago I invited her to a pumpkin carving bonfire, on a day I knew she was free, and she told me to remind her closer to the day. There was another party that same day that I wasn't invited to and that she told me she wasn't invited to either. A couple of days before the bonfire I texted her asking if I should get a pumpkin for her, no response. Day of the bonfire I texted her letting her know when people were set to arrive, she texted me several hours later to tell me she wasn't coming. I found out a few days later that she had actually gone to the party she told me she wasn't invited to.\n\n\nThat hurt. So I sent her an admittedly long text about how her friendship left me feeling kind of shitty and if she didn't want to be friends with me that's fine but it wasn't fair to me to tell me that she \"loved\" me when her actions say the opposite. She responded with \"jfc Apple. I don't have to text you everyday to prove we are friends. I have friends that I go months between texting and they know I'm still their friend.\"\n\n\nAfter that I deleted all our texts and her number, but I still brought her a souvenir from a trip I took for my birthday. She didn't wish me a Happy Birthday but I figured it would help smooth things over and we could try to talk about our friendship. She never texted me, not even to thank me for the gift.\n\n\nA few days ago I saw her sitting with her douchebag of an ex boyfriend, and even though we aren't talking I was concerned so I had one of our mutual friends ask her if she was okay. She responded by saying that I could just text her because she's not mad at me if I'm not mad at her. I still haven't texted her. Our mutual friend has known her for years and told me that this chick will not text me first. I kind of just want her to acknowledge that she hasn't been a good friend to me. \n\n\nAll my other friends are telling me to drop her like a bad habit, but when we were first starting our friendship she told me she usually ends up pushing \"good\" people away and keeping only toxic ones in her life. So I knew this was a possibility but it still hurts. Plus I'm not blameless in the distance we have, I drunk texted her and I was constantly asking if she still enjoyed our friendship, which was probably really annoying. \n\n\nI feel like I'm an asshole for not stepping up and fixing things between us. I actually have a text ready to send to her but I can't bring myself to send it.",

When we started having sex I had several problems (my dick wouldn't get hard basically). \n\nWe live kinda far from each other and have little time to spend toghether, so the first days when we met at my place for like two nights we would try sex at least twice a day. \n\nNow, its been almost two months since the last time we had sex, because she always says she's tired or she's not in the mood, but she masturbates like 4 times a week when she's alone. \n\nYesterday I complained about this and she got mad and I ended up apologizing.

      "description": "AITA for wanting a good partner?\n\n\nMy current gf(22) is horrible at sex. I (24)was her first when we started dating over 3 years ago. Since she was new to the whole thing I knew there would be a transition phase. But what I didn't know was that she wouldn't be willing to put in the effort. \n\nShe isn't willing to watch porn. She doesnt like the idea of it? That would be fine but she isn't willing to even attempt to research positions and such to try to improve. She has gained weight and isn't really interested in working out, whether to be more fit or for relevant muscles. \n\nEvery time we have sex I have to do all the work. She gets tired on top after ~20 seconds and then wants to switch. She has actively gotten worse over time, since she was having a bit of improvement a little over a year ago.\n\nMaybe tmi here but last time she did oral she tore the frenulum.(skin that joins the foreskin and head. It has happened before, but I feel like it shouldn't after 3 years of a relationship. It's to the point where I prefer to just whack it and go to bed.\n\nI have talked to her about this multiple times through the years, and every time she acts as though I should be the grand master and showed her the \"correct\" way. I hit adequate pretty consistently but I know I'm no sex guru. I've tried my best to help her but she doesn't receive instruction very well.\n\nI don't want to cheat but I can't help but feel sexually starved for the past long while. I haven't cheated and have no plans to, but I want to have a good partner. \n\nAITA for wanting her to excercise/workout  and overall put effort into becoming good/better at sex?\n\nPs. We don't argue needlessly and are a good couple otherwise. This is 1 of the top few issues we have.\n\n",

      "description": "I call him digs short for disgusting, you'll know why later on. So this 20 years old college student still act like a middle schooler for 5 years. It was also nice and smooth when he first moved here in our condo by recommendation of my parents (her mom and mine are sisters). He showed his true self little by little, he rarely cleans the unit, and the more importantly the rest room. I clean the always since I don't want the unit to look dirty for unexpected visitor. This may look childish but he has been staying for 5 years and he still acts like a fucking visitor! He smells like dried sweat mixed in garbage everytime he comes home. His bedsheets, blankets smell like dried molds and sweat and you would notice molds growing when you remove the sheets, his towel smells like shit as well after a few uses idk why. The only reason why we haven't kicked him out bec he's a relative and my mom doesn't want to start a drama in our family so I just let my cousin be. What really triggered me is he stills from my wallet and he thinks that I don't notice what he's doing, there was one time I left $55 on my wallet just to be sure I didn't lose count and the next morning the $5 was gone!! So I confronted him about it and he totally denied it but it already happened on different occasions, I also told my parents about it  and they told me to let him off since we'll be moving soon and they won't care where he lives I have not spoke to him nor he does to me since the wallet incident and he can't hide his guilt for stealing, he can't look me in the eyes, he gets out of the way whenever we bumped into each other and looks down like stupid shit. Since I can't do anything more to make digs move out. I've slowed down his internet connection on our WiFi for a guaranteed speed of 80kb/s and a Max of 120kb/s. Where he can still refresh his FB feed but can't play videos (he'll need to wait for a couple of minutes for a 2-3 second buff), 4G is also not reliable and super slow since we're surrounded by towers making his laptop a useless piece of junk since he only uses it for online gaming, he eventually gave it to his father since he can't use it for gaming anymore. I was so happy about but still pissed and angry that he still lives here. I can't wait for the contract to end so I can move to different unit and he'll be on his own or have him tire the fuck out for staying here find a damn place where he can let his germ family live\n\nFor the record, he went home last night after being gone ALL DAY and guess what he did? He only washed his ass and went back to sleep without taking a shower. what a fucking guy. He deserves to be named digs the disgusting.\n\n*English is not my first language and I'm not that good at it either so forgive me if there are errors).\n\nTLDR: my cousin digs is an irresponsible and disgusting person so I don't talk to him nor help him anymore and I made his internet connection super slow so he can't sit here all day not doing anything.",

I've not said anything to her about it for a year, as I was scared i would be being rude, but recently i did.\n\nI said to her, '-*name*\\-, could you please stop talking to yourself, you can talk in your head it is just like listening to two songs a once, you know?' then she looked at me confused and left. The next time i saw her, she didn't talk to me, then her mother came up to me and asked me to stop teasing her.\n\nShe came up to me, and we played a board game with my friend and she started to do it again. When she went to the bathroom, my friend asked me why she was doing it, and I said it was one of her little quirks. She asked if i could ask her to stop, and i said i would as it was annoying me too. When she came back I said '-*name-,* could you please try not to talk to yourself, me and -*friend*\\- find it quite annoying. Then she started the cry, so her mother took her home.\n\nAm I the asshole for saying something that made her upset before?",

We went up to the seats and stood there for a bit, thinking maybe these ladies were just talking to their friends and they'd go back to their original seats afterwards.. but after an awkward while it became clear that they'd just moved and stolen our chairs while we were outside. They were ignoring us while we were standing there looking at them, so I went up to them and said \"Hey, are you guys going back to your seats soon? The show's about to start.\" to which they replied \"...what\". So told them they were sitting in our seats and they got annoyed and go \"Oh... ok then, fine.\" and move a couple chairs down.\n\nIt was such a weird situation! I'm thinking.. who does that?? Why can't everyone just do the right thing and stay in their chairs and we can all just avoid all this awkwardness and confrontation?? I felt annoyed at them for pulling a sneaky and doing that, but then again the seating was unassigned so technically they weren't our seats to keep anyway?? I'm so confused.

      "description": "I am on mobile so I'm sorry for any formatting issues.\n\nMe and my husband went on a short spring break trip to visit his sister who lives an 8 hour drive from us. \n\nOn the course of this trip we went to a Ramen and Poke Bowl restaurant.\n\nMy sister had recently discovered it and I wanted to try it. We all enjoyed our meals. \n\nThe next day she discovered they had charged her extra tip. Her meal was about $10, she left about a $3 tip. They had charged her more than $20. \n\nIn the restaurant they had given our table, consisting of 3 parties, each their own \"checkbook.\" A little black book for your ticket and your credit card. I am not sure of the proper name. There is very little chance the waitress made a mistake. \n\nWhen I leave credit/debit card tips, they usually dont post until the next business day. This waitress ran it immediately. That seems fishy to me. \n\nWhen my sister discovered the error, she freaked. She double checked her receipt and started ranting about punching them and yelling at them and never tipping servers at their business again. She was insisting the waitress stole from her. \n\nOn my way home I left a Google review, as I usually do. The owner of this business replied to my review. I guess it upset them because they mentioned it to my sister and I think that they have asked her to take it down. \n\nThis is the gist of my original review, which I edited after they gave her money back: \n\nDouble check your receipts if you leave a tip on your credit card! Whoever is running the receipts here is stealing. My sister realized they had done this to her and is going back to fix it. Very untrustworthy business! \n\nMy edited review: \n\nDouble check your receipts if you leave a tip on your credit card! Whoever is running the receipts here is either stealing or making mistakes. The manager corrected the mistake for my sister, but be wary! \n\n\nThat night after my sister got home, she starts texting me about my review saying \"they helped me, you can take it down.\" I replied, \"ok good, I'll edit it.\"\n\nAn hour goes by, she berates me about how my review is still there. She hasnt replied in 24 hrs. I think she is mad at me. \n\nAm I the asshole for not taking my review down because it upsets my sister? \n\n",

      "description": "In my D&amp;D group's most recent session, the party fulfilled one of the party member's campaign goals by taking control of a castle that was previously held by bandits.\n\nOver the course of the almost five hour session, our five person party fought our way through the castle while uncovering secret passageways, falling into traps, and getting the shit beaten out of us by bandits--you know, typical D&amp;D stuff--but the whole time the other  party member kept referring to the castle as \"her castle\" and instantly laying claim to the tens of thousands of gold worth of coins and items inside.\n\nRelatively early on, I noted that I really liked one of the rooms in the castle, and when I was told that it was going to be her room, I told her that she would have to make some concessions (not just to me but the whole party) because this was a group project. I bring up the fact that restoring and maintaining the castle will be expensive and that pretty bluntly say that my character, who at the time had way more money than the others wouldn't be particularly interested in helping fund the other character's project if he didn't get anything from it. Not only was loot collection heavily constrained, but it was pretty strongly implied that my character and the other male party member wouldn't even get to live in the castle that we all helped take. As far as I can tell, I was the only one who was unhappy about this arrangement. \n\nAs you can imagine, I was a bit miffed by all this and between the lack of loot and an extremely prolonged series of horrible attack rolls, my attitude was noticeably sour by the end of the session, but I never considered the idea that I might be the asshole until I was called out before the other player's vistory speech. The other player told me that she still intends to assist my character in his goal but that she didn't appreciate me threatening hers.\n\nI suppose I could make excuses about how withholding funding is absolutely something my character would do or about how little my fiscal contributions would have mattered in the end (like I said, we found upward of 15,000gp worth of coins and items in the castle), but I'm not interested in using in-game reasons to justify this primarily out of game conflict. In the end it boils down to the fact that I was dissatisfied with how the other player was handling the mission and clearly stated my interest in taking action that would hinder her. \n\nAm I the asshole? And, if so, how do I go about making things right?\n\n",

      "description": "Mom died recently, leaving behind my half-brother, my niece, and me. Mom was in poor health for the past two years. My brother has lived on her place rent-free for 20 years. Mom paid all his expenses for at least the last few years (he lost his job). His social security checks begin this spring, but they will be a modest $1,200 monthly.  \n\n\nMom's always been high-strung and high-maintenance. I loved her, but she made me crazy. So I told my brother he could have her land and mobile home if he would just take (better) care of her. I don't live nearby and still work 12-hour shifts. Well, he didn't take good care of her. At one point, I had to drive her to the emergency room because we couldn't get him on the phone. There were several other instances of him not caring for her, and not looking out for her like an unemployed son with absolutely nothing else to do should have been doing. I'm not saying I was any better as an absentee daughter, but we went on outings occasionally, and I definitely wasn't any worse as her daughter than he was as her son.   \n\n\nHer will leaves her estate to me and my brother, 50/50. I was named independent executrix. I knew mom had a life insurance split between me and brother, and also knew she had two CD's, one for each of us. As it turns out, she has three CD's for $5,000, supposedly one each for me, my brother, and my niece. That's their understanding, at least.  \n\n\nAITA for keeping her cash assets, including the CD's. After the smoke clears and I pay for everything I said I would, it might be $25,000. Her home and land, otoh, are worth at least $68,000, with a fair market value of about $80-90,000.  \n\n\nWe went to probate hearing then had it out afterwards. They are very unhappy that I won't just turn over $10,000 to the two of them, even though I will only have about 25k, while they will have a minimum of 68k. My niece had shot a warning volley across the bow a few weeks ago when she said, \"Surely you realize property is not as valuable as cash. Besides, granny meant for me to have that money, and daddy to have \"his\" CD. (The CD's do not list any beneficiaries).  \n\n\nSo, AITA? And if they already think that I AM the asshole, shouldn't I just go ahead and make arrangements to sell the home and land so we can each get what we really think we should have out of mom's estate, 50% to me and my brother, $5,000 to my niece?",

She really doesn’t seem to feel that way, despite showing signs of it all throughout the 8 or so months that we have known each other.\n\nIt’s been stressful, and there’s a lot of stuff I can’t go into because it would become a novel, but I also learned she did some things that violated my morals and so I feel that this was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I’m done\n\nI stopped talking with her at school, and over text. I respond with short answers and she seems kind of worried. I feel awful, but inside I think I did the right thing for ME.\n\nHowever, she didn’t seem to think so because she texted me and asked me what the problem was with me. I said, “It pains me to say this because we used to be such good friends, but I’m not sure that I want that anymore. I’m done.

      "description": "I know \"L\" for about 10 years now, maybe even more. She always had low self-stem issues, abandoned school and got a shitty job and she still lives with her mother while being 38. I tried being supportive during out entire friendship, I even got her a job as a maid working for my family when she was unemployed. Well, it all changed last year.\n\nYou see, she was getting quite desperate in the relationship department. She is quite obese and never got a boyfriend in her life, she decided to join one of those programs that let you exchange letters with prisoners and she fell in love with a guy currently serving 20 years in super-max for killing a dude (allegedly in self-defense). At first I didn't mind much, after all we all deserve a second chance but a few months after they started \"dating\" things got really strange really fast.\n\nFirst, they got married inside prison after only 3 months on this \"long-distance relationship\", them he made her get a tattoo of her name on her arm, a few weeks after that he made her end all her social-media accounts (Facebook and whatssapp) . Slowly he prohibited her from having male friends (I was the exception since I knew her for years and I got her the job she currently has) and recently I had the final straw.\n\nSomehow her boyfriend got quite rich inside bars, or is there something she is not telling me. He transferred money from his account to her letting she get a new iPhone 10 or X or whatever its called nowadays and said that she was only allowed to use her cellphone to call him and not anyone else (even her mother), hell she had to buy a \"secret\" second cellphone to be able to call her mother and sisters. One day, my mother (which L works for) tried calling L 50 times, my mother and I didnt knew about this secret phone, in our minds whenever we called L she would answer with her phone. I went to my mothers house to check on L (she was alone inside and thus my mother was trying to call her), L told me about the two cellphones and how she forgot her \"secret\" phone at home and only brought the iPhone and them she refused to call my mother (her boss) on the iPhone saying \"I dont even call my own mother with this cellphone and I aint calling yours\".\n\nThis for me was the last straw, I never tried to intervene because Im too afraid that the prisioner would be able to break my legs or some shit like that but I sure did made mean comments about the situation to her over the months (to no avail aparently). I left my moms house frustated without saying a word, told everything to my mother and she fired her as soon as she returned home. I blocked L´s \"secret\" phone number and we are cutting all ties with L´s family, we want nothing to do with her or her \"husband\".\n\nI told this story to my friends and they told me I was being selfish or YTA for not trying to help a friend that I know for over a decade get out of this abusive and dangerous relationship.",

      "title": "AITA For taking a free fridge, and returning it when asked by the police?",
      "description": " \n\nSo today I took in a fridge that was left in dorm commons for over 8  hours. It was empty, totally warm, and had nothing on it to indicate  ownership. Usually people leave things out to give them away for free, usually clothes, canned food, and college textbooks. Sometimes furniture (large objects are removed after 24h if left in public.)  In orientation we're warned to lock our rooms, and never leave things out, because there's no enforcement for lost goods, so you should keep them in your dorm. Every semester there's tons of theft at the beginning of the semester, there are also no cameras at all in the dorms except for the exit and entrance. So imagine my surprise when at 10:00 pm housing and police are going door to door searching for the refrigerator I'd taken.\n\n At 12:30pmish when I got back from lunch it was in that lobby. At  8:30pm I put it in my room. Just before ten people are going door to door  knocking, no one in my hall answered the door except me, so I didn't  know what it was about til they mentioned a fridge. I explained it was  left out, apologize for the confusion and carry it back to the other guy, and even apologize to him in person. He nods, and says not to worry about it at all.  I told my RA if I saw anything left out  that might be valuable I'd ask him to take custody of it, and if he is  able to find out if it was intended to be given away, then I could claim  it. Everyone is happy that the situation is resolved so easily, I feel  bad as I know how it can feel to feel like a victim of a crime. Housing  RA had told me that the guy said he was rearranging his room, and needed  to clear the space up, and that it'd sounded wierd to him too. Director of housing then gives me information about renting a fridge through the campus, cool! \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the police knock on my door again. They then ask me privately if I'm sure it was out that long, as the other student had claimed he put it out at 6pm sharp, and that it was gone when he checked soon after. They stress that it doesn't matter anymore, because I'd returned the item and the other student had left happily, but that it was bothering them. I repeat my version of events and the officer leaves thanking me for my cooperation.  \n\n\n First of all, why'd you wait 3 and a half hours to report it if it disappeared at 6 pm.   Secondly,  Why are the housing reps, and police relaying different stories to me, last it feels like he wanted  the police to feel that  was a malicious theft, based on the short time window.  He then told  the police he it was \"for his buddy\" and indicated he'd  immediately leave the campus with it in his vehicle. I told the police that it at least makes sense  he left it out because he was giving it away, it was on a trolley in a  public walkway right by the elevators for hours. He had just planned to  give it away to someone specific, and left it ready for several hours apparently.\n\nI On the bright side, the guy  was very happy after he got his refrigerator back and dropped the issue  entirely, so there won't be any official repercussions. How would you react in this situation if you were either party?",

It would probably also make a big mess.\n\nBasically my friend (we will call her kate) Kate got cheated on when her best friend (call her Amy) Amy made out with the guy several times and gave him a handy. This lasted for a couple weeks and somehow Kate never found it.\n\nFast forward a month later to now and I feel bad for not telling Kate about it but it would totally break trust with my friend Avery who was the one that told me all this. It would be a huge mess with the friend group because everyone involved is friends with each other. But I hate this guy for doing this to Kate and I think she deserves better than him.\n\nThey have been dating 3 months now and her worst fear is him cheating on her. She has no clue it's already come true. She insisted to me that if something happened she would want to know even though it would make her sad that the guy cheated on her, and sad that it was with her bff Amy. She might even be mad at me for not telling her earlier. Is it best to just not say anything? Or would I be the asshole if I kept quiet any longer?\n\nI'm ^this close to telling her about what he did. But WIBTA? ",

That morning I got woken up by text and calls from my older brother and younger sister freaking out \"mom is dying\" \"get your ass over here\". I rushed to the hospital in damn near tears thinking I wasn't gonna get to see her. \nThey were able to stabilize her and she was sent home a few days later. \n\nLast night I was at work (I work nights) I get a casual text from my brother saying \"mom has been admitted to the ER\". I was bummed out but I didn't think it was a huge issue. She's been admitted plenty times her sugar fluctuates between 300 (her Dr thinks that's normal for her now it's crazy I know) to over 1000. I asked him if I need to leave work and go to the hospital. He replied telling me that he'll let me know and to just \"keep checking up on Mom\". And so I do. I messaged him about an hour later and no reply. I messaged my sister and she's back home taking care of her kids. \n\nI messaged my brother once more \"how is Mom should I head out that way\". You might be asking yourself why I kept asking instead of just going. Well every time my mom gets admitted we take turns spending time in the hospital so she doesn't stay alone. I was waiting till they told me \"I gotta go home and rest come stay with her\". Anyways I go home and go to sleep. I wake up and again ask \"how's Mom\" and instead of getting an answer telling me how she's doing, I get \"aren't you planning on coming?\". I said \"dude I work and don't have a car I've been asking if I should have taken off\". And to that I got \"you said enough\" and then 3 or 4 long messages from my brother telling me how much of a piece of shit I am for not being at the hospital with Mom.  \n\nOh and the reason I brought up that I have work is because I'm not doing great financially and my mom depends on us. Well the second I walked into the hospital room my brother and sister get on my ass about not helping my mom financially enough.\n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\n",

      "title": "Aita for never wanting to have future contact with my girlfriends father?",
      "description": " My girlfriend (we'll call her gf from now on)&amp; I have known eachother since 2001 but we only recently started dating in 2017. We have met a fair amount of eachothers family &amp; friends with the exception of me meeting her dad. I never met him because her parents were divorced &amp; they didn't live together. \nOur relationship is pretty serious &amp; we plan to get married soon enough so things like us getting along with eachothers family &amp; friends really means a great deal to me.\n\n Gf &amp; i haven't been spending alot of time together since i am stationed in ft Stewart Georgia &amp; she lives in New York so you could imagine when she came down to visit her dad who lives outside of Atlanta  (3hrs drive) i was absolutely thrilled to go see her &amp; have the chance to meet her dad who i have never even spoke to before. I thought to my self 1 the rest of her folks love me so he will too .2 he is retired army &amp; i am active army &amp; soldiers love to bond &amp; shit talk. 3 gf is going to be jealous of my bond with her dad. 4 This is going to be awesome .\n\n So i make the trip there walk in the house &amp; gf makes the introductions \" hey daddy this is [insert name here] \" . @ that moment i extend my hand &amp; say \" hi sir its nice to finally meet you\" . He then turns his back to me &amp; ignores me . The entire time he didn't even make eye contact or look at me. I repeated \"sir?\" a little louder with my hand still extended for him to shake &amp; he continued ignoring me. I looked @ gf &amp; she just smirked a little bit while nodding her head in the direction of the living room.  We went to the living room where we waited for her little sister to get ready so we could go out to the mall. Gf acted as if nothing weird had happened with her father a moment ago so i too brushed it off &amp; truthfully i didn't want to ruin my short time with her.\n\n Fast forward to the next day. i check out of my hotel room &amp; go back to gf dads house to spend a few more hours with her before i have to head back to base. The time came for me to leave but gf halted saying \"my dad will be back in A few minutes so just say goodbye to him too\" i thought ok no problem a couple minutes delay wont kill me. He shows up &amp; i say \"hey sir thanks for letting me come by &amp; it was nice to meet you\" holding my hand out for him to shake ,he again ignores me &amp; walks away. Gf again smirks &amp; acts as if nothing weird happened. I shrug it off for the 2nd time so that i can make the most of my time with her as i leave. \n\n I spend the entire drive back &amp; the next day thinking if i did something wrong to this guy. Was it what i wore or something i said or did that made him act that way. I replayed the situations over &amp; over in my head before i had a serious conversation with gf telling her that im not having any further contact with her father &amp; that when we have children hes not meeting them because i dont want him to treat my children that way. I also told her ill never set foot in his house again &amp; he is not welcome @ my house.  I am not going to be disrespected by anyone in that manner. He can do whatever he wants in his house because thats his castle but i am no kin of his &amp; i owe that man nothing so i dont see why he would behave like that.\nHer initial response was a bit confused with a mix of \"thats just how he is\" . I told her that her father is either socially retarded or he is intentional  being disrespectful to me &amp; i highly doubt its the former because he doesn't go through his daily life ignoring people. She eventually understood after a bit more back &amp; forth. Gf spoke to various family members who took my side &amp; spoke to her dad about it. \n\n Fast forward 3 months later &amp; we are in Jamaica for my dads funeral where we meet even more of eachothers family which was pleasant. I meet her aunt (gfs dads sister) &amp; gf rattles off the story of the \"Georgia incident\" in a somewhat comical way to which her aunt responds laughing \" thats is just how he is\" .i laugh too so that i can allow them to enjoy their time together without lecturing them on why that guy is trash because who knows when gf will get the chance to go back to Jamaica &amp; visit her family. I love gf &amp; i love to see her happy so i let it go. All this happened late in 2017\n\nYesterday 2019 gf mentioned something about when our future children visit her dad &amp; i stopped her in her tracks to say \"that will never happen\" .\nGf: you're still hung up on that stuff that happened?\nMe: yea thats kind of a big deal to me\nGf: yea but my folks spoke to him about it and now he knows he is wrong .\nMe: your dad is a grown man he should have known he was wrong before. hes a dick\nGf: yeah but he is trying to be better.\nMe: he had 2 chances to shake my hand . He has already shown me who he is &amp; by what your family says \"thats just how he is\" he is never going to chang or act right. I dont want that around me or my future kids.\nGf: can you at least acknowledge that he is making an effort? \nMe: making an effort to who? Has he reached out &amp; apologized? Did he tell you to pass on a message to me? No? Ok then dont bother calling anyone now to try &amp; convince him to send an apology because its too late now.\n \n So gf is telling me im in the wrong &amp; im being harsh. Over a small situation. \n\nI grew up giving people respect.  I lived in the south all my life where we even refer to small children as sir or maam. I dont sit until im offered a seat . I never shake hands while sitting &amp; the military instilled even more customs and courtesies in me . Her father also being also a military man should understand those basics too. All i wanted was for him to have the decency to shake my hand &amp; return the respect given. I dont expect everyone to be the exact way i am because people are different but i at least expect someone to acknowledge i exist. \n\nSo tell me folks am i the asshole for not changing my stance on this\n\nTL;DR: gfs dad completely ignores me twice never apologized .i tell gf my problem with that . Gf tells her family. Family tells her dad. Dad is trying to change. I tell gf i still dont want any contact with her dad a yearish later because he still hasn't apologized  .gf says i am now the asshole. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n",

      "description": "Ok so for starters, I was never interested in this guy, but he was interested in me. I figured that he and I have good friendship chemistry, so I won’t simply discount him just because he seems to like me, and I planned to be upfront with the fact that I wasn’t interested in a relationship if he ever brought it up. \n\nOne day he asks me to get dinner (in my school’s dining hall, so it wasn’t a date), and I was nervous because it’s one on one, and as someone who has some pretty serious trauma from sexual abuse, that can be jarring. However, I felt guilty/afraid to say no, so I met up with him. \n\nWe got food and things were pretty cool. Our personalities meshed well, but he definitely mistook my kindness for me flirting with him. It was especially present when he talked about how he was insecure about having a neck beard that grows if he doesn’t shave it every second and I mentioned to him that he looks fine regardless. My mission on this planet is to lift people up, and he was clearly feeling insecure, and I recognized that since he clearly liked me, my opinion held merit. This is why I decided to try to promote the fact that it doesn’t matter how he looks, rather than just saying that one of his features looked good. But he like, REALLY, took it the wrong way.  He started doing that goofy smile guys do when they are head over heels. \n\nI am generally a very bubbly and positive person who guides social encounters. When I get anxious, I start to blabber incessantly, which is what I started to do as we continued to talk, because all I could think about was how he probably wanted to do sexual things to me and how scary that thought is for me. This is  another thing that comes with trauma for me. I could be head over heals in love with the guy sitting across from me, Iocked in enthusiastic philosophical conversation, but sometimes, an image of him raping me just pops into my head. It makes it very hard for me. \n\nSo when we walked out of the dining hall, I was just very eager to get back to my dorm. Unfortunately, he walked with me to my dorm, which was a mere 50 feet away. On that short walk, he proceeded to move very close to me to the point where our shoulders were almost touching.  I moved away. He kept moving close, even though it got to the point where I was off of the path and walk-in in the grass. He said something along the lines of “Sorry, I’m walking too close to you,” to which I responded “Yeah, I’m just really big on personal space.” He just continued to walk closer to me.  I was afraid to say no. I just wanted to get back to my dorm and cry. When we got outside the door, he leaned in to hug me, but I just ran into the building and proceeded to have a panic attack. I spent two hours on the phone that night crying to my best friend about how terrified I was, and how hard it is to go through life with the pain that I constantly feel. \n\nIn an effort to be fair, I want to mention that this guy is significantly shorter than me. Also, he had no way of knowing that I have trauma. \n\nFrom then on, my responses to this guy’s texts were curt, if present at all. That was in September. He ended up giving up on texting me, but then one day in the dining hall, we ended up right next to each other getting food. I was instantly uncomfortable, and tried to keep conversation brief. Later on, he texted me and apologized for acting weird in the dining hall since has was super high at the time. I was once again brief with my responses. \n\nA few weeks later, he texts me and asked me if he makes me uncomfortable. His message proceeded to send me into a fit of anxiety. You see, days before, I had just found out that the guy that I had spent a lot of time flirting with over the previous weeks was a serial rapist and that I could’ve been one of his victims, so this message came at a really bad time. \n\nI was too afraid to respond. I felt so guilty, but all I could think about was that I didn’t want anybody to hurt me again and how scared I was of him getting angry. So I didn’t respond. That was until two months later, this December. The guilt began to eat me alive, and so I texted this guy a respectful explanation for my behavior. The message didn’t go through, which I think means that he blocked me. I vowed to tell him the truth in person once I got back to campus, but there he was in the dining hall today, and I was just too terrified to even make her contact. \n\nThis guy did try to reach out, and no matter how I frame it, from his point of view, I just refuted his attempts at communication. There’s no going around that.",

      "description": "So I have these friends. Lets call them Mary, Grace, and Sam. Of the three of us, I'm the only one currently employed. Lately, I've noticed we haven't been able to hang out as much as we used to. Maybe it's because my work schedule is hard to work around, I don't know. But regardless, I see them hanging out sometimes on social media, doing things I would always do with them. And it kinda hurts to not even get invited. And the only times they really seem to invite me anymore, is when I need to pay for them. Because they have no money.\n\nNow, all three of them are very nice people. I don't imagine they would ever try to use me. But my paranoid thoughts and self loathing make me feel like I'm just not a good person to hang around. It feels like they don't want me around anymore, and that Mary only invites me along so Grace and Sam can come too. Mary still has some money, but Grace and Sam have none. So whenever I think about it, or see them hanging out, these thoughts pop up again, and turn into resentment.\n\nIt should be noted that in the past, I had a different friend who often did try to use me for my money, and take advantage of me. It was really bad. But I was so desperate to feel loved and wanted and accepted, that I would always give out money. Mary knows all about this previous experience.\n\nRecently, I saw them all hanging out again without me. And it was all stuff that we had been excited to do together, and wanted to do all together. So I was...really hurt. And I sent Mary a message saying something along the lines of \"Looks like you're all having fun\" Because I just wanted them to remember, hey, I'm still here, too. And because I wanted them to feel a bit bad, because I was feeling like a sack of trash.\n\nMary said it was petty and I was just trying to make them feel bad when they did nothing wrong. I started trying to explain my feelings to her about it, but she stopped me, saying I shouldn't bother her and try to ruin her night by saying something passive aggressive and trying to make her feel bad when she did nothing wrong. \n\nI feel really bad about this all now. Am I the asshole here?",

They’re extroverted, and they admit to not understanding introverts and they know that I am one of them. They need tons of social attention, so they like to follow me around. I’m not a big fan of this, so I started spending more time alone. During second quarter, they acted like wanting to be alone alot is a sign of hating everyone, and they started pressuring me to be more social. I started to sit further away from them in classes, and they started saying things like “Hey, you wanna play video games with us? Oh wait, nevermind. You hate us.” They started to get angry that I wasn’t on discord that much anymore, and I started ignoring and avoiding them. I completely isolated myself from them over winter break.\n\nRight now in third quarter, we have a discrete friendship that works decently for all of us, but I’m not sure if I was being an asshole or not.",

      "description": "Hi all. I've noticed that AITAs to do with wills are quite popular at the moment, although most of them seem to be whether taking 100% of the inheritance is greedy, which are typically met with a resounding NTA. I have the opposite problem.\n\nMy dad is in failing health and yet my brother has been taking money from him without repaying it, not allowing him to see his kids, suddenly lumping him with animals to look after before he goes on holiday etc. As a result of all this my dad told me the other day that he would be cutting my brother out of the will. My dad recently received a fairly large medical retirement payout, which my brother has apparently already been digging his claws into.\n\nMy dad is kind of a pushover, and when this kind of thing happens it annoys me because he moans to me about it yet continues to lend my brother money. I am not sure if he would actually follow through on this threat, but I ended up in tears begging him to leave my brother in the will. If he is cut out, I just know that he will not stop hounding me and my husband for 'his' half.\n\nAITA for telling my dad what to do with his money?",

Seems like there’s no mess up so far. While driving to school he told me he had a meeting that started at 3 and was projected to last 1.5 hours. I realized I forgot to bring my phone because I left it on the charger. My dad tells me to stay close to the school and meet him after his meeting so he could get me.\n\nI go through my day and realize how boring 1.5 hrs wait is. I couldn’t do hw and I wasn’t going to sit around because I would fall asleep. I decided to walk. But the farthest I walked was 1.5 miles from the school. I went around the school and before I knew it I had walked 6 miles. (I know tgatvdue to my watch) It was also 4:30. \n\nIt normally takes my dad 10 min to get to my school and I was waiting out front for him where he normally gets me. At 4:40 I decide to go into  the school and I see him there. I get into the car and he’s mad at me, asking where I was and he told me he arrived at 3:30. He yells at me for 5 min and then stops for the rest of the ride. He didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day. \n\nI woke up today and it seems we are all good so far.\n\nSo, AITA for making my dad wait so long?",

      "description": "First time posting in this community but regularly watch. So I live in an condo apartment complex that used to be an old hotel from 1940s or older. It was recently sold to a new owner(there are other things in the apartment thar need fixing but not extremely dire), who I told about the pipe underneath the sink coming undone constantly and leaving a huge puddle on the bottom floor of my kitchen sink. It's so bad, there is masking tape holding everything together(this was like this prior to me and the two previous tenants living there before me-told the older owner about it the second day of moving into apartment but was cheap about  fixing) and he agreed to hire a plumber this week to look at it. \n\nSo the owner gives the plumber my number and he calls me at 8am yesterday saying he'll have to get materials and can come during the week, asking when I get off of work(I get off late afternoon and don't come home until 5). He states \"Is this everyday?\" and I respond yes. I asked if he could come saturday and he was like \"it depends since I have to get materials\" but calls the owner and lets him know. I text owner and let him about plumber possibly coming on Monday since I stated Monday is okay(I'll be working closer to home that day and will leave an hour or so early from work to make it easier. I called the plumber around 9am leaving a voice mail stating if he can come around 4pm on Monday since I'll be home from work before then. No response. I finally text him if a little after 4pm works for him and all he texts is \"No\".\n\nSo I text back saying that \"Please we need discuss a time when you can come because my pipe is leaking constantly, this will have to be around my schedule as well as I can't take an entire day off for this, so would you be able to come saturday?\" Nothing.\n\nI then text my landlord/owner saying \"So he is not giving me any other options for him to come out and fix the pipe. He said no for Monday to a bit after 4:00 and has not replied back about coming on saturday(which we keep going back on). He is not being accommodating. Could you please speak with him?\" He said he'll give him a call.\n\nI can't take off all day from work as I just got this job(research at a hospital) and have only been here a few weeks. I'm willing to leave work as early as I can so he can enter my apartment(the concierge downstairs can't let people up into my apartment without me physically being there) and I don't want a random stranger alone in my apartment with my belongings.\n\nAITA for asking a plumber to work with me or around my schedule to fix my sink even though I will take off a few hours from work to make it happen?",

      "description": "My paternal grandmother passed away this week, she was 92 years old and lived a full life. \n\nIn her life she was an abusive mother and wife. She had severe rage issues and quite possibly some very serious mental illnesses resulting from having had a very violent childhood herself.  She refused to go to a doctor to get a diagnosis or any medication. \n\nShe was a horrible woman, but not to me. I had limited interaction with her since childhood. I remember seeing her enraged maybe twice in all that I've seen, and it was never directed at me. I was also consciously kept away from her when she was at her worst, I guess. So my memories of her are that of a benevolent woman who was kind to animals and kind to me. \n\nBut I never heard positive things about her from my mum or other relatives. They hated her, called her crazy, found her to be a huge burden. \n\nNow that she's dead, they're holding a traditional Hindu funeral service for her... And it will involve all the people who hated her in her lifetime, who treated her like an inconvenience as she grew older. \n\nI refuse to attend this service. I not a practicing Hindu, nor am I one for appearances. I don't want to meet these people and hear them tell lies about what a kind woman she was etc etc. She wasn't and that's ok. I don't want to participate in this ritualised hypocrisy that is honouring my grandmother's memory when the same people obviously disrespected and dispised her in life. I also have anxiety and am particularly wary of large social gatherings. Over the past year things have improved but I can't bring myself to attend this event. \n\nMy grandmother is gone, in my belief system, this service is of no consequence to her. And I don't want to interact the people who will be attending this service. \n\nA small part of me thinks I should go to be there for my dad, she was his mother after all. But that small part is snuffed out by the much larger part that is already depressed and anxious and doesn't need any more reason to hate people. \n\nAm I the heartless asshole? ",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nWife and MIL drama hits a boiling point and I just trying to get some basis if I am in the wrong.\n\nThis all began a few years ago. We were getting ready for our mainly DIY wedding and my mom had invited us over to Thanksgiving. After discussing with my wife, we decided it would be hard for us at the time (we live about 2.5 hours away) so we let my mom know a month ahead of time. My mom said it was fine and said she understood we were busy with wedding stuff, I come from a small family so after my wife, daughter and I were unable to attend it would have been just my brother and his gf. So my mom decided to just not cook a dinner and would work out other plans with them.     \n\nThis seemed fine but then I get a call from my angry brother (who I am not really fond of). That it was a terrible thing to do to my mom and that I spend too much time with my wife's family (they are local to us). He screamed a whole bunch of other things. I just kinda ignored him as it hadn't been the first rage fest he has had in my life but he was screaming so loud my wife heard it. Fall out from this was he was uninvited from the wedding and we haven't spoke since, he has made no effort to reconcile (not a big loss for me).\n\nThis has pretty much soured the relationship between my mom and wife. She assumes that my brother only did that on her behest or that my mom should have chewed him out, or made him understand what he did was wrong. That she caused him to blow up doing what she did. And it is her fault for raising someone so self absorbed. I have no idea about my mom and her discussions with my brother I figure that is there relationship and we are adult children my mom isn't in control of me or him.  MY wife comes from a family where the parents still have a big say over whats right and wrong in their adult children's lives.\n\nMy mom isn't perfect she has done some things that disrespected us. I brought them up with her, tried to make her see what she was doing with various degrees of success. I had tried a lighter approach at first to being pretty blunt now. My wife is always on me to bring up these things to her. I feel like I'm stuck in the middle here with my wife being on me to set these things right and make my mom understand the wrong she has done. Telling me I'm \"Momma's Boy\" because I'm constantly defending her. In my wife's mind because I can't completely write off my mom as terrible person that I defend her. I try and focus on people's actions and not make judgments of them as a person. My wife see's this as being weak and not standing up for us as a family. Meanwhile my mom is telling me how she loves us and doesn't mean things the way they happen and that she is sorry. But my wife doesn't believe any of it because she hasn't taken responsibility for the original wedding incident. My mom on the other hand feels like my brother is 30+ years old she didn't ask him to do anything but does say she would have handled that thanksgiving differently and does feel sorry for the drama it has caused.\n\nThis is blowing up recently because my wife found out that my mom recently attended thanksgiving with his fiance's family. She sees this as being massively hypocritical, because my mom hasn't come to our place on the holidays. We haven't directly invited her but my wife's family has and she has mainly turned down saying she has had work the next or that its hard for her to drive the long distance during the winter. My mom has come up slightly before the holidays to celebrate these holidays but never on them. We spend all holidays with my wife's family because they are close by and my wife really doesn't want to go (we haven't been there since before my daughter was born 4+ years ago). My mom says she understands our kids are young and its hard to travel and that its better for the kids since my wife's family is so large and have really festive holiday parties that it is something they should experience. \n\nBut since my mom hasn't come up to be part of the holidays she hasn't made an effort but my mom makes the effort to be with my brother's fiance's family on a holiday. I don't know the details of who invited who or why it happened. I see that as her relationship with him and none of my business really.\n\nSo I just feel like I'm stuck in the middle here. My wife I feel has been hurt deeply and understand that. My mom isn't perfect and has said some passive aggressive things that fuels the fire. But I personally don't think my mom is a terrible person. \n\nSo who is in the wrong here? Should I be standing up to my mom more and setting stricter boundaries and I allowed the relationship to get this bad? Is my wife overreacting? Is my mom the source of all the toxicity and being two faced? Who is the A here? ",

This project is quite tough, and we have been on it for 5 weeks now.\n\nI was quite motivated because they seemed really focused and ready to help me. All went normal, until the programming started scalating exponetially, meaning that working at home can be really helpful as we only have 2-4 hours per day for day at class. They started doing my part of the tasks they gave me at home, and reproaching me I was doing nothing for those full hours at class, and getting even more mad at me because i can't finish the only few things I understand and do well.\n\nThis classwork method takes us all the programming classes we have for these almost month and a half we have, so we have to learn by ourselves almost everything, and by this I have the feeling that im getting really falled behind from what I should be.\n\nThis works means the 90% of the global note of the evalution, so I can understand their will for those full points, but im about to explode, furthermore, with the oral exposition ot the project this Friday, \"as I haven't done anything this last month\" I have to go out and speak alone in front of the other 30 students.\n\nAITA for whining this time?

      "description": "First, some context. I live with two roommates and one of them loves to cook and bake, just like I do. There's rarely a time when one of us isn't in the kitchen making something. We often talk with each other about the recipes we want to try, what were doing differently that day, etc. We don't cook together much because we both are kind of control freaks when it comes to our food and want to make everything our way. I really enjoy the social aspect of food, so usually once or twice a week I'll make something to share with my roommates. I like seeing their reactions and it makes me feel good since we're all in college and having someone else making your food is a pretty big luxury. I also like to get feedback from my roommates on what I could do differently, especially the other cook because he has a great pallete and always has some very insightful advice \n\nMy roommate does not seem to share this sentiment. We have lived together for 1 1/2 years now and he has never offered me a single thing he has made. This seems kind of absurd to me considering he will frequently make huge amounts of food that he can't even finish before it goes bad. I know he has no obligation to offer me anything, but I think it's kind of inconsiderate of him to spend a morning telling me all about a recipe he's gonna try and what he's gonna do to make it and not ever think to offer me some. I think some of it might just be that I really respect his tastes and feedback and i just feel a little insulted that he doesn't see me in the same way. What do you think Reddit? ",

      "title": "AITA for hanging out with my friend after he broke up with his girlfriend?",
      "description": "I am going to tell the story as objectively as possible so I know the answer, because I feel genuinely bad about this. For context, I am a 25/F and he is a 24/M. My friend, we'll call him James, and I met in 2012 when we attended college together. We joined the same club and became fast friends. We started attending the same church and we became known as the pair that always hung out together. People would always question if we were a thing, but we never were. We drifted apart for a while after I got a boyfriend and I stopped attending the church. There was no falling out and I would occasionally see him when I was out and we would act completely normal.\n\nWell, my boyfriend and I broke up and I started attending the church again soon after. I saw him and we reconnected instantly, but never really hung out outside of church. While I was gone, he got a girlfriend, who we will call April, and I became friends with her too after I got back to the church. At this point, they had been together for a little over a year and a half (I had been gone for about three years). Things were fine for a while and every Friday we would have a young adult group that would meet at around 9:30pm and we would just hang out with a bunch of other people our age. Anyway, one night they set up a volleyball net in the church and James went to play with a bunch of other people. I sat with April, as I was recently out of surgery and could not play, and I asked her how things were going with her and James. She remarked that he had broken up with her about two week prior and that she hasn't really told anyone yet. \n\nI felt really bad and I understood because I went through a similar situation myself, so I comforted her as best as I could and offered to hang out with her that week to hear her out. She agreed and we went to get coffee later in the week. She told me about the circumstances surrounding their breakup and how he basically broke up with her out of nowhere, but explained to her that he didn't think the relationship was going anywhere. I gave her some advice, we hung out once more after that a out a week later, and I remarked to her that I would reach out to James as well, since I was friends with him for a while too.\n\nA couple weeks later and on another Friday night, I approached James and asked if he was ok and if he wanted to talk. He agreed and we decided to go to Sonic after the young adult group ended and talk over milkshakes. This is also something that we have done in the past before I initially left the church the first time, so it was kind of nostalgic for us. We spoke about both of our respective breakups and how similar they were to each other, which made us both feel better. Eventually, something happened at Sonic that we found funny, so I decided to post a video on Snapchat. April was following me on Snapchat and saw the video I posted and texted me the next morning asking if I had hung out with him. I responded by saying I had, but I had not revealed anything that she had told me (I really didn't). I wasn't hanging out with him to gossip, I genuinely wanted to see if he was ok. She never responded to that text. When I saw her that Sunday, I asked if she was mad at and and she shrugged and said, \"It is what it is.\"\n\nHer and I haven't hung out since and I am wondering if I was wrong in reaching out to James. I have tried to talk to her, but she gives me one word answers and doesn't say much to me anymore. James and I have hung out a few times since then, but neither of us have interest in the other.

Over the course of that year I realized I loved them, maybe too much to the point of obsession I can admit. But at the same time, they were my best friend. Probably the closest person to me. Now let's go back 5 years ago, I started dating a girl who would eventually become my girlfriend. She's amazing, pretty, funny, and she loves me. Not too long ago I realized it's pretty fucking stupid to keep hanging out with someone that potentially destroy your relationship, so after a 2 hour phone call of crying, silence, and just pitiful behavior. My friend and I both agreed if I really cared about my girlfriend I had to stop talking to them and get over him. So we're here now, and a last week I was talking to a old friend who goes, \"Oh yeah (ex best friend's name) asked me what your new number is and is trying to talk to you.\" I immediately freeze up and hit with a rush emotions I was really not prepared for. And I'm honestly thinking of calling him. But I don't want to hurt my girlfriend. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "A little while ago I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a7s1v6/aita_for_being_angry_at_my_friend_for_pretending?sort=top) post. Read it for better context, but the long and short of it is I confessed feelings for a friend which he verbally and, to a degree, physically reciprocated, having previously displayed interest (as well as saying I was his best friend). He then proceeded to refuse several invitations to meet up over the course of about five months on the grounds of being terribly busy and never indicated any interest in meeting me at all outside school. During this time he would regularly tell me funny stories of the times he met up with other friends (really quite regularly) and so on. I don't even know if he realised the very obvious issue here, or if he was doing it intentionally for...reasons? Anyway I have been pretty angry at him seemingly lying to me about this sort of thing for basically years and seemingly stringing me along. FWIW, he had actually tried to get out of school to meet a friend for lunch at some point, so you can see he isn't trying very hard in this case.\n\nAnyway, today he texted me \n\n&gt;Oh [other friend of his] and I were thinking of going to [cafe] or something after school tomorrow, do you want to come with ??\n\nAm I the asshole for being somewhat offended at this offer? I can say almost for certain that he met up with this guy regularly anyway, and he has told me stories about times when he was meeting this guy. So I feel like he has finally decided, in his infinite magnanimity, to invite me along out out of pity. At least before I felt I had a shred of dignity left. I dunno. Also, I'd just come along as a largely unwanted third wheel and make everyone uncomfortable. Even the phrasing of the message makes it pretty clear I'm an afterthought, tagging along to join his meetings with people he could actually give a fuck about. After an hour or two I just replied \" I wouldn't want to intrude\" and he said nothing further on the matter. \n\nAll the crap I mentioned in the previous post killed my interest in him pretty quickly anyway, but I've considered him my best friend for a good six years. My plan now had been to talk to him in school but basically always be alone outside, since that way I could at least keep some self respect, rather than begging him to come hang out with me. Not that I'm sure I even really want to meet him that much anymore. He has also been physically touch again recently, and I'm not really sure what to do about that. I have no idea what to think in general.\n\n Am I being unreasonable or unfair? Again, it may help to skim the previous post for a little more context.",

      "description": "My roommate and I are best friends, but he can be quite irresponsible with his money. He does pay his share of rent and utilities on time, which I do appreciate; however, he has complained about not having his license or a car for close to six months now. \nI have encouraged him to save money. Like perhaps don’t eat out every day, don’t buy multiple games for his PS4 every week, don’t buy stupid things in-game for his stupid games for his PS4, etc. \nWhen he got his tax return (roughly 2 weeks ago), he proudly told me he was saving all of the return for a car and to get his license. I had my doubts, but reassured him that he’s got this. \nLast week, he asked me solid reasons why he shouldn’t spend his tax return on a Switch. I gave him my honest thoughts, including that I’m not the biggest fan of having to drive him to work, to meet up with his friends, to go to the store, etc. Also, it would teach him a stance of responsibility, which he greatly lacks due to being attached to Mommy’s titty until he moved in about 4 months ago. He said it made sense, so I felt a bit more confident in him. \nTonight he came home holding a Switch box with a case and some games in a GameStop bag. He mentioned I was overreacting because it’s “his money and he can do what he wants with it”. I’m just annoyed over how he’s being reckless with his money and isn’t putting the right things as a priority. I just want what’s best for him, because I’ve been in his shoes at one point and looking back, I wish I would’ve had someone like me preaching to save and prioritize the proper things. AITA? ",

Recently we decided to take some time to figure out what we needed in a relationship, and wouldnt be happy without. \n\nThere was one thing that he brought up, and that is having liquor in the house. \n\nI was raised in a very religious household.  This  taught me that drinking is terrible. Since growing up I have realized that there are many different ways people can act while intoxicated, and not all of them are bad. When we started the relationship I told him liquor is not something I want in my house or around my children. Since making this decision we agreed to a compromise of a boys room where he can keep his liquor away from our kids. Recently he bought up that he is no longer okay with this. He feels as if I'm asking him to hide a part of himself if I ask him to not drink in front of our children and also that I am demonizing something he enjoys. \n\nWhile dating him I have begun to realize he could have an issue with alcohol. There are multiple moments where he has put us in situations which should not have happened but did due to his intoxication levels.\n\nHis alcohol usage has become a constant issue of irresponsibility and now I feel our relationship might be over forever due to this impasse. I told him this is a deal breaker for me and that it makes me worried about our children's safety. \n\nTldr: we have very different views on drinking while together and are at a point it won't be able to progress because we are hung up on it.

CG walks up to me, I have mutual friends with her so starts talking to me and joking around. I was on Instagram when she approached so I am now holding my phone loosely at my waist and I'm not looking at it. All of the sudden in the middle of the conversation she smacks my phone out of my hand and yells something stupid along the lines of \"SLAPPED!\" (middle school so i don't remember exactly). Understandably I am pissed and ask wtf and she says it's just a joke\". I pick it up to find that the glass is completely destroyed, with shards falling from the screen. Again I ask \"wtf wrong with you, why did you just break my phonel\" And CG is adamant that I'm ying and that it was already broken. She wouldn't even admit she broke until it the teacher asked other kids who saw and told her that my phone in fact hadn't been broken before.. Anyways a week passes and tell I finally her she needs to pay to replace the screen, which is -$75 to which she says \"you are rich, just buy a new iPhone.\" NoW at this point can't belleve her, for the phone she broke was a $250 shitty android that saved to buy and have made it clear that my parents will give me nothing towards a new phone and thatI have to pay for a new one out of pocket. CG constantly guilt trips me saying her family is extremely poor yet she has a brand new iPhone 6 which on it's own was worth 3x mine. I only ever ended up getting around $25, have never spoken to CG again. AITA for getting mad, even if she didn't expect it to break my phone? ",

      "description": "So my FH just graduated from a prestigious school. We also just moved across the country, and I am sitting for the February bar exam. FH and I are both in high earning careers, we have a very healthy savings. His income covers our cost of living right now, but there isn't a lot left over after our monthly expenses. We have completely shared finances and all resources are ours.\n\nSo the program was really hard on our relationship to begin with. I made a lot of sacrifices followed by a cross country move for his career.\n\nWe had struggled getting an engagement ring, despite having agreed on a budget. He never wanted to go shopping and it made me feel really insecure because I asked if it was about money and he said no. \n\nAbout the same time we were looking at a ring we started to talk about our travel plans for the year. I gave up pretty much everything I wanted to do this year, leaving only the things that were family commitments that HAD to get done. One of those thing was a cruise with my parents that we are taking because my Dad was just diagnosed with cancer. it will probably be my last family vacation. Since that was going to be a big expense, I have been trying to give up the other things I want to do so FH can do what he wants to do. We spent new years at the beach with his family, he has taken 2 ski trips.\n\nAnyway, I learned all this about how he has been uncomfortable with the spending about a week ago. After feeling like shit about my ring, and after giving up on all these things I wanted to do. So now that I know hes feeling bad about money, I think about things and feel like he has been cheap on the things that I really wanted to do (get an engagement ring, going on a getaway together after the bar) and has been spending a ton on ski weekends. And he wants to go to the 1st MBA reunion.\n\nThe reunion will cost a grand. He wants to go for an invenstment fund meeting he has been working on. I feel like the other person he has been working with could handle it. Or he could skype in. He offered to take me with him and go to the meeting and not go to any other events, and then just have a weekend together, but I don't want to do that. I don't want to go back right now, and I don't really want to have this program running any more of my life.\n\nAITA for not wanting him to go?",

      "title": "AITA for not letting my boyfriend play video games?",
      "description": "Throwaway account\n\nNow before all of the angry comments, let my explain:\n\nWhen my boyfriend was a freshman in college (last year), he was obsessed with a game called Warframe (for those of you who don't know its a game with a lot of grind if you are a f2p) I played this game too, but not to the extent that he played. He would play for 5 hours just to get one rare blueprint for one character in one day (those blueprints are basically only 1/6th of the grind). We would occasionally play together and I noticed how he would always have something new, and I know he is too poor to buy any of that. He also ruined his GPA for the year because he would just play Warframe.  Also, my boyfriend had an extremely easy schedule for that year so he could of used the time for a job (he always complained about wanting money), however, instead he would just play Warframe whenever he could - in between classes, 2 am in the morning, you name it. I started to get worried and had a talk with him over the summer of 2018.\n\nAfter I talked to him about how he spends too much time on video games, he agreed to play it less, and he actually did. I also asked if he can get a job and he promised me he would try if he can (couldn't get a job because his semester schedule was a complete mess) However, this year, around October, he bought Monster Hunter Worlds (a game that is way too time consuming) and he played 28 hours of that game in under a week. Also, his schedule during the semester was much worse than the one from last year. He also tried to hide the fact that he played the game until I eventually found out.\n\nAnyways, after a short fight I asked him to stop playing any grindy video games (which is basically all video games) and keep his steam profile public (so I can see if he plays). He completely complied and he now doesn't play any video games and plays a game called Enter the Gungeon (really good game btw) sometimes. So today is when it all hit me. He isn't depressed or anything, and right now he has winter break. I just started to think about him and realized how boring it must be for him when I can't talk to him or do something with him because I'm busy. I ask him if he is interested in any hobbies but he really isn't. He tries to reassure me that he is perfectly fine with it, but I'm not - I just feel guilty\n\nSo my question is - AITA for not letting my boyfriend play any grindy video games or is it justifiable?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My boyfriend used to play video games way too much when he should of focused on school, I told him to try to play it less, then next year he started to play really grindy video games again behind my back. I always worry about him but he tries to reassure me, but I feel bad because I feel like I am being too controlling.",

      "description": "For Christmas my group of friends does a secret Santa and this year the budget was $20 and in order to make it a bit easier everyone made a list of items within the budget. One of the girls from the group (let’s call her B) and I used to be very close. We did everything together and at some point I considered her my best friend but started to grow apart a little over a year ago. We had a few arguments and had talked things through and apologized but we stopped being close. When it came to exchanging gifts it turned out she had gotten me and had decided to gift me a “cup” she made in her clay class this past semester. I said thank you for the gift but couldn’t help feel disappointed considering there was a budget to follow and the only thing on my wish list was an $8 book.",

My moms always been unfair with me and my 3 siblings, my little brother is the baby and gets away with everything, I’m not even joking. I’ve been sent to the hostpital a few times because she thinks I have a mental illness and the last time she tried to admit me I left. The doctor told her they couldn’t admit me because the last time it was obvious that I didn’t have a mental disorder that there was problems with me and mom and possible drug problem, don’t flip out Its just weed, and that I had to go home with her. I told her right when we walked out that I’m not going to her house and if she made me that I’d make sure in every way this would happen again. She agreed to let me stay at my grandparents. \n\nI got caught smoking and was found in passed out in the car high as hell, this is when she tried to admit me into the hostpital the second time. She took all my belongings and refuse to give them back.\nMy brother got caught at school selling weed and they took his phone for a week. As I said it’s unfair \n\nI’ve said many times I don’t want to talk to her that’s she’s basically dead to me and that’s that. Am I an asshole for not wanting to fix things?

      "description": "Here's the deal: My friend ( let's call her J ), is running for a position for our university's student alliance. We're both first years, so we don't have as much experience with campus life as as the average student. \n\nThe position is one that basically involves J representing our faculty's voice (social sciences and humanities) at the student alliance level. For some reason, there are four positions for this yet only two people ran. I see J winning anyways as she is running uncontested.\n\nShe won't stop talking about this election (signed me up to promote it for her without asking me, even forged my signature, constantly messaging me to post her promo stuff on social media). \n\nI'm worried I'm being an unsupportive asshole because I have been calling J out for her lack of campus life awareness. She doesn't know anything about basic issues pressing students. She didn't know about our student newspaper, our radio station that's shutting down, a referendum taking place during elections regarding bus passes, or a vigil for the Christchurch shooting that happened today. I feel she's simply running because it's an easy win for her, she has a lot of connections and it'll look good on a resume. \n\nAlso I agreed to post her flyers on my socials but I went into settings so she's the only viewer of my stories. She has a massive following compared to me anyways and so I thought the difference was negligible. \n\nI feel I'm being insensitive and should support her no matter what as a friend.

      "description": "I just want an outsiders perspective on things. I will take whatever your guy’s judgement is with no complaint.\n\nSo for context, me and my fiancé live alone now bc we can’t stand roommates anymore. The last roommates we had was a couple. The main problem we had with them was that they would leave out their dirty dishes for over a week, leave their food to rot in the fridge for months, and leave their dirty laundry on the dining room table. And when asked politely to clean up their mess they would get hissy and will say something along the lines of “ WHAT DISHES ?!I don’t remember having any dishes.” And because of this they view me as SUCH A BITCH they think my fiancé shouldn’t marry me. That is according to a mutual friend of ours.  We think it’s true bc it explains why they have never even acknowledged our engagement.\n\nAlso, they tried to bail out of the lease 6 months before it was supposed to end. And since then, they have been such a pain in the ass to deal with to the point we gotten into many fights over it.\n\nOkay now to the issue. I was the master tenant of the last apartment so the whole deposit was sent to me. After looking over the paperwork I was happy to find out that they were getting less than 15% back. We told them that they were only getting x amount bc of services performed only in their room. We did everything by the book so they couldn’t take us to court.They were like okay, and said they wanted the money in check. Check is cut. And we think that is the last time we’ll hear from them. WRONG!\n\nThe GF messages my fiancé asking if we combined their deposit. He replies yes and she says “ well that’s wrong. It’s need to be x amount”. I had a lapse in memory and thought I had sent only half the amount and fiancé relays that back to her. Then I frantically pull out the paperwork and realize I was right all along and the bitch was trying to trick us into giving them more money.\n\nHe clarified with her again why they only got that amount. And she throws a hissy fit over it.  And I tell my fiancé initially he needed to shut her down. Present the fact and say we’re done. I found out he didn’t do that .\n\nShe was arguing with him saying “how do you know this service you deducted was only done in our room?”. Fiancé replies “ bc the pictures used for that service is clearly your room”. They argue back and forth like this. And meanwhile, I’m about to damn near tear out my hair out over this. Bc we went over this already with them and this argument was cutting into the very limited quality time together.I asked for his phone and I type  in “ We are going off these photos management provided. YOU’RE NOT GETTING ANY MORE MONEY FROM US. WE ARE DONE ARGUING WITH YOU”. And she finally left us alone after that.\n\nThen we get into a fight bc I had essentially “violated” his character. Simply put he’s neutral good and I’m chaotic good . His neutral good causes him to be kind and civil no matter how disrespectful someone is being as a long as it’s not physical. He got mad at me for typing that under his account. And explained to me that she wasn’t being rude yet and that he has a set of protocols before escalating to that type of talk. \n\nI’m a little baffled bc I told him “why didn’t you take your phone away from me. You could have done it any time”. He replies “ well I trusted that you wouldn’t do that”. And I replied “ well I trusted you to shut down the conversation but didn’t”. And he rebuts by saying “ well I was going to but you didn’t let me do it. I had it handled”.\n\nOh and he also said the reason why he was being so civil with them was so he could earn their trust. So they can say how they really feel about me to his face. So that way he can get really mad and that’s just how he is person.  And I’m so perplexed by this bc he admitted many times he hated them and never wanted to talk to them.\n\nWhy be civil with them after everything? His neutral good nature causes me to feel like he’s not prioritizing us and not properly defending me as a fiancé. I love him very much and I still do want to marry him.\n\nSorry for the long wall of text guys. I don’t even know how I would TL:DR this.",

I've hung out with them before on her bday when we all went out for drinks and I don't have any issues with them. I just really don't like the club scene. I'd rather goto a dive bar and play pool than to a club and dance. I've told her this many times.\n\nSo last night same thing happens they ask I decline because just got done moving needed to finish setting my stuff up but bc they all plan to get ruined I drive them to the club. No issue there. I get home finish setting shit up. Few hours later I get told I'm eating with them despite not being hungry despite not being hungry since having eaten earlier. So the entire time they're eating I'm kind of half listening, half in Narnia because they're all drunk. I'm answering any time they talk to me but I'm not adding anything to the convo. Mostly just lost in my own head. \n\nWe get home and she asks why I'm so cranky? I say I'm not I just don't wanna go hang out in as restaurant for however long for no reason while I'm not hungry, that the only reason I went was so she wouldn't get upset. She gets seemingly defensive saying I didn't say that explicitly and that I need to learn the difference between her being bummed and upset. And that she just wants to spend time with me. \n\nAITA for all that?",

Lately he has been trying to force me to play it and I have been making excuses to get out of it. It honestly feel like he bought me a chore.

      "description": "So for some backstory , me and this girl (let’s call Jan) have been friends for about 4-5 years back when we worked at a retail store. We got along pretty well and it made work more bearable (keep in mind i was a teenager at this point so i was probably 17 ) and she was a few years older. She wasnt the type of friend i’d usually have , considering we had very little in common and i thought of her as more like a work friend. Regardless , we still hung out outside of work whenever she asked me and i didn’t see anything wrong with it so i did despite the only thing we had in common was mutual friends so that’s all we talked about. Now in the years that followed , a LOT happened. I went through a period of severe depression after being kicked out of my parents house, dropped out of university after a mental breakdown due to stress , fired from my part time job and was struggling with debt. Eventually i managed to pick myself up and get my shit together , find an apartment and a good stable full time job , but during this time, Jan went off the grid. she was completely incognito and deactivated all her accounts and number so i never heard anything about her. a few years later , i changed as a person and was not the same one from when i was a teenager but Jan resurfaced and acted like nothing had changed, so she started  asking me to hang out again and i was reluctant but still agreed because why not. big mistake. she would be constantly spamming my inbox with messages and asking me to hang out multiple times, and because i didn’t want to hurt her feelings i agreed for the most part. i was in my 20s by now but after a lot of turmoil that happened in my life i became more low key and only stuck with my very small group of friends that i’ve known for a very long time because i just didn’t have the emotional capacity or energy to invest in others, and she KNEW this because i told her many times. Back last year up to a couple months, my best friend was struggling severely with alcoholism and suicide, eventually leading me to take care of her because her parents were no better. in the span of the next couple months or so i was so focused on not only getting my friend help and trying my best to keep her stable and on her feet , but also with work (which is emotionally exhausting on its own ) , enrolling to go back to university , and busy paying bills among other things so i barely had time for people., and whenever jan would ask me to hang out, i would always tell her that i needed time because i was so drained from everything that was going on that i needed time for myself. she somehow took this as me purposely ignoring/avoiding her despite me never implying that and got so offended that i didn’t want to spend time with her  she would get very pissy with me and not speak to me for days (i told her what was going on in my life so she would understand but i guess she didn’t). now for the days when i agreed to hang out , it was the most shallow and vapid time because all she wanted to talk about was the latest drama with people we knew and she would spill her personal love life and problems onto me and i felt like she wanted me to solve them for her because she would constantly ask me what to do. this was EVERY time we hung out. and whenever i tried to talk about something else or she asked me a question , she would interrupt me halfway through and lose interest right away because then she would start another topic. On my birthday that my friends planned for me , all my close friends were there but Jan was there too because i felt bad and i didn’t want her to take it the wrong way if she wasn’t invited. I shit you not, she was on her phone the entire time and had 0 interest in interacting with any of my friends despite me trying to introduce her to people, and then she tried to get me to leave my own birthday party early for her because she was going to meet up with some rando on tinder to hook up that night and she needed me to let her into my apartment so she could crash. On New years she publicly humiliated her friend infront of her friends because Jan wanted her to go to Jan’s party and when the friend didn’t want to she insulted her and told her to never talk to her again.. Since then over the following months, i’ve been actively avoiding her spam messages about her rants about her fights or problems with people who i haven’t spoken to in years and don’t really care about and she’s been asking me if i’m ignoring her (which she always does even though i say she i’m not) and i tell her the same thing i always do , which is that i prefer my own company right now and i need some space to myself to which she replies that if i like to be alone i must be struggling and that i’m unhealthy and weird for not wanting to spend time with her, then ends with trying to guilt me by saying i can “talk to her when she’s worth my time “in a super passive aggressive way with exclamation marks and all. she has gotten super passive aggressive and very insecure over the years, and to be honest a toxic person to be around. AITA for no longer wanting to invest emotionally in someone i’m no longer close with (or ever was for that matter )? i’ve tried many times to tell her how i was feeling in the nicest way i could but she would always twist it and take it as me hating her and she would get very defensive and start throwing daggers at me. \n\nFor some reference , i work 64h a week with troubled kids in the foster system so it’s already a very emotionally and mentally draining job ",

After I refused, she called me an asshole and one of the two yelled a lot at both of us to STFU and stop arguing, which I denied and as a result got blocked by the owner and the other guy kept swearing at me for a good bit. This was all yesterday, and as of today whenever she mentions the argue on another server of ours and I reply, everyone yells at me to drop it and shut up.\nTL:DR, do you guys think I'm the asshole for replying to the girl being upset instead of just shutting up, doing as I'm told, and letting her do whatever?",

My youngest, a 9 year old boy with autism and multiple health issues,  has trouble walking long distances so I went to walk ahead with my girls.\n\nWe don't go often so I forgot about the footpath rules until I noticed the markings on the floor,  and was too far to mention this to hubby.  About 50 meters away I can hear my son start to wail,  and turn to see my hubby comforting him and some cyclist near them stopped briefly before riding off. \n\nI headed back to help calm him down, at which point hubby told me a cyclist had hit my boy then proceeded to yell at them for being on the wrong side of the footpath. \n\nI want to acknowledge that I appreciate why the footpath is designed this way,  and how frustrating it can be for cyclists who are constantly blocked by inconsiderate folks. So I acknowledge that my hubby might have been an asshole for not observing his environment better.  \n\nBut what kind of person hits a kid and then blames the kid,  not so much as an apology or concern for his well-being? My hubby and child were on the wrong side, but the cyclist who hit him was going in the same direction and so was technically also on the wrong side.  I didn't see if he was on that side because he was overtaking other people,  but there wasn't a lot of people around at that time.\n\nI could understand if he showed concern and then politely reminded hubby about the rules,  but really if someone is in your way you don't just go ahead and hit them,  even if they shouldn't be there.\n\nI was absolutely livid,  and kept looking for the cyclist as in my head I was going to clothesline him off his bike and then yell at him for getting in my arms way.  Lucky for all of us that I didn't see him again. Are we all assholes? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I recently ‘broke up’ with a friend and am not sure how much of an asshole I was.\n\nSome background: ‘Sharon’ is much older than I am and, while sweet, has very little understanding of social norms and boundaries (I only mention her age because she’s in her mid 40s and is pretty set in her ways). I considered her a distant friend but she thinks we are much closer. \n\nI’ve never minded inviting Sharon to parties or seeing her casually, but every interaction is a struggle since she’s always pushing hard for us to be closer. Examples include trying to plan multiple vacations with my family, attempting to pressure me to let her host a baby shower for me, always trying to pull me away from the crowd at parties for long and intense one-on-one discussions, and showing up literally hours early to my house before a planned event because she wants ‘some alone time with me.’ (Yes, I know some of these instances are my fault since I didn’t enact good boundaries). \n\nIn the last year I have pulled away hard since she’s seems a little SWF, but I struggled with feelings of guilt since she genuinely isn’t a bad person. So she didn’t feel ghosted, I told her that between my job, husband, children, and extended friends and family, I’m too busy to be regularly in touch. \n\nThe break up: A week ago she noticed that I’d interacted with some friends on social media but not with her. She confronted me about that. I summoned a backbone and told her that I had friends and family member to whom I was much closer to than her. And that I deeply resented her monitoring my interactions with other people. And finally, that I needed space from her. Then I deleted her from every social media platform and have been ignoring her multiple texts and calls. \n\nI think in my heart of hearts I used this to excuse to end the friendship since it has gotten so exhausting. I think she is stunned and hurt by this. AITA?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I got between my ex and his more recent ex?",
      "description": "So, to give some background, I (22F) recently started talking to my ex (23M) again after around four years of not speaking, with a brief interval of catching up but not actually seeing each other as we were in different states. My ex, we'll call him K, and I, dated all four years of high school. I broke up with him not long after I started college an hour and a half from him, where he stayed at home and went to community college. I broke up with him for the typical getting out of a high school relationship reasons; I wanted to explore, experience new things, and the distance was too tough. Perhaps I didn't give it enough of a chance once I went to college, and I did have some guilt over it for a while, but overall I think it was the right decision for me and don't regret it.\n\nAbout a month after the breakup, he started dating J (22F? now). Now, K and I had a great group of friends, with whom we were both very close and my then/current best friend was also extremely close with him, the three of us spent a ton of time together. They remained friends for a bit after he began dating J, though he cut me off almost immediately (understandably so). Then K started to blow off our mutual best friend for J, and when confronted about it just shut down and cut her off too. Shortly after that he cut off the remaining people in that friend group (pretty much all girls). As I recently found out, it wasn't even him cutting them off - J used to go through his instagram and unfollow practically every single girl on his feed. One of our mutual friends in particularly she apparently despised because one of K's friends who had hooked up with her shared a nude of her, to which K didn't even react. Real shitty of K's friend but nothing he or the girl did wrong. Sounds like classic abusive behavior to me, dragging people away from their friends like that for bullshit reasons. At the time I wasn't aware of any of this past what my best friend's situation was.\n\nSo fast forward about four years, which they've dated on/off, but mostly on, apparently their breakups didn't last long. I had not talked to him at all while they were dating. Last year he contacts me when I'm living in a different state and says he wants to meet and catch up, and we text back and forth for a while and he expresses interest in coming to visit me and see my family. We talked for a couple of weeks, and plans didn't pan out and I didn't hear from him again. I kind of chalked it up to being busy or him changing his mind about talking to me, and didn't push it, but then found out he was dating J again. Left it alone, not my business, I hadn't seen him in four years, he's an adult, etc.\n\nNow, a few months back, I hear from K again. This time I am living in the same state as him again and so we make plans to hang out. We do and have a great time. We did hook up (no sex, like second base) the second or third time we hung out but I decided I wanted to keep things platonic. We go visit my/his former best friend at work and they connect again too. Our HS friend group takes him out for his birthday in the city. We hang out like 8-10 times over the next few months, which brings us up to the present.\n\nHe also tells me about what happened with J. Apparently she cheated on him serially, sucked him dry financially, and was just generally not a nice person to him. He worked 50 hours a week while she sat at her parents house not working and smoking his weed and spending his money. He took her back after the first time he found out she cheated - presumably this was when he contacted me and we were in different states. This time, though, he said he was done and needed to spend time on his own. I fully agreed as the guy had not been single for more than a month since he was 14! The thing that makes it worse imo, is that they were in an open relationship. She was ALLOWED to fuck other people and she still managed to break his trust and lie and cheat. This girl was complete and utter trash, and a totally toxic and manipulative presence in his life.\n\nThe last time we talked he said I should come out again to his city to hang, and i'm like okay cool let's make plans next weekend, then he starts ignoring my snaps and texts. I don't think too too much of it until my best friend texts me that she thinks he's dating J again. He's also been ignoring her messages, and unfollowed everyone who took him out for his birthday a month ago on instagram again. I checked my instagram today too and realized he unfollowed me as well, and we also noticed he had begun to follow J again.\n\nI still recognize that he's an adult and can make his own choices, and that it isn't necessarily my business, but I am really worried for him. I've seen how people can be so blinded in abusive and manipulative relationships like that, I thought he had finally turned a new leaf but am afraid he is slipping back into this abusive situation. I thought that he was finally going to reconnect with his old friends and that we could maintain a friendship. I thought he was going to be able to spend some time finding himself.\n\nI just feel like I need to do *something* to stop this but I don't know if what I'm most tempted to do will be appropriate or effective. I really want to message her, possibly anonymously, and tell her that she needs to stay the fuck away from him. That I know how she forced him to cut off all of his female friends due to her toxic and selfish jealousy. That she serially cheated on him and broke his trust over and over. That she was manipulative and abusive to him and everyone knows it. That she has already caused him so much pain and that she needs to fuck off and figure out how to not be an abusive person.\n\nThe most sensible thing seems like it would be to talk to him directly about my concerns, but... I'm afraid that it won't be effective, especially coming from me, and even worse, might push him further into her arms. And I also know that he is fully aware of the shit that she did, and so it's not like I'm telling him anything new. But I don't want to hurt him. And I don't want her to hurt him. I care about this kid, we grew up together, and it's so plain to see that this girl will be trouble for him and he knows himself he needs time on his own.\n\nTL;DR recently reconnected with my high school ex (as well as him connecting to other old friends) after his four-year long abusive relationship. Things had been looking up until he started unfollowing all of us on instagram and ghosting us after we all took him out for his birthday, is looking like he might go back to her. I want to tell her to fuck right off because she's abusive, manipulative, and toxic as hell",

      "description": "Yesterday it was the day before payday and I had to gather up loose change to get a decent dinner for the family.  Generic steakumms on hotdog buns was on the menu, but my tax refund deposited just as I was leaving the market, so I decided to order some Chinese food and sushi as a treat since we’ve been kinda broke lately.  \n\nI inadvertently ordered the sushi stacked on rice for my wife, instead of the sushi rolls that I normally buy for her.  I wanted sashimi because I can’t eat rice.  Food arrives And I note my mistake, and offer some of my sashimi, despite her wanting fish/rice in a roll form.  To me, they are the same thing  just in different form, but whatever I give her some of my salmon and tuna leaving me with  mostly eel, crab sticks, and the weird white fish that’s kinda rubbery.  Not what I like the most but Whatever,I want her to be happy with her food and it seems that she’s ok with this at first but I see she is pouting a little bit, so I ordered what she likes and told her its on the way.  \n\nWell this made her mad for some reason, and even though she got what she likes, a little later than the rest of us, and she had food to eat in the meantime, and she didn’t have to eat processed freezer beef paper, she’s still unhappy with me because I didn’t want to give her all of my tuna and salmon, and just suck it up and eat the rice. I should note that I cannot eat rice or I will have digestive issues.   \n\nShe didn’t eat any of it and hasn’t spoke to me today.  She insisted I was being a dick about it by ordering what she likes.  I think she should just be happy that she didn’t have to eat steakumms because they’re nasty.   I ended up spending $85 bucks on dinner which is enough for 2-3 days of food for the family.  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  My wife always seems to find something wrong with everything I do, this is just one example. ",

I suggest a french vanilla latte because that syrup technically consists of vanilla AND hazelnut flavoring. After making her the latte, her boyfriend brings the drink back to me and very politely lets me know that his girlfriend \"isn't the biggest fan of the drink\". Being the nice guy I am, I gladly make her a new drink to try (a cafe mocha this time) without charging them for the drink. However, I can't help but feel that they are assholes for not offering to pay for the drink.

We both can understand each other even in the deepest conversations. Last summer she broke up with me when I was overseas. I had really really hard times when I was a child but this time I had similar traumas again. Not only about her but also about my own life. Made many mistakes because I was depressed and couldn't sleep for very long time and still can't. We fought a lot after the broke up because I couldn't get over things that a normal person would. I really think she is the one for me but I also know she is not a person for serious relationships. She really cares for me still as a person. She even would like to sleep with me but she says she can't be my partner. I live in a place where I can be attractive because I have not the suitable social skills for the people where I live. But somehow she has and now she is in place for a few months more where she can spend time with probably any guy she want and I respect that. I am not jealous or something but she knows she can distract herself this way and I can distract myself only with alcohol. The problem is I want her in my life as a person who really understands me and makes me feel alive and well but AITA for not being able to stay as just friends?\nShe is okay with staying good friends and help each other at hard times but I still have huge feelings for her and she knows that.\n\nI think I am the a-hole here in my opinion. What do you think?",

      "title": "AITA for getting angry with my friend for blowing me off most of the day even though shes staying AT MY HOUSE?",
      "description": "Okay! So! First time poster. This just happened and I really need to vent and see if I'm wrong for getting angry. I'll change some names in case this is seen anywhere. You see, me and my best friend who we'll call Choob, have been friends for about 8 years - she's the very closest I've had. Strong friendship, and we've been through a lot. Even though we live 20 minutes from each other as of late with life getting in the way, on top of the general lack of motivation that comes with mental issues, we see each other once every two or three months. This weekend was our meetup. Two weeks prior, Choob's mom (who I call mom) asked us to take her Valentine's weekend since they were going out of town. Choob is old enough to stay home alone by herself, but I guess she wanted her to be in trusted company, whatever, haven't seen her since the beginning of January so I'm down!  \nThis weekend we also had the county fair. We were going to go Friday, but she just recently got a new boyfriend. I was not going to third-wheel. I called up another friend of mine from High School to ask if she had any plans that Friday, and I hadn't seen her since before Christmas break. She said she couldn't but she WAS going to SeaWorld that Friday and offered me her free ticket. Choob has a SeaWorld pass. I clear it with her and we instead go to SeaWorld and say we'll go to the fair Saturday.  \nNow SeaWorld was the best. Hadn't been there in 12 years! Also met up with another friend of mine and HS Friend's. Loved Mako and Manta. We stayed until closing, and after my HS Friend went home, and other friend decides he wants to continue hanging out so we go see the Prodigy (great movie, ass ending).  The day was very eventful.\n\nNow onto Saturday. We stay in bed for a good while before knocking out some chores. We both mutually decide we're exhausted from yesterday's festivities and we no longer want to go to the fair. Which is totally fine. We spend time hanging out and since it was going to be her and her boyfriend that were going to the fair, I suggest they meet at the park down the street so they can at least spend time together. I wouldn't want to keep her from her boyfriend, new relationships (her first real legitimately good one), puppy love, honeymoon phase and all that - I've been there. They do, and I just tell her to text me so I know she's okay because I get concerned. She leaves at around 2:30, I suggest getting back around 4-4:30, so we can still do things and she'll have hung out with him. Eventually, my step dad (stepnub) and I are hungry and we want food.  She's no longer answering me, and I try to call her. Twice. She ignores my phone calls. Twice.  \nI text her to answer her phone, and she responds \"uhh\" as if I'm bothering her. I explain we're going to get food and I'm trying to ask what she wants. She gives me a vague response (it's subway, didn't tell me the bread cheese or if she wanted it toasted, had to wing it) - I expected we would go get her so she could come with. But she doesn't. At this point I'm annoyed because my stepnub is here wanting to buy food for us and she couldn't be bothered to tell me what exactly she wanted, and didn't text me until *hours later*. After we had already got home.\n\nShe texts me, asking if I care *if she now goes to the fair*. I'm completely blown away. She ignores my calls, my texts, doesn't thank us for the food, and now she's asking if she can go to the fair? Clearly she already had her mind made up at this point.\n\nShe comes back to my house and asks me if I'm angry at her. I'm not one to sugarcoat and I was livid. I immediately told her that I was, and she seems surprised and asked me why, and then gets to apologizing over and over saying she didn't want me to be angry with her, while continuing to get ready (which nullified the apology for me). I try to explain to her why I'm angry. I told her you can't just blow me off while you're staying at my house for your boyfriend of a week. That just seems plainly disrespectful to me. I also ask her why can't they just go tomorrow when she isn't at my house since I'm not going to the fair. No legitimate answer other than another friend of hers wanted to go, other than that just some more stuttered apologies and asking me not to be angry with her. And then she leaves with the food we got her, and mumbled a half-assed apology to my stepnub who's absolutely blown away that she's treating our home like a, \"flopper house\", as he put it. \n\nShe's at the fair now with them. I completely understand time with friends, but she has already gone to the fair once with her boyfriend earlier this week. I don't understand the need to go again, and blow me off, sitting here, stirring in my own anger over what she just pulled on me. My stepnub is absolutely fuming over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I finished typing this my mom has now found out and her mother has been called. Her parents aren't happy. Will probably update. I really need to know AITA for all this?",

      "title": "AITA for cutting out my high school friends out of my life because my SO did not get invitation to one of their wedding?",
      "description": "This happened many years ago but it has bothered me bit every now and then.\n\nI had these friends I had known for 8 years. It was mixed group from my friends from elementary school and high school. During and after high school we pretty much spent all our free time either drinking/partying/hanging out or playing games online with this group.\n\nSomepoint one of them decided to get married. I had known him from elementary school and her bride ever since their whole relationship. \n\nFor me weddings have always been family party. In my family it is given that any SO someone has is also invited. Weddings are all about love, parthership and family so in my family it is considered extremely rude to excludes other peoples family members. The invitation to the wedding did not have avec on but I never thought anything about it. \n\nWhen we were having bachelors party for my friend the topic of brining SOs to wedding came up. It was then when I realized that my SO isn't invited, but everyone elses is.\n\nIt really hurt me. At this point I had dated this girl for 3 years and lived together with her for 1 year. She was and still is very much essential part of my life. \n\nIf I had dated this girl only a short time and if we hadn't lived together I would have totally understood why she wasn't invited. However girlfriends of other people who they had dated way shorter and didn't even live togheter were invited so it made no sense to me exclude her. I only saw it as an way of an insult for whatever reason to not include her.\n\nI also understand that especially for brides weddings are one of the most important days in their life. It is their party and they can invite whoever they want. \n\nAnyway, after giving it thought after the bachelors party I decided to decline the wedding invitation. There is no way I could go to a wedding without my SO who I will probably spent rest of my life with. It would be too disrespectful towards her. I wished them best in their life and I have not contacted anyone on that group since or no one from that group has contacted me. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n",

      "description": "A girl I‘m going out with (who is, to be honest, more a Friends with Benefits than my girlfriend, as I don‘t want a relationship), just moved out of her parents house into her own place.\n\nShe has plenty of income, and felt that she was feeling lonely at her new place. She used to have a cat with an ex of hers, but her ex decided to kidnap it, and she hasn‘t been able to see it since or had any opportunity to keep her. She likes cats.\n\nI‘m allergic to cats. I love them, but I‘m very allergic to them. I love dogs, and she knows this as whenever we go out on the street, she sees my excitement whenever we see one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe‘s been looking to adopt for a few weeks now, and has been telling me she wants to get a dog \\*and\\* a cat. That way they can play with each other and not be lonely when she‘s out to work. I love the idea, but I‘m scared of being too allergic to the cat, so as not to come to her place a lot in order to avoid the allergies. \n\nThree days ago, she tells me theres this pet store very near my place, just as I‘m leaving her house. I tell her let‘s go over there and check out what they have. \n\nWe see the puppies and the cats. We take out a few of the cats to see what my reaction is, and at first I‘m okay, but after a bit I start getting an itchy throat and runny nose. She likes the Sphinx and tells me it probably wont affect me as much as it doesn‘t have any hair, but as we tried, it did give me a reaction. This whole time, I‘m trying to tell her to get whatever she likes, as I‘m not gonna be the owner, and I don‘t want to affect her choice of a pet. She tells me she doesn‘t mind, and asks me what my choice would be (a dog or a cat), knowing well what my answer was. I try to tell her I don‘t want to affect it, but it‘s true that puppies are not so easily found in shelters, and a cat would be a bit easier to get.\n\nAfter a bit, she decided to get a 5 moth old husky. I‘m noticeably excited, and she signs all the documents, pays, and we go out. I go back home, she takes the puppy to her place.  \n\n\nAs soon as she gets there, she starts texting me how overwhelmed she feels about the dog, as it‘s very scared, and she didn‘t know she had to teach her everything from going to pee outside to even walking inside her place and up and down the stairs. She tells me she now can see a cat would be much easier, and a dog wouldn‘t give her the love she wanted to feel, but a cat would.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe start looking for options. Going back to the pet store and getting a cat (but the money for the dog wouldn‘t be refunded or count for the other purchase), taking her to a shelter to get adopted, or selling her online on a forum.\n\nToday, I proposed this idea: I‘ll take care of the dog. Go over to her place twice a day, take her out on walks, train her, watch for her and take her to the vet any time she needs. That way she can at least try out what having a dog is, maybe the puppy would be more comfortable after a bit and give her the love she needs. She can also get a cat from a shelter and have the best of both worlds, without the responsibility of taking care of the dog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe tells me I‘m being an asshole cause I‘m the one who wanted to have a dog, and I‘m trying to force her into having one even though she doesn‘t want one. I obviously would love to have one. I can‘t take one as my roommates wouldn‘t allow me to, but I don‘t know what to do. Taking her to a shelter would probably get her a new home fairly quickly as she is a beautiful puppy and she‘s very quiet and shy, but I honestly wouldn‘t like to let her go, precisely because of that. I‘m telling her it‘s clearly her decision, and I don‘t want to affect her if she wants to donate her, but at the same time I don‘t want her to lose all that money and lose the beautiful pet she just got. Am I being an asshole? What should I be doing?",

      "description": "So, for background and backstory, I'm 33 and single currently. \n\nWhen I was 22, my boyfriend at the time surprised me with a trip to Vegas to visit a certain aquarium (not sure if I can name things here) on Valentine's Day.  We lived in Arizona, so this was a pretty big deal. We actually hopped on a plane in the morning, and spent the day in Vegas, then hopped on another plane back that night. Yeah, it was pretty awesome, but it was 11 years ago and the dude and I didn't even date for that long. (He broke up with me, starting liking the ex of one of his other friends, long story, whatever).  We only dated like 4 months. \n\nThen when I was 28, the guy I was dating at the time had tickets to Coachella. He always bought two when they went on sale, with the intention of selling the extra for profit, but since we were dating at the time, he gave it to me and I paid for most of the gas on the road trip to California. We also didn't last long. About 6 months. That trip put a lot of stress on our already not that great relationship, and he turned into not that great of a guy. Not the place to talk about it though. \n\nSo, to this freaking day, if Vegas is brought up in casual conversation, my mom just has to chime in with the fact that these two things happened. I've expressed how uncomfortable I am with it multiple times, but she doesn't get it. \n\nFor instance, I was out it dinner with my parents and my aunt and uncle and their significant others. My aunt mentioned that her daughter (my cousin) is going to Vegas for the first time with her husband. This conversation immediately followed.\n\nMom: oh! Vegas. (My sister) had her bachelorette party in Vegas! Motosurf has actually been there a few times!\n\nMe: yeah, I have.  We don't have to bring that up. \n\nMom: I'm not saying anything! An ex boyfriend of motosurf actually brought her there on Valentine's day! She's actually gotten a few great trips and things from exes! \n\nMe: yeah, we don't have to talk about it. \n\nMom: it's fine! One ex also took her to Coachella! She's had so many great experiences with ex boyfriends!\n\nMe: so many, yet none of them stuck! \n\nI then whispered to my mom that she didn't have to mention this every time Vegas was brought up. She got huffy and told me she didn't do that and has been a bit short with me since then. \n\nShould I feel like an asshole for telling her to freaking quit it?\n\nTl;dr years ago I went on trips with short lived exes and my mom keeps bringing it up in casual conversation. I told her to stop and now she's huffy about it. ",

      "title": "AITA for not letting my FIL bring his dog over to my house?",
      "description": "This happened two weeks ago. My SIL was in town staying with us and my FIL wanted to come over the next day for lunch. He told my wife he wanted to bring his new (he’s had the dog for a few months now) dog over so SIL can “see” him. My SIL has already met the dog over Christmas break, and informed us then that the dog was tinkling on the carpet out of nervousness. The subject of FIL coming for a visit back then with the dog was discussed and my wife and I decided to not let him bring it. \nNow, we have a dog of our own. I’m not a dog person but my wife and kids finally convinced me to get one (after about two years of discussions and numerous promises to train the dog properly and make sure it meets my criteria) and she’s great, but I still don’t really like other dogs. We’ve had other dogs over before, once when some family showed up for a visit with their dog in tow, and again when other family was in town and they had no other option but to bring it. That’s it. My wife, SIL and FIL are all aware of my feelings on the matter. \nSo I told them no, the dog can’t come over but FIL can. My wife and SIL gave me a lot of grief for that and continued to pressure me to let him bring it. They said since we’ve had other dogs over I shouldn’t have a problem with it. I reminded them that the first time was a surprise and the second time was a “need” situation, where my FIL simply “wants” to bring his dog. My FIL is rather entitled and I explained  to them I felt a visit from his dog would open the floodgates to him to bring it every time he visits, which wife and SIL agree that’s something he would do, but still were upset that I wouldn’t relent and just let FIL bring it. This isn’t the first time FIL has tried to get me to allow his dog over here, and I feel I shouldn’t have to keep explaining my opinion and repeatedly tell him “no.” AITA?",

      "description": "In late 2017 I ended a very long relationship (several years). It look me a few months to even sort-of get over that, eventually hitting the dating scene in like eight months later, even though it was still tough.\n\nI messed around with some people and loved being single, but after being a bit of a ho for only two/three months I met a really great woman who I’ve been dating ever since.And she’s \\_genuinely\\_ great, no bullshit here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I just really don’t know if being in a relationship is what I want.I often want to be “free” in a way that you just can’t be in a relationship, I want to sleep around (I will not cheat on her, never have on anyone and never will), etc.But I don’t know if I really want these things, or if it’s just my dick and some immaturity talking…they feel like “bad” reasons for ending what’s otherwise a great and fulfilling relationship with a great, healthy, clean, sane person who I look forward to being around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd when I think of leaving her it really bums me out. Both because I wonder about being lonely, missing her, and also because she \\*really\\* loves me. She’s expressed it and it’s obvious, and I think breaking up with her would really surprise her and deeply, deeply hurt her. She’s also got few friends in the area and whatnot, no family (she only recently moved here), and so I just think about her being all alone dealing with this and it fucking crushes me.Am I the asshole for feeling this way and considering throwing away a rare thing—a good relationship—for immature and base impulses/desires?",

So last year we both had animal ears and a tail to be the same character at our separate schools. However when the day came his school was closed due to snow and they decided to reschedule. I took in his costume for a coworker without one (with his permission) and tidied them away at school when the day was finished (the children would wear the ears during their play time).\n\nHis World Book Day was rescheduled for weeks later. He told me at the time when it was supposed to be but didn’t really mention it after that- until the night before when he asked for the costume. I told him I’d left it at school and he was really annoyed. I said if he’d wanted to wear it he should have reminded me to bring it home because I’d completely forgotten about his World Book Day. He said because I’d taken them into school it was my responsibility to bring them home and he didn’t need to remind me. It was a minor spat and in the end we cobbled together and made him a Diary of a Winpy Kid costume and it was all fine.\n\nAt the time I thought it was his responsibility to remind me because it had been weeks since it had been mentioned but now I’m kind of thinking that if I’d taken them into work I should have brought them home for him.

Carl used to work at this restaurant years ago (way before Steve started coming up). While working his new job, he still came into the bar often to visit, but had never met Steve. Carl as a person is... a wonderful friend. Carl as a bartender is....not the best. He's still in his first few shifts behind the bar (used to serve) It takes him a little extra time for drinks and doesn't dish out price breaks the way other bartenders do. No biggie. He's learning. We tip him the same (30%) as other bartenders. I can see how other people could get frustrated though. \n\nOur problem begins with Steve. He doesn't like Carl at all. He complains that Carl is too slow, too hipster and too stupid to figure anything out. I've never noticed anything wrong about Steve's food or drink orders- just that he's slow to get drinks, charges full price and sometimes uses the wrong glassware (but same volume of drink).\n\nBefore, Steve only quietly mentioned his irritations from the other side of the room at a table, out of earshot of Carl. However, that changed when we were sitting at a closer table la. After a few drinks, Steve started talking louder than normal. I wasn't sure if Carl could hear or not, but I was VERY embarrassed to say the least. No one else at our table really seemed to notice Steve talking- we had all been drinking except me (DD for the night.) I could tell Steve would have been a dick if I told him to lower his voice, so I didn't say anything and changed the subject.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I privately told Steve that his behavior wasn't cool and to not do it again? I'm glad that situation kind of resolved itself, but I don't want to repeat itself. I especially don't want Carl thinking that we don't like him or are supporting him while he learns a new job.\n\nTL;DR- Friend A and Friend B don't know each other. Friend A and I are at a bar while Friend B is the bartender who isn't great at his job. WIBTA if I told Friend A to to lower his voice while he talking shit about Friend B/bartender's work skills?",

      "title": "AITA for smoking pot?",
      "description": "I have enjoyed smoking marijuana in different amounts in different phases of my life - I experimented (once in a blue moon) with pot and some other halucinagens, as well as alcohol, all while in high school.  In college, I smoked semi-daily (like maybe 3-5days a week) and drank considerably more. Senior year of college I was working nearly full time while going to school so I binge drank less, but still regularly drank and still smoked daily (like, daily).  \n\nNow about 5 years out from graduation, I would say my smoking and drinking is similar to my senior year of college, but slightly declined.  I've recently been cutting back on alcohol, but its really for weight gain (beer). \n\nI was a solid student, missed homework assignments and compensated with high test scores, went on to play a college sport and get a STEM degree, like I mentioned worked nearly full time my senior year and had a solid job right away. \n\nI'm now debt free, my salary has steadily increased and I've moved my career in the direction I want it to go. I've expressed some displeasure with various work situations, and extreme dislike of particular employers, but I dont vent nearly as much as she does - I'm not complaining, it's just how each of us are, she talks more about her work than I do about mine. \n\nOccasionally, usually when she is upset about something else already, she will complain about me smoking pot so frequently.  Another situation I've noticed is if I'm cutting back on alcohol (like now) or caffeine - she seems to see that I'm controlling my substance intake and decides it must be a good time to harp on pot again.  \n\nHer overall substance use is lower than mine, and always has been, but she has known me since high school (I even had something of a stoner reputation when we started dating). \n\nI am admittedly lazy sometimes, always have been since long before pot. But I'm generally on top of my shit. And -  She doesn't complain that I'm lazy. No issues like being noticably stoned at inappropriate events.  I'm attentive, she often doesn't know if I'm high or not.\n\nThat was the case tonight.  I came home and she was noticeably upset, nothing to do with me but she told me about it and I comforted her, she was calming down some and I've got my arm around her on the couch, I think we're about to settle in and watch a show before bed.\n\nThen she notices my eyes are red, asks if I smoked, which I did and I said as much, and she got all huffy, got up to brush her teeth and remained more distant the rest of the night. No TV show.\n\nShe didnt say more than \"I wish you wouldn't always do that\" but I can tell that she somehow feels that it invalidates the attention I gave to her issue a moment before.  Like, I listened, reflected back with her and helped her articulate her feelings, did my best to validate and support her.. but I was high while doing it so I'm an asshole? Like, am I? \n\nAm I an asshole for being high all the time, without causing issues by my being high?  Like, when I have tried to approach this topic with her she cant offer a reason why she doesn't like it.",

      "description": "I have a co-worker I've had feelings for since I met her when I got hired. Initially I tried to keep work and infatuation separate because I just got hired and it's bad news, but we're assigned to work together a lot and the more I got to know her the stronger my feelings got. We soon started texting a lot and talked about hanging out outside of work. A few months into talking she mentioned her boyfriend during conversation and I expressed my surprise. What surprised me even more was that she's been with him for years. She reasoned that she likes to keep it private so she doesn't talk about it much, but regardless we continued a good personal friendship and work relationship.\n\nDown the road, some drama happened between us where she broke up with her boyfriend and i got excited by the opportunity to jump in (disregarding my no work romance philosophy), but kept my distance so she had time to be emotionally available. We had a fallout when I confronted her about this mystery guy she's been hanging out with on Snapchat (which was a bad idea) and she admitted she's been dating someone new but claimed didn't want to tell or confirm to anyone. We talked it out but it wasn't the same after.\n\nWork was slightly more awkward, we only interacted with each other only when we had to for work and only briefly. Luckily we didn't have to work together in the same room. A few months of this and we were assigned to work together again, but this time I had more self control and respected her space. I stopped stalking her Snapchats and such and focused more on myself. We slowly warmed up to each other again with me joking around a lot and she reciprocated better than before. We regained our texting and friendship again but I kept my distance when relationship was brought up. I also found out that she had a new boyfriend.\n\nFinally, she also broke up with him after a few months because he was very jealous to say the least, and she kept talking about not being with guys for a long time. I still had a small amount of feelings but it wasn't until she asked me to hang out was when I told myself I should try it out and see where it goes. Joke's on me, she kept mentioning a friend the whole time and I started getting suspicious again. Eventually that friend turned into new boyfriend, but this time I was jaded from my past experience. We had plans to go out but I cancelled it because I was hurt from hearing the news and it didn't seem right if I still had feelings for her. We still talk, and we actually work together  a lot better now than before, but when she mentions her boyfriend I completely shut out of the conversation. \n\nI'm trying to make peace with myself and move on, because if she didnt see me romantically the first few times, it's obvious she won't have feelings for me ever. If I do something we're both interested in, she seems upset that I didn't include her (she never asks me to hang out) and tries to tag along when I want to go out alone for lunch, and I find an excuse where she can't come with me. I have a feeling she thinks I'm being moody and passive aggressive. Sometimes I do ask her to hang out but it's a mixed bag of answers. If she feels like we'll be together alone for the plan, she wants to bring an extra friend. Soon I just plan on not even making plans with her because her answers always seem conflicted to me.

      "description": "Obligatory throwaway account because a coworker knows my account\n\nOkay so, I have a friend / coworker that I've known for over a year. We are good friends and hang out and all that. We initially began hanging out in a larger group, but over time the friend group fractured and turned into smaller friend groups. He is very anxious about social interactions and comments frequently that he thinks people don't want to hang out with him or invite him to things. \n\nHere is the thing though: as someone who has actively hung out with him regularly for the past year, I can honestly say it is difficult to hang out with him. He will change the venues and times about 3 times within the hour before the designated hang out, he'll freak out if certain people are invited (we once invited our manager's daughter because she is also a coworker and cool, and he made us disinvite her less than an hour before because he was worried she would say something about him to her dad), and he'll frequently just cancel less than hour beforehand.\n\nThat brings us to last week: I invited him to a social work event, and the usual runaround begins: despite him agreeing to the date and time (and mind you, this is a free event paid for by work so money isn't the concern), he starts coming up with excuses with why he doesn't need to go and how it's not important anyway. And here is where my potential assholery comes in: I told him that people have noticed that he's flakey and antisocial and if he truly does want more people to be his friend and hang out with him he should reconsider cancelling all the time.\n\nThis really stressed him out and his girlfriend told me on Friday (this happened on Monday) that he's still really upset about it. I told him because it's something I've wanted to breach for a while and it felt appropriate at the time, but knowing that he's so stressed out about it is making me reconsider. I know I can't take it back now, but I have to know, am I the asshole?\n\ntl;dr - told a flakey coworker that other people have noticed he's flakey when he tried cancelling on an event again and it really stressed him out and made him even more anxious.",

She apologized, but I didn't talk to her for a minute or two on our way to our next class. \n\nWhen we arrived to the next class, I said it was fine and I forgave her. She and another friend didn't do anything but tell me that I was being over dramatic and should've let it go because she apologized. This kind of thing doesn't happen pretty often because I'm usually a chill person and don't get mad quickly, and when it does, it usually is just a minute of me being a dumbass and ignoring her and then apologizing for being mad.\n\n So, Am I The Asshole for being upset about something that small?",

      "description": "My coworker is a good person and decent teaching partner but today she drove me up the wall.\n\nWe have a child in our class who has autism and is prone to emotional outbursts. He was upset about being asked to help with a task so he ran out into the hall.\n\nI was busy with a group of children in another area. My teaching partner wailed to me and told me to go after this child because she could not.\n\nI’ll tell you why she apparently can’t. Her knees have gone bad and so have her ankles. Okay I understand it’s painful but in this situation you need to make sure that child is okay.\n\nShe proceeded to tell me “I can’t be running after children.” And I told her she needs to at least check where he is exactly so we know he’s safe. She then told me not to get angry with her and left with her group of children in a huff. \n\nI took my group to the class because I wanted to chat with her right away. I managed to calm the child down and he was able to return to class as well.\n\n\nI stepped outside with my coworker and told her that despite her physical ailments, in an emergency situation like that she needs to keep an eye on the child. If it means your legs need to be in pain going downstairs or walking fast then so be it. I asked what she would’ve done if I wasn’t there. She said she’d walkie talkie other staff...\n\nWhat the actual fuck? By the time you do that the child could easily run away, out into the street or god knows where.\n\nI explained to her that she needs to locate the child immediately and she can’t be saying that she “can’t do this” right in front of the children. It’s very inappropriate.\n\nAnyway I made her cry and I did apologize but it needed to be addressed. In the moment I didn’t really care about her mobility issues because at the end of the day our job as educators is to ensure these children’s safety at all times.",

My mum and dad were catholic, dad more republican (Pro IRA, Anti British than my mum was)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo tonight, i was in a heavily protestant neighbourhood close to my area, invited by a girl (protestant) whom i lived with for 3 years in university, aswell as 3 other I in a house of 6.

Yet tonight a guy was making fun of me for being catholic, i gave it back as him being a protestant (as ya do up north), so turns out he and his family were well known in the community and in this in this area and no taxi company/service would take me from a protestant area to my catholic area (and vice versa). Barman who was a protestant, knew where i lived and got me a taxi to \\*insert my area\\* without me telling him my address or where i l was from( how did he know?)

      "description": "Backstory: Around twice a month, I wake up in the middle of the night unable to breathe. This has been going on for the 5 or so months. This was worrying but I didn't think much of it since I was back to normal right after I woke up. Recently however, I woke up more than once in one night and was terrified. I thought I was going to suffocate to death in my sleep. \n\nIssue: I went to the doctor and told him about this. Judging from what I told him, and the fact that I'm overweight, he said it's probably sleep apnea. He told me what caused it, how it's treated etc. But after this, he told me to go home and video myself sleeping to see if it is actually sleep apnea. I explained that I'm not comfortable doing that, he replied that I don't have to show him. I then said that I don't have a way of recording 7 hrs of video footage as my phone is a dinky 8gb iphone, he replied by telling me to borrow some video camera that can. \n\nThe reason this was annoying me is because he said there's something called a sleep study which can be done. This seemed much better. However, he said that before I could do one, I needed to see if it was actually sleep apnea. Isn't the whole point of the sleep study to diagnose if it is sleep apnea? Why do I need to test it myself, and then get it officially tested? I heard that this condition is potentially life threatening and that I may actually be suffocating more often than I realise which only exacerbates my anger.  \nAm I the asshole for being angry at my doctor after this situation?",

      "description": "So my S.O. (I don't know what else to call someone I'm in a flirtationship with) is a very sweet guy. He asked me out and I said yes but I'm not allowed to date and all. I broke up with him a few days into our relationship because I felt overwhelmed and all and we sort of stopped talking for a while and then we got back together. The problem is, he says he loves me but is also attracted to another girl.\n\nSo we're in a flirtationship, as we call it that ourselves.\n\nSo a few days ago he and I meet up. It's an almost date. We're fine and having fun the entire time and we also were fine after that too. He acted super happy that he got to see me and all. He said stuff like \"I love you\" and \"I wanna take you to my favorite places it's gonna be so romantic\" (I'm paraphrasing) before the date and all.\n\nAnd then he suddenly stops talking to me. He doesn't even reply to my goodnight text and he ALWAYS replies to it. I'm like no not again please no what did I do because this has happened before. He acts so nice and then suddenly acts like he doesn't want anything to do with me. He won't text or anything even while being online. And it was going the same way.\n\nSo I was like \"hey we need to talk about something important\" (this is all through text by the way). And he said \"what's up\". And I replied in a very calm, collected and grown up way. I asked him to give me a small heads up if he won't be active for a few days on end and all. I told him that he's not just a friend I can greet with a \"haha how were the 3 days you didn't talk to me lmao but it's fine\". We're almost dating! I deserve a small heads up when he's not texting me. \n\nAnd he replies with \"oh, sorry\"\n\nI tell him that it's not me trying to be controlling or annoying, I just wish communication would be a priority in our relationship.\n\nAnd it seems as if things are back to normal. But I don't want to be the crazy bitch in a relationship. I  don't think he's cheating on me or anything like that everytime he's not replying to my texts. I just feel hurt and disrespected when he does this closer-then-ignore act.\n\n\nAITA for asking my SO to give me a heads up when it comes to these things?\n\n",

      "description": "\nSo basically a little bit ago I had a realization that my ex, (who I was still friends with) was seeming hypocritical and manipulative. What caused the the realization I was will get to later, bout for now I’ll start with some backstory.\n\nSo earlier last year me and this other girl were dating. She had previously been dating my other friend and she then encouraged us. However, I was hesitant. See, I’m asexual, so I don’t have sex and often like to take relationships slow. The friend that was previously mentioned (I’ll be calling her A) and my ex (who I will be calling K) got together by making out. In MY bathroom.\n\nThat is also not to mention that some drama had gone down between K and her other ex while she was with A. Appearently K had gotten back together with said ex because someone else messaged K saying that they liked her ex. WHILE she was dating A. I found out this was true after logging into K’s Quotev account and reading the messages for myself.\n\nHowever, despite this, I decided to date her anyway. Later, we had a sleepover, to with I expressed SPECIFICALLY that I’m “Not really ready to kiss as of now.” Despite this, she kissed me anyway. I went along with it because I was awkward and I was tired.\n\nWe went on for a few more months before we decided to break up, well, I broke up with her. She begged he to come back, to which I said no.\n\nMe and K continued to be friends. She was still kind of bitchy and always talked about how gay she was and how she’ll never be attracted to guys (btw she now has a boyfriend).\n\nHowever, what made me completely done with her was that one day I had a panic attack and she asked why I was crying, I couldn’t answer, obviously, so someone else told her. She scoffed and said that I wouldn’t be so upset about it. However, the next day, the person who caused the attack came up and apologized to me. I said it was okay and that I find of just freaked out because she was yelling at me. K was behind me when it happened and defended me, saying “Oh, yeah, because you were just yelling at her, it’s fine.”\n\nOkay, now, I will admitt, K has done some good things and wasn’t... too bad of a girlfriend. But I told her that I didn’t like her anymore and that she was an asshole and she just shrugged. A little while later, a mutual friend approached me, taking her side saying “this is so stupid! You should just some hating each other and be friends again.” I told the friend off saying stuff about how she was aweful and how I’m allowed to not like people. She huffed and sulked the rest of the day, causing more people to get mad at me.\n\nAt this point, I fell attacked and don’t know if I’m in the right or wrong. Me and K are still talking like civilized people (because she’s one of the only people who I share fandoms with) but I really don’t like her. By now everyone just associates me by hating K. But am I really the asshole?\n",

      "description": "My husbands half-sister's grandparents (so not my in-laws) own a car repair shop. My husband car is still running, but is having issues that needed to be fixed, such as the car not wanting to go over a certain RPM. My husband called the shop a week and a half ago and they said they could begin looking at the car Tuesday if we brought it in that Friday night. I thought it was silly to drop it off and have it sitting in a lot for four days, especially since it was still running, so we dropped it off Monday night. It is now 8 days later and they are just now looking at it to figure out what is wrong. At 4pm today they told my husband they were going to test a part tomorrow and that was it they were going to order it. They won't give us a timeline, but I imagine its going to be upwards of another week. We need this second car. My car is a company vehicle so when Im at work its with me. My husband took off some days for our kids spring break (tomorrow) and instead of being able to go out to do things they are stuck at home. Im pissed and there are already reviews online that suggest this is a common problem with this shop. My husband says its because they are down a mechanic, but I feel if that's the case they should be transparent with customers about how long things will take. So, WIBTA if I left a less than pleasant review on their website? ",

      "description": "So I was out selling stuff at a garage sale today and a woman and her small kid were looking around. There was a toy space shuttle that the kid wanted, and he was about to walk off with it but his mom saw and put it back. They moved on to another yard, but they passed by again after a few minutes and were about to leave in their car. The kid was walking behind his mom and picked up the toy and was going to leave with it. Now I'm sure the mom would have noticed when she saw her son, but my girlfriend and I both yelled \"hey!\" loudly. It was instinct on my part, and thinking back on it makes me think I should have said \"excuse me\" or just waited for the mom to notice. I will admit that my gf has quite a brusque manner of speaking, so she probably sounded aggressive, but I can't exactly replicate it in my head. Anyway, the kid drops it (or his mom took it out of his hands; I can't remember) and yells \"Hey, don't talk to my son like that he's only 4!\". I remained pretty level-headed, but I was pretty agitated because we didn't say anything bad; the kid didn't even seem upset! However, I tried to difuse the situation by calmly telling her \"I wasn't yelling at your kid, I was only trying to get your attention\" as she walked away. She proceeded to turn around and give me the cuntiest death glare I've ever seen in my life(it should be noted that her hat read something to the effect of \"resting bitch face\"; she looked like the can-I-speak-to-the-manager type). At this point I was really upset and even felt my blood pressure go up but I just looked back at her almost bewildered. She then proceeded to drive off, presumably pissed off. Am I the asshole for yelling, or for hating her on the inside, or both?",

      "description": "I got married a week ago. We got engaged in  November so had 4 months to plan the wedding, there was a bit of contravercy around it though...My husband's sister is getting married in May and has been planning it for 2yrs. Apparently she and their mum were Ticked off by our timing. When he first messaged his mum to tell the news, her imidiate response, 'Can't you wait until after [sister] gets married?' (No congratulations or anything) The fact that she'd been planning her wedding for this long and then her brother turns around and suddenly gets married before her apparently seems unfair to them. I Think she may have felt it was stealing her thunder, taking away from the excitement of her big day.\n\nI'm Not completely sure how much she was bothered by this. Their mother didn't seem annoyed so much, she just suggested we wait. When we were adament about the date though, she got on board and began excitedly planning with us. He messaged his sister to ask if she was okay about it, but it so happened that in that moment she was already annoyed about something unrelated, sontook the opportunity to complaining about that, the wedding thing wasn't really discussed. He said he couldn't tell if she was actually bothered by our wedding, or if she was just bothered by this other issue that came up. I Never heard her complain specifically about our wedding. Once she'd calmed down she seemed okay with us, so we carried on with plans. On the morning of the wedding, as I was getting hair done, her mother said, \"I Do wish you had waited...\" After I brought it up, but didn't press the issue. This got me worrying that the sister resents me. I Honestly didn't believe we were doing anything wrong, but still didn't want her feel spited.\n\nI Admit that I do understand her annoyance to an extent, but honestly think her and the mother were being a tad unreasonable,  I don't think this would have been sufficient reason for me and my fiancé to have delayed our plans  \n\nMy reasoning-\n\n•Our day will detract from hers. Everyone has been looking forward to hers for years, and is very happy for her. It's going to be a big event, whereas our was small and simple. When it comes I don't think us being married months earlier is going to make anyone less excited\n\n•We have life plans to fulfil, and I don't see why we should have to delay them any longer for anyone else \n\n•We're not getting any younger, and are aware of how long it can take to get pregnant, so want to start trying  as soon as possible. (She already has kids a family life)\n\n•It was her choice to wait 2yrs to get married. There's nothing wrong with this, however think they shouldn't expect others to put their own lives on hold for those years\n\n•Waiting until *after* her wedding would have meant only a month at most after theirs for ours. Would she not prefer us to have a couple of months between rather than a couple of weeks, if she's worried about it detracting from her's?\n\nSo AWTA? ",

      "description": "So here’s the backstory, I have a weird fear of getting knocked up, like to the point it’s irrational and I know it is. Met a great guy and we’ve been together for 3+ years, and in the beginning, I just kind of avoided the whole sex thing until he brought it up about 6 months into the relationship. I decided that maybe just doing it would make me realize I was being irrational, but it only caused me to spiral into my own fears and spend countless hours googling pregnancy symptoms for nothing. I told him about this and we kind of just called off trying again for two years. For some reason, after those two years passed, it kind of clicked and the fear went away, our sex life has been great since like August. But recently, the fear has come back out of the blue, and I’ve been avoiding telling him. We’re long distance atm so it’s easy to make excuses as to why we can’t meet to do it (out of town next weekend, on my period, working overtime, etc...) but I think he’s starting to catch on and he‘s even gotten a little shitty about it. AITA for changing my mind about wanting to do it and not telling him? ",

      "description": "tl;dr I'm into with this girl, suddenly got the cold shoulder, and then told her I was available anyway because I'd already invested so much\n\nI fell heels over head for a girl in my junior year of college. I then spent all of my social capital to win her over (calling in favors, etc.) and ended up dropping out and moving back in with my parents. I live in the midwest, and she now lives in Phoenix, twenty minutes away from where my sister lives. I visited when my sister got married, and she (the girl I'm into) wanted to pick me up and take me out. So I thought, \"fuck yeah, everything worked out after all.\" Then I went back to the midwest, and later returned to visit my sister and her husband again. This time *I* took her out, and we had a good time. I went back to the midwest, and told her about a week before Christmas \"I'll be in Phoenix from the 23rd to the 28th.\" She had moved to LA and was visiting family over Christmas break in Phoenix too, so I invited her to dinner and a movie about rock climbing (on the first date she took me rock climbing). She said she wanted to, but said she was \"going to spend all the time with them\"--meaning her family--\"that \\[she\\] can.\" I said \"no problem,\" even though I was a little hurt. She didn't respond, so I texted her a couple days later and said, \"I'm here until tonight, and up for anything.\" No response five days later...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter rereading this post, I must say I feel pretty pathetic. This is probably my all time low. And I've had some pretty low lows. Thank you to whoever read this far, and have a happy new year.\n\nUpdate: she blocked me on Instagram I think. Her sister’s Instagram says she follows her, so I think she didn’t delete her account.\n\nUpdate 2: she must have deleted her instagram account",

I respected her as a person(she was very kind to me, this is the first time she \"acted out\" towards me), then in choir today while we were practing songs for the musical she dropped a gum wrapper down my pants and someone recorded it on Snapchat. I did not notice until 7th period when one of my classmates asked me if I had noticed anything. I was confused and asked her \"what?\", She told me and said \"Thats why me and bff's sister were laughing.\" I was pissed but couldnt go to the principal yet since it was the last hour and I liked the sub we had.\n\nAfter school, I told the principal everything. He said he would do something about it since that had broken a lot of the policies.\n\n\nSo I might have ruined her chances to continue being the manager. AITA?\n\nSIDE NOTE: Her older sister was appearently an asshole to my older sister back when my sister was in highscho so my parents were aware of the family already.",

He always brushed me off by saying \"it's just a joke chill\" and saying that when he lived in the U.K. (he used to live there but we both live in America now) everyone called each other c\\*nt and it was fine. But in America that word has a completely different meaning which he knows about but doesn't give a sh\\*t. Plus I never call him any type of name like that (there's no equivalents for guys anyway)   \n\n\nI kinda regret acting the way I did because I don't normally lose my temper like that, but it was a very impulsive thing because I felt extremely disrespected. I want to apologize but at the same time I think he should apologize first because he started the whole thing. Everything was fine until he said that. What do you think? AITA?",

      "description": "Tonight was the start of our vacation to Florida. My mom, fiancee, and I were in the car making the 6 hour drive down. We stopped to swap drivers and my fiancee mentioned previously that she was angsty from being in the car so i asked if she wished to drive, the response i got was something along the lines of \"meh\" thinking she could go either way and me not wanting to just stand around i made my way to the drivers side and hopped in. As soon as she hops in she sorta leans in and snaps at me in a harsher tone than i was expecting \"next stop i drive\" all right, sounds good, i can do that. However she sits back in the passanger seat and proceeds to as best i can describe wall up. Her body language was defensive yet aggressive, i try and write it off and just get on the road. As best i could try at least, but i just couldn't shake the feeling of a porcupine sitting next to me. \n\nI wanna start this paragraph off by saying up front i can let my emotions get the better of me, i know it, and i dont like it. Over the past two years with my fiancee ive definitely learned more about controlling yet learning from them. With all of that out of the way back to the story, as i am driving along i can feel a bit of her anxiety, im aware of every grunt she made while adjusting how she was sitting, when she would take a big breath and just kinda sigh, which sometimes its just for her to correct her breathing pattern so i can understand on that one. However the three of four times she would take that breath and inflate her cheeks and , literally, slowly deflate. \n\nObviously, somethings not quite right to me. So i ask her what up? No reply was to be had. Somtime after this she grabbed a pair of headphones, and went even further into her own world. At one point she says take exit so and so, but i couldn't hear her, so i ask \"what?\", \"exit 298\" this exchange wasnt what got me, but what got me was the fact that as i asked her what, and while looking at her i see the exit sign for 298 go by. She tells me this as we are literally passing it. And now im seeing signs for a toll road. Great. I say \"as we are driving past it? Now where am i going\" she just sits there and continues to play on the switch, blankley. Fuck now what!? I panic and yell \"will someone tell me where the fuck i am going!?\" My mom pulls up the maps and gets to it. Turns out we didnt even need to take that exit. Ill admit it was probably Google maps being weird. At this point i admit i felt a little peaved but i focused on just driving. Some other idiots may have been on the road so i was trying to make jokes about look at so and so, but she was in her world, and my mom was in back in her own. Which is chill. However my fiancee being distant made me feel a little lonely on this drive, i dont think ive added its maybe 1am at this point, but the other half and i are night owls anyways. \n\nAfter the exit incident i decided im gonna try and find a good spot to stop and swap drivers. Hell she wants to anyways, maybe it'll help improve her mood. Well a little while later i get off the turnpike and we swap. From here on out it was pretty uneventful. I tried to help with navigation, figured it would be wrong of me to do similar as she did, admittedly i was tempted, but thats petty, and i truly do not wish to see her flounder, frustrated, or anything, i truly just want to make her happy, because when shes happy and smiling i find no greater joy! \n\nWe get to where we are staying we get settled pretty well. And we start to turn in for the night. Its maybe 2:30am by now. So its which is honestly close to our normal time for bed. Im still a little worked up over earlier, and i know that if i dont talk then she wont know whats bothering me and we'll lock ourselves into a cycle, and its shit all around. So i try to start a conversation, me knowing myself i think i could have approached it better, but i think knowing my anxiety about just talking about things to start with i did good in my presentation. So i start off with \"i decided to swap drivers in the hope it would improve your mood.\" Yes, obviously a bait question, but i wasnt looking for a fight. I was honestly just looking for a response, something. But she never even looked up from her phone. I dont know what i said next to try and start a conversation but her reply was \"well you were having mood swings\" first thing i said is \"ya, probably, but you have been living in your own little world of anxiety, and all i wanna do is try and help\" i was quite flustered by this and had to walk away, i said what i said with my emotions, and i didn't like it, anything more would have made things much worse. I dont know how long i was away, i know i paced about for a good minute before going outside for some fresh air. As an astronomy nerd i stared at the moon for god, too long, beautiful thing. Anywho after a good little bit i feel like i have calmed down enough to at least go back and be in the same room as her. \n\nBack in the room she is pretty much just as i left her, i think i started to take my cloths off and prep for bed, i say to her though \"all i wanted was to tell you how i felt, so you could know where i was, and to have you at least acknowledge thats how i feel.\" I was not met with a response. At all. After having just said what i said and being met with what i was met with i was feeling low, i just hold my arm straight out to the side and flop them down, and just stair at her with my mouth open in disbelief, finally she opens her mouth and im greeted with \"you remember that Facebook post mamma was telling us about? Well im just like that, all out of fucks.\" Guys this one fucking hurt, this one hurt like a good kick to the nuts. I dont even think i made it out the door before i was crying. And my friends, im a 6ft tall bearded dude who works with motorcycles, i was crying like a little bitch. I didnt make it far, before i turn around and while deffinantly letting emotions get the better of me i say \"do you enjoy this?\" Her reply was \"enjoy what?\" Insult, meet injury. Having already ran with the thought of asking her to sleep on the couch while i was looking at the moon, for some reason i felt it. And in a somewhat moment of clarity i said, as calmly as i can with tears in my eyes, and my heart on fire. \"If you truly cannot see what you have done, then i respectfully ask that you sleep on the couch tonight, only time will tell just how much you have hurt me tonight\" i got an eye roll back... \n\nAs soon as i closed the door i locked it and just collapsed to the floor, and just started bawling. You thought this bearded fuck was crying like a baby before? Lol that wasn't even the worst of it yet, i just let it out, i knew i needed it. I thought maybe i would cry myself to sleep, but no, that one little thought wouldnt go away. Idk what it was, but it was sorta relentless. After a good while i collected myself off the floor, and went to go blow my nose. Im in the bed now. I cant sleep, i know she cant either since shes been in the shower next to the room im in while ive been typing this. So guys im just feeling a little fucky, i feel like an ass for letting my emotions get to me, but im proud that it felt like i stood up for myself, while being met with passive agression and idk maybe it is maybe it isnt, gaslighting? From someone who i love dearly but didnt feel at all like my fiancee. In the end im hurt, i dont know what my next steps are, or how im even gonna talk to her tomorrow. I dont know if i should consider asking her to leave? This has me fucked up guys, this isnt me asking for advice, just letting it out ya know? like how can she tell me she loves me more than i currently can? like yes i know i tend to ponder if our relationship is worth it easier than she does but shit like this doesn't give me the warm fuzzies. So tell me reddit am i the asshole? \n\nTL;DR fiancee runs out of fuck, i tell her to sleep on the couch. ",

      "description": "Ok. Last night my partner and I were sitting on the couch together in my living room. I was playing Resident Evil 2: Remake and they said that it was very loud, so I lowered the volume from 18 to 14 (roughly 22%). 18-25 is the volume we normally watch TV at depending on the input source. At some point my partner says they need to get on a Skype video call (on their phone) with two other people. I say okay and they accept the call and put it on speaker phone at least 75% of max volume (as always). About 5 or so minutes into the call, this paraphrased exchange takes place:\n\nPartner: God your game is loud. Wanna lower it?\nMe: I already lowered the volume earlier.\nPartner: Well, I can't hear my call.\nMe: I can barely hear my game.\nPerson in the Skype call: (To my partner) Just use headphones.\nPartner: I don't have headphones.\n[I reach over and hand them a set of V-Moda Crossfade LP audiophile headphones with memory foam ear cushions]\nPartner: I'm not wearing those. They're huge.\n\nMy claim that they are noise cancelling doesn't change their mind. Annoyed, I sigh and pause the game then remember that I have a wireless headset lying around. I go get it. Luckily it has a charge and I go back to playing my game until my partner ends their call 25 minutes or so later. \nAfter the call, my partner is still upset with me for being reluctant to lower the volume. I respond that I would have been less reluctant if they had asked nicely instead of barking at me. I also tell them that it's inconsiderate to be on the phone in the living room while people are using the tv and that it's customary to either use headphones or go into another area since phones are easier to move than tvs are. I ask them if they can see how they were being rude and apologize for it. They respond by saying they should have just not come to my house in the first place and go to bed.\nThe next morning, they are still upset and say that I was the one being rude. I hold my ground and maintain that they were in the wrong for both snapping at me and failing to observe common courtesy behavior. Suffice to say, we don't make up before we both have to go to work. Since we can't agree on this, I defer to Reddit. Am I the asshole?",

I constantly get reminded of things such as, \"your stream sucks\", \"Matt is way better than you\", etc. They've started to turn streaming into a competition and are rooting for Matt. while trying to push me down.

I'm told that I should stop complaining and just accept he's better.\n\nIt's really starting to get on my nerves and I'm thinking about quitting streaming, all the fun has been sucked out of it.

I’ve been working my new job for just over a year and and he’s been the boss of the branch ever since it opened about two and a half years ago.  It all started out great.  Got great hours, decent pay, vacation.  But the entire time I’ve worked here, I only hear my boss complaining about how he doesn’t get paid enough, how he falls behind on the mounds of work that gets dropped on him, how he is getting a second job because he claims to not make enough money here (but I know he’s just an irresponsible spender and he makes plenty.)  It’s gotten really discouraging for me because I have intentions on moving up in the company but it just makes it so hard to hear him complaining.  I know his position isn’t as hard as he’s making it because I know he’s the kind of guy to try to make numerous short cuts that almost always end up backfiring on him and he’s also just a tad bit immature for his age.  I’ve wanted to say something to him.  But I just don’t know how to do it in a way that won’t offend him.  WIBTA if I told him to just keep all his problems to himself or should I just try to keep ignoring it?",

      "description": "Hi,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a 20 year old female. I get the bus to work most days. I am also a massive introvert, and shy. I really enjoy sitting on the bus, looking out the window with my headphones in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo two days ago, i got to the bus stop and there was this old man there (about 75?). He started a conversation which is fine, i don't mind small chit chat, i prefer not to but whatever, it's just being friendly. He asked me if i as going to college, i said no work (I look young for my age). He asked me how old i was and we talked about the weather (lol classic brits). Then I got on the bus, sat by myself at the top, happy days. The next day, yesterday, he was also at the bus stop. Again, he started a conversation, i went along with it. There was also another old woman at the stop he was talking to so i let them do most of the talking and just sat on my phone. Then today i didn't have work but needed to do some christmas shopping so i got the bus again, coincidentally at the same time, and he was there again! I've been getting this bus for over a year and hardly seen him before, but it probably is just coincidence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo today, he started a chat again about his coat, i mostly just say stuff like 'oh really' and 'oh yea that makes sense'. Like, i'm not that engaged in the conversation, just enough to be polite. I would really rather just keep to myself, but i don't want to be rude. Then he asked me if i was sitting upstairs or downstairs on the bus, i said i don't know, whichever is free. He said he was going to sit upstairs with me, i thought he meant like just generally upstairs. So the bus finally came and i was really happy to just sit in quiet and listen to my music. He let me on the bus first (I insist every time he can get on first, but he insists harder that i get on first). So i paid, and went upstairs. The top of the bus was empty except for one guy, i went all the way to the back to try and get away from him and sit in peace (Am i an asshole for doing this, i don't know :/ ). I heard him coming up the stairs so i slank down in my seat whilst turning my ipod on, but he looked around the entire bus, then came all the way to the back despite all the empty seats, and sat on the one right next to me and just carried on talking. He started talking about the history of the place we lived, asking me about where i work, he said he could be a reference for me if i wanted to quit my job?? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe just droned on the entire way, i really didn't say much, i just looked out the window awkwardly begging for the journey to end because i felt like he was in my personal space (Fair enough if the bus was full and it was one of the only seats, but it was empty!). I just wanted to listen to my music, but felt it would be rude to just shove my headphones in my ears. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don't want this to happen every time i get the bus, or am i just being an antisocial b\\*\\*ch? I'm just not very comfortable with it at all. So guys, am i the asshole?",

In my chosen field, jobs are definitely harder to find than fields like business or engineering. So in my fervor to have the best possible materials to apply with (i.e. resume, demo reel, portfolio), I've decided not to show my mother my portfolio.\n\nThis is because, growing up she has been somewhat overbearing in terms of making sure I've done everything I can and need to do. Now don't get me wrong, I love my mother to death and I would not be where I am without her, but ever since middle school she always wants to go over all of my work or all of my materials to make sure they are good enough. I know I was an annoying little shit for a kid, and she has always helped me and I could never discount that. \n\nNow at face value this isn't a bad thing, but I feel like enough is enough. I am a college senior, and she still forces me to show her my resume, my LinkedIn, my everything for her to check over like every two months, even when nothing has changed. She always says \"it takes a village\" to get things done, which I agree, but I always ask people in the field I'm in like friends and professors for feedback on all my stuff, so I've got that covered.\n\nAgain, this isn't an angry or bad situation, I'm just curious as to what y'all think. I of course love my mother and all of her help. But isn't it time for me to sink or swim on my own? I'm sure that will be how it is once I finally have a job and move out, so I'm sure I'm just complaining for no reason. Even so, I wanted to know y'all's thoughts. So, AITA for not having my mom \"check over\" my job hunting stuff?",

      "description": "I’ve noticed some pictures and videos are taken without the person noticing or their consent and honestly that’s creeped me out also because what if someone does that to me one day just because I’m browsing books or some shit? I hate myself, I know I don’t want a photo of me online just because I can ride a horse or order a damn milkshake. \n\nAnyway they’re amazed that disabled people can be people, they’re amazed a limbless person can be a parent, a horse rider doesn’t need to use their legs to ride or because someone is just buying some fucking food from the market! It annoys me, it’s like no one expects us to be able to do anything correctly or we can’t do shit at all. \n\nSome of the comments piss me off because people want to mourn for our problems or give us hugs. Please don’t touch me, you made me feel like shit by telling it like it’s a tragic ending.\n\nI’ll add I’ll understand if it’s someone seeing a machine that is used to help someone (like a small lift or cutlery that stays level no matter how much you use it) because it’s usually more of a “so that’s how it happens!” Reaction. \n\nAnyway, I’m asking because obviously I’m not normal, I don’t know if my annoyance is valid and if the reactions to these things are acceptable because of the difference. I’m worried I’m being out of line and I should be grateful because I guess it’s basically learning. \n\nI don’t know what’s so fascinating about it either so if someone can explain that to me, thank you.

This has gone on for about a  month and she gets mad at me for most petty reasons. This all occurred because the stress she got from having a newborn baby and the stress has been put on me. It got to the point where I have to give up schoolwork or after school activities for the baby. I have no grudge against the baby nor against my mother but today I broke down to her about her targeting me and why my brothers do the exact same thing in front of her and it doesn’t bother her. Now here is where I have a problem, my younger brother and I both know she is manipulative but my older brother refuses to believe it. I cried and poured my heart out to my older brother and mom and she found a way to make herself look like the victim. She always does this to all my brothers. We cry and talk to her but it all ends up to making her the victim which makes us feel like we failed as sons  therefore makes us feel guilty. This gotten out of hand so much that my younger brother has depression from watching his mom cry. And I honestly think it’s starting to affect me.\n\n\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "So here I am, outside my house cleaning off my deck from snow and leaves and my 11 month old puppy is out with me in my side of the lawn. Suddenly I look up to see he has disappeared into my landlords back yard. So naturally I start calling for him and he knows \"come\" very well. \n\n\n\nSo at the point he's just running around like a maniac and I know he's ignoring me. So I walk all the way over and I get close to him and ask him to sit. After a couple tries of him sitting and then running away from me like a game whenever I get close enough, I finally get a hold on his collar and starting marching us back to  our side of the house. Obviously he knows he is in trouble because he knows he is not supposed to be in our landlords yard so he's acting ashamed and not cooperating. \n\n\n\nHe is a pitlab mix and although he isn't big in height, he weighs an awful lot. Enough that I cannot lift him and therefore struggle to get him to move if he doesn't want to. For reference I am a 130 pound 5'4\" girl and he is probably about 50 pounds of pure muscle. \n\n\nSo I'm pulling him through the snow and leaves and we are both slipping all the way, and even though I was kind of upset he didn't listen I am by far no animal abuser and I stayed calm as we walked back. \n\n\n\nWe get to a wall of snow and leaves that he won't budge past. I'm struggling to pull him through it when I hear a man from the road who can see through our yard tree line scream \"Don't you be dragging that fucking dog!\". I don't say anything and just finally get him onto the driveway pavement and it's much easier for him to walk and I am just crouch walking while holding his collar. We get to our stairs and I let go and he proceeds to go up the stairs and wait at the door. Next time this happens I will for sure be bringing the leash with me, if that makes a difference. \n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR; AITA for holding my dog by his collar and pulling him along back to the house when he ran away into my neighbors yard and he knew he was in trouble? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "This is a long one and formatted on mobile, so strap in.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I joined a new school and instantly became really close to this girl, we will call her F. Now one Thing that is important to know about F is that she's madly in love with another close friend of mine, well call him J. Now me and J are lads, and he confesses a lot of his problems to me. As my friend ship with these two characters developed, I notice that F often pines for my attention. I don't mean to sound full of my self, but she would literally jump into my arms if I didn't answer her for more than 3 seconds\n\nNow our first fight happened when J started talking to her less, she accused me of stealing him and got mad at me. I tried calming her down and tried to reason with her. We didn't talk for about 3 days until she  apologized for what she had said. Now at first I thought, what's one fight. I soon realized that I liked her, but I knew she would never go out with me. What made it worse was J became my best friend, we helped each other through problems at home. She continued as of she hadn't done anything\n\nOur next fight happened about 3 weeks later, I'd noticed whenever she didn't have my full attention she'd say \"why do you hate me?\", and give me puppy eyes. I felt manipulated as even when it was really important that I pay attention to something she said this. I told her to stop and got defensive and said the exact same thing again. This hurt in particular since I was still hiding my feelings for her. Of course she didn't know so I can't blame her for that. \n\nSoon what started to happen F would ask me to tell something to J, And he'd tell me to say something back at her. I was effectively her communication method since he had stopped talking to her at this point. I felt terrible about it and soon starting going oIt and abusing some substances to forget about her. I soon realized how stupid this was and instead told her I liked her, her reaction was less than ideal. She completely shut me out for a week and a half. F told me we couldn't talk anymore as it was too awkward. She tried talking to me after that, but she didn't tell me she wanted to talk to me anymore, \n\nI got confused and just ignored her. And although she probably didn't mean to she hurt me a few times.lastly I wrote her a long letter about how she had made me feel and she didn't really react at all, she just kept trying to talk to me. She had pushed me to drugs though so I told her I didn't want to talk and she stormed out of class.\n\nAITA for cutting her off? I'm still good friends with F.",

One of the other members of our group is already itching to take over as DM. Today he messaged our group chat asking if we want to chip in 8 dollars to buy a 50 dollar player handbook to use instead of a digital copy. I haven't replied yet but others in the group seem to have no problem with this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow 8 dollars isn't a big deal to me, if he was asking me to chip in for pizza that'd be no problem, but doesn't it seem tacky to ask for money for a single item that can't really be shared? We're also not the only people he will use it with since he DMs online on the weekends and will probably continue to keep it after a third of our group leaves in Summer. This will 100% end up being his book rather than the group's, therefore he should buy it himself right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's nothing personal against this guy, I was also asked by the one of the neighboring English teachers in my town to chip in for a \"group barbecue\" (the grill itself, not the food) which I pretended not to read and ignored it until they forgot about it. What should I do if I'm confronted about it this time? AITA for thinking these \"group\" purchases are in poor taste and just an all-around dumb idea?",

Private servers are essentially your own personal version of the game you can customize to your liking, which you can then allow other people to connect to and play with you. Some unique private servers get very popular and can even make money. \n\nMy friend told me his idea of making a private server for this game similar to Fortnite. This friend has zero knowledge of programming or running a server, but sounded very willing to put effort into creating this. \n\nI was talking to another friend and ended up telling him my first friend’s idea. This second friend is a very good programmer and thought making this private server would be easy. We talked about how cool and fun this would be if it ever went live, and that was the end of that. \n\nA couple weeks later now my second friend has apparently undertaken this project of making the private server and my first friend caught wind of it and is upset with me. I told first friend he would never have made the server anyways because he lacked the knowledge and didn’t seem ambitious enough to learn how to do it. I also told him maybe he could just work on it with my second friend and be a co-owner or something.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my second friend about first friend’s idea? I didn’t tell him like I was trying to be sneaky or something in order to make money, I just told him how fun this idea would be and I guess he believed it enough to start working on it. I didn’t tell him where I had got the idea from either. ",

      "description": "So for a long, LONG, time, my girlfriend did not have a job as I had a really good one with a high income. I worked a lot but always made time to see her and such. We would always go out to eat at fine restaurants around us, go to shopping trips, travel etc. when she had money, she’d pay her share of whatever but when she didn’t I always picked up the slack. At times when money was rough for me, I still paid for things that I shouldn’t have and had to work extra hours to make up for it. I didn’t mind though, I made enough to the point where I was worry free. \n\nOur relationship is not the type where the guy is expected to pay for everything, we’ve made an agreement from day one to be a team, pull the weight 50/50 and that’s it. I payed for mostly everything though and never said a word to her about paying me back or doing something equivalent of the money I spent. But recently my girlfriend finally got her dream job and it’s been nice because nowadays, I can relax while i shoot her a text to bring home some takeout or do something of that sort and finally rest my mind at the fact of me not having to pay for as much anymore. \n\nSo last Friday, I went to the convenience store and got myself a can of snuff, but I forgot my wallet. I went back to the car and asked my girlfriend if I could use her card. She looked at me, sighed, rolled her eyes and said “please just pay me back...” in a very disgusted tone as if I pestered her about it all day. my reaction was “are you serious?? Okay.” And I slammed the door shut. I walked in and paid for my can of snuff and walked back to the car. She said “what was that about?” I said to her “pay you back? Seriously? Do you not remember a time where I’d take you to the Cheesecake Factory and blow $170 on both of us and never asked for a dime?” She looked at me and muttered out “yeah”. I came back with “it was $4, if you’re that worried about it I’ll pay you back.” She didn’t want the money back, she understood that she was wrong and it was over and done with. \n\nAfter that, hasn’t happened again since.

      "description": "I am an adult with adult siblings. My parents (Ps) are in their late 50s (bio father &amp; stepmom). One retired, one nearing retirement. All children from prior relationships were adults when they married. \n\nWhen my spouse and I started to try for a baby, we were open about the process with my Ps. Around the same time we started trying for a bio child, we also looked into becoming foster parents but decided to wait. We talked about our experiences with the foster system to my Ps. Unbeknownst to us, after learning that we were taking foster classes, my Ps also began foster classes. After a year, we conceived. My Ps were the first to know. A few weeks later, my Ps accepted two high needs foster children under 7. \n\nI have actively tried to make the FC feel welcomed but this process has been very difficult. The FC require several appointments a week, specialized school, school, and lots of assistance with ADLs. They also have behavioral problems. My Ps seem overwhelmed providing care to the FC. D is frequently stressed out and angry. I know these traits are related to parenting. I enjoyed my relationship with D as an adult because these traits faded and we became very close. Now these traits are back and it’s very uncomfortable. My siblings make comments about D’s stress. \n\nM is distracted and inattentive. M is very emotional about the FCs and the process. M dumps these feelings on me. I want to be supportive but I decided not to become a F parent because I didn’t feel ready and now the emotions are imposed on me. I have tried to establish boundaries but my wishes are ignored. With therapy, M is an emotional wreck. \n\nBoth Ps are exhausted and don’t seem to have an agreed parenting approach. Frequently one will undermine how the other chooses to handle a situation. It is uncomfortable to watch this conflict unfold. \n\nNow, FC may not be reunified with their bio Ps. My Ps want to adopt them. We will find out if this is going to happen at around the same time my child is due. For years, my Ps repeatedly brought up how much they wanted to be part of my future C’s life. I started looking at homes in my Ps’ neighborhood, in part, because they wanted to help with day &amp; afterschool care, have random family dinners, and be close to my C. My siblings received so much help from my Ps with their C, and I saw the bond my Ps created with my nieces and nephews during this solo grandP time. I was looking forward to my C having a really close relationship with my Ps. \n\nNow when my Ps bring up spending time with my C, I do not feel comfortable with the idea of leaving my C in Ps’ care. I am worried about my C’s safety because my Ps are constantly distracted and exhausted. I worry about them missing a pickup or providing sufficient care because they are mentally and physically drained. I don’t want my C to know their grandPs as the stressed, angry and sad individuals they have become. I want my C to have a relationship with the amazing grandPs that my nieces and nephews once knew. \n\nI am worried about my C’s safety because the FC have a history of aggression. The FC are constantly testing boundaries and one is outright cruel. One FC enjoys seeing others in pain. For example, FC held the other FC’s head underwater during a bath. \n\nI am worried about the FC. Simply, my Ps don’t have the greatest medical history. I don’t know what level of care my Ps can provide to FC in the future. \n\nI am worried about my relationship with Ps. I don’t want to hurt my Ps. I am afraid of the inevitable day I have to tell them that I am uncomfortable with them providing solo care for my C, there will be no sleepovers at their house, and that we’re not moving.",

But despite this stuff I try to be a decent person and not do anything rude to her and just get through the rest of this semester (we’re both in college and I’m moving out at the end of the semester). \nAnyway, the reason I don’t want her boyfriend staying over is because she invited him without telling me he was coming after I’ve asked her to let me know. Also, she spent nearly the entire day cooking for him in our (very small) shared kitchen so I wasn’t able to use it for hours. She also let him stay at our apartment all day watching Netflix. \nI’m planning on basically saying that she can’t invite him over if this is how they’re gonna behave.

      "description": "Im making a throwaway account because i don't want anyone to know this and this has had a really big emotional toll on me so please be respectful in the comments. I want to know who's in the wrong but please be respectful when doing so. So i've been dating my girlfriend for a few months now and i really felt like she was the one for me. I thought we were getting married. I remember when we were dating she used to talk about how wedgies were funny and she would give me them a lot. I did it to her a couple times back and i felt it was weird she seemed to enjoy them. She would even ask me to give her them too which was even weirder. Wedgies are supposed to be a prank, they hurt and are embarrassing, definitely not enjoyable to receive one. She was giving me wedgies every time we hung out and it was getting really really annoying and i'd tell her to stop. She'd calm for a bit but then revert to it. Eventually we're hanging out and she leaves to go the bathroom. I go on her computer to look up flight tickets or something and i see a closed tab of a youtube compilation of guys getting wedgies. There was also one of guys getting wedgies on google images and thats when i realized that wedgies are some sort of weird fetish. This whole time i felt i've been violated. SHe'd only did it a couple times in public in front of my close friends or hers so it wasn't that big of a deal but now knowing she gets sexual pleasure out of it I feel like she also cheated on me when she gave my guy friends wedgies too. I told her i figured out what is going on and that her wedgie fetish is disgusting and degerneate and i can't be with someone who gets turned on by that. She starts crying and she's on her knees begging me to not leave her and give her another chance and to find a way to work things out. I leave and everyday i get missed calls and texts which I've been ignoring. I'm considering maybe giving her a second chance but idk. AITA here? all my friends think so and her friends have been harassing me nonstop, i had to block them all on social media. Should i give me gf another chance or did she violate me? I really feel if the gender roles were swapped I would be considered the asshole",

It also has become kind of a \"me\" time because now my family is wanting to start to do everything together, and thats ok for me, but I still want to have my time alone.\n\n\nSo I notice that when I'm about to have dinner for myself and I set up my cellphone to start watching videos, my dad suddenly appears and starts making talk with me, he starts talking when I have my videos on, so I have to pause them to answer, this has became a problem because it's really annoying, the chat that he wants to make aren't that interesting, plus after eating I can always go upstairs and talk about whatever he wants to talk then. \n\n\n\nHe really seems annoyed that I eat watching videos, and he demands I stop doing that while he is talking to me in the table, he says that im addicted to this \"new technology\", even when Im only watching videos just when Im eating (plus I have catched him several times texting while driving, thing I never do, but somehow that's less important than eating while watxhing videos.)\n\n\nI have tried talking to him, that I just want to eat alone and we cab talk later, but he doesnt wants that.\n\n\nAm I being an asshole? I know that of \"enjoy your time with your parents before is too late\", but I feel like I spend plenty of time with them, I just want my own time eating alone.\n\n\nTl;dr: my dad gets mad that I want to watch videos while eating, i get mad that he doesnt get that i just want to ear alone",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom\n\n(This is an older story that is being told from the present from which the story was taking place unless said otherwise) (please let me know if older stories are not allowed on this sub and I will take it down)\n\nKey things to note: - I am 15 and living with my grandparents.\n- My mom is still very much in my life \n- grandparents live in town A whereas my mom lives in town C (theres a town in between)\n- I have had run ins with dcf (not sure what DCF actually stands for but basically its a kid protection thing) many times for many different reasons so I know how things with them go \n-my mom has about 6 people living with her in a smallish house \n- my girlfriend knows most happenings in my life but not all \n-I'm currently in a therapy/school tardiness program\n-DCF can and will take me away if they say both my mom and grandparents unfit to care for me\n\nSo a bit on my grandparents. They were once super nice and chill, maybe a bit overprotective but I didn't really notice until much later. Once I did notice I tried very hard to respectfully ask for better curfew hours (was 5pm -asking 8pm) and a bit more freedom when it comes to going places with friends. But they didn't really budge and I got super depressed and rebellious so I went from asking to demanding and just leaving when they would yell or scream horrible and self esteem damaging things to me. This started when I was 12 or 13\n\nThey turned physical a bit later. Throwing things and hitting me. Now cue my girlfriend I started dating when I turned 15.\n\nI told her a little about what's happening but not everything because I didn't want to freak her out but I did say I was taking measures to protect myself like staying at the library during times I'm not at school and taking the bus to my moms house on the weekends. She was worried understandably but I couldn't do much because I couldn't drop out of school in the middle of the year and I needed the money my grandparents were receiving for me from the state so taking legal actions weren't possible either.\n\nOne day my grandma was going crazy and when I tried to calm her down she pulled a knife on me and threatened me and I was freaked\nI ran and texted my worker and my girlfriend and then SHE freaked.\nMy worker wasn't answering so my girlfriend calmed me down but now she's pissed about it and doesn't want me living there anymore \nI explain why I can't leave and that I'll be more careful\n\nShe wasn't taking none of it and gave me an ultimatum\nGet DCF in or we are breaking up\nI chose breaking up because in theory I only needed another year and I would've been out and with my mom with no hassle\n\nShe later still got DCF in and told my worker and school what happened but I managed to get myself out before any damage was done\n\nTL;DR My girlfriend broke up with me because I refused to let DCF into my adusive situation (and still did it behind my back)\n\nThe parties in question are My girlfriend or me (in case you were confused)\n\n\n",

      "description": "Clarification\n\nMy boyfriend is out of the country. We message each other daily. Yesterday night, he got home and messaged that he missed me. I messaged him back, but didn't reply for 30 min. because he was listening to some singers (he was also with his friend). For some reason, this irritated me. He uses his phone a lot and I'm assuming he just saw the notification and just swiped up to reply to me later. \n\nBackground: Early in our relationship, he said that it bothers him when he is texting someone and they reply even a minute late. (A little unreasonable, because but whatever, that's his thing) So I try to reply to him as soon as I see the conversation. Like I'll message good morning as soon as I wake up. I noticed he has this habit of not messaging me right away even though he has this stipulation, so I talked to him about it and he said he will do it. And he has been. \n\nI understand he is out of the country and I try to be understanding. Usually there was something going on and I get it, he can't be on his phone 100% while he is with family/friends/etc. But yesterday, that small 30 min. seemed deliberate. \n\nAnyways, I tried not to let it bother me. But it was obvious it was during our video chat that night so I ended it early and said I just wanted to sleep. \n\nAITA? Tbh I just want confirmation that I am so that I can attribute this to anxiety and be done with it. But I sometimes overthink things and I'm curious to see what other people think ",

I have a inclining bed so it makes it easier to sleep in a certain angle so it won’t hurt me when I get out of bed due to my double mastectomy and my back problem. Not only that I have a surgery coming up this Monday  for reconstruction and I wouldn’t be able to get out of that bed. Was I the asshole to leave suddenly? She knew I was finally packing up to go.

      "description": "TL;DR: my best friend leaves me and our friends on a night out to go to a part with my bf ex despite having a deep chat with me early that night how that wouldn’t be the case.\n\nSorry for the rant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA bit of background. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years, all good and happy and this situation isn’t to do with him. I only knew his ex through my friend Jenny but had never spoken to her before going out with my bf. My best friend is a terrible drunk who tends to seek out a party on any of our nights out together. Usually meaning leaving me and our friends at a pub so she can go to a flat and not get home until 10am on Sunday with people she mostly only associates with at these after parties. This has been the case for at least 3 years and she regrets it each time.  \n\n\nOn Saturday, me, Kelly and 2 others were out for her sisters birthday. Her sisters friends were not free to come out so it’s me, Kelly, her sister and our other friend. Had a few drinks at mine then headed down town for a few more drinks at the pub. Whilst at mine Kelly got a call that another friend who was coming back from another night out and would meet us down the road. Along with her is my bf ex who wanted to get a lift back too.  \n\n\nMy bf ex isn’t in our close friend group but over the last 2 1/2 years a few of my friends have got closer to her through nights out and social media. That is absolutely fine but her being out with us always makes me feel nervous. Mostly I just feel uncomfortable when she is around due to my friends acting extra friendly to her so I almost feel excluded. It just makes me feel awkward. They do know this and I know it’s something I have to work on. When she is around I can chat away with her in a group and be civil as she has never done anything to me but it all feels false and I hate not being able to be genuine.  \n\n\nAnyway, before we left mine and Kelly said what the plan was as she knows I get a bit anxious when she’s around (as I don’t know how to act). I explain that it’ll be fine but it’s just a bit shit that you will probably end up with her most of the night. She denies this and explains how I’m her best friend and she wouldn’t speak to her if she didn’t want me too. That is totally not my place and way to dramatic for my liking so obviously said no to that.  \n\n\nThen as we get down the road and having a laugh together, my friend and my bf ex arrive and instantly my best friend is joint to her hip. Kelly is wasted at this point and almost seems like his ex is clinging to her as she kept getting them shots. Within about 25 minutes they have left us all to go to an after party when it’s only 11pm. I was left to look after her younger sister, who was very drunk, all night while she pied my calls and ignored me when I watched her walk away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer point is that she is so drunk that she doesn't know what it is that makes her behave like this, although they do still speak occasionally when sober but are not the type of friends to meet up for cup of tea etc. She apologised to me last night for leaving on the night but never mentioned anything about my bf ex and her. I know people can be friends with who they want but it’s almost like they just became closer after I got with my bf. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? I don’t know if my feelings are justified.",

      "description": "I live in a major metro area that has terrible traffic. I work downtown and typically have a 15-20 minute commute from my house, which is south of downtown. \n\nMy main friend group here is made up of my best friend from high school (BF) and another good friend from high school (Other Friend, or OF). OF also works downtown, 2 blocks away from my office. OF typically takes the light rail from his apartment to work. \n\nBF and her husband recently bought a new house in a development 10-20 minutes outside of the eastern suburb she works in. With no traffic, it typically takes them 35-40 minutes to drive downtown. They do not live close to public transportation of any form. \n\nThe issue: we all make plans for the occasional happy hour on Mondays, since BF works 4 days a week and always has Mondays off. The last time BF met us for happy hour, it took her 45 minutes to drive downtown, going the opposite way of rush hour traffic. She has asked that myself and OF meet her halfway for the next happy hour, since it took her 45 minutes to drive due to traffic. I said no, due to the fact that it would take OF and I 30-45 minutes to drive half the distance, since we would be driving with rush hour traffic. Since BF doesn’t work Mondays, BF’s drive was only 5-10 minutes longer than usual, and OF and I both work downtown, I’m of the opinion that BF should be the one to meet up with us. AITA for saying no?",

My problem with this situation besides the fact hes 17 and shes 14 (i'm 15 for reference) is when they first started hanging out she was showing interest in our mutual friend and his long-time best friend and sort of manipulating him, and manipulating the rest of us to think her life situation is way worse than it is (its not perfect but i know from knowing her that its not that bad, also she had faked photo evidence of \"abuse\" when it was just a picture of water with red-food dye all over the floor) and he was shit talking her a lot to me when they supposedly started dating talking about how he knows she a liar and all that. my main problem is that this guy is super nice and tries to help everyone and tells them just what they wanna hear and i'm worried hes dating her just to make her happy. Its even to the point where they are secret about it because they know it will hurt the friend mentioned earlier. I mainly stopped talking to him because besides wanting to avoid the situation he hardly made an attempt to reach out anyway and i would always have to start the conversation, though i do admit i was a bit childish and hurt that they didn't tell me",

      "description": "Some background is required ...\n\nMy mother (81) lives in an retirement facility (not a nursing home). For most of her retirement years, she has suffered from debilitating pain as a result of her years as a nurse, lifting patients, suffering sever back injuries, etc. She no longer drives. I live only a few blocks away and visit her at least a few times a week and talk on the phone every single day. Once a week, I take her shopping to the pharmacy and to the grocery store for snacks. Sometimes she asks me to take her to the liquor store even though she knows this will start an argument. I REFUSE to take her to the liquor store. If it was up to her, she would drink all day, not eat and end up being nasty and in poor health - not just because of lack of nutrition, but also risk of falling (she broke a hip a few years back).\n\nShe will not admit to the possibility that she is an alcoholic, so it's not even worth getting into it. As long as she doesn't have access to alcohol, life is great. But if she has a chance to get her hands on it, she will and I end up having to take it away from her. I have a full cabinet of liquor that I have taken away from her in the past (my husband and I don't really drink, so it just sits there).\n\nHer best friend (I'll call her Bertha) lives about an hour drive away. They have been best friends since college. Bertha is the nicest, sweetest lady you'd ever meet. She would do anything for you. Bertha still drives and is in great physical health. Unfortunately, my mother can be very pushy and obstinate. So when Bertha comes down for a visit, they will go out for lunch together and then go shopping. My mother easily convinces Bertha into taking her to the liquor store even though Bertha knows she has a problem with alcohol. I have spoken to Bertha about this before, but when it comes to my mother, Bertha just can't say \"no.\" She's afraid of starting an argument, so she just gives in.\n\nUnknown to me, Bertha visited my mother a couple of weeks ago. Yesterday, I brought my mother some groceries because she hasn't felt good lately and just didn't feel like going out shopping. As I was putting her groceries away (usually she does it herself), I discovered 6 bottles of alcohol in her room. These were all purchased when Bertha had come to visit her. She had 3 bottles of wine, gin, whiskey and vodka. All the hard liquor and one of the wine bottles were half empty.\n\nOf course, an argument ensued. Now I know why she hasn't being feeling well. This, because I also discovered she hasn't been to the dining room at her facility in nearly two weeks. She's only been eating the free muffins and bagels from the snack shop in the facility. And I can only assume these are the only bottles. There may have been ones she already emptied an got rid of.\n\nWith no access to alcohol, my mom lives a pretty decent life, eats properly and is pleasant to be around.\n\nSo, WIBTA asshole if I asked Bertha not to visit her anymore? I don't know what else to do.",

      "description": "(TL;DR at bottom) So once a month, my friends and I cook dinner together. There's 6 of us who usually participate. Half of us cook, the other half cleans up. Today, we decide to make hamburgers and fries. One of my friends decided they wanted to eat baked potatoes instead. That's cool, we got plenty of potatoes for her to cook with, no worries. She decides to cook 3 potatoes. She was also one of the ones assigned to help cook, so she and I did most of the cutting of potatoes for fries for the rest of us.\n\nWe get our first batch done. We eat a few, make sure they taste alright, no problems, maybe a little more salt. I go help my other friend who's cooking the hamburger meat. I check back every once in a while on the 2nd batch, and notice that friend who wanted baked potatoes is still snacking on the fries. I let it go, because well, they're fries and she helped cut them.\n\nI run to the restroom real quick, come back and she's still snacking on the fries. Then it hits me that, hey, she's got 3 potatoes waiting for her in the oven still, so like wtf? So now I'm keeping an eye on her because a) the fries are for everyone else, and b) she's cooking an alternative meal that equates to the hamburger and fries.\n\nI hint that she's got potatoes waiting for her in the oven, so slow down on the fries. Didn't want to seem too forward about it, but I don't think she took the hint. We got a little down time in between cooking, and she goes back to eat more of the fries. By this time, about a third of the 1st batch is probably gone now, with most of that being her eating them. I decide to confront her and basically said \"Can you stop eating the fries? You've got your baked potatoes and we need to have enough fries for everyone else to eat with their hamburgers.\" I walk away because I always feel awkward having to confront people, plus I felt a little guilty for having to do so.\n\nA few minutes later, she walks up to me and says that the baked potatoes are only substituting the hamburger, not the fries, so she's allowed to eat the fries. I didn't say anything back because I felt like I was in the right for calling her out, and also that I thought that reasoning was stupid since she's cooking 3 potatoes. Maybe if it was just 1, but 3?\n\nAnyway, she didn't eat anymore until after everyone got their fries and there was less than a handful left over up for grabs, so I guess my message was understood. But she did disappear for the rest of the time, so I'm pretty sure I upset her and she didn't want to stick around me anymore. We've only exchanged passing glances since, so idk how she's feeling about it. I feel bad since she did help cut them, but on the other hand, I feel like she ate more than enough to compensate for that role. AITA?\n\nSidenote: another friend didn't like the fries. Flat out said they were undercooked and raw (uneven cooking since some fries were cut larger, but all were definitely cooked enough to be edible; I reckon she's used to conventional fried fries only). Literally convulsed and spat out the fry into the trash and decided to eat cereal instead. Kind of still pissed about that, like bitch why don't you put it in the oven and cook it then? And did you have to be so fucking loud about your displeasement? Ungrateful and disrespectful. Anyway, just wanted that off my chest. Anyone who has cooked for others will understand how I felt. u __ u thankfully, everyone else enjoyed the fries.\n\nTL;DR - friend group makes dinner of hamburger &amp; fries, 1 friend decides to make alternative meal of 3 baked potatoes using same potatoes used for fries. Friend eats 1/3 of 1st batch of fries. I call her out and tell her to stop since they're for everyone else whose eating hamburgers. She says her baked potatoes only substitute the hamburger and should be able to eat fries. I called bullshit, and she doesn't get to eat anymore until everyone else gets to grab their fries first. Friend hasn't talked to me since and disappeared for the rest of the time except to come eat. I feel bad now.",

      "description": "Ok so. I work in customer service at a grocery store. Im the manager of the front end and i am not “technically” allowed on a register. We all know how these things go, we start getting lines so i eventually pull someone with a large cart over so i can make the lines move faster. As im pulling her over, someone else sees and brings their stuff over as well and starts sitting it on the belt. I let them know politely that i had already pulled someone so they would have to go first. I just get grunted at and shrugged it off. Then, the customer starts pulling my closed sign off which i DONT want because if my boss saw me on a register i would get in trouble and i dont want a line to build up on my register. I tell them to please leave the sign up and here the comments come.. “i was here first”, “Looks open to me” ect. The customer also didnt put a divider into the lane so i started ringing up their things on the original customers i pulled over order. THE CUSTOMER FREAKS OUT. hollering about how im not paying attention and at this point im getting irritated and say “im sorry, it was a mistake.” after the first customer pays, i ring up their stuff as fast as possible just trying to get them away from me. The last straw was them flipping out for me going so fast and they cant see what they are ringing up as. This person shows no sign of disability (not that they are all visible) but i had no idea of who i was dealing with just the fact that they were yelling at me and creating a scene at this point. I finally snapped and said “you need to calm down or go to a different register” and her caretaker had came up RIGHT before i said this and all hell broke loose. i was called ableist and told i had no customer service skills. they called my manager and corporate and i am feeling really guilty because i know the person probably had no idea what they were doing was rude. i was just promoted and am now waiting to be called into my managers office. \n\nAITA?

      "description": "TL;DR I tell my (bi) friend serial anecdotes all the time, and while I don't mind them telling me anecdotes about them with women, I uncomfortable with them telling me ones about them with men. Would I be an asshole if I told them as much?\n\nI'm gay and I talk to one of my friends about my experiences in grindr and with other guys all the time. I was very hesitant to at first because I didn't want to push into tmi territory or talk about sexual stuff all the time if it would make them uncomfortable, especially because they are bi ace. But they've assured me they find my anecdotes amusing, they like learning about the culture of the community through my stories, and they don't think I'm oversharing and will let me know if I make them uncomfortable.\n\nThey have recently started also exploring relationships, and when they talk to me about their conversations with and thoughts about women I enjoy it and find it amusing an dome discussing it with them. But when they talk about guys it makes me uncomfortable. Sometimes I feel right in it, like when they joke about how all women are goddesses and they always forget how comparatively gross men are until they start messaging with them, I feel justified in being upset by that. The same sorts of behaviors and interactions with men they complain about are my favorite sort of interactions, and totally normal and not creepy or gross stuff.\n\nBut sometimes I'll make a joke or anecdote about me and another guy, and they'll relate by shooting back a joke or anecdote about them with a guy. And that makes me uncomfortable. I'd say there are three reasons for that.\n\n1. I don't like the idea that their experiences with men, as a non-binary bi ace person, are really comparable to mine, as a gay man.\n\n2. We kinda hooked up once. I was absolutely trashed, and I hated it while I was happening even though I didn't really try to stop it, and I was messed up over it for weeks afterward. It's one of my biggest regrets in my life, and thinking about this person interacting serially with men just reminds me of that and brings back all those feelings.\n\n3. Outside of our one experience, I really assumed ace meant they weren't interested in sexual interactions or whatever. In my head they're very much a non-sexual entity, so hearing them talk about personal sexual anecdotes makes me feel weird. Like realizing your teacher probably has sex: it's perfectly acceptable and normal, but uncomfortable because of who they are in relation to you. This is my ace friend. My other friends making me aware that they fuck is fine, but my ace friend making me aware that they fuck is weird, because of the implications of being the ace friend. Idk.\n\nAnyway. They picked up that I was uncomfortable and asked me if it made me feel weird that they're relating their sexual stuff to mine and if they should stop/filter more. The honest answer is yes. It makes me feel weird when its about guys, and they can relate all they want with their interactions with women but I would be more comfortable if they filtered out the guy stuff. But they let me talk free-range about my guy stuff, and I feel like an asshole for not being equally open to them, and like to be a good friend I need to work through it/get over it.",

      "title": "AITA for being happy that my ex's dog got taken to the pound?",
      "description": "This may get long, but I'll try condense it as much as possible.\n\nA couple of years ago, my then girlfriend (22 at the time) moved in with me (24 at the time) and my two engaged housemates. We'd been dating for about 8 months at the time and she'd been wanting to move out of her parent's place as she had issues with them. What started as a trial move just became her staying permenantly and everyone seemed ok with it. I was having a great deal of mental issues with work and figured it'd be a good thing to have my partner close by to support me (in hindsight not the healthiest plan on either of our parts, but that's a whole other story).\n\nLess than a month later, she starts hinting at wanting a dog. I should mention that the house already had a dog and a cat owned by my housemates, but she wanted a dog for \"us\". She was aware of my issues and thought having a dog would help alleviate them. Problem is, she wanted a puppy. I told her many times that I was simply not in the right frame of mind to train a puppy as it required a lot of patience and time. Not to mention that we'd be forced to keep a puppy inside 24/7 until it got its vaccinations, the issues with my work causing me not to get paid much, and the fact we'd need to account for my housemates pets. \n\nUnfortunately, and against my better judgement, she eventually convinced me after several weeks of pleading and taking me to see a litter of puppies our friend's dog had recently birthed. My only condition was that she ask the housemates. As it turns out, they both told her that she needed to ask the other two if it was alright, so she took that as a \"yes\" from everyone and went forward with the adoption.\n\nWhat followed was easily some of the worst months of my life. Just as I'd predicted, I was not able to cope with training a dog, and she barely lifted a finger to discipline him. Because of that, the pup would misbehave and act aggressively, then go to my ex for protection, which she'd enable. I ended up taking a lot of my frustration out on the poor pup, which I freely admit were not my finest moments (nothing overly abusive, but a lot of shouting and some harder-than-necessary smacks). \n\nThe worst day was easily my housemate's wedding day when, after an amazing day out celebrating their union, I come home to find the dog had chewed up a whole bunch of stuff in our room, pissed and shit all over the bed, scratched up the carpet, and thrashed his food and water bowl around. I actually couldn't do anything but stare despondantly at the mess as my ex picked the dog up and said something to the effect of \"Oh dear, you've made quite a mess. You must've missed us so much!\".\n\nAs a few more months passed, my health got much worse to the point I needed an intervention, a week after which my ex broke up with me since she couldn't handle it. She ended up taking the dog with her back to her parents. Lo and behold, after 3 days of constantly being upset over it all, it was like a spell broke and I was starting to be back to my old self. I got the help I needed and started to fix my life. \n\nAfter a few more months, I hear that my ex is having troubles with the dog being overly aggressive and just not getting along with the other 2 dogs at her parent's. Apparently her mum threatened to take the dog to the pound while she was at work if my ex didn't start disciplining him. A couple of weeks after that, she followed through on that threat, and honestly, I felt happy. Happy that she got the comuppance she deserved, at least in that aspect. Not happy for the dog, obviously. He's the true victim in all of this and I can only hope he went on to find a better home with people who can give him the love he deserves.\n\nBut in any case, am I an asshole for feeling happy that she got what she deserved? Or am I just being vindictive?",

      "description": "Just over a month ago I met a guy who I'll refer to as Dan. I started talking on and off with Dan through ThatOneGayDatingApp^(TM) and agreed to meet over some coffee, and it went fairly well, we chatted about stuff for a while, relocated when the coffee shop closed and overall talked for a few hours. After that, we would meet about 1-2 times a week, typically going out to eat then heading back to my place and watching some Lord of the Rings the end the night. Upon meeting Dan I found out that he apparently had a rather sizable inheritance and rather wealthy parents. This isn't really a big deal to me, whatever. Well, Dan only really liked to go out to \"boujee\" places (his own wording), which are very few in number where we're at. For our second date he brought me the nicest restaurant/bar in town; he brought flowers, paid for dinner and drinks, we talked. A lot of what we talked about was actually me talking about one of my favorite hobbies: D&amp;D. He would always bring it up because it was obvious that I was really into it. Usually I say very little about it, because honestly, if you aren't part of the hobby you probably don't want hear me rambling about, but I digress. He would get kinda weird about it though, saying stuff like \"You're so sexy when talk \\[insert D&amp;D thing\\]\", usually followed by me asserting that it's not that kind of fantasy role-playing... I figured it was a well-meant attempt to play at my interests, and that he was just oblivious to some social etiquette. Anyway, moving forward that's what a lot of our discussions were like; he would ask me about my nerd stuff and we talked about character concepts and worked on building him a character. I learned that his dad was some big-wig in some pharmaceutical company, and Dan would occasionally go to board meetings to sit in for his dad. \n\nTime to talk about the red flags. A couple weeks ago Dan wanted to go on a date to the other boujee restaraunt in town. Now here's the thing: My ex works as a waiter there (we broke up about 8-9 months ago). Dan knows this, and has actually met my ex before, knows he works there, and knows of our past relationship. I'm actually on good terms with my ex, so I wasn't too bother by it, and the night we were going was when my ex typically had the night off when we were together, so I figured it'd probably be fine. Dan wanted to do a gift exchange, and like a total jerk I had forgotten about it among the 3 other exchanges I had that week, plus 2 work parties. I show up and head to the table, and he had a big gift bag and a big bouquet of flowers (cue me remembering we agreed to a gift exchange). I apologize profusely, and we proceed with the evening. Our waiter was my ex. The evening was a tad awkward, though my ex stayed formal and and stayed professional. I opened my gift which was a $40+ gift (he had asked to do a $25-30 exchange), but I was pretty glad to now have another D&amp;D book. I promised I would make up for the lack of gift, and and did actually order his gift and let him know what it was, and fortunately he was pretty stoked and I was in the clear.\n\nAt one point, Dan told me of when he had met my ex over some coffee (this was after we had broken up). He relayed a story my ex had apparently told him, a key point of this story being that my ex had gone out of his way to cheat on me during our relationship. He told me this story after I mentioned the approximate date we had broken up to Dan. My reaction to this information was pretty mellow. I said it really doesn't matter much to me now, and it's not worth my happiness to obsess over past relationships.\n\nA couple days after that I'm texting a friend that I haven't chatted with in a while that lives about 20 minutes away. I mention that I've been going on some dates with this Dan fellow. I got a text back asking if it was this guy and a picture attached. In the following discussion I learned that Dan had hit my friend up a while back on ThatOneGayDatingApp^(TM) and was really persistent, to the point of offering money for sexual services. My friend included a portion of the chat that also contained a face photo from Dan to confirm that we were talking about the same guy. \n\nI decided to check in with a few people concerning Dan. I first called a friend of mine that I've known for about 2 years now, and he said he'd heard some iffy things about Dan, but had never met him personally. I then called my ex to check a few things. First, I apologized for the awkwardness at the restaurant when he waited on us. I then asked for his version of the story without giving details of what I heard. His version had maybe one common point, but the rest of it was pretty different, particularly the date and location (totally different city). I definitely knew that he hadn't gone on any trips close to the time that Dan mentioned this happening, and I was later able to find several photos on Facebook that helped confirm that this was a trip he went on some time after our breakup.\n\nSomething else I heard from my ex was that Dan has been coming through the restaurant  every week with a different guy, always paying for both of them and pretty much flaunting his money (something I actually got kind of annoyed about while dating was that Dan simply would not let me pay for anything, and would insist that he pay for both of us). \n\nThat leads me to one other thing that bothered me. At one point a family friend of Dan's family was visiting and wanted to get some drinks with Dan. Also, this guy was Dan's ex, who had apparently lied and cheated on Dan. This is actually a story Dan told me himself: after the family friend had a few drinks, Dan pours his entire drink over this guy's head. Now I get that he had apparently done some jacked up stuff, but pouring a drink over his head over something that happened years ago seemed way too Hollywood drama to me. Dan tried to justify it and I just left it alone.\n\nAfter collecting all this information and reflecting on everything I knew from personal interaction, I decided to send the following text to Dan:\n\n&gt;*(6:00pm)* A few things have been brought to my attention, and this is the last willful interaction I will have with you. Do not message, call, or otherwise try to get in touch with me again. I will send the gift I ordered to your house. You will not be receiving further responses from me.\n\nAnd his replies:\n\n&gt;*(6:09pm)* May I ask what happened?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*(6:10pm)* Did something happen on you end or mine?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;You know what I just have to say your a complete asshole. I thought we was friends. Then you shoot me a text and say you never wanna talk to me or see me again and for what reason you did not explain. You talked about always being honest and blunt so I'm still waiting because the was a pretty vague text. But I have a feeling you won't even reply to this text message, so guess what I don't need your gift save yourself the 20 dollars and cancel the order because I think you need it more then me. *\\[smiley face emoji\\]*\n\nI did feel bad about the way I went about cutting him off without explaining things, but the last sentence definitely cemented some of things I was wary of concerning him. Still, I know I'm biased, and while I don't regret cutting him out, I do wonder if I was really an asshole in this situation. Hopefully this post is semi coherent, I'm not the greatest at translating my thoughts to \"writing\". Anyway, have at it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I have two friends, let’s name them “A” and “B”. I’ve known them both for about 5 years, but I used to work with “B”. A few years ago we became neighbors and we would check each other’s animals when either of us were out of town. \n\nLast year, they got divorced. “A” kept the house and “B” moved out and left pretty much everything to “A”. Throughout this time, I have remained friends with both. And “A” still checks in on my pet when I am out of town and I check in on “A”s pets. \n\nThis past week, a legal document was sent incorrectly to my place. The names on the letter was “B”s first with “A”s underneath. The address was not the address to where “A” lives. \n\nI informed “B” that I received this letter and made plans with “B” to give the letter, make a copy, and give it to “A”. The divorce didn’t end well, so I wanted to just make sure that they both got the information they needed. “B” had told me that “A” has made a habit of not forwarding important information and at times misrepresenting details which impacted the settlement of assets in the divorce to favor “A” (I personally have not had a conversation with “A” about it, but our group of friends have come to find out that other issues which “B” brought up were true). As well as they don’t like talking or interacting with each other. \n\nTonight, I gave the letter to “A” and got an upset reception. I expected it to happen, but I did my best to explain that there was no malicious intent on what I did. I just tried to do what I believed right and most helpful. I was told the optics did not look good and I proved my allegiance. Which I believe is unfair. After the time I’ve known “A” I have never tried to do anything to pull one over, and have tried to be a good friend. Even defending “A” when “B” would talk about negative aspects of “A”. \n\nSo AITA for not just giving the letter to “A” since they were right next door?\n",

After confronting her about why she lied when breaking up with me, she told me it had only been a \"facter,\" and she only started liking him after we broke up, and the main really was that she just stopped loving me. I accepted that answer and moved on.\n\nSo a couple months go by, and today while talking to a friend about her he tells me that the entire reason she broke up with me was because of the other guy, and she lied to me about pretty much everything else about why she broke up with me. Would I be the asshole to reveal to her friend how much she didn't like him and shit talked him?

      "description": "I broke up with my gf after 7 years together last year. She left me and It was not entirely her fault. I had lost my job a few months earlier and since had started turning into this grumpy insensitive man. We fought a lot almost everyday. I tried to apply for various jobs to no success. I felt like I had done everything I could but she thought I was not trying hard enough. I grew to resent her for I thought she did not understand me. I said horrible things to her and made her cry many times. One day she decided she could not take it any longer. She told me she's moving out. I did not do or say anything to stop her as I was still too busy dealing with my anger and desperation over my unemployment.\n\nA few months passed and I started seeing another girl, who was somehow able to see past my anger and bitterness and knew deep down inside I am a loving and gentle person. She cheered me up and convinced me that things would get better. She never lost faith in me. And there were times when she also supported me financially when I needed to pay the bills. I told her to leave me alone because she deserved someone better, not a loser like me. Her friends told her that I was only using her because I was broke and needed money. I told her her friends were right. I was not good for her. But she told me she loved me and her friends only said those horrible things because they did not know me.\n\nBut what she did not know though,  I was still much in love with my ex gf and still could not get over her. This new girl was stubborn. Whenever I tried to push her out of my life, she would always fight her way in harder than ever. Until I finally gave up and I started to actually fall in love with her as well. I really believed that with her, I could start all over and be happy again. We moved in together as a new couple. And then the good news arrived. I got a call from this company that would love to have me. I was beyond ecstatic. And that's when my ex gf showed up. She had no idea that I was dating someone else. She told me that she’s sorry for leaving me. That she should’ve been more understanding and supportive. \n\nI told her there was nothing to apologize for. I was angry when she left but not anymore. I did not blame her. It was not entirely her fault. I was a douchebag myself and treated her horribly. Seeing her again after months made me realize I was still so much in love with her. When I told her about my new gf, she looked so shocked and hurt. But She told me she would give me sometimes to think about us. She does not want to be the other girl. She also said she understands if I can not leave my new gf because she (my new gf) was there when I needed help the most. As much as I love my new gf, I realized I am still much in love with my ex as well. Is it possible to be in love with two persons at the same time?",

      "description": "I love my sister. I’m very proud of her. She went from doing poorly in high school to getting into college and eventually doing well in her classes. However, she is very needy and relies a lot on family members for help. I took the role as her emotional rock when I lived with her and helped to mediate her many fights with my parents. I helped her stay upright when she was having mental health issues, cooking for her when she wouldn’t feed herself and encouraging her to clean and go out, basically being there for her whenever she needed me. Despite our closeness I was pretty relieved when she left for college. I felt as though a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, the responsibility of another persons life was taken from me and given back to them. I continued to do well in school and recently got accepted into my college of choice. The thought of being my own person and moving away from my family, who I had my own problems with, was very exciting to me. However, when I visited the college as an accepted student, my sister decided she wanted to transfer there. I haven’t said anything to her to make her think this was a bad idea, as I don’t want to be selfish. I love my sister very much but the idea of having any facet of my life being my own sounds so new and liberating. This was supposed to be my thing, the beginning of me being my own person. Anyone with a slightly older sibling will understand what I’m talking about here, everything you’ve accomplished so far has been recently done by them, making your achievements not as memorable or important. Now even my drop off at the start of the first semester will mean little as my sister will be there too, doing the same thing in the same place. I just want one part of my life to be new, my own. (Ever since we were children I was forced to do whatever she did, sports, classes, hand me down clothes, etc) Am I being selfish? It is a good school and I want her to do well, just, somewhere else.\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting my emotionally needy sister to transfer to the college I’m attending?",

      "description": "Here it goes. Ok, so at my HS, there is a kid named Andy. He is, REALLY annoying, self centerd, bratty, and on the SED spectrum. (he is also known for sitting there and laughing and taking a video of a kid who was having a seizure. He is 5\"4' and fat. (Just to give you an idea on what he looks like.) (I'm 5\"7' kinda overweight, and kinda muscular.)\n\nAnyway, it's pretty obvious that he is getting \"bullied\", he is basically the grade's punching bag. Now, my school has a very strict definition of bullying, which is why bulling is in parenthesis. There using loopholes, and the few times when they do break the rules, Andy has no evidence. Anyway, in computer class (6th period.) Andy and I have this, and 3rd period together. The teacher assigined us partners. I was with my friend Lucas. Andy was put with Jack. Jack is cool, but has low patience and very hot headed. After a few days, Jack got fed up and Requested to work alone. Request granted.\n\nSince Andy was by himself, teacher let him pick which group he wanted to join. He poke? Picked? ours. Now a few of the people \"bullying\" him are in that class. they go up to us, chatting and \"helping\" us, while picking on Andy. Well, one of the guys, Marcelino accidently slaps him. Andy goes to the teacher, but the bell rings and there outta there like that. This happened on a Friday.\n\nOn Monday, 3rd period (P.E.) Now, here is the thing. I never bullied him, but also never stood up for him. Bystander in the middle kinda thing. So Andy walks up to me and announces that he reported them. \"Yeah, good for you.\" I say. (not  sarcastically.) Then he askes me if I was called into the principal yet. I ask him what he is talking about. He said He used me (without my permission and/or knowledge), as his witness. He then says what he wants me to recite to the principal like I'm his machine. And before I have a chance to tell him hell no, he runs away. Now, a lot of his \"bullies\" are my friends. Like Marcelino? He's actually not a bad guy.\n\nAfter this, Andy tries to befriend me. I kept denying him but he got my xBox gamertag (same as my Reddit name) from Lucas. Lucas is a really nice guy and Andy also voluntold him as a witness, which he agreed to. He hasn't got farther than that and I fear he may be stalking me. (online, I have no proof.) \n\nNow to the big part. Last Friday, Andy said there gonna call us in after break (next week) Now I know siding with Andy and telling the truth is the \"right\" thing to do. But I don't wanna snitch on my friends. I am an introvert, and have a very  mild stutter issue. These guys are really popular guys and I fear that me, or my other friends might get bullied and loose our reputations as popular ourselves. What I am planning on doing is NOT getting involved with it and saying that I was focused on work and didn't see it. AITA?\n\noh, and to the three people who saw my last post, it was a test to see if my computer works. That's why you may have deja vu.",

      "title": "AITA for ending a friendship over an argument where he ignored data to disagree with me?",
      "description": "Some background before we go in. I'm high functioning autistic and almost always read social situations wrong. I have very few friends because of this, and I have few chances to make new friends as I am on disability and I have the typical narrow interests problem. Because of this almost all of my friendships are made online, and most always come about thanks to meeting someone in the comments section of a story I enjoy, or wrote myself.  \n\n\nThree years ago I was lucky enough to meet someone online who enjoined my stories enough to offer me help with editing them. Well call him Editor.  \n\n\nI have some pretty bad spelling and grammar issues, and I also often fail to see mistakes I make because my brain knows what I meant and filters the mistake out. Because of that and how he would happily edit a chapter almost any time I asked right away, I really appreciated his help and we became pretty fast friends, but he was always a little abrasive, and tended to call me stupid (not in those words, but context made it clear he thought I was an idiot and being insulting about it.).  \n\n\nThe last thing you need to know is that I keep maticulious data on my stories. I track views, comments, who comments frequently, when its viewed, when people comment... I dont' mean to be creepy by that, I just want to know if my story is doing well, or it I am failing to improve over my previous story. My ex-friend knew I keep this data and has even seen the spreadsheets I track it on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night in a private discord specifically for one particular series I write, I was talking to some friends and a couple fans about my currently in progress story and how I am worried I made a mistake somewhere because its reader engagement is down 72% compared to my average. That's the measure of how many comments per chapter a story is getting, it's a handy metric for seeing how much people enjoy a particular work.  \n\n\nI have no way to feel like I am contributing to society other than knowing people enjoy my stories. Everyone who talks to me for even a short time about why I write knows this about me. In light of that fact I asked if it might be possible that a percentage of my normal readers were not commenting specifically to punish me for canceling a story a month ago which I wasn't enjoying writing but was fairly popular.  \n\n\nEditor came into the conversation then, having not even been on the discord up until that point. He laughed and told me that I was being \"a crazy girl again\". I admitted that was unlikely, but I was trying to understand what was different this time and why I was down almost 3/4ths of my average engagement levels.   \n\n\nAt first he seemed to get that I was looking at things from a scientific angle. He brought up how only 32% of readers on my stories leave comments, and a few other datapoints. I agreed, but then broke down the data for him since he missed it earlier. In short, I know not only how many comments a story should be getting on average per chapter, but also how quickly the majority of comments should arrive. The first 8 hours after a chapter is posted normally have 14-22 comments posted on them, but this story was only getting 2-4 in that same time span.  \n\n\nI also informed him that I wasn't seeing my \"regulars\" in the comment section, and since those regulars are not on my discord it's not like they simply decided to comment on the discord. I used this data to show that I was doing something that was making readers either upset, or disinterested.  \n\n\nHe then told me that I was being stupid, and that people weren't punishing me by not commenting. I said that was unlikely, but I didn't have any other ideas of what it could be. He points out that my new story was a different genera than the last one, and I laughed.  \n\n\nSee, every story I do is a different genera and that has never effected anything before. I've done fantasy. I've done scifi. I've done science-fantasy. I've done drama. I've done magical realism. I've done Literary Realism. I've done Martial Arts. I've done \"Trapped in a Videogame\". I've done \"world hopping\".  Genera doesn't seem to matter to my audience. My regulars would always comment, usually enthusiastically. Editor knows this, he worked on 18 of my 25 total stories.  \n\n\nThe Genera of story isn't a real factor here. My audience doesn't seem to care about that. They are here for the world building, themes, tone, and generally zany way I write. I know this. I ask people what they like. I do polls. Editor knows all of that as well.  \n\n\nThe fact that my current story is a post-apockoliptic one focused on the problems with budding young civilizations as the world recovers from the war really shouldn't matter when the audience in question has enjoyed everything from a comedy where the joke is \"Literately everyone is a different kind of monster but none of them know that about eachother.\" to a story where an eldritch horror challenges some random mortals to a game of live action D&amp;D with their whole world's fate depending on that game, to a sci-fi epic involving the protagonist hitchhiking across the stars to rescue their friends who were abducted by space pirates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClearly, genera isn't a factor in my audience's enjoyment of my work.  \n\n\nEditor doesn't care as I explain this to him and insists that it's because I'm doing post-apoc. I know he dosn't personally care for my current story very much and I ask him to put his bias aside and look at this objectively because the lack of engagement is very distressing to me and I want to find the real reason behind it so I can fix things.   \n\n\nHe proceed to call me an idiot and insist that I cannot compare my current story's performance to my past ones because it's not the same genera as the others. I reminded him that I dont' do the same genera unless it's a direct sequel, and even then I've gone from fantasy to science fantasy and no one was bothered by the shift in genera between sequels.   \n\n\nI also told him that since I am comparing the average of all my works combined to my current story, genera wouldn't matter anyways.  \n\n\nHe repeated his argument, insisted I was being stupid and illogical and that \"You're not being punished!\" and I agreed, again, that my earlier conclusion was unlikely and I was simply considering that possibility because I was stumped. I asked what he thought, and he repeated his entire argument, ignoring the hard data we have showing that no, my readers really don't care about genera.  \n\n\nThe argument looped 5 times before my roomate called me away to drive her to the store (she dosn't have a license). I was so pissed off that I almost crashed twice. When I got back home, I was still mad, so I asked Editor to apologize. Not for arguing with me, just for pissing me off to the point where I almost ran into an oncoming snowplow because I was too angry to notice it.  \n\n\nEditor refused, saying he wont apologize for being right.  \n\n\nI told him that would be fine because we wouldn't be talking for the foreseeable future, and removed his flair on my discord which makes him as a friend of mine. This pissed him off so much he left the server completely.  \n\n\nAs far as I am concerned, since Editor will argue with me like that at least once a week, and never apologizes sincerely, we wont be talking ever again... But I feel like an asshole for abandoning him like that. Am I?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": " Rewind to a few months ago. I meet this amazing girl. After talking for a while I find out she's studying in another country. I've done long distance relationships before and I'm not too keen on it. I express my reservations around LDRs straight away. But I fall for her hard and she convinces me it's not so bad - \"it has it's advantages\". She returns to her country of study.  We text every day while she's away. Not something I enjoy normally but you gotta do what you gotta do, and she doesn't do phone calls.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and she comes home for Christmas. We go on our first date. It goes great. She thinks so as well. She tells me she doesn't go on a second date with someone unless she sees it going somewhere.\n\nThankfully, she agrees to a second date and it goes even better. We express we both want to make the most of our time together over the holidays. Then our next 3 or 4 dates go amazing. We talk about everything, even our future. She tells me she wants me to visit her after she goes back to college. I'm more than happy to. I fly over and we have a wonderful time. \n\nAt some point she warns me that she turns into a \"demon\" when it comes to texting during her exams. I understand, she's stressed and distracted. Everything is normal until a couple weeks ago when she stops replying to some of my messages of ignoring them altogether. Fair enough, she's stressed and focusing on her studies. But then I find out she's going out during her exams. Including the night before one. So she has time to party but not for me? That's when my sympathy starts to wane. Also, I know she's online but ignoring my messages.\n\nOur texting (only form of communication) becomes less frequent, especially because she never texts first, rarely asks me questions, and I grow tired of carrying a one-sided conversation. So now I start to think she's not distracted but disinterested. I'm gutted and frustrated. These things happen but at least tell me.\n\nFast forward to a couple days ago. We're surprisingly messaging back and forth and I know she's due home soon so I ask her if she booked flights. She has but she's not staying home for long. I ask if I'm going to see her, and she responds she'll message me when she's \"in our city and available\". Now I'm confused.\n\nI really want to make this work. Yet, if she doesn't want anything more out of this fair enough. But I think the decent thing to do is at least tell me. So I'm not wasting any more time and energy. Am I being unreasonable? Or WIBTA by calling her out / asking her asap where this is going?",

I've been a few times and haven't really liked going, so far it's just been the same thing each week including standing around having awkward small talk and watching the kids play on the equipment (except my son who doesn't walk yet). I don't really feel comfortable going, I'm the youngest by at least 10 years (currently 20y/o), while they're all pretty cool guys, I can't really relate to any of them and feel a sense of judgement for being so young. I also struggle with talking to them about their kids, because so far all of them have said their kids are great and sleep through the night, whereas my son fights sleep and wakes up multiple time a night, I don't really like hearing how everyone else has it so much easier :/ \n\nMy partner thinks it's good for me to get out of the house, which it is, but she's adamant that I go to this group even through I've already been a few times and don't particularly get anything out of it in terms of feeling better, or feel getting a new \"support community\". My partner feels I'm being stubborn and writing it off because I don't want to socialise. \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "I  love telling stories, but, one of my favorites paints another in a  really negative light, so, am I an asshole for telling this story?\n\nAbout  20 years ago, I blew out my knee skiing. I tore my ACL and MCL  (ligaments). The MCL will heal on it's own, but, the ACL will not. I  went to the orthopedic surgeon, and for whatever reason, this guy was  really adamant that I should have reconstructive surgery.\n\nI  wanted to wait until the MCL had healed just to see what the knee would  be like without the surgery, and the Dr is telling me I should get the  surgery right away to avoid a second recovery (good point).\n\nThis  discussion turned into a debate, and I was going over my reasons for  wanting to wait, and he's giving me his reasons why I should get it done  right away. He had some good points, and I was considering his advice  carefully. Even after his points were made I still wanted to wait.\n\nMy  last debate point was: \"If I decide to get the procedure done 20 years  from now, you're techniques will be that much better\". At this point he  said the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard from the mouth of a  physician.\n\nHe said, \"No, we've got it figured out, it's not going to get better than it is now\"\n\nMy ears listened in disbelief as a previously unknown part of my brain took over my mouth and said:\n\n\"What are you talking about, you guys are barely above leeches and stone knives?\"\n\nThe  doctor completely lost his shit at this point. He got 6 inches from my  face and SCREAMED at me for several minutes. All the stuff you'd expect  about how I disrespected him, and have a lot of nerve, etc. I basically had to wait until he calmed down, and I left. I was definitely not  letting this guy anywhere near me with a knife.\n\nThe  waiting room outside was packed with people that all heard it and kinda  looked up at me as I was coming out of the examining room. The seemed  concerned.\n\nPostmortem analysis:\n\n1. There is still medical use of leeches, and there are scalpels made of Obsidian, which is a stone. (well volcanic glass anyway)\n2. I've never regretted not getting it done.\n3. I've researched it and techniques have improved and now 20 years later, I am thinking of getting the ACL reconstructed.\n4. I've never identified the man, just told the story about how he came completely unglued.\n5. I think it's funny.\n\nAm I an asshole for repeating this story and thinking it's funny?",

They continue to give the cold shoulder despite the fact that we got along great before this.\n\nTL;DR - I had a friend of mine over to have sex and hang.

      "description": "A few years ago, I went to a charter school in my state which was well known for their STEM program. At the time, I hung out with 3 people- F1, F2, and BF (bestfriend) Now, these friends and I had been friends since middle school, but things had been getting tense lately between me, F1, and F2. There was sort of a wall forming between us- they'd pretend I didn't exist in conversations and they'd talk shit about BF (who, at the time, who I was still fairly close to). I still had a semi-positive view of them, though, so I just endured it. The problem came when it was time to work on this project. I was systematically excluded from nearly every aspect of the assignment. Now, to be fair, the project slipped my mind after a bit- I was a busy person- but I didn't even have the link to the powerpoint so I could edit. They never spoke a word to me about the project, just worked on it themselves. Several weeks pass, and the project is now due. F1 and F2 ask me to edit the project at the very last minute, and I rush to do it, but we still get a bad grade, and my A drops to a B-. My grades mattered a lot to me back then- I was so pissed I didn't talk to them for the next few days. \n\nF1 and F2 had a habit of cheating on tests. F1 would take a test and write down the answers somewhere and pass it to F2, who had the same period later in the day. One morning in my Health class, I mention being worried about my Chemistry grade and F1 offers to make me a cheat sheet. I say yes. On the period of the test, I ask F2 if she had an extra copy. She says no, sorry, F1 only made one. At this point, I'm done. Looking back on it,she could have just forgotten, but at the time I was pissed. The project and the shit-talking came back to me, and I get an idea. I go to the teacher and tell him that F2 had the answers to the test written on her periodic table. I  expected him to out her immediately, but instead he hangs back and stares directly at her paper. She couldn't even take it out. He was staring at her so intensely that someone else across the room would have been able to cheat. He comes up to her and says 'Can I see your periodic table?' She turns it over and he sees the answers. He takes the periodic table and her test and she sits there with her head down for the remaining hour. Later I find out that she got a 50 in the gradebook (generous of him) and her grade went down to a 68. He wouldn't let her make it up. She made up some other assignments and the grade was raised to a 69, so she had a 69 for her report card. A bit of time passes and I forget about it. One morning, I'm called to the principal's office along with F1 and F2. Once it's made clear that no, I did not cheat on the test, I'm unpunished. Since this is the SECOND time they get caught cheating, they both get ISS. F1 and I were in National Honor Society, but I assume she was kicked out. We're still civil because they don't know I reported them.",

      "description": "Just a heads up, this is probably gonna be NSFW\nOkay so, I am in a w/w relationship for four years now, we are both 20, so we started dating rather early but we both had serious relationships before that, (as serious as it can get when you're fourteen).\nSo I love her, we work absolutely great together, I'm talking soulmate level here. I am absolutely sure I will marry this girl but that is also my problem. Since I found my perfect partner so early on, I barely had any time to experiment. I know it sounds ungrateful but my sexuality is a big part of who I am. I am very kinky and she recently found out that she is asexual and I know I should support her more, I know I should be happy for her, but here's the thing, I fucking hate it. \nI sorta feel trapped because sex is not only a way to get off for me, but it's a way to be close and intimate and all that stuff and I would choose one time with her over 100 times with strangers.\nSex in general is no big deal for me, it doesn't have to have any feelings attached to it, it's just for fun if it's with someone I don't love, but in a relationship I need this aspect. That she doesn't want me, also makes me feel super unattractive. \n\nShe feels extremely guilty for \"trapping\" me even though I tell her that it's okay, that I have no right to demand anything but I still feel… unloved and ashamed for how I am since she is so \"pure\". \nThe worst thing about all of this is though, that since she found that label for her, my love language is being completely left behind. No more hickeys, no more making out, no more talking about anything sexual, hell we barely even kiss on the lips. She says its because she likes kisses to everywhere else more but I just feel like this is drifting more into a platonic relationship than anything else and it's just not enough for me. I do not feel loved even though I know how much she loves me. \n\nWe tried an open relationship but whenever I am with someone else, (of course she agrees first and I tell her everything), she absolutely hates it. She is crying and shaking and she feels horrible for \"guilting\" me into coming back, so I don't do that anymore either. \n\nTl;dr: AITH for needing a more physical way of relationship to feel loved? \n",

      "description": "Soo, this happened some while ago but it's been brought up by a coworker recently and they made it known they thought i was an asshole for doing what i did, so i needed some neutral insight on it.\n\nHere's what happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got a job at a fast food chain last summer during the holidays to save up some money. Worked there as a regular for three months, then became a part timer when college started again. It didn't take long until i noticed one of the supervisors was unnecessarily rude and mean to me. at first i thought it might be his personality or he must be going through a tough time, which is why he acted like he did, eg insulting me for minor mistakes, getting pissed when i didn't do smth right or didn't know how to do smth, suspecting me of talking smack about him whenever id converse with another coworker. \n\nbut then i noticed he was nice to everyone else except for me. \n\nso then i thought ok, it must be because i'm still new and i'm not capable yet and he is simply frustrated that i'm not doing stuff right. but then we got another newbie and he was perfectly fine with that dude? they even became close friends in a short span of time. so that couldn't be it either.\n\ni didn't even give him any reason to dislike me, i was always respectful and gave my best. all the other coworkers were telling me how they were impressed with how fast i got the hang of everything but for some reason i could never do anything right for him.\n\nother coworkers would frequently have arguments with him that'd get personal, but he was still always friendly to them.\n\nwhat's weird is that on some days he'd be incredibly nice and joke around n stuff but then turn right around the next day and be pissy again. i always blamed myself for his mood changes, thinking i must've given him some sort of reason to be this way and felt really guilty.\n\nthe thought crossed my mind that maybe he thought i hated him, for whatever reason, and that's why HE started to dislike me?? and it was just a huge misunderstanding. but i didn't know for sure.\n\ni did confront him about it but he'd say that he didn't have any problems with me and he was treating me like he treated everyone else too.\n\nat the end i just accepted that he hated me (and possibly thought that i hated him too?) and decided that i wouldn't try to make him like me and stopped caring. i noticed he was shittalking me behind my back to others and so i decided i wouldn't hold back either and openly voice my frustrations with him. i never attacked him personally tho, i only ever complained about how he handled things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter becoming a part timer and seeing him twice a week only, he got a lot nicer. helped me convince my store manager to give me some days off, shared personal stuff with me, joked around with me. i didn't know why he suddenly changed but i didn't think too much of it. i thought that maybe he'd finally realized i didn't have any problem with him or didn't dislike me anymore. As soon as we started getting along i stopped complaining about him too. i thought it was awesome we could finally work together without that weird tension between us.\n\nthis went on for a few months, we sort of became friends. i still had some trust issues, i got anxious every time i clocked in thinking that this time he'd be mean again (since it happened in the past, he was nice for one day, then bitchy the other). but i truly wanted to forget all the conflict and just start over new. i was a good friend to him, didn't shittalk him or anything like that. i'm not twofaced like that.\n\nbut then one day i clock in and i immediatly notice he's pissed again. i shrug it off as maybe he has a bad day, but he's nice to everyone else again. i'm like oh no is it starting again??? i thought we were getting along well? towards the end of my shift he calls me aside and tells me he needs to talk to me.\n\nhe tells me a coworker told him i was talking smack abt him to everyone else while simultaneously smiling in his face and pretending to be friends. i tell him that's not true etc, i say i only did that back when we didn't get along because i thought you hated me! after arguing for a long time (some tears of frustration on my part lol) he finally decides he believes me. i apologize to him for talking abt him in the past.\n\nwe've been good work buddies ever since (it's only been 1 month lol) even tho i still get anxious that he'll suddenly change again sometimes &amp; still don't know the reason WHY he treated me like an ass in the beginning. he seems to be over it tho and trusts me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nstill, my coworker told me they thought i was an asshole for simply assuming that he hated me \"without any proof\" and being vocal about my frustrations with him. so? am i the asshole? was it wrong for me to assume he hated me and deciding that i would stop caring? should i still have been nice to him? and also- what should i have reacted like instead?\n\n//sorry in advance for any spelling &amp; grammatical mistakes, english isn't my first language",

      "description": "Late Saturday night I hit a huge pothole and it caused my tire to start leaking air. I was planning on getting it patched up yesterday, but all of the good tire shops in my area were closed for Sunday. Instead, I borrowed my gf's car to get to classes today and asked my gf to drive my car to the tire repair shop while I was gone (she does not have classes/work Mondays). However, when I was leaving I found my tire had now gone completely flat, so I texted my gf and told her not to worry about it and that I would change the tire and drive over to the tire shop myself when I got home.\n\nAfter seeing this text, she did not reply and instead decided to try to drive my car with the flat over to the gas station \\~0.5 mile away to fill it up with air and then go over to the tire shop from there in an attempt to surprise me by fixing my tire for me. What ended up happening was that she got about halfway there when the flat tire fell off the rim and she had to get my car towed to the tire shop. Thankfully the car/rim were undamaged and the tire was able to be patched up just fine, but it obviously cost more than it needed to with the tow. I only found all this out when I got back home and saw my car was missing.\n\nThis upset me because\n\n1. She didn't tell me she was doing this. It is my car and she could have damaged it by driving on a flat.\n2. She put herself at risk unnecessarily.\n3. She cost herself money and wasted her whole day off getting my car towed unnecessarily.\n\nI understand that she was trying to do a nice thing, but I wish she would have just left it alone. Upset as I was, when she got home I thanked her (albeit maybe a bit curtly) for trying to do something nice for me but to please at least tell me she was going to do what she did so I could tell her not to if I didn't think it was a good idea. This greatly upset her that I would be mad at her for getting my tire fixed.\n\nAITA for not appreciating what my gf did?",

      "description": "\nSo me and my best friend have the same lunch in school and our lunches are spent exclusively together. Maybe one person joins us but other than that we really only eat with each other.  So I never worry about lunch since I know I’ll have her with me.\n\nAnyway flash forward to today and she texts me saying that she’ll be in the library, so I should meet her there since she was dismissed early, I ask if we can eat first since I was starving and I hadn’t eaten anything all day. Food isn’t allowed in the library so she said to eat without her and then go to the library. \n\nI got irritated at how flippantly she suggested that. I have no one else to eat with so I felt she was basically condemning me to eat in the bathroom before I meet her. This isn’t the first time she’s told me to eat alone either.\n\nAnyway since I live close by to the school I just told her that I would be going home and skipping my 4th period. She spammed me a bunch of texts saying that she had something to do in the library and to not leave. And brought up that she wouldn’t ditch me if she was in a similar situation. And that we could eat together after.\n\nI found this hypocritical since she’s mad at me for deserting her when she’s essentially doing the same thing to me. She’s mad at me for leaving when she left me. \n\nAnyway I felt guilty and told her that I signed out already but I could wait till she’s done in the library and then we could eat since I saw she was mad. And she told me to go and that it was fine. But obviously it wasn’t fine seeing as how she sent it like:\n\n“ it’s fine. Go. “\n\nWhatever I left. And her birthday is tomorrow so I feel like an asshole. Should I have been more patient? ",

My sister was scheduled to give a lecture. Before my sister even came into the room 3 of the older members showed up out of nowhere and saw a few of our younger members on their phones. Which one old member said he didn't like seeing them out and everyone should put them into their pockets which we respectfully did. The second old woman stood over us and said \"NO they shouldn't have their phones at all\" and proceeded to ask us individually for our phones. The first guy gave it up and I was second and I said \"no\" which seemed to stun her for a second before she asked everyone else and who all said \"no I'll keep it in my pocket\" keep in mind there was still no sign of my sister. After another 5 minuits she shows up and starts giving her lecture and I make a few sniggers to my girlfriend because it's my sister. Her lecture finishes and I'm called outside by the old man and was told that I am wrong. Overtly rude. The reason why all the cadets are against the seniors ect. I said no I still stand that she shouldn't be allowed to bark at us expecting everyone to give up their phones when we're all here on our own free time. I am brought inside confronted by the 3 seniors why all give their own piece if mind. I'm told I'm wrong and disrespectful. The one I said no too is a lutenent (due to her not insubstantial contribution to the unit for medical supplies. Which she got by fundraising with another group) and that \"this is a military organisation and if i don't understand that now I will by the end of this\" whatever \"this\" is. At which point they stored out and said they were reporting me to the officer in charge.",

      "description": "So yesterday,  this friend of mine(12F) was being annoying by constantly bugging us (me(15M) and my two other friends) and coming to us back and again with water pretending they are gonna throw it at us,  but they didn't . So, we also started teasing her. At one point,  she throws the water at me,  which wet my pants. So, I pretend as if I'm gonna take revenge, but I don't. I WA fine with teasing but I didn't want it to escalate to physical teasing. So,  I do nothing. \n\nAfter some more teasing,she gets so annoyed that she throws water at me again,  and this time much more water,  wetting my pants more. Now, I want revenge. So I go to fetch some water, but she runs to her home. And I couldn't do anything.\n\nToday,  I come at her outta nowhere and throw water at her. The amount was less than the amount she threw at me, but it was fine because I was relieved.But then, she calls her parents and they create a big hassle by blaming me for doing that to a girl,  who is younger than me. I don't think that she's that young for her age to become a deciding factor for who is to be blamed (also the gender) ,  and neither are age gap is that wide.\n\nBut in the end , I get all the blame and scoldings and our mutual friend ( 13F who is also my crush) now thinks I'm the wrong here. And that is scaring me that I might have ruined any chances with her by looking like an asshole. Am I the wrong here? ",

      "description": "The other day I was getting bubble tea with my roommate, and after leaving I commented on how I hated that the debit payment menu asked how much you wanted to tip, and that I felt awkward typing in $0 and I wished they would just remove it. This prompted an (admittedly very civil) argument about whether you should tip the people behind the counter that prepare your drinks (such as baristas). \n\nMy logic is that they’re not providing any service- they’re not coming to a table to take my order, they’re not bringing my food to me at a table, etc- all they’re doing is putting my drink in a cup and handing it to me from behind the counter. Also, baristas and other similar workers get (at least) minimum wage, so they don’t rely on tips the way servers do. \n\nI’ve never really second guessed this, but I’ve been thinking about it a lot since then. My roommate said she always tips if it’s an option, especially with specialty drinks like flavoured lattes and stuff. She seemed to think that not tipping is rude and acted like I was really upsetting her when I talked about why I don’t tip- the conversation ended with her saying “it’s whatever, it’s your money you don’t have to tip” and she looked upset- she made me feel like I was a really bad person for not tipping. So reddit, AITA? Should I be tipping my baristas and other behind-the-counter workers?  ",

      "description": "Hey guys,\n\nRecently I've been feeling guilty about something, but simultaneously feeling like I shouldn't feel guilty about it so I figured I'd bring it here.\n\nI've been seeing this girl off and on for a while, and while nothing super serious has happened I've been distancing myself from her, and I'm unsure if that's an asshole thing to do, or if I owe her an explanation.\n\nWe had been hanging out at her place when she went to go take a shower. While she was in the shower I noticed she left discord open and decided to ctrl+f my name in the open conversation to see if I came up. (I'll explain why at the end) The first message I found kinda shook my reality. She had basically said she was using me to get over an ex, and once I had \"outlived my usefulness\" she was gonna ditch me. Searching a bit more she had also said that she changed her mind and thinks she might actually like me, however the first message stuck with me more. \n\n\nSince then I have been Slowly cutting her out as I cannot shake the feeling that our relationship was just a game to start out and I kinda want to just get out and never talk to her again. WIBTA for this? If so, would explaining myself help my case?\n\nPostnote: A while back I had left my discord open around her and she had searched her name in my conversations too, luckily the only message that was secretive was that I thought she had a dorky laugh. So she had been teasing me about this, I was hoping to get something to tease her back about.",

      "description": "So me and my ex were engaged about a week and a half ago. We decided it would be best for us to not be together. I need to get some medical stuff done so for the time being we’re still living together. We were really close and together for almost two years. We’d broken up before hand and he immediately jumped to saying another person. Like within a day. This has happened three times before we moved in together. My issue is this. We talked and I wanted to make sure that he wasn’t just going to jump into another relationship to make up for what I lack and then come back to me like the other times. I’m planning to go back to the south and doing this would fuck a lot of things up this time. So we both promised not to get into another relationship for two weeks. So that we both have time to slowly wean off of our relationship, and so we aren’t jumping to someone random. 3 days after that I find out he’s dating someone. He’s over there all the time, he’s stopped caring at all about my feelings: canceled plans to make them with him(things I’ve worked on for a long time), the time we spend together he’s not focused at all(texting, etc) even though I’m doing a lot(cooking crab legs, finding movies for us to watch, etc). It’s been pretty annoying but tonight he was gonna go out drinking(he’s 21 I’m 19) so I said to have fun and be safe, he said it back and left. He’s usually out and back by 10-11 but I woke up at 3 and he texted me at like 1 am saying “not coming home tonight, see you tomorrow”.  He went off to his new boyfriends house. As I’m typing this I feel more like the asshole but I go really upset. I haven’t said anything but I’m still really pissed off. It felt like a huge kick in the face. Am I the asshole here?",

Most of the times it was OK and my dad almost every time brings his bicycle with him. Not this time. This time he wanted to walk, because he wasn't in the mood for biking... So I went like a speeding demon trying to kill everyone that was I front of me. I forgot to mention that my dad didn't raise a spoiled brat. I knew when to stop and to listen to him when he said slow down. So I was going to normally on a new bike and two old ladies where walking. Normal right? No. I accidentally hit one of them with my front wheel. This is how the conversation went:\n-I am so sorry, are you OK?\n-OW mu butt, what is your problem. \n-Miss I am sorry I didn't mean to.\n-What can I do with your stupid sorries?\n-I didn't mean t... My dad interapses me.\n-Miss chill he is just a little kiddo.\n-I don't care he should be more careful.\n-But he didn't mean to, so please stop shouting at him.\nSo I am in the background feeling sad and looking down while I feel sorry for the woman while my dad is talking to her relaxed while she is talking mad trash about me and how they raised me.\nSo after the talk my dad cursed a little and we continued the day.\nI still felt very sad and bad about the woman but also good because she talked bad about a 5year old. \nI don't know if I am the asshole or she is or my dad. \nI will leave it up to you \n(sorry for the bad vocabulary and grammar I am still studying English and I live in Greece and I have gotten a little rusty) \n",

I guess as much time most couples who aren’t living together would spend together - maybe more.\n\nShe was there for me through some hard times and would always offer me so much emotional support, support I’d never experienced before. That’s one of the major reasons I fell for her.\n\nShe was in a long distance relationship with her ex boyfriend for three years. He was always well aware of when we would meet up alone and she always told me he was fine with it. \n\nNothing ever happened between us and I never wished for them to break up because I didn’t want her to go through that heart break. Yes, I was jealous but I was happy knowing she still cared for me even if it wasn’t romantically.

It freaked me out so I told her about my feelings towards her. She told me I wasn’t being understanding of the situation she was in - which I agree with but I guess I lacked patience. I asked her if she felt anything towards me and she didn’t answer - she just told me how upset she was at the whole situation. \n\nDid I do the wrong thing by telling her how I felt?\n\nAny advice would be great, thank you.",

      "description": "I’m only around my grandparents a few times a year, but get annoyed when they always manage to bring up politics around Thanksgiving and Christmas. No big deal, that’s just what relatives do. \n\nI’ve voiced concerns with my parents in the past about how they bring political discussions into the mix when it has nothing to do with the conversation and assume I have the same beliefs as them. At Christmas, I was discussing the stock market and how 2018 was a historically bad year. Next thing I know, my grandfather turns it into how the Democrats refuse to give Trump any credit. \n\nI told my Dad about it and explained that I want to speak up next time to share my opinions when they force politics into the discussion. My Dad says because he is old and really cares for me, I should just continue to nod along and not speak up. He feels that it would break my grandfather’s heart to speak up in opposition of his views. I feel that I’m a 24 year old adult and should not just nod mindlessly to something I disagree with.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to speak up with a conflicting opinion or should I just keep my mouth shut until my grandparents die? ",

I wouldn't care too much about missing the 1st day to go to her graduation. But she has to pack her stuff up from school and take it back home.

If you get a 72, it will also equal a \"C\" and a 2.0 towards your GPA. Regardless of whatever number in between 70 and 79 you got, it will still count as a C and a 2.0.\n\nLast year, in my Junior year of high school, I finished with an 89.35 in a class, which will not round up to an \"A,\" it will remain a \"B.\" I missed the score by 0.15. I have finished with borderline grades twice before, but both times the teachers used some magic to bump me up to an \"A,\" because to their logic, why should I receive the same grade as the kid who just skirted by with a 79.6.\n\nUnfortunately for me, this last teacher was not so kind and did not lift my grade up. Needless to say I was incredibly frustrated.\n\nMy question to you all, is were my frustrations justified, or am I just being an entitled asshole?",

      "description": "This friend, let’s call her Mary. \n\nSo Mary and I have been friends for a few years. We both have writing blogs on tumblr, and at the start of our friendship we both had very few followers and we’re both pretty unknown. \n\nAnyway, a year or so later mine suddenly got a lot of attention and a lot of followers. People were telling me how much they loved my writing and offering critique and things of that nature. I was eternally grateful for all of those nice people, and it’s really help me improve my writing. \n\nAnyway, Mary knows a lot about me. I told her a while ago that I was into BDSM. She seemed so cool with it, which was great for me. Then randomly, out of nowhere, she calls me an asshole for glorifying and sexualizing abuse and said anyone who’s a dom is a bad person and has something seriously wrong with them. This really hurt me, especially since one of my BEST FRIENDS is a dom. I tried to explain to her that BDSM is about consent and being safe, sane, and consensual and that people can leave the relationship at any time if they feel unsafe, but she wasn’t having it, and insisted I was a bad person for having a kink. \n\nAnyway, so I didn’t talk to her for a bit, but slowly we started talking again. We continue to write and create stories, and things continue on as normal. \n\nMary would often write fanfic of my characters sometimes (short 1k word dribbles, nothing serious) and I would always reblog them and be like, “this is so good!!! Follow my friend she’s great!!!”\n\nThen one day, out of the blue, she tells me that my writing is shitty and that if she were me, she would change everything about the characters and story and then proceeded to compare one of my main characters to a character in a series that she hated, and said that character was leagues above mine even though she thought that character was horribly, horribly written. It’s worth noting that she has never bothered to read more than a few pages of my story, and has admitted that she’s only read maybe the first couple chapters about a year ago. There’s like 50+ chapters now. But she justifies it with, “I don’t need to eat the whole sandwich to know that it’s shitty.” \n\nAnyway, I felt really hurt by this. I’m really fine with constructive criticism. My close friends and I critique each other’s stuff all the time and help each other improve. But I felt like what Mary said to me had crossed some sort of line, but I didn’t want to come across as too sensitive. So I had my friends read the entire conversation me and Mary had because I didn’t want to be biased(I had screenshotted it and cropped out her name so they wouldn’t know who I was talking about) and they were completely flabbergasted that a “friend” would say that to another friend.  \n\nI ended up talking to her about it like a few months ago, and she seemed to think she didn’t do anything wrong. \n\nOne of my friends told me that she thinks Mary is jealous because we started off with the same amount of followers, but now I have so many more than her and she hasn’t grown much since then, even though she posts frequently. I don’t wanna accuse her of being jealous because I feel that’s unfair, and maybe I am just a terrible writer and the thousands of people that read my stories are just too nice to tell me. Idk. I really don’t mind constructive criticism at all, but she came across really harsh. \n\nSo. AITA for thinking she was a little out of line? I really do think of her as a good friend, and I don’t want to lose her ",

      "description": "My friend is teaching me to drive. His car is quite old and had several previous repairs. \n\nLast Saturday's lesson was tricky and more than average clutch work, so I stalled more. We were going to pick up another friend and go downtown after the lesson. After picking up our other friend, we were on our way and his clutch wouldn't go back up at one point. We pulled over, he tried solving the problem to no avail. Since my other friend and I couldn't find a permissible parking space near the area we were in, he had to call a tow truck. His car is at the mechanic's and it was a problem with some fluid that was too complicated for him to fix himself, and it might put his car out of commission for good. \n\nI messaged him asking what time he'll get his car back on Monday, but no response. The car is his only reliable way to get to work. Money is tight for both of us. WIBTA if I don't ask anything about mechanic/tow truck fees, knowing that my lack of stick shift skills might have caused the clutch problem? ",

      "description": "Driving on the rightmost lane (\"fast lane\", this being straya, and proud of our colonial heritage we drive on the ~~wrong~~ *proper* side), the traffic began slowing down and speeding up in cycles - it slowed down to ~40 km/h, sometimes almost stopping, picked up again, and repeated every minute or so - for no apparent reason. After a couple of these cycles, I decided there's no point in accelerating back to 100 just to slow down again, so I stuck to a fairly constant speed, around 70kmh, that let me keep up with the traffic without having to hit the brakes, but of course I ended up letting a rather large gap form in front of me during the peaks of the cycles. During one of these peaks, I was overtaken on the left by a man in an Infinity who communicated to me, using his hands and horn, that he did not find my decision satisfactory.\n\nI could have moved to the left without any hassle if I had been a bit more aggressive, but the freeway was fairly packed and since my exit was still a fair distance away, I wasn't in a hurry to move over and took my sweet while to find a comfortably large gap before I started switching lanes.

      "description": "I'm going to try and be as unbiased as possible. Also this is very long so go back if you don't want to read a novel. \n\nQuick Context: We met during a really bad time in my life and I needed a good friend. From the first few times we hung out, she wanted me to live with her as she knew my living situation was not the best. I declined for a few months but eventually caved as she was persistent. I moved into the smallest bedroom of the house and paid cheap rent. We hung out all the time and shared some really good moments together. I loved her alot. We lived together for two years.\n\nThe Story: I was living with my dog, her, her dog and her boyfriend. Everything was pretty alright allot of the time. She and I spent alot of time alone as her boyfriend was a workaholic. We used to go to shows together, go to the park and go on trips together just the two of us. Like I said I was in a bad time in my life so I didn't think too much of myself. I liked what she liked. Did what she did. I went where she went. If she didnt care for something, neither did I. Honestly I lost myself a bit during that time. We did everything together and she seemed pretty happy to have me as her best friend so that made me content. \n\nBy year two my boyfriend was also living there as well as a 5th person and my anxiety was almost unmanageable. I started going to a therapist and that helped tremendously. That was about the same time that I started getting fed up with a few things. My original roommates(the couple) were not treating my dog very well. Everyone who lived there was in a group chat and the chat turned into a method of calling people out and embarrassing them(namely me and my boyfriend). Specifically I was noticing things about my friend that I didn't like i.e. her treating my dog badly(punishing hhim, locking him in my room and not letting him out, calling him names), acting like her dog was more important than my dog, insisting that she's right despite anything proving otherwise, her essentially pitching a fit if things didn't go her way. Things weren't always bad but I just couldn't ignore it when they were and I expressed these concerns more and more to my therapist each week. \n\nThe straw that broke the camels back was one day she yelled and screamed about something trivial and stormed out of the house. It wasn't directly at me but the entire house. Because of my high anxiety I ended up having a panic attack in my room. After calming down I decided no more. I made up my mind to stay out of the house as much as possible and when I did have to be home (which wasn't often)I kept my room door closed, only leaving for food and bathroom needs. I stopped hanging out with her all the time and I finally made some time for my family and other people. I explored new friendships. The time that I spent away from her was good for me but at the same time I did have the hope that she would notice I wasn't around and realize she was pushing me away. There were a few times we did hang out over this period but it was always with a group of mutual friends and I didn't interact with her very much.  \n\nThe Beginning of the End: Well she finds out I am planning a trip with a friend of mine. This trip happens to fall on a day that she wants to throw a last minute party. She tells me I have to cancel my plans and come to her party instead because I'm her best friend. This is the first time I tell her no flat-out and it doesn't go well. After stewing and pouting, she ends up deciding to have the party another day. I said that to say this: the next day she confronts me about not being around. She tells me that I'm not making time for her and that she really needs me to do that. At this point I could have told her \"I havent been hanging out with you because of A, B, and C\" but I didn't think that would go over well. So I tell her I don't know what she's talking about and ask if this has anything to do with my refusal to cancel my plans with my other friend. Well turns out that was the wrong response because she absolutely blows up. \n\nThe Wrap-up: Our friendship doesn't end there but it might as well have because it just continues to get uglier and uglier from here on out. I don't regret ending the friendship by any means.  Regardless, I feel like this was an opportunity for me to be honest and possibly start a dialogue with her, however my assumption that she wouldn't have taken it well caused me to not even give her a chance to redeem herself. \n\n\nSo, AITA?\n",

      "description": "Lewis (House mate 27 m) is a pretty bad house mate. I will explain everything he has done to lead to me to consider to leave his food to rot. So i am 21 yet i feel like i take care of Lewis who prior 8 months i had no idea he existed so its not as if we have a history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen i moved in Lewis was a chef and did crazy hours from 6 am till 10 pm so when he came home he never cleaned or anything but it was understandable because of his hours so i accepted this. Eventually he quit and became a sales person for a food delivery company. Now he was working the same hours as me and should be doing as much as me in terms of house work. But no, he is messy, lazy and every time i tell him to do something he will come with something to say to not do it. For example, our landlord was coming and we agreed we had to clean the place and he said why should he, and said its like \"me shitting on his doorstep and asking him to clean it up\" he probably hasn't cleaned the bathroom or kitchen in over 4 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe broke his iPhone charger and then asked me to fix it (as i am a bit of a techy) but i couldn't so i gave him a spare phone to use until he got a new charger which is only like 10 pounds. This lasted a month and he still didn't get a charger but i wanted my spare phone back so i had to go out of my way to get a charger so i could get my phone back. he didn't even thank me or pay me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe never buys oil, toilet paper or any necessities and steals mine but every time i bring it up he says i'm being a tight f\\*\\*\\* and that he never uses them which me and my other house mate know he does and its resulted in us hiding our stuff. He also never takes his house key and always expect us to open the door for him every night. My cousin and i decided to let him stay outside for 15 mins before we let him in, he started banging on the door that the neighbors came out to see what was going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now to the part that this has lead up to which i feel is my revenge almost. Since he works for this food delivery place that sends him 10 meals a week and costs him 44 pounds. Delivery is every Sunday and he has gone Spain and hasn't cancelled this order or anything, i missed the delivery but they left the box outside. I just plan on leaving it there for him to find all rotten when he comes back. I'm not going out of my way to put it in the fridge. I've thought about maybe putting a sign on it saying take if you want for people passing by but then i feel he could report me for theft or something. So ive decided to just leave it and let it be. I know it's a waste of food and i feel bad it could be used but i don't want him to blame me, i'd rather he just learn a lesson.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, i know he is an asshole. But with what i'm doing now AITA?",

      "description": "So I hang with a group of friends and we're all pretty nerdy. We watch anime, play videogames, go to conventions, esports tournaments, etc. You get the gist, we're a bunch of geeks.\n\nOne day this guy just showed up and latched onto us. He was invited to our party and I honestly have no idea how he ended up here. He was somebody's sister's, classmate's, coworker's, teammate or something like that.\n\nAfter the party ended, he'd somehow been invited to our group chat, which is think is a huge mistake.\n\nNow we can't get rid of him without being super rude to his face. He invites himself to everything, and even when we ignore him, he starts messaging us individually asking for when we're hanging out. A few of the nicer people in our friend group just feel sorry for him and cave, and end up inviting him along.\n\nHe has nothing in common with us. He's loud, energetic, super active, and basically has no geeky interests at all. But he's so desperate for friends that he ends up going along with whatever we do, but just sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nFor example, a few of us are are obsessed with an anime based mobile game, and occasionally we just sit down together and do nothing but grind events. Like we're that geeky. Some of us have multiple accounts and dual boot the app on our phone.\n\nTo fit in, he downloaded it and started playing even though he has no idea what it's even about. And he only ever plays it when we whip out our phones at designated double exp event times.\n\nOr how we'll all go wait in line to watch the My Hero Academia movie, and he wants to tag along. Even though he has absolutely no idea what's going on. He's just so desperate I feel like an ass just for not reciprocating! He even COOKS for us, he's so desperate it's...I feel like an ass for not wanting to be friends.\n\nLike why does this guy even want to be friends with us? Why can't he find friends with his own interests? None of us want to kick him out because we've all experienced being a cast out loner because of our weird hobbies, and he's genuinely nice. But he's making things so awkward for all of us!\n\nLike if he only showed up occasionally, I wouldn't mind as much. But he shows up to literally everything, even when we're being passive aggressive and refuse to carpool with him, he'll drive an hour just to follow us to an event.\n\nAm I an asshole for feeling absolutely nothing but annoyance towards a guy who hasn't done anything wrong but be different?",

      "description": "So here goes the story. My ex and i broke up last October over unrelated issues. Both of us had a role in the breakup but in the end I was the one who finalized it. He still loved me at the time of our breakup, so he wouldn’t see me or let me go to his house (where our whole friend group hung out) because it hurt him too bad. After about a month I missed him, as well as missing my friends at his house. I started flirting with him again and finally ended up asking him to start a friends-with-benefits situation. He agreed. We started hanging out all the time again and i would spend most nights at his house. His roommate, (my current boyfriend) was always there and he and i would end up sitting together while the group all hung out. His roommate and i clicked immediately and we would sometimes flirt with each other in front of my ex, but we never actually did anything physical besides some light snuggling. Eventually, my ex confronted me about liking his roommate and i told him the truth. I said that i wish i loved him back but that i can’t control who i like and who i connect with. We ended our friends-with-benefits and he promptly blocked me on all social media, cut me off from my remaining mutual friends, and made his roommate move out. He had to move back in with his mom. I’ve now apologized profusely to him for my mistakes and pain i caused him while we were dating as well as the dick stomping i did by dating his roommate. I’ve told him that i can’t change the past and can only be the best person I can be now. However he still is extremely upset and angry at both me and my boyfriend (his ex-roommate). He flexes on us and sends us hateful texts via other people’s phones, and he told my boyfriend that they could not be friends again until he breaks up with me. \nAfter everything stacks up, am I still the asshole?",

      "description": "I work in a restaurant, on Sunday’s I have a closing shift with another manger, we’ll call him B. So normally when I close I clean back of house, which means I do the dishes the trash and deck scrub the floor before putting the morning dishes back where they go. \n\nLast Sunday B told me to clean the dining room instead so G could do back of house. I agreed and around 9 I started cleaning and by 10 I had all my duties done. Tables, chairs, trash cans, bathrooms and swept and mopped. \n\nI go help B and T who are cleaning the kitchen and just help out by cleaning the walls and the hood so we can leave on time. \n\nNow the whole time I was cleaning B is doing the milkshake machine (should only take like 30 minutes tops) and t is cleaning the grill (15 minutes) and I’ve managed to sweep mop and clean the rest of the kitchen. \n\nI go to the back once I’ve done that and b comes to the back and sees me and with his phone in hand tells me to take out the trash for G. I look at him and tell him no because if I do back of house no one takes the trash out for me. He then tells me to scrub he floors in the back. \n\nAt this point I start getting an attitude and give him another look. He still has his phone in his hand and is sitting in the back office. I tell him “no, when I do back of house no one does that for me” he looks up from his phone and tells me he does all the time, now gaining looks from G and T. \n\nA few minutes later he goes “okay let’s put the dishes away.” And stands there while I put them back and start getting very agitated. I tell him yet again that when I do the back no one but me puts the dishes away to which he says he does all the time. \n\nBut here’s the thing, he doesn’t. So I grab my stuff and clock out. \n\nAm I the ass-hole for giving him an attitude while he sits back and kicks it?",

      "description": "I had this friend. We had been friends for a year or two, had hung out a fair bit and knew each other through mutual friends before we became friends. This was great with a solid two years of just being friends, except around the end of 2017. I ended up having some feelings for her. Spend a solid 2 months thinking that it was incredibly stupid idea to try anything and that it was just a fleeting feeling, I hadn't seen us as anything but platonic before that.  \n\n\nEventually it dragged on long enough that I talked to her about it, surprisingly enough it didn't immediately ruin things, we chatted about it some and she felt something too. We were both fairly apprehensive about it so took things slowly thinking it over but ultimately we ended up deciding we were a thing. Which was great, except, about two months into us dating she got depressed. After chatting about it some she started seeing a psych and things were pretty hunky dory still. The depression wasn't a huge hurdle, sometimes she got in pretty low but I tried to be as supportive as possible and help cheer her up. Ultimately it wasn't a huge issue like I said, and the whole thing was a rather normal relationship.  \n\n\nThis was until she got worse with the depression, felt numb all of the time and rarely was her more 'up' self. I tried to be supportive where I could, just by chatting and hanging out which she said helped. That said, the whole thing stopped being fun at all for me. Not that I saw having fun as contingent on being in a relationship, I still cared about them a lot and tried to help where I could, but it became really exhausting to deal with and I started to really not like hanging out at all because the whole experience was really confronting. I'd not know if I was going to have a fun time just chatting or hanging out, or if we would sit in silence for a few hours, or if she'd be in some weird passive aggressive mood. The whole not knowing what was going to be the case was a pretty dread inducing feeling, but, I did't want to let on that it was having any impact on me and just pushed those feelings to one side to act as a rock I guess.  \n\n\nThe up/downs and not knowing what was going to happen was prevalent up until the end of last year, when she had become super distant. We didn't really hang out, we didn't really text, any attempt by me to strike up a conversation was completely unreciprocated and the whole thing left me feeling pretty shit. I let it go on for about month where we were super distant before we ended things. We broke up on decentish terms I guess, we decided to try and be friends. However, she just grew much more distant but at the same time started feeling better. Over december what little we talked she seemed to be back to her usual self, but just had basically no time for me. We didn't hang out in person at all, sometimes we'd call, but she'd just play her music out loud and not really try to engage in the conversation. It really shitted me when she'd pause the music for her to say something but leave it going when I was talking.   \n\n\nEventually I tried talking about it, but I found it really hard to keep my cool for some reason. She didn't like that I was having a problem with her feeling better, but I wasn't, it was more she had just totally disregarded me after I had been there for her so much. I don't think I did a really good job of explaining my feelings, but at the same time she didn't do a very good job of trying to listen, and that just made me more annoyed after all the time I had spent trying to listen and be supportive to her over the year. We had a bit of a fight and then didn't speak for a week or two except really brief texts.   \n\n\nThen I tried to bring up the issue again, we had a massive fight were I just completely lost my cool. I called her selfish, told her about how shit dating her and being her friend whilst she was depressed was, and tried to call her out for having no patience with me when I had nothing but patience with her. This was a really long and protracted text fight, half way through she started screenshotting it all and sending to to a friend because I was \"being really immature\" and a brat. The whole thing ended with me getting the angriest I had been ever I think and just blocking her. This was about two months ago and we haven't spoken since.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole in this? I don't mean it as she is somehow obligated to do the exact same for me that I did for her, but at the same time it felt so shit to be so close to someone and tried to support them the best I could during a bad period for them, only to be basically thrown to one side. At the same time, she was depressed and I really can't blame her, and don't blame her for how she acted whilst she was depressed, just how she acted after she was seeming much more up? I get she would have still been depressed but I don't get how she didn't seem to care at all about me and how one sided things seemed to be.   \n\n\nThanks for reading this far if you did, it's a throwaway but I'll answer any questions y'all may have a lot happened and I'm not sure I know how to make sense of it. I just want a feeling as to if I'm the asshole for being mad at her about all this when I don't think I can blame someone for being depressed.",

      "description": "I'll give you some examples.   \nJust now, christmas, skyfall on the tv, we do small talk. I say something along the lines of \"yeah next one will be his last film\", she says something like \"really? skyfall is the most recent one right?\". I, in a joking tone say \"Um, that movie is 6 years old\". Ok I get it, it's not super nice but it was in a conversational tone, half joking, it was not meant to offend. Also we watched skyfall together in the theatre in 2012 and talked about spectre often enough  so it's not like I was intentionally mocking her lack of knowledge. I was jokingly referring to the fact that she probably knows it but confused it with something or was just not concentrating. Like that whole conversation was completely meaningless out of boredom. I didn't mean anything by saying that.   \nAnyway her reaction: She immediatle changes her whole expression I can see her lips pressing on each other. She says \"\\[my name\\]...Can you just ONCE not be an asshole? Why are you this way?\". I get annoyed and obviously get in a bad mood as well and have this \"not again\" expression. She goes out of the room and turns of the tv as a last \"fuck you\" before she goes out. I say \"Thanks, didn't wann watch it anyway\". She says something like \"One more word and I...\" then she goes out... She comes back a couple minutes later, just grabs my phone out of my hand without saying a word and looks up what the last bond film was. I just let it happen I know if I say one thing now the whole week is basically ruined in my family. After she found it out I say \"Can I have it back now?\" She says \"Alright\" in an annoyed tone and just throws it at me.  \n\n\nAnother time my sis and my parents came back from Ikea. They bought her a new chair for her apartment and a new shelve for our living room at home. So basically I say something like \"Do I get one too?\". (my chair is literaly broken I just didn't know they were buying one)  my dad says something like \"Yeah we can go next week again if you want\". Then my mom jokingly says \"Can you even put that together on your own?\" my dad: \"Well \\[my sister\\] and \\[me\\] can build that together\". My sister somehow thinking he was talking about the shelve: \"Ok fine, in an hour?\" Me: Oh that shelve? Nah. (It wasn't expected of me to help with that and I had other things to do). So my sister immediately interprets that as something I don't even know. She has the same sudden change of mood and starts yelling at me for \"always being such an asshole to others\" and how I will never find success in life with my attitude. I take that personal and say \"Well what are you gonna do\" she then takes of her shoes, throws them at me, starts crying, runs out and slams the door. Doesn't talk to me next 3 days.   \n\n\nAdditional info: We are both mid twenties (I'm 24, she's 26) and these things happen always when we're both at home. Basically whenever we see each other. Something always happens that ruins the whole time we are together. We both say that this only happens when we are with each other we have no problems with others. I know that's true for my part.   \n\n\nI posted about that same thing here some weeks ago and pretty much everyone agree that I'm the asshole. I fought that verdict then but I'm ready to accept it this time if that's what the community says. In this case I would probably avoid her in the future at all costs because I can't change who I am. maybe that's better for both of us. I don't want my whole day ruined just because these minor things.   \n\n\nTL;DR: My sister says I'm an asshole. I say she's overreacting.   \n",

      "title": "AITA for asking my parents to watch The Office with me after they kept bugging me about them wanting to watch it?",
      "description": "Okay so I started watching The Office on Netflix over the summer. I then rewatched the whole show about 2 more times. Sometimes my mom comes up to me and asks, “What are you watching?” So i tell her and stuff. Then she says, “Why don’t we all watch it together as a family?” I was a bit reluctant (because there are some non-parent friendly times in the show) so she backed off a little. But I eventually caved, and we agreed that we would start watching it next weekend. \n\nNext weekend came and went, and we totally forgot. Now I was kinda getting antsy because I wanted to start watching the show again, but we kept forgetting. So I started watching Parks and Rec to bide my time. And sometimes when I was watching it they would annoyingly say, “You’re not watching The Office are you,” because I guess they thought I was watching it behind their backs. Eventually we started watching it, and oh boy. \n\nThey only wanted to watch about 2 episodes **a night**. Which got annoying fast because if we wanted to complete the series before 2020 then we should probably shoot for as many as possible. Occasionally we would get into arguments because they would not want to watch it. But then I was angry because I wanted to watch it, and also confused because they kept bugging me to watch it before we started. I know that some days people just don’t feel like watching a tv show, but it seems like if I didn’t insist on watching it at least once then they wouldn’t watch it. \n\nMy dad also got into the habit of using the excuse of, “I’ve already seen this before so it’s boring.” (Keep in mind I’ve already watched the full series 3 other times and it’s still great imo) So I ask him how far he watched. And **every** single time I ask he always says the same thing, “I don’t know it’s been so long.” But to add to that he sometimes gets on my me and my moms nerves whenever we are watching another TV show by calling out what’s going to happen. Stuff like, “I knew that was going to happen” or “He’s gonna die” and it annoys the crap out of me. **But** when he tries to call out what happens during The Office, he is wrong 8/10 times. So I guess if he’s seen the show before and remembered what happened, then he’d probably be right more than he is. \n\nAlso, sometimes my mom is like, “Only one episode tonight because I’m watching **my** show.” Which I get that she needs time for her shows, but when it’s 7:30 and you’ve got like 30 mins left of your show, then we’ve got plenty of time (they usually go to bed at around 9:30-10:00). \n\nI also don’t get how they are getting so mad at me for wanting to watch a show with them that I like. I always ask if they don’t like the show, but they always say that they do like the show. Sometimes when I ask them they always try to stall by us only watching it after I’ve showered. And I usually hop in the shower at about 7:00 or 7:30. But I ask if they want to watch it at like 6:00. And they always ask, “Have you showered yet,” like I have like over an hour of free time until I shower why can’t we watch it now? Sometimes I use the analogy “8+3=11 and 3+8=11.” (Which kinda says that the order which I shower and watch The Office doesn’t matter because it will take up the same amount of time) kinda slimy, but I don’t use it anymore. \n\nTldr: Parents kept bugging me into watching The Office with them. Now that we’ve started watching it they barely want to watch it anymore, but still insist they like the show. And they also get mad when I ask to watch the show more than once or twice a night. \n",

      "description": "I know this sounds bad judging the title but trust me its nothing racist of the sort. Ive put in two years hard work at a chinese takeaway and have not one been allowed to have a holiday longer than 3 days this whole time.\n About 6 months ago my boss hired two new romanian workers . They worked for 2 months and due to the lady being ill they went back for two months . They came back two months back and are planning to go back to romania in june and september for all of both months.  Both bosses have no issues with that. \nAlso my female boss went back to china last month for a month and right now the male boss is away to china until begging of april. The female boss is again planning to take her kids on another holiday to china in july. \nNow to me and my boyfriend (we work together and live together). We have my moms wedding 9th-10th of august and my best friends wedding 24th of august. I asked for these off and jesus. All hell broke lose. Female boss kicked off big time and said it means shell struggle to run the shop. It was all resolved but she still brings it up. Recently she tried saying i cant attend an event my group at uni have organised and are running. To even pass my course attending the event is mandatory so i of course put my foot down. Until today. Little backstory my family live down in London with exception to my mom and my great-grandad has alzehimers and dementia so doesnt understand when i (gladly his golden grandchild) cant attend family events (i am really struggling with money atm and quitting without having a backup lined up is to risky ). I asked for time off in May for a week to go and see my family. I havent been to london since i started work there and have only seen them at events held for my mum or me up north. She seemed fine with that as my bf would be staying up here as most catteries up here are fully booked in may so our kitties would need him to stay. Until. I said me and bf would be off for 4 days in june or july(travelling on a monday morning and coming back friday lunch. Shop opens at 5pm) . Hell opened and satan himself arose. \"No you cant. How do you expect me to find cover for you. Im back in july to china. Blah blah blah\". Long story short everyone but me and my partner are allowed to have month holidays off but for me and bf to attend a wedding for the woman who literally sacrificed her vagina to birth me and a girl whos been there for me for 3-4 years now is a big ass deal. Am i the asshole? I understand they have moved here from romania and china respectively to get a better life but surely the rules should apply to all of us .",

      "description": "I'm a junior in high school. For some background, some kids at my school are very... boisterous, to say the least. They have very negative attitudes, too; if they meet up with each other in the hall or the lunch line, they will essentially trash-talk each other in a relatively loud manner (It's definitely in good fun, but it still comes off as obnoxious imo). Overall I'm just uncomfortable around them. I think they're too much of a bad influence and I'd rather just not interact with them at all.\n\n...which I usually do by literally not looking at them in the first place when I'm walking. When I walk to class, I just keep my eyes straight. If I see one of these particular classmates in the corner of my eye, I'll probably just glance at them and then look forward again, still walking. Sometimes they will say hi to me, but I don't respond. I just don't want to encourage their behavior and let them direct it towards me. \n\nNow we're not complete strangers; I've probably had one or two conversations with them. The thing is, they acted all nice when they talked to me, but they went to their friends right after and went back to that same negative behavior. I feel like they were just being fake with me.\n\nI've noticed for the past few weeks that I've been acting like this a lot. Am I being mean? Am I obligated to acknowledge them in the hallway, to give that social grace even if I barely know them? I need second opinions.",

      "description": "This is basically a repost but I added info in places and found it was more appropiate to post this here instead of r/tifu\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it was a normal night as usual except I have have a pretty bad cold and cannot smell or breathe out my nose, my friends come and pick me up from my house. I was waiting for awhile but didn’t mind anything of it. I get the text my friend is outside and It’s my two friends , Friend A the driver, and friend B the driver. I get into the car and they immediately tell me they are going to the store to buy JUUL pods before we get to my friends house. All is going average get the pods and on our way to my friend’s house we get pulled over for Friend A not using turn signals. Me being the dashing intellectual I am begin recording from the back seat joking like haha my friend is gonna get a random ticket haha . Cop sees me recording and points it out and it wasn’t the nicest exchange but I didn’t think anything of it, keep in mind I was sick They say the car smells like weed they have to search the car. I laugh knowing we don’t have weed that I know of so i got nothing to hide. So apparently right before I got picked up they went to go buy an 8th of weed. I was shook on the spot. I would have never recorded or been an asshat to the cops if I knew there was weed on the vehicle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriend A gets arrested as it’s in his pocket and now he is facing a 300-500 dollar charge. Cops told him that if i hadn’t recorded it they wouldn’t have searched the car and i feel like a complete loser. I feel so bad i just want to make it up to the kid but I feel he hates me no. I would have never recorded the incident in the first place if i knew there was weed in the car but I am at fault. I’m not sure what my friends think as a whole i just hope we are still friends and my boy gets through this. They also ended up not even giving him the driving violation.\n\nAlso its been 4 days since the incident and we havent talked since\n\nTLDR: My friend gets searched because i recorded a police officer and i had no idea there was weed in the car or i wouldn’t have done it. He faces a big fine and friendship could change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I live in a small-ish apartment with all vertical storage,\nand I’m shorter than my 3 other roommates by at least 6 inches. There’s a little step stool that we use to access the cabinets - the 3 others tend to only need it for the top shelf (big pots and other infrequently used stuff), but I need it for everything but the bottom shelf, including the food in my pantry. \n\nSo the relatively small AITA - AITA for keeping the step stool out? When I’m not using it I tuck it around the corner. This way I can push it in and retrieve it with my foot, and don’t have to clean my hands 100 times while cooking. Other roommates fold it up and keep it in the closet, which I would agree with if I didn’t have to use it multiple times a day, every day. It’s pretty low profile, less than 12 in, and out of sight when behind the counter. On the other hand, in their defense, it isn’t cute (crappy college step stool that has just moved with me throughout the years), I understand wanting to put it away. \n\nThis isn’t causing any real drama, and I know it’s pretty petty (we have a great relationship and this is not the hill any of us are dying on) - just wanted to turn it to the hive mind for judgement.

      "description": "Tonight I was working the late shift at Starbucks, and was told to work at the register for my shift. I was also given a list of things to get done while there were no customers wanting to order. With tonight being valentine's day, we were very slow, so I burned through the list fairly quickly. Now, the way things work at Sbux, there is only one assistant manager \"in charge\" at any given time, no matter how many are working. Tonight, I happened to be working with 4 other managers. I asked the one in charge (who I'll call C) what they wanted me to do once I finished the list, and they thought about it for a second, and then told me to just watch the register. As I walked back over there, she also told me specifically to not help with anything else except maybe making drinks if we got slammed. With how slow we were, this got boring pretty quickly, so I started absentmindedly doodling on a whiteboard we have nearby to leave notes on (making sure to ring any customers who came up immediately). C walked by about 10 minutes later, and I asked her \"Are you sure you don't need me to do anything, I'm honestly bored just standing around here.\" She looked around and said, that everything looked perfect, and just to keep watching the register. Sometimes I like to leave stupid jokes on the whiteboard for the openers, so this time I figured since I had nothing better to do, I might as well do something more extravagant. I started drawing a fairly detailed picture of a giant monster, and wrote underneath \"Merry phblthpka, praise be to \" and then a bunch of nonsense characters I made up on the spot. At one point another assistant manager (who I'll call B), who has been known to have anger issues in the past, tells me to wipe up the counter behind me because it looks terrible (even though the C said it was perfect). I spent another 15-20 minutes cleaning everything in depth again, then went back to the drawing. After B was leaving for the night, he caught a glimpse of my drawing, and flipped out. He told me that this was my last chance here, and if he ever saw me writing on that whiteboard again, he was going to write a note to our district manager (not the first time he's threatened me with that). He demanded that I drop everything immediately and erase it, and again told me that I was on thin ice. He goes on these rants so often it's a running joke at this point. I figured I was due for another one soon, so I wasn't worried until I joked about it with C, and she took his side, and so did the other employees there tonight. I asked her if she had a problem with me doing that, and she got quiet and didn't really answer. This was also weird because she has no problem calling me out when she thinks I'm not working hard enough. I could see an issue with someone getting offended maybe, but the picture was totally out of view of the customers, and I know everyone I work with well enough to say I would be genuinely surprised if they were. So am I the asshole here, and if so, why?  \nTL;DR: I was told that I had nothing to do at work except ring people up. Noone is here so i draw a picture on a nearby whiteboard (still ringing people up, no customer complaints) and other employees get angry.\n",

      "description": "Okay, so this happened yesterday. I went to grocery store to pick up some items to help my parents cook for Thanksgiving.\nAs I was getting in my car there was a guy in a truck who called me out and asked if he could a dent in my car. He stated: “hey man! I can fix that dent! I will give you a free estimate and then I can fix it for you!” \nSo I obliged and he grabbed some tools out of the back of his truck. He told me to put my foot on my break, so I got back in my car and put my foot on the break. He then started to bang the dent out. \nI immediately stopped and got out of the car and told him: “ Wait! We didn’t discuss a price for the work.”\nHe said:” it’s okay, it’s just $99”\nI then stated:” I can’t pay that much money”\nNow to give some context here. My car has a dent on the right side near the back of the car near the bumper. As well as the bumper is slightly popped out. \nHe said: “it’s okay I can do $60”\nI then stated again that I can’t pay that. At this point he has ONLY fixed the dent and not the bumper. \nI told him:”I can’t pay you that, that’s too much. I don’t even have cash on me”\nTo which he stated: “there’s a ATM at the bank over there.” The ATM was across the parking lot about half a mile away. \nI told him: “look I don’t have time for this, my family is waiting for me, I have to go”\nHe then got angry at this point and said: “So I fixed your dent for free?” \nToo which I stated: “look we never agreed on a payment before you started working on it”\nWe just went back and forth on that fact, him stating that he did the work and me stating that we didn’t agree on a payment before hand. \nHe did lower the price to $20 but I told him I have to leave. \nAt which point I got in my car and left. \nAITA for not paying him? I would have to go to the ATM which I didn’t have time for as well as we didn’t agree on any payment before he did the work. ",

      "description": "My group was assigned a project of making a poster for an engineering class, and I offered to my group to design the poster so that they could just add in the text and we would be finished. There only thing was that this project was assigned on a Thursday and I told them ahead of time that I wouldn't be able to work on it at all the entire weekend, so I was going to finish it by Friday. They all agreed and thanked me for it because I was the only person in my group that knew how to use Photoshop well. The same day that the project was assigned, my groupmates got together and did all of the research before I even got to contribute. Cool I guess, now all I need to do is design the poster! The only thing I didn't know was that my groupmates already had an idea in their head of what the poster should look like.\n\nI spent a good 4 hours that night creating a poster for my group that I figured would suffice, but once I showed my group, they said that it wasn't what they were thinking, and asked me to change a few things. I was a little annoyed at that point but it wasn't that big of a deal, so I changed the few things that they wanted the next day and showed them what I had changed. I got a message back a few hours later that they had gotten together and changed a few things about their poster concept and asked me to change some more, and even asked me to replace a part of what I had made with someone else's, that didn't even fit the rest of the design. \n\nAt this point it was already Friday night and I didn't have much more time left, so on Saturday I just added all of the information and graphs to my original design and sent it to them saying that it was going to need to do because I didn't have any more time to work on this. They decided to message me back saying that they were just going to do it by hand and that it wasn't a big deal, and I'm still pissed off that I wasted a good 5 hours working on something that my group isn't even going to use. I attached a picture of what I made so that at least someone could see it. It's definitely not my best work and was really rushed, but I still think it would have gotten us a good grade. [Here's the poster](https://i.imgur.com/jExFsZS.jpg)",

      "title": "AITA for thinking this friend wronged me and ghosting her?",
      "description": "This is long.  \nPreface: Friend is a little dense. She casually insults people our friends group knows (e.g.: \"Ah! We're only meeting at lunch because that friend of yours is a loser who doesn't have a car\").   \nWhen I said that her boss was a bit of an asshole for paying the graphic designer 5€ per graphic and for not giving his employees a regular contract (not paying taxes and insurance), she got mad because it was someone she knew and also belittled my knowledge (I am a law student). I said I'd be more mindful in the future but we had to explain her that she'd done the same things with our friends, since she had never noticed. I started thinking her judgement then.  \n\n\nAnyways, me, her and her boyfriend (also my friend) had been planning to go to Japan for over a year. I was okay with doing most of the stuff she wanted, because she can be very insistent and does not concede much once she's decided to do something.   \nHowever, she's also someone that always chooses the most expensive option because she thinks it's best. Since I'm the one with more (family) money, she never took seriously my objections and was always quick to disregard my saving tips for the trip. This went as far as her being willing to pay double the price for plane tickets because she wanted to fly with our national airways (not the safest, and well known for its regular strikes).  \nIn a moment of great mental instability due to personal reasons, I started having doubts (fueled by my unhappiness about the whole situation) and told her that i wasn't 100% sure anymore and needed to evaluate all the costs before booking. It was a two lines message and we didn't discuss it further.  \nThe next week I saw on her IG story that she had purchased the tickets. I was confused, and told her \"hey, I'm not too happy about this because I think you could have at least asked me to be sure I didn't want to go.\" She said she believed that i didn't want to go. I think it would have been normal to ask anyway, even if I had told her so (which i didn't. at all).   \nI forced myself to accept it, since I don't like arguing with her and, tbh, I thought it would fall to deaf ears.  \nSo it was okay, until our common japanese penpal wrote me saying that my friend had told her I decided not to go because it was too expensive, and that she was very sad. I explained the situation.  \n\n\nThe next time I met my friend I tried to make light of the thing me by trying to laugh off the fact that she told our penal the wrong reason, despite her knowing it wasn't because it was too expensive. She replied to me saying \"But that's the reason!\" even though I had explained it no less that two days prior. I felt extremely wronged and hurt.\n\nI was unable to feel calm or happy in all of our following interactions and I have been avoiding seeing or interacting with her ever since. I am studying a lot lately so I'm using that as an excuse to basically ghost her. I reply if she writes me, and I reply in the group chats, but it doesn't happen often and I don't initiate contact anymore. She hasn't questioned it.  \n\n\nI know I should just get over it, and I'm trying, but I can't help but think that if she doesn't bother thinking about my reasons, then I don't see why I should bother about our interactions instead of thinking about myself first. I know this is not how you keep a friend and I think I might be the asshole, despite believing that I have been wronged.  \n\n\nTL;DR Friend booked the vacation we had been planning for a year without informing me because she thought I didn't wish to go anymore and imo does not make an effort to understand my reasons, so I ghosted her.  \n",

      "description": "SO some backstory:\n\nMy girlfriend and I worked together for around 2 and a half years.  In this time we moved in together and had a child.  Beforehand she had 3 children from a previous marriage.  From day one I have accepted her children as my own.  Now that we have 4, we had a carefully balanced schedule where one of us got off, then switched kids, then the other worked.  We still managed to get one day off together.  And let me add this: through promotion I became her manager.  So to the story.\n\nThis past weekend, St. Patricks, is our busiest weekend of the year.  We are a restaurant and bar.  She and I have been fighting from Friday night until Sunday.  Towards the end of the night she is getting miffed and tells me she quits.  She has been unhappy there for a couple of months now.  I really needed her to work through St Patricks, we were short staffed as it were.  And then she pops this.  She's done.  \n\nThe next day I am going to make the schedule.  I realize I have 2 other servers out, so I will be super short during the coming weekend.  I talk to her about putting her on the schedule.  \"I told you, I don't want to go back to working there.\"\n\n\"Well what are you going to do for money?\"\n\n\"I have another job.\" And bam, the next day, Tuesday, she starts working at an office job.  I really don't think she planned it in advanced, the girl who got her the job worked the saturday and Sunday she was on.  \n\nBut I feel upset because we had a tightly crafted schedule, juggling the kids and still managed a day off together.  She didn't bring this up with me beforehand.  I work 4p-3am Tuesday through Sunday.  Now she is working 9a-5p and we will never see each other, and there is no way we will ever have Monday off together.  I feel like she was completely inconsiderate of my feelings, she screwed me on my work schedule, she didn't give me a real notice and completely shifted how our life is going to  without considering me.  I told her she can deal with getting the kids and deal with watching them, since she just changed my life with no input, made my job more difficult and alienated me.  \n\nShe countered that I am \"being controlling and treating her like a child.\"  But I don't think it is wrong for me to feel hurt.  It is very hard for her and I to cooperate on things.  We both come off as critical. I am upset.  Am I the asshole? I don't mind her changing jobs, but don't drop it on me overnight and screw me at the place I am responsible for staffing because in the end, it doesn't hurt the bar it hurts me.  And I feel left out of the loop.  ",

My mother works M-F from 3-4 so she can’t really take her to her appointments as most doctors offices are closed by the time she gets out. I have not complained yet but it’s starting to get to me. My days off usually consist of one appointment. I have to go to work late because when my mother goes to work she wants me to stop by the house and check on my grandmother if she needs anything. I’ve had to leave work many times to take her to the ER, I’ve had to bathe her and change her when she broke her clavicle. The most annoying part is sometimes I will go to work early and my mother will call me extremely upset asking why I didn’t stop to check on my grandmother, I believe there has never not once been a thank you.

      "description": "So, I'll give her side and my side, for clarification on why I'm posting this \n\nHer side;\nMy beautiful girlfriend has mental health issues, one of which, I believe to be 'phone phobia' which is in my opinion a part of her OCD. This causes her to the inability to answer phone calls and make phone calls saying that this causes her anxiety. She believes that I do not understand the extent of anxiety this causes her.\n\nThe most recent event tonight was that our family car got hail damage and it's nearly at the cut off point to make a claim, which requires one of us to make a phone call to our insurance company, however, due to me working long hours and times where the insurance companies phone lines are closed, I cannot easily make this call without it getting in the way of my work life, however, she argues that I can make this call without it effecting my work life, because I finish early on Fridays sometimes. I asked her to make this call for me and obviously it was a problem, and I got mad at her and told her that this is an issue that she needs to bring up with her psychologist as in my opinion it is a priority for various reasons which the most important ones, I will state in 'my side'. \n\nMy side; \nI will start by saying that  I am autistic. I see things in the way my Mother describes as 'black and white', and because of how I view life and problems and the solutions to these problems, I am often told I'm emotionless or heartless. \nNow that this is out of the way, \nI believe that this mental health issue she has when it comes to the phone should be considering a high priority on things she needs to work on with her psychologist, as we have two children and I fear that if something were to happen to our kids while I wasn't there - she wouldn't be able to make a phone call such as a phone call to an ambulance or the hospital. She believes that the only reason I want her to address it is because it bothers me, and I don't believe she sees the deeper reason it bothers me as much as it does. I have also recently don't some research on phone phobia and believe the start of the solution to this problem is facing the fear of it, however, I am not a psychologist and don't know how bad it actually can be. \n\n\n",

She Is a complete dick to me  when talking to her friends, she bad-mouths me to her friends and family, she gets on my back about eating my own food by telling me \"I need to learn how to ration my food\" which wouldn't be that bad if she wasn't eating my food and living in my mom's house, and she keeps talking about things I do bad weeks after it happens. So lemme get back into the story.\nShe was being a complete dick to me by yelling at me for eating my food . And I left to go to my room.

Now her friends hate me even more and I'm still stuck in a house with her\n\n\nLet me know if there is \n1: Spelling Mistakes\n2: Grammar errors\n3:Not enough info on her side \n4:Not enough info on my side\n5:too many lists\n\n",

      "description": "Recently I went on a date with a girl who I work with (I know it's a bad idea I too live in the future where I made this decision) and it went well we had a fun time and I was looking forward to the next date. Later that week there was an emergency at the mall we both work at and I wasn't there but she was texting me how she was scared and didn't want to be there anymore but she didn't have a place to go. I offered to pick her up and let her stay at my place until she could go home (she lives across the border in Canada and needed a ride that I couldn't provide) and when we got to my apartment I immediately went to the kitchen and offered her some tea or water but she went right to my bedroom which I was uncomfortable with. I jokingly told her to not be in there and went to my living room and asked her if she wanted to watch something but she kept staying in my room and touching my stuff which again I wasn't comfortable with. I asked her to leave but she didnt. She jumped in my bed instead. I sat on the bed thinking she must be tired from her ordeal at work and so let her stay in my bed. Eventually she took her clothes off and we had sex and after she left to go back home. A few days went by and she asked if I wanted to date her and I said no I think we're better as friends because of different personal reasons such as different political views and interests in general. She thinks I just wanted to have sex with her and leave when I never really wanted to have sex with her in the first place. I understand I did sleep with her but I wasn't the one who pushed for it. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "So I am a 23 year old woman, who still lives at home for financial reasons. And the only source of income I got right now is SSI (Social supplemental income) because I have a mild mental disability. But the thing is this: I am more than capable of making my own decisions: monetary and life decisions. So from that fact, I have lived on my own before, but had to always move back because of, yet again, monetary reasons. Now back to the story:\n\nI am finally getting out of my slight depression after my girlfriend dumped me (yes I am gay, no judgement), and after going to therapy a few times and taking my therapists advice on calming my anger down, I finally felt ready for looking for work. Today I found a job called Door Dash. Which is like GrubHub or Uber Eats that delivers food to people. I thought it was good for me because I can work as much or as little as I can. So I got all happy and expected the activation kit in a few days or less. So like all happy people, I had to share that happiness with someone, so I told my mother.\n\nInstead of being or even sounding proud of me, her only disabled daughter possibly finding work, she looked at me and said, \"I don't know if it is a legit job for you, you would have to go to your father on this one\". So to ease their anxiety a little bit, I sent them the official website link. Still doesn't seem to help anything. \n\nSo I went to my father about the matter and he said along the lines of:\n\n\"Do you really think you would want to take a job that involves your two biggest weaknesses: driving and socializing with people? That is set up for failure for you, I would look for something else\". I wanted to punch him in the face right then and there. My dad is known for pointing out and picking each and every tiny detail from any job that I seem to want. So I was just like, \"You cannot pick and choose which job I can and cannot have\". He just said sorry and went back to whatever he was doing at the time. \n\nI am just sick of being held back at this level and not actually getting a chance to improve myself when it comes to social skills. WIBTA if I ignored their advice altogether?\n\nA little FYI before I end this here: I DID have a fender bender with someone on ICY roads more than a year ago after my brakes failed on my old car. And because of autism, they DID expect me to learn a little slower on social skills than my neurotypical peers. But does it really give them the right to make themselves my \"helicopter\" guardians?",

      "description": "So, every morning it's the same routine. I wake up, make breakfast for my SO and I and get ready for work. On the way out I'll usually say something along the lines of \"siiigh, whelp, off I go\" or something like that. Obviously not thrilled to leave, but not seething either. To which my SO responds by shrugging his shoulders indifferently while reading the news. \n\n\nIn regards to my job, it could definitely be worse. But, it's a completely toxic environment and I'm just not a good fit. I plan on quitting soon and taking a break, then perhaps seeking employment later on in the year. My SO is recently retired for good and has no plans to seek future employment (which isn't a problem for me). We had planned for me to quit a couple months after his retirement so that he gets a bit of time alone to work things out by himself (also not a problem). \n\n\nSo, this morning, cue the typical routine and my SO says that me being sad when I leave for work is making it hard for him to enjoy his new time off. That I should be happy because I'm almost done with this job and I'll be on break soon. Which is true... but knowing how I will feel in 8+ weeks doesn't really help me feel any better about how I feel in the present. \n\n\nThen he starts comparing things, saying he's had worse jobs and this and that. I get it, lots of people don't like their jobs. But, does that negate how I'm supposed to feel about my particular situation? It's not like I *want* to hate my job. So, what about it? Am I the Asshole, then?",

      "description": "Maybe a little misleading on the title and hopefully this belongs here.  \n\n\nI'll try to give a condensed version as best I can.  \n\n\nI was just talking to someone through a dating site. Turns our we both know some of the same people. However, this person knew that another person was in the past interested in me and what happened there.  \n\n\nSo I told them pretty much what happened, basically the guy was an asshole and then making too many demands of me when we weren't actually dating, just I knew he had interest in me and I hung out with him a few times to figure out if we cold be emotionally compatible. We were not; the dude kept telling me I was lying but it's okay because I was cute/adorable. Even got to the point where he'd join in with other people who were insulting me over...well, them being stupid and trying to take me out of context because I tended to make self deprecating jokes.  \n\n\nBut how I ended the story was the last event where... I'm 5'10, the other guy is 5'2 and it's weird because for me, I want to be shorter and I like taller guys normally, but this short and heavily obese guy kept grabbing my head to drag me down to his height and trying to force kiss me while doing the baby voice of \"I like you, why don't you like me\" and then later tried to sexually assault me (multiple times) and when I left, he spun a story about how much he did for me while we were dating (never happened) and said something along the lines of \"and he kept acting like I owed him something for nothing, which is kind of weird because with how unattractive and everything he is, the expectations he had on me were just ridiculous\"   \n\n\nThe guy said he didn't want to talk to me anymore because I was a shallow asshole for mentioning the other guy was ugly. To me, I think there's a point, you realize you're physically unattractive, you USUALLY don't get away with being an asshole. But... to make note of his behavior being tied also with his physical appearance... does that make me an asshole?  \n\n\n(I know the polling might say something like You're the asshole/they're the asshole. I'm guessing I'm just looking for if I'm an asshole or not. I know the guy who we both knew was trying to date me and then spread lies about me is an asshole.

He basically said no, they weren't serious. They were never 'intimate'.\n\nI said I didn't appreciate him discussing my past sexual history with my EX and that there certainly was a past sexual history. He was fast to dismiss this, because she told him otherwise.\n\nI told him she has a lot of videos of us and I'm perfectly happy for her to show him. (Probably a bit spiteful but I was annoyed at this point)\n\nSubject was changed and we went along with our day.\n\nTurns out fiance is fairly religious and this caused a fight. My EX messaged me asking why I felt the need to get involved. \n\nI feel all I did was respond to what I considered someone crossing a line.

      "description": "So, this has been a difficult year for us, my children and I haven't been in the Christmas mood at all. I lost my job and its been hell. I needed something to fill up my time, since im on my Christmas break till the new year.\n\n\nI was thinking some volunteer work would be a good way to pass the time. We did some work in a nursing home and a homeless shelter.\n\n\nI also chose to visit shutins, and basically spend time with them. Keep them company . One of the people I visited was this 50 year old divorcee. She is a heavily depressed woman who hasn't left her house in over 20 years.\n\nSo I went to her house and she was just so happy to have company. Seriously, she just jumped and hugged me for almost 15 minutes as soon as I walked in the door. So we sat down and talked for almost an hour or so. She told me about her husband and everything and why she hasn't left the house. She said it was because she was ugly. She believes herself to be deformed and scarred. The charity organization warned me about that beforehand. But objectively, she isn't ugly at all. She's actually a really beautiful woman. I told her she was pretty and that made her cry with happiness. \n\n\nAnyway, long story short, once my hour was up, I quietly dismissed myself and she started screaming and crying at me not to leave.\n\n\nBut I explained to her I had to pick my daughter up from school and could only stay for a couple extra minutes. When I did, her tone changed. She started holding onto my arm, rubbing my bicep, touching my chest, she even unbuttoned the top button of her top. I left because I was uncomfortable, she told me to come back any time.\n\n\nSo, this woman I volunteered to help is trying to seduce me. Ive considered going back. But I mean, She's obviously emotionally scarred. Would it be wrong for me to do so?\n\n\nSo would I be the asshole if I go back to this woman's house and attempt to make a move on her?",

      "description": "So this just happened. A little background info; I have fairly severe anxieties and weed helps me cope with that, so I have been smoking for years although weed is illegal in my country. My GF is completely okay with this - we cleared it up before committing to a relationship. We have now been together for over 2 years and we've lived together for over a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recelty turned 26 and got a bag for toiletries from my GF's parents. They live far away so my GF bought it for me on their behalf. It was her idea to get it as she'd heard me complain that I didn't have one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday she asks me if I'd started using the bag (she knew that I had, it was on my table and it was clearly the reason she asked). I said that I have, but I'd used it for my weed+equipment when I go biking. She wasn't happy about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to use it for weed when I don't need it for toiletries and then for toiletries when I need it for that. She doesn't want me to do that because she says it will stink (it wouldn't because the actual weed is in a vacuum-sealed container. Anyways...It's a toiletries bag - is anyone gonna go sniff it?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe that a gift is something you give hoping it’ll cause as much joy as possible. I also believe that the one who gives the gift has no right to decide how the gift is used. If you still claim the right to dictate how it's used, then you're still claiming ownership of the item - and “then you haven’t given a gift to someone else but to yourself”. My mom always preached this to me growing up, so this sits deeply within me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my point of view then my GF is trying to dictate how I use one of my personal belongings with arguments of how she spent so long finding a bag for TOILETRIES, and how the bag was FROM her parents for when we VISIT her parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got pissed with the situation and said \"Fine! I'll throw it back in here (closet) and only use it twice a year then\". That's probably where I should've left it. But I couldn't help state that I thought it was silly as all hell, and then I - admittedly - threw a \"hissy fit\"-comment that \"I'd remember that gifts given to me weren't actually given to me\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe discussion then shifted towards being about why I had to make such a big deal out of something so little and pathetic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThing is, I was really excited about how perfect it was for both purposes and I thought the bag looked cool as well - I was really happy about the gift and now I'm not. Now it's just sitting empty in the closet for me to use a few times a year instead of being something that I use all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel as if I'm just being made out to be the dick for taking a stand about the use of my personal belonging, but it might’ve been unnecessary. AITA?",

      "description": "Okay so I’ve taken my son (2inDec) to a soft play area near me, I’m doing the usual walking round following his lead as he’s so excited and wants to play with everything all at once, on the first round I noticed a little girl (quite obviously about 6 months younger than my son) standing around crying, looking lost, scared and confused. I asked the group of mums near her if they were her mum and they all said no. My son then went into the ball pool and I had to go make sure he wasn’t up to mischief, thinking the ladies might continue looking for the little girls mum, as I’m quite obviously heavily pregnant and running round after my own toddler. About 5ish mins later my son has run back round that way and the little girl is still standing in the same spot crying, my son tries to cuddle her and give her a kiss but she pulls away, which is absolutely fine... I let Taylen know not everyone wants a cuddle and look around again for this little girls mum, and say a lot louder, ‘where’s this little girls mum? Her crying is breaking my heart!’ A woman from across the play area, started walking towards me and smiled and said\n\n ‘I’m her childminder’ \n\nMe: ‘Why are you ignoring her then! She’s been standing there looking lost and crying for ages!’ \n\nCM: ‘everyone has different methods I’m trying to teach her independence. Rather than sitting on my lap’ \n\nMe: ‘you’d be sacked if you were my child minder, where even were you? try getting off your phone and interact with her! *pointing to phone open on snap chat glowing in her hand*\n -again my son run off so I followed him because I’m a parent and my child comes first. \n\nWhen My Son runs back round to where she is again she tries saying something defending herself to the other mums. Along the lines of ‘she will just sit on my lap the whole time otherwise’ \n\nI interject with, “what and her standing there crying didn’t hurt your heart? You didn’t want to show her everything’s okay rather than leave her to stand there crying! You aren’t even her mother to be ‘trying out methods’. Wish I knew who this poor little girls mother was so I could let her know.” \n\nThe one of the mums gives me a nod as if she agrees with me the rest just all looked away as if I was a arsehole for causing a scene in a play centre. I am quite a passionate person when I speak and have been told when I’m angry i make words sound venomous almost... \n\nAlso I feel I need to point out that she only had this little girl with her, no other children. Thoughts? \n\n\n",

Turns out, the friend that agreed with me and I couldn’t go, and the two friends went to see a movie. I’m at home, it’s late, and the friend that agreed to see the movie randomly texts me (like they usually do when they want to make a point about something) with a sarcastic comment about how the roads were so packed. I explain my reasoning about earlier. At first, it was with a text about a Reddit post I saw about someone who totaled their car and advised about being safe on the road today. My friend said it happens all the time so what does it matter. At this point, I don’t know if I’m just being pushy about this whole thing.

      "description": "This happened a while ago and me and this is actually my ex boyfriend but i think about this incedent a lot and can't get an unbiased opinion from any of my friends or family. \n\nAbout 2 years ago when we were both 20 he wanted to go to a party with some of his friends on the campus of the college they went too. I wasn't a huge fan of the idea for multiple reasons but the main one being he was underage and it was a dry campus. I knew there was going to be alcohol there and I tried to tell him that of they get roudy in a dorm room the campus police will be called and it would be potentially bad. I didn't have an issue with him drinking but I suggested they come over to our apartment instead where I felt it was safer. He didn't listen and went anyway. \n\nWell surprise surprise they got too loud and campus police showed up and I had to go pick him up after he was given a citation for underage drinking and I was pretty pissed. While on our way home he wouldn't say sorry too me but called his mother sobbing to tell her and say he was sorry. He was super drunk and I thought it was a pretty funny reaction given everything else. He woke up the next day and I made him tell me what happened and it included a story of his friend throwing up all over a police officer which he laughed about and told everyone we talked to, even joked about the incident to her face. I thought that was a sign that the embarrassing stuff they did that night was worth joking about and when his best friend asked me what happened after I picked him up I told her about how my bf called his mom. \n\nMy bf was furious at me for \"emasculating\" him and embarrassing him in front of his friends and yelled at me about it then and everytime is was brought up after that until the end of our relationship. I know I probably shouldn't have said anything but if you're going to make fun of a girl to her face about puking on a cop on the same night I guess I thought he should be able to take a little himself? I was upset with him and I won't pretend that's part of the reason I wanted to tell that story so I feel like that mabe makes me TA but I really don't know so I'll just leave it up to Ya'll to judge.

      "description": "some background information:\nwe're all girls.\nthat friend (alpha) shows more obvious symptoms than me, who's also autistic.\nalpha is friends with my best friend (beta), who's neurotypical, but they only got close because they both have no friends in their class (homeroom). I'm in a different class with both of them.\n\nalpha's been friends with beta since school started this year. because i always go to their classroom to find beta during breaks, I also became friends with alpha since she always joins me and beta's conversation. I knew she's autistic (she knows I'm autistic as well) but at first I was fine with that, it's just sometimes she would be trying so hard for us to only talk about topics she's interested in.\n\nalpha would sometimes join me and beta during lunch hours. and the whole time she would be only focusing on stuff that she's interested in. when sometimes I'd like to talk about stuff that I'd like to cover, she'd become more and more aggressive and change back to the topic we were originally talking. beta remained silent the whole time because she didn't know how to react to situations like this. (and she's that kind of person who just goes with the flow)\n\nafter one lunch when me and alpha became more aggressive towards each other than ever, I started to feel annoyed by her. so I started to stay away from her, but she seemed to be unaware of that, she still treated me the way she did before, and I was getting more and more annoyed. I was planning on taking a break from her to rethink how I should face her, but we see each other every day and she just sticks closer and closer to me and beta.\n\nyesterday, alpha received a notice from the school on her application on going to a canadian study tour. since she's the only one in our school who applied to that tour, she has to pay an extra amount of money, then she asked me and beta if we could go with her so that she doesn't have to pay that extra money. however, we both told her that our parents don't allow us to go because they can't afford the fees. (we knew about the tour a while before yesterday and we've asked our parents about that) somehow she only asked me again if I really couldn't go with her, and I emphasized that my parents can't afford the fees.\n\nsuddenly, I heard her laughing. \"who tf laughed?\" I asked. she immediately pointed to beta, but beta denied that she laughed, and I believe she wouldn't laugh anyway because I've been friends with her for years and she has even seen my parents, also she knows how poor my family is. I was being so mad that I left their classroom immediately. this made me wanting to cut alpha off (in my life).\n\nbeta told me that she felt something's wrong with alpha's social skills, (she said she doesn't see anything wrong in me) but she doesn't know how to tell alpha about it. however, I kind of see myself in alpha. being only focused on one topic that I'm interested in, not being aware of people's actions, body language, etc. I've lost friends because of the same thing alpha did to me. (I got my diagnosis a month or two ago so I didn't know I was autistic when I lost my previous friends)\n\nand now if I cut her off, beta would be stuck in the middle because she's okay with both me and alpha exhibiting similar autistic behaviour. also I'd feel guilty about that because I'm basically cutting off myself in my life (does that make sense?) and I clearly know that she can't control her behaviours, but still I feel annoyed that I want to cut her off. I feel like I'd be an asshole for that, so before I make this decision, I decided to post here.\n\ntl;dr: my autistic friend annoyed me with her autistic behaviour to a point that I can't stand anymore so I wanted to cut her off. but if I do so, my best friend who's friends with her would be stuck in the middle and I'd feel guilty about that.",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my mother to abstain from buying Christmas gifts this year?",
      "description": "I grew up poor in one of the shittiest cities in the US.  Despite that, I was always fed and always got gifts on Christmas.  I only recently learned that my mom was putting herself into debt to always make sure my little brother and I had plenty of presents.  I'm thankful for her generosity, but it needs to stop.  At this rate, she's going to die in debt.\n\nShe's always bought for all my cousins, too.  And since my first cousins are having more and more kids, the number of people she wants to buy for keeps increasing.  I've pleaded with her for the past few years to just not buy gifts, trying to convince her that holiday shopping is not obligatory, that the kids all have plenty of toys and games already, that my brother and I don't need anything, and that that money would be of so much more use going towards future expenses.  She never listens though...saying that she needs to because my first cousins have always bought gifts for my brother and I, and that it will make her happy to buy the gifts/sad to not buy the gifts.\n\nI should add that I'm 2.5 years out of college, and I have a decent job (65k+ in an area with relatively low cost of living).  Ever since getting this job, I've helped my mother financially as much as possible. She works at a school and doesn't get paid when the kids are on break, and I fully support her during those times.  I bought her a car and pay for all maintenance and sometimes gas.  I help her at random times when she won't be able to make ends meet in a given month. I've bought Christmas and birthday gifts, and I buy my brother things he wants and needs in her stead. I intend to pay off her credit cards over the coming few years.\n\nI could buy all the gifts, but I just don't think it's necessary,  especially when I'd rather put it toward helping my mom and doing things with the people I would be buying for.  I take my brother to concerts and I'm taking the oldest cousin-once-removed skydiving next year.  I'd rather do more things like that and buy gifts that matter at some point in the future than add to their piles of stuff. In my family, the Aunts and Uncles all buy the kids cheaper things, and their ideas for gifts come from the parents telling them \"so-and-so needs an xmas idea\" and passing whatever they said along. Call me a Grinch or Scrooge, but the gifts that come from that are meaningless.\n\nI write this as I wait for my mom to come over because she wants me to go Christmas shopping with her, and I'm incredibly frustrated.   If she didn't buy gifts this year, she could save that money for the next time she would need to \"borrow\" from me, meaning I could save what I set aside for her every month and could pay off her debt sooner.  But she just won't listen and sounds a bit like her heart is going to break if I wear her down. AITA for being so upset with her?\n\nTl;dr: My mom can't make ends meet without my help, but insists on buying a lot of Christmas gifts.  I want her to stop, but she's very emotional about it.  I'd rather help her with her debt than buy gifts in her stead.",

      "description": "My ex girlfriend is 21. We dated for 3 months before she randomly broke up with me last night. I later found out that she got back together with her ex-boyfriend, who she broke up with before we started dating because he was abusive towards her, physically and emotionally.\n\nShe told me about this ex (now current) boyfriend and he seems like a real psycho. She admitted herself that she put up with him for so long because he was tall and blond and handsome. Beneath his looks was a really messed up and flawed person. But of course she thought she could change that. Surprise surprise she couldn’t and she decided to leave him.\n\nWhen we were together, she always told me how great of a person I was and how I was so different from her ex. She said she never knew what a normal healthy relationship was like before she met me. She even said she was “falling in love” with me.\n\nThen, at midnight last night, she texted me saying she couldn’t be with me anymore. In the morning, she wrote a long message about how she was going to follow  her heart, and her heart told her to stay with her ex. She said that she truly loves him and that she can’t imagine loving anyone else. She said she was never going to give up on him and that he is changed for the better now.\n\nThis was my reponse:\n\n“Honestly, for such a smart woman, you’re acting like an idiot. You can’t just say all those things about wanting a man who respects you and then go back to your abusive ex. If you stay with him you’ll be miserable for the rest of your life. Good luck.”\n\nI had a rough day and talked to my friend. She saw the text and said I come off as bitter and rude. And that I’m victim blaming, that I don’t know what kind of mental trauma that my ex-gf endured at the hands of her man.\n\nAITA? Im an honest person and I can’t stand it when people act like idiots, especially in the name of “love”. I can’t help for telling it as it is.",

      "description": "So my younger cousin and I both go to the same uni. We grew up together and I would have considered him one of my best friends up until recently. \n\nA few months ago I started hooking up with this girl Nicole. I liked her at the time but I was graduating that year so we decided not to make it official. We agreed it was cool to hook up with other people and not tell each other, as long as we didn't rub it in and use a condom. I also asked her to refrain from hooking up from this one guy as I know he'd try to gloat about it to me, and she agreed. So of course, after a few weeks she hooked up with that guy. And I've been cheated on in previous relationships so this made me very insecure and led to us ending things. \n\nA few weeks later my cousin drunkenly hooked up with her. He told me about it thinking it would be cool to hook up with the same chick. Normally that would've been fine but I actually liked her. So I told him how I felt and asked if he didn't continue pursuing her. He agreed and I thought that was it. A few months later I find out he did continue talking to her and they're now dating.  Now I no longer like her like that but I feel betrayed by my cousin. I opened up to him and he completely disregarded what we talked about. We haven't really talked since and on thanksgiving he texted me saying how thankful he is for me and how I'm like a brother to him. I didn't answer and thought that family would respect each other, unlike what I felt he did.\n\nAm I the asshole for not responding and considering not talking to him anymore?",

I’ve recovered miraculously but it’s left some permanent scars, one of which I realized is the fear of abandonment.\n\nAnyways, enter ex bf. We’ll call him Jaden. \n\nJaden was my first love. I shared everything with him, we connected in a way I’ve never connected with anybody else before. Everything in our relationship was fine, I tried my hardest not to let my issues get the best of me.\n\nJaden has a reputation for being a player.\n\nSo Jaden up and left me out of the blue one day, with no second thought, despite him “being in love with me” and knowing about my issues. I was crushed, the worst heartbreak I have ever experienced by far. He started dating somebody the day we broke up. \n\n\nA few months go by and Jaden comes back around. Basically leads me on for about three weeks before deciding to call it quits once again. I’m fine this time around and just grateful to finally be over and done. No more stressing. I had worked too hard to keep him around.\n\nI start seeing somebody new. Then, Jaden comes back and tells me how sorry he his for treating me like someone unimportant and that I meant a lot to him. I broke things off with the other guy and Jaden and I are rekindling.\n\nAnyways, more often than not I lay into him for the way he’s treated me. I tell him how heartbroken and abandoned I felt, and that if something were to happen again I’d be truly done. No forth chances. \n\nHe’s been really understanding and apologizes profusely but I can’t trust him anymore and need him to understand that he hurt me. \n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR I have abandonment issues and currently make my exbf (soon to be bf again) feel guilty for leaving time and time again and coming back only when it’s convenient for him.",

Bro works, so it’s usually my job to take care of things when Mom needs help (usually because she can’t lift/move an object, or because she needs help with the dogs or something). I’ve spent several months over the past couple of years barely leaving the house and it’s driving me nuts. I’m the type who likes to wander/travel. I’d like to eventually go abroad, but for right now even doing something minuscule like checking out a local mall to see how much it’s changed since I last visited would be cool.

      "description": "\n\nHey guys. This is something that has been bothering me for quite a while, so any opinions would be helpful. Probably still not going to approach my parents about this, but.\n\nI am a 19 y/o, living at home with my dad and stepmom and going to community college as well as working. I go to school two days a week (all day) and work 3 jobs (25+ hours a week). I also workout and try to have a balanced life.\n\nI pay for my own expenses, car payment, insurance, eating out, phone bill, etc. The only thing I do not pay for is rent and groceries for the house.\n\nI love my stepmom and dad, and I am well aware that they do a lot for me, especially my stepmom.\n\nHowever. \nI am beginning to become frustrated/overwhelmed. My parents work from home and don’t leave the house very often, especially in the winter. This has caused me to turn into their errand girl. They have me get the groceries and run any errands they don’t want to leave the house themselves to do. This would be fine if it was every once in a while. \n\nExample:\nYesterday I went to school from 10am-7:30pm with very little breaks in between my classes. I’m exhausted at the end of it. Also add i was feeling under the weather. 7:30 rolls around and my dad asks me to go to Costco(close to my school, but 20 minutes from our home) for him to grab a computer monitor he needs, but not sure what one. This makes me have to go to Costco, FaceTime him for 10 minutes while he decides what monitor he wants, and then asks me to bring it home. All the while I’m exhausted, and still not feeling well and just want to go home. \n\nThis is a common, if not daily occurrence. My parents are always asking me to go “here” or “there” for them because I’m out already or heading in that direction. A lot of the time, they don’t care that they make me late or I have previously made plans. I worked a 9 hour shift last Saturday, got off at 10 and had to go grocery shopping because they wanted things before a certain sale ended. If I’m the one who drove, I have to drag my friend or boyfriend to whatever asinine place my parents need me to go. This is something that my precious boyfriends (and current) have picked up on and think it’s very invasive and odd/rude. I’ve defended them saying they do a lot for me, so I can do some stuff for them.\n\nBut lately it’s just started to become too much. Add the fact that I have homework, jobs and my own life to juggle AND the fact that they claim I don’t do enough at home, it’s enough to frustrate anyone. I have weekly chores, try to keep my area and bathroom clean and common areas, but I still receive texts and get told that “I’m doing the bare minimum” and “why didn’t I do this”. \n\nAm I the asshole because I’m living rent free and don’t want to be their errand girl?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Sorry for the weird title. Anyway, this past summer my friend got married in August. We're not that close. More like coworkers who have stayed in touch on Facebook after moving on. A few weeks before her wedding she tells me her photographer bailed and wanted to know if my husband wanted the experience since he is wants to start a photography business. She offered my husband $500 for the job. \n\nMy husband loves gadgets so he had a lot of equipment he brought to her wedding. Including a video camera and a photography drone. Her wedding took place over a entire day. They had many musician friends play music. He busted his ass literally working 12 hours taking pictures, trying to video record the ceremony, record the live music that was played. But because he is also new at photography and had never done a wedding, it wasn't his best work. Everything he got is mediocre. He told them he'd get the pictures to them soon but it ended up taking him 4 months. He was embarrassed it took so long, but editing is still new to him and we had a newborn so it was just a lot at the time. I explained this to my friend and she seemed understanding but we could tell she was a little disappointed in how the photos came out. Husband promised her he still wanted to put a wedding video together for her, but it would take awhile as he realizes his computer needs better gear to deal with video editing.\n\nHe keeps asking me if we should have given her a partial or full refund because he's embarrassed how it all went and I say no. If she asked we'd give it to her, but she hasn't and I think she's getting a good deal even if it's not the best quality. We do feel bad it's taking a long time so we constantly debate it. What do you think?",

      "description": "The time has come for me to get another haircut and my girlfriend has requested I try some style called a 'fade'. Now I have zero knowledge in the realm of haircuts/styles, so rather than assuming that what they give me is what she wants, it makes sense to me that she should come along to make sure they achieve the vision she has.\n\nWhen I said as much, her response was that I \"need to be less shy and just talk to them\". While I fully admit to being an extremely shy person, I do not believe that is the issue here. Fundamentally she wants me to try a new haircut and I am perfectly willing to do it, but she is the only one who accurately knows what she wants, I do not. So rather then run the risk of wasting my money on a haircut she doesn't like, I think she should come along and tell them what she wants. She thinks I am just being shy.",

      "description": "Ok I know a lot of posts on here are just for self validation but I really want to know if I'm the asshole. I'm going to try really hard to be objective and not try to let emotions play into my story.\n\n\nI work for a very well known retailer as a manger. I have been with the company for 7 years with no complaints.\n\n\nWe recently got a new store manager who is very insistent that we uphold all store policies, black and white, as to not discriminate. I agree with this. My old SM would often make exceptions to store policy if a customer was a regular or became irate.\n\n\nWe have a regular customer (we will call her karen.) She is known by name throughout the store as someone who consistently is a hassle to deal with, but we have always been nothing but nice to her. Under old management she always got her way. Two days ago, she tried to do something outside of store policy. I explained to her that since she has been allowed to do this in the past, I would do the same just this once, but she shouldn't expect this in the future. My SM got mad at me for this but I felt it was the right action.\n\n\nThe next day, she comes to shop and asks me to break another store policy regarding returns. I tell her no. She argues. I tell her no again, explaining why. She continues to argue and bully me. This goes on for about 15 minutes until I decide to once more cave in to her wants because my company wants us to appease unruly customers so they won't effect the experience of other customers. I will say I was not the most friendly during this transaction and made it clear that she would not get this treatment in the future. (I did end up getting chewed out by my SM for this choice.) \n\n\n\n\nI was very worked up and hurt by her treatment of me. One coworker could see that I was feeling upset, and asked what was wrong. I described the situation to her, and pleaded that we all remain on the same page with companies policy from here on out. I will say, I was emotional during this conversation and probably did not sound very professional, but was trying to keep quiet.\n\n\n\n\nTen minutes later, Karen calls the store and I answer. She asks my name (I give it to her) and she is very angry because she could tell I was \"talking shit\" about her to my coworker. I did say yes I'm sorry, you did make me feel hurt with your treatment so I vented with a coworker.\n\n\n\nMy SM isn't upset with me. The customer will most likely report me, which does make me nervous. I shouldn't have talked about a customer on the floor.\n\n\nI am leaning more towards myself being the asshole here because even if she upset me I should have been professional enough to wait until I was off the sales floor to vent about my feelings.\n\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I’m in high school at the moment, and on the science bowl team (I know, nerdy, but what can you do lol). Through this I’ve met friends from all across the country, and it’s been fantastic getting to know them. \n\nThen there’s this girl from my school. We’ll call her Anastasia. Last year, she took advantage of our coaches disliking towards a member of the team and made herself the favorite. And although she didn’t make it on the main team, she got the disliked member kicked down to the second team. At the state competition, we won, which was huge, because we had never done that before. One of the members on the main team couldn’t make it to nationals after that because it was their birthday and they’d already made plans. Instead of taking the disliked member, who had placed at states, the coach decided on Anastasia. She claimed she asked the coach if the disliked member could take her place, but we caught her lying about it. Instead she asked if the disliked member could compete with her, even though she knew that wasn’t possible because only a certain amount of people were allowed on the team. \n\nOther than this, though, she’s had a rough life. And I get that, but she also mentions it constantly. She keeps saying that her parents are too poor to afford summer camp, and the next week they buy her the new Mac and an iPhone X. One of my friends’ mom works in a hospital, and when we were studying after school and Anastasia was around, it went a little bit like this:\n\n“Friend: Oh yeah, my moms still at the hospital can I get a ride?\n\nMe: Oh, yeah sure. (I turn to Anastasia) Btw, her moms not sick or anything she just works—\n\nAnastasia: My mom goes to the hospital every month because she has a higher chance of getting cancer so she has to go get scanned!\n\nFriend: Oh that sucks. Wait, does she have cancer?\n\nAnastasia: ...that’s private. \n\nMe: (thinking) then why did you say something in the first place.”\n\nShe also makes it a point to tell you all of her life struggles the minute you meet her. Like she’s bragging about it or something. \n\nIn addition to that, she had to study for the national competition because she had never competed before. It’s insane, I realize, but the coach thought that she could catch up by practicing and studying. Instead of working hard and learning from others, she would shit talk them to our faces after practice. She shit talked a freshman, two years younger than her, for knowing more things than she did. She even didn’t want people to teach her stuff, which I don’t think she realizes is a huge privilege because the rest of us have to do things on our own. \n\nShe has talked crap about every single one of her friends, including me and my friend. She’s abandoned them, and started talking to college people in an effort to look cool I guess? Eventually earlier this year I told her enough was enough and I don’t think I can be friends with her. Keep in mind I’ve done nothing to her that I can think of. I mean, asking the coach to put the disliked member on the team might count, but I feel like that’s justified and was the way to get us to place high at nationals. Although it may have been fueled a little bit by MY dislike for HER. \n\nAnyway, me and my friend have become super close with people all across the country. We meet up at competitions and it’s fantastic. Of course they have their flaws too, but it’s nothing we can’t get over quickly. \n\nAnastasia wants to be friends with them so badly. But I have a feeling that if we let her join this group chat we have, she’ll ruin everything. She’ll tell everyone her personal problems and make them uncomfortable, she’ll talk crap about me and my friend to them, and she’ll end up starting drama over nothing. Me and my friend aren’t of course going to prevent other people from joining the chat. We’ve already had a couple people on the team do so, and we’ve offered it to plenty more. We hate playing gatekeeper but we can’t stand Anastasia getting to know these people. So, AITA for trying to prevent her from being friends with my new friends?\n\nTL;DR: An ex friend that talks crap about everyone, took advantage of someone to get higher up on our science bowl team, and tells everyone she meets her personal problems wants to be friends with my new friends that I made, but I won’t let her.

      "description": "Last night, I was all set to have dinner at my girlfriend's house. We've been dating for about 3 months and I've met her parents before, but this was the first time that I'd be dining with some in what was obviously a more fancy setting. When I asked my girlfriend what they were serving, she said that her dad had cooked salmon, however I noticed that she had a weird pronunciation of the word. She included the \"L\" when she said it, making it sound like she was saying the first half of \"salmonella\". I asked her why she pronounced it like that and she simply responded with \"Because that's how it's spelled\" and I wasn't going to argue that.\n\nMe, my girlfriend, her mom, and stepdad all sat down for dinner and it started off with some very casual small-talk and after that, I decided to make things a bit more humorous. I said to her stepfather \"This is delicious salmon\" except I intentionally pronounced it with the L, just like my girlfriend. My girlfriend was stifling a laugh and her mom was shooting me a curious look. Her stepdad, who is typically a straightforward, no-nonsense type of guy, simply stared at me and asked \"Do you find my cooking to be amusing?\" I then played it straight and said \"No, I just really like this salmon.\" Again, I mispronounced it. My girlfriend and her mom both smiled at each other and then there was an awkward silence followed my her stepdad shooting me daggers. As I focused on my filet of salmon, another idea struck me and I decided to have some fun with the pronunciation of the word \"filet\". I decided to pronounce it with the T at the end, so that it rhymed with \"skillet\". Keeping sure to mispronounce both \"salmon\" and \"filet\", I said to her stepdad \"I'm sorry if I offended you sir. This is just a really delicious filet of salmon.\" My girlfriend burst out laughing and her mom was also smiling ear to ear while chuckling, but her stepdad wasn't pleased. He simply stared at me with a blank expression, set down his utensils, and simply said \"I'm done.\" And with that, he got up and walked away from the dinner table.\n\nHe never did return and my girlfriend's mom explained that he likes his private time in his study whenever something is bothering him. Her mom was totally cool with my little stunt and she thought I was just having some fun. But as her mom was serving desert, her stepdad comes in the kitchen and I can hear them whispering to one another, but I could only make out small pieces of what was being said. I heard her mom say \"You're overreacting\" and at one point I heard her dad whisper \"sick little bastard.\" Then while me and my girlfriend were just sitting at the table, both of her parents' heads peer into the frame of the door connecting the dining room and kitchen, and they both just awkwardly stare at me before sliding back out of view. Then her mom comes in and she looks PISSED. She says to me \"Please leave my house.\" but she also looks like she's ready to burst. I asked if everything was OK, but she just repeated herself and told me to \"get my act together.\"\n\nI left like I was asked and my girlfriend even sounds mad at me know. It's weird because she was laughing and playing along, but when I left she just texted me \"Grow up.\" Now I'm just wondering what her stepdad could've said to them to make them change their tunes and have me kicked out.",

      "description": "Okay, so my older sister (OS) has be driving me (Me) and our younger sister (YS) to school. Those two in the front seats, I’m in the back.\n\nLast week I was leaning my arm against the window with my head in my hand because I wasn’t feeling good that morning (emotionally) she mad a sharp turn, my arm slipped and I hit my head off the window. I was crying in the back but they didn’t notice until we got to the school. OS didn’t want to drive me home so I had to go into the nurses office as I waited my vision was really blurry. I told them what happened and that my vision was blurry so they did a head injury report and I went home. I got shit from both of them but mainly YS, she told me how she thought I was lying about being hurt because I could still text while everything was blurry. I’m on my phone constantly so I know where all the letters are by instinct (That probably isn’t healthy) and a lot of squinting helped. Yet she still gave me shit for it.\n\nFast forward Thursday I was in the car again and she made another sharp turn. My shoulder hit into the car door and it hurt like hell. I tried to pull through the day, then my back started hurting, and then my chest. It actually hurt to breath. I went to the nurses during lunch and told her what happened (different nurses from last week)\n\nWhen my dad showed up I was still having issues with breathing and pain in my shoulder/back/and chest so we went to the hospital for X-rays and all that jazz. I told them what happened and got checked. The doctor said it was probably a pulled muscle, told me to take pain relief and if the pains still there after a week come back.\n\nFriday morning, still hurts but I go to school, well try. I barely make it out of the driveway. I’m not going with OS and YS anymore.  I physically couldn’t carry my books. I’ve done it almost everyday for this school year and I just couldn’t. So I stay home and I’m pissed off because I know for a fact that if I hurt someone while driving,in the same way, twice on accident, I’d never here the end of it and wouldn’t be allowed to drive.\n\nTwenty, minutes ago I was watching tv and I was like “Hey, OS, look at this.” And she asks me if I knew why she hasn’t talked to me since Thursday (we don’t talk much anyways so I never actually noticed). She said I was trying to get her license suspended. I honestly wasn’t and didn’t even think of that, like I know both times it was an accident but I’m not going to lie about how I got injured and then have something bad happen to me that could have been avoided if I told the truth.\n\nI don’t feel like the asshole but I’ve been wrong about how I feel regarding right and wrong before and I just don’t know.\n\nTl;dr sister made sharp turns twice, both ended up with me getting hurt (Head injury and Shoulder injury leading to back&amp;chest pain), I told doctors/nurses what happened, my sister accuses me of trying to get her driving license suspended.",

      "description": "So, a while ago, my really good friend dropped out of school. While I didn't necessarily think it was a good idea by any means at the time, I didn't want him to think I didn't support him no matter what so I tried to be good about it. He told me it's because he doesn't think he needs school and is burnt out. I think a lot of it has to do with depression, among other things. \n\nNow, it's been a few months and he's not doing much whatsoever. Sitting around at home for a lot of the time. He doesn't work or anything, and I feel like it's just making him worse. We've tried to talk to him about it but he's stubborn to a fault, sometimes. The career field he wants to get into is incredibly competitive and not really do-able without a degree, so I'm concerned about that, and also a little miffed because, coming as someone who struggles to pay for school, and his family could afford it a lot more than I can. I just hate watching him sit around like that. Of course, I still hang out with him as much as I possibly can, and he's still one of my best friends, but I'm so busy with school and work and other commitments that it's hard. I'm still being as supportive as I can, but AITA for having these feelings of frustration? ",

      "description": "So my mother and I have very similar personalities and this causes a lot of friction between us whenever we’re together for more than a couple of days. We would often get into little arguments that would blow up into huge fights. But this is usually only if we’re in the same physical place. When we’re in different places, we would communicate almost every single day. \n\nLast year I moved halfway around the world but in February, my family went on vacation together and I saw them for the first time in like 6 months since I moved.\n\nOn the last day, she was already kind of pissy. When we got to the restaurant, neither of my parents were really talking and I didn’t have any so I was on my phone. She said to me “why don’t you talk to us? We never get to see you. This is our last day, spend some time with us”\n\nI told her, “I know that but I don’t really know what to talk about right now. If you have something you want to talk about, I’d gladly participate in the conversation”\n\nI can’t remember what she asked me but it was a yes or no question, not exactly conversation kindling. So after a few minutes of no conversation, I went back to my phone. \n\nAgain, she got mad and repeated to me what she said earlier. I repeated my answer again. This happened a third time. I told her conversation was a two way street and she needed to give me something to talk about if she wanted to talk because I could not think of anything to say.  She claimed she already tried to start a conversation but I told her all she did was get angry at me for not starting a conversation. \n\nThis was the last straw for her and she got up from the dinner table and left before our food even arrived. At this point, I was quite angry as well so after I finished dinner with my dad, I went to a bar to grab a drink and wait for her to go to sleep because I didn’t want to deal with another argument and we were all staying in the same room together.\n\nThe next day, my parents had a much earlier flight than me so they left before me, around 6 in the morning. I told my dad to wake me up so I could say goodbye to them. He said goodbye to me. I told him to be safe. I said the same thing to my mom in the same way and she got angry and said something along the lines of “you don’t need to be like that. You need to grow up and stop being such a brat” I replied that I said the same thing to dad. Then they left. \n\nI haven’t spoken to my mom since that day. I want to make the relationship better, but I feel she was more in the wrong than I was and she should be the first to reach out. I just spoke to my dad and he says he’s pretty sure that’s not going to happen. He says I should just be the bigger person but she’s an adult too. If she was to reach out to me, I would apologize for my part in it but I’m very tired of the way she treats me sometimes. AITA? Should I just give in and reach other to her first?",

      "description": "We had all originally agreed weeks ago that I was hosting until 2 days ago when my aunt called me telling me that my dad told her to tell me the plans changed and that he and stepmom would now be hosting.\n\nI had a baby 3 months ago and originally wanted to spend this xmas season at home. But then my mom broke her leg and can't go anywhere and she's literally going to be alone xmas with her friends nanny watching her. So we decided to visit her even though it's a 2 hour drive.\n\nBack to xmas eve. The hard part about saying no is that cousins I haven't seen in years will be there and my stepmom's dad just died. He was staying with them. And her mom is really sad over it, which I get. She doesn't want to be left alone...I don't get why this wasn't able factored in when we all originally agreed to do it at my house.\n\nMy dad called me later that day and told me about the plans saying it would be easier for everyone, they'll just order food, blah blah blah, telling me what time to leave my house to get there. I have to be at our church by a certain time so if we don't all get out of the door early enough to see my dad then we might as well not go.\n\nI reminded him that MIL is going to be with us and let him know that she's bringing her dog. He said that was fine but then yesterday H and I remembered that he's technically not off xmas eve so he can't exactly be away from the computer for huge chunks of time. My dad is an hour away so not sure if H would go with us or just make up the hours later somehow.\n\nHere's the big thing that bothered us. My dad asked me that we not be too joyful because stepmom's mom is still really sad. Mind you we have an energetic 4 year old and H has been depressed, so have I actually. And then to hear that kind of request is ridiculous to me. I mean it's Christmas. And shouldn't we be trying to cheer up a sad lady?\n\nRight now we still don't know what we're going to do. And I feel like my MIL is going to feel dragged around if we do go, but she did want to see my dad and rest of family because it's been a while. Also my MiL gets depressed too I dont want the whole atmosphere to set her off too. She'll be here tomorrow and maybe we'll see what she thinks then. Don't want to ask her before she leaves because then she might not come.",

      "description": "So this happened a few weeks ago, and for it's been weighing on me since, so I thought I'd see what you guys had to say;\n\nI've recently started at law school this year straight from high school. I chose this specific school because I had experience the previous year by participating in their high school mock trial competition, in which they gave all the participants a free t-shirt, which has the name of the university and \"high school mock trial competition 2018\". \n\nObviously a fair few students who participated in this competition now attend the university, and while there's not been anything said, it's seemingly implied \"don't wear the t-shirt to class, you'll look like a tool\" kind of thing. (Also worth mentioning; after this incident went down, I found out that the boy had actually worn it to the law faculty orientation and the law student association had called him out on it)\n\nAnyway, a few weeks ago during a mid-lecture break, I saw this boy wearing this high school mock trial competition t-shirt, and as I walked past, said \"hi\" and started joking around like \"Oooh wearing the t-shirt (his name)\" and he, goes \"all my other shirts are dirty\" and I continue smiling and laughing a bit and go \"oh sure haha\" and continue walking the other way, But as he goes by I hear him say to the girl he's walking with \"Well, *she* was judgemental.\"\n\nI was a little taken aback with this, as I thought it was just a bit of teasing, but to be called judgemental for it got me thinking, AITA?\n\nWorth noting; I had met this boy before and had a few discussions- maybe not firm friends yet, but getting there - I wasn't just teasing a complete stranger. Also he had a reputation amongst us 1st semester law students as showing off a bit, and \"flexing\" on the rest of us (for lack of a better word) so him wearing the shit fit into his personality",

He fessed up a few weeks ago after I found naked pictures of his old fwb.\nAnyways. We hit bottom, talked it through in a surprisingly grown-up way. \nWe've addressed the underlying issues-he has to talk about issues before it becomes a crisis and I have to let him be a partner in the relationship. We've pushed each other away a lot in the past \nWe've found a way to overcome this in the sense that we're willing to challenge ourselves to be better for our sake and the sake of our kids.\nWe touch base often to see how it goes. I'm going back to therapy and suggested he do the same. \nI want to ask him to show me the messages where he says \"yeah, not going to do this anymore, I'm committed, bye Felicia\"\nI feel like everyone is entitled to privacy-I'm seriously violating his by checking his Facebook despite being terrified of what I could find... But at the same time if it happens again I am walking out. His refusal to show me proof would be enough for me to walk out too. I still kinda feel like I'd be an asshole to break a family over this. But then again, I'm not really an asshole to ask the man to commit. 🤷\n",

      "description": "**TL;DR** because it's longer than it needs: I sigh because someone called a known woman a slut. This person takes it badly because it was condescending. I want to drop the subject but he keeps arguing. Points out how angry I'm getting, storms off and leave. His brother catches up to me and asks me why I got angry, but doesn't seem to agree with my feeling that I got angered. I get remorse for ruining the party's mood, so I come back and apologize. I get what feels to me like snark in response. I drop it entirely but my ego is still hurt to this day.\n\n\n\nHey everyone, I'm posting my story here because the people that were witnesses will dodge the question if I ask them their opinion about it. I'll be, at least try to, be the most truthful I can, but I'm a faillible human and the way I recount this event might be biased. Don't hesitate to point it out if you feel that it's the case.\n\n\n\nA few months ago, I was at a chill little party with a group of friends, we were six people. I'll name two of them: B, the party's host, we're long time friends and even shared a dorm in high school, and his big brother L, who I'm familiar with because he's been present at quite a few of B's parties, but isn't someone I usually hang out with. It seems releavant to note that there was only one girl at the party, and that everyone else including me were dudes.\n\n\n\nWe were playing a trivia games in teams of two, and I teamed up with L. It goes well, until the point where a card mentions my country's counterpart to Vanna White from our version of The Wheel of Fortune. L says \"ah yeah, the slut!\"\n\n\n\nI'm not here to argue about sexism, so I don't call him out on it, but I don't like that remark so I let out a sigh that's loud enough to get heard by L. He gets defensive, and this conversation ensues: \n\n\n**L**: \"What? That's what she is, she's a slut\". \n\n\n**Me**: \"I don't think you should call women sluts even though her job is to look pretty on TV\"\n\n\n**L**: \"But that's litterally the definition of what she is! She sells and displays her body, so she's a slut! You and I don't even know her and will never meet her anyway, so what's wrong with calling her a slut?\"\n\n\n\nThis goes back and forth for a little while, and I feel like he's trying to say the word \"slut\" as much as he can to get a raise out of me. I get exasperated because it's clear that neither of us is willing to change opinions. I also can see the mood is degrading as the rest of the people present fall silent and have their attention focused on us. I ask L \"I want to stop talking about this, can we go back to the game?\", in a clearly annoyed tone.\n\n\n**L**: \"but Siphonay, you have to understand that you have your opinions, but that most people disagree with you\", \"you shouldn't be so condescending because you think you have the right opinions\". \n\n\n\nI start getting angry and ask him how I was condescending.\n\n\n**L**: \"well you sighed when I said that Victoria is a slut, it was really condescending and you clearly feel superior and think I'm a misogynistic asshole\"\n\n\n**Me**: \"I never called you that, I just expressed that I didn't like what you said! I wanted to keep playing nontheless! Stop taking me for an fucking idiot, I know you're trying to make me angry on purpose!\"\n\n\n\nAt this point, I've lost my temper and I'm screaming. Everyone else in the room is silent. A friend interjects calmly \"you shouldn't get this angry, but I agree that L's words to express his opinions are harsh, and probably not the right ones\"\n\n\n**Me**: \"it's not about that anymore, I just wanted to keep playing the fucking game and he keeps pissing me off with this! He's fucking with me!\"\n\n\n**L**: \"I'm fucking with you? You're so childish for getting so angry and vulgar over me calling her a slut, you don't want to take any responsibility for your behavior\"\n\n\n\nI'm really freaking out. I try saying that I'm more angry about him sealioning me than what he initially said. He keeps calling me a condescending white knight, so I snap and call him a fucking asshole, which makes things worse.\n\n\n\nAt one point, I realise I ruined the night. I stop talking, pick up my shoes and heads out. L tells me \"that's it, storm off like a civilized adult, you're such a pleasant person\", sarcastically, of course.\n\n\n\nI walk back home, boiling inside but I feel really bad for ruining the evening. B catches up with me on bike, stops me, and asks me calmly why I got so angry, telling me I ruined the mood and everyone's got so silent.\n\n\n\n**Me**: \"Don't you feel like he was taking the piss at me and getting me angry on purpose? Because that's how I felt\"\n\n**B**: \"He wasn't angering you on purpose, you just both got big egos that clashed. But nobody back here knows why you got so angry over *litterally nothing*. Are you okay?\"\n\n\n\nI burst into tears because of the remorse I have, and I explain to him that, as he knows, I have anger issues that I pretty much can contain nowadays, but (back when this happened), I'm in a pretty rough life situation and had to adjust to a sudden change, so my temper was shorter than usual, but that it's not an excuse for what I did. I also explained to him that, I did not come to argue about that, and that at this point I didn't care who was right or wrong, I wanted to drop the subject because I felt it was not the time and place to do so, and that as much as he was calling me childish and immature for getting angry, he didn't try once to appease the situation.\n\n\n\nB doesn't reply to that, and there's a pause for a few seconds, I collect myself, and ask B \"Do you think I should come back and apologize?\"\nHe tells me that I can if I want.\n\n\n\nSo I head back to his place with him. I'm still pretty shaken and I'm clearly holding back tears while I'm saying it:\n\n\n\n\"First off, I want to apologize to you, L. I realized that sighing in exasperation when someone says something is condescending and that it's normal that they don't react well to that. It was rude, and I shouldn't have done it. And I want to apologize to everyone else for being unable to control my temper, and for ruining what was an enjoyable night.\"\n\n\n\nHere's L's reply: \"It's good that you found the courage to come back and apologize. I hope that one day you manage to overcome your psychological issues.\"\n\n\n\nThis answer didn't please me, and that's quite the euphemism. I felt my apology was genuine, because I really felt bad about what I did, and getting so angry, and turning everyone's good time into a bad time. I expected him to apologize, in turn, for whatever. Maybe for using the language he used, or maybe for not trying to calm down the situation. But it seemed to me that he thought only I was responsible for what happened.\n\n\n\nI didn't reply, I just sat down. The game didn't resume, but we dropped the subject, everyone started to talk again, even me, even L, sometimes to each other, without hostility. It seemed to have become a chill party again, but calmer and less lively. It got late and everyone left normally like nothing ever happened.\n\n\n\nThis was probably way longer that it should have been for such a mundane story, but it's been in my mind for months. I don't want to bring this back up with L, but the one or two times I asked anyone else that was there, they just reply to me that they didn't hear the start of the conversation, that they don't know if he was angering me on purpose, so I'm not insisting. So this is a bit venty but I really need people to tell me what they think about it. I thank you for your patience if you read this far, and in advance for your honesty.",

      "description": "I'm going home for the weekend from my university and the nearest airport is an hour and a half away. I don't have a car so I had to ask a friend for a ride, which is a lot to ask because it's a 3 hour round trip and it's hard to fit that in with class as well being out of the way. Also made it clear I would pay them($50 vs $100 uber), but most everyone had class and my only option was this one friend I have mostly through association with other friends. I'll be honest when I say this was probably my last choice because I just don't care for him too much. However, he was kind enough to take me and beggars can't be choosers so I take the ride.\n\n\nHe picks me up and he has a friend already sitting shotgun so he \"wouldn't be lonely on the ride back.\" Fair enough, I still get a ride. We talk for a short while before I get dropped from the conversation. No big deal, I brought headphones so I'll just listen to music. Nah, he starts blasting edm while still trying to have a conversation with his friend in shotgun. He's pretty much just yelling while they listen. The subwoofers he has are right behind me, I can't even hear my headphones cranked full volume.\n\nEventually we switch to country and I get a \"hey petefromthestreet, do you like country?\" to which I reply \"A few songs here and there, but not my first choice. So and so dropped a new song have you heard that? it's pretty good.\" and he said \"oh I'll play it right now.\" he played half the song and then went back to his own thing and that's the last we talked for like the remainder of the car ride.\n\nI never said anything, but I just feel so ungrateful and a little upset, even though he was my only option, I like him less.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I was picking up a small amount of groceries from Tesco that my parents forgot to buy on the way back from school (milk, cheese, veg and some sweets). After I gathered my items I made my way to the self service checkouts. I normally use the self service checkouts for two reasons: \n\n1) I know that it is quicker for me to do it myself\n\n2) Better to listen to my own thoughts than feign niceness to the checkout person whilst awkwardly waiting for them to be done. I don't have social anxiety or anything I just find it a bit tedious.\n\nIn this instance, as I was walking to the self service checkouts I heard a woman call to my left; Along the lines of \"Do you want me to help you with those?\" I very awkwardly semi ignored her with a \"eerit's alright\". I didn't stop walking at all and only half looked over my shoulder to see who it was that was offering me assistance. As i returned my head to look where   I was going it clicked that the woman had some sort of mental disability. After i responded my brain noticed that she said the sentence a little oddly (Not sure how to describe it with respect, but it was an obvious tell that she had a speech impediment). I got to the self service checkouts a few seconds later and looked up to see she was looking right at me with a sad expression. At this point I could see by her face she had some sort of disability (scrunched face, saggy lip...). I looked down, scanned, bought and bagged my items. When i glanced over again she was dealing with a new customer.\n\nSafe to say i felt like shit afterwards. I am a 17 year old boy if that matters. But was i really in the wrong for rejecting her offer? Does the fact she had a disability change the situation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers",

      "description": "Bit of background story: I (17M) live in Sweden and in gymnasiums (i guess kind of equivalent to high school) we have ”food credit cards” that all students receive in our school in order to eat out, that are filled with approx. 5.5$ each day (we don’t have a cafeteria). We can only eat at restaurants that the school has a deal with. One of those is Subway. This happened about 1-2 months ago.\n\nWe decided to eat at Subway that day and we were late that day and as soon as you’re late by just about 5+ minutes on weekdays, lunch time, the place is crowded af. Anyway, since it was so crowded there were no seats available that day, so me and my 2 friends decided to sit with the lone old guy at one table. He was very quiet eating his sub while me and my friends were also eating, talking, whatever. \n\nThen, the old guy asked me a question, since I was the only one sitting right across him, my friend beside me and my other friend beside the old guy. I couldn’t hear him, (crowded place and he was barely audible). I asked him to repeat himself, tilted myself closer to him and I still couldn’t hear him at all. He was also in a wheelchair. Then, I said no for some stupid fkn reason because I didn’t want to look like a dumbass for asking him to repeat himself a second time. \n\nHe looked sad for a moment, looked up and asked my friend beside me the same question. My friend also asked him to repeat himself and then said yes and got him a refill. I asked him once we were outside what he asked for and he replied ”probably something along the lines of: can you get me a refill?”. Once he said that it kind of clicked, since it sounded similar to what he asked me initially. I laughed at it and told my friends I felt bad and would have got him the refill if I heard him. They were joking about it asking me why I said no. Guess I was tired that day.\n\nAITA? I wanted to hear your opinions since I felt awful about it for like 2 days lol. He was really sweet and old, probably 80+ years old. Also wanted to share this story since I found it a bit funny (and sad) :(",

      "description": "Sooooooo... Can't sleep. Can't eat. Had a nightmare and woke up pale and dizzy. Please help.\nI need to know if my behaviour was  normal for someone in a panick mode.\nWe were going to visit my honey's parent's house (dacha/дача) when his dad told me his agressive dog tried to kill my cat. That cat is a jerk and she is fearless so she just ran to that monster to play. Luckly, the cat was saved by the dad. But I was mad that he let that happen and most of all I was furious my kind hearted kitty was now injured in the head. And it was obvious Zosya wasn't okay and that they didn't look hard enough to notice that she was injured. So when I came and saw her injured and acting strange I became sooooooo angry I thought I was gonna kill the dog.\nSo I start saying, not yelling, very agressively that this f*cking dog bites everyone in the family, she is a nightmare, and calling the dog a couple of bad russian names. So my bf tries to calm me down but he says things like no big deal the cat is okay now, there is nothing I can do about it anyway so there is no reason to act this way. I go like no, that f*cking dog IS a reason. We start raising our voices and we ended up screaming at each other. I have never screamed so loud at someone in my life. All I was thinking was HOW COULD YOU BETRAY OUR CHILD YOU CUNT. It lasted no longer than a couple of minutes and than he started eating and I stayed with my kitty to check if she was okay. Of course we ended up with more fighting and not taking to each other but that's another story.\nWhen we discussed that he told me it was inappropiate for me to start a fight in his parents house and I told him that he can start a fight with his family whenever he wants to in other words calling him hypocrite.\nI get it. It is not my house. And I am always aware of it. But this time I was way worried about my baby than thinking about what is acceptable and what is not.\nI believe I am an asshole. I couldn't stop myself from showing my emotions. But at the same time, maybe it is something that all people do once in a while. Am I trashy? ",

      "description": "A girl, who seemed very interested in me, once invited me over to watch a movie alone in her room on her bed.  I made a a couple of advances throughout the movie to which she would just laugh at my face and say \"can't we just watch the movie?\". I even made an advance after the movie was over. Same reaction. It wasn't even in a rude way or anything, it just indicated that she didn't want want to do anything like that.  It also seemed like she still wanted me there though, because she put on another movie afterwards. I made no advances during this second movie.\n\nI tried catching up with her a couple of times after that. She would constantly tell me that she was into me when we messaged each other, put us in situations where we were alone at hers, but just lost it when anything actually did start to happen. It was really off-putting. She wondered why I didn't keep perusing her after that, and actually got rather annoyed at me when I just stopped messaging her.  A couple of weeks later I messaged her, and she just gave me a snarky response along the lines of \"I think you meant to send that to someone else\". Our few interactions after that made me feel like question whether I was in the right, or wrong.  She seemed really annoyed at me. I just felt like I was wasting time with someone who wasn't that into me.  \n\nFor a bit of context, this happened a few years ago. We were also in university, and had our own private student accommodation rooms. No parents around or anything. Some recent post on another sub made me reminiscent, and it made me question whether I was in the right, or acted like an asshole in the situation.  What do you guys think? ",

      "description": "So context; we’ve been dating around four months, we’re exclusive and I do almost ALL the organising of dates. He’s always happy to see me, texts every day, but if I waited for him to proactively arrange a date I’d be waiting a long time. I think this is born from entrenched complacency rather than malice.\nAnyway, I went to his last night after not seeing him for a week, I gave him a Valentine’s card and he hadn’t got me one. When I reminded him that we discussed this (cards or presents etc- settled on cards) he apologised but I was clearly upset. Anyway, fast forward a few hours of an actually pleasant evening (I managed to put my disappointment to one side) and I ask him if in a few weeks he would visit my hometown up north with me. I tell him he doesn’t have to meet my parents, I’ll just book a hotel for a night or two, and that it would mean the world to me. He asked “would you be offended if I said no?” To which I replied that not only would I be offended, I’d be hurt. He then made all his teeth kissing huffing passive aggressive noises and I asked what the problem was. He said he just didn’t want to go, he’d been before, it’s not appealing, he didn’t fancy it. When I attempted to tell him that I was very hurt by this because he wouldn’t even do it for me (and that I was only asking to have a night or two away, not for a bloody kidney) he said I should accept his decision, he had the right to say no, I shouldn’t feel hurt by that, why should he do something he doesn’t want to do, why am I guilt tripping him and telling him off. I reiterated that sometimes we do things that might not be our first choice of a fun thing to do because it would make the person we’re with happy and not hurt them, and that I would do the equivalent for him. He point blank refused. We just left it at that. \nI’m terrified of being alone because I’ve been treated like such crap in the past but I just can’t get over how insensitive and selfish I feel he is being. I’m not going to bring it up again but I’m wondering, am I just being over the top? AITA? \n\nEdit: we broke up. A lot of comments on here are right. I’m not actually into HIM I think, I’m just sick of being single and the whole dating scene. But I also know when to stop. His behaviour got a lot worse, I am getting help for some of my own attachment issues and generally I’m not going to be with someone unless we’re both actually HAPPY- not just riding some societal timeline.\nThanks for the responses.

      "description": "Ok, 2 of my buddies from college came to visit/stay with me. They wanted to go into the city (i live in the suburbs), so get into the city from where i live, you have to take the train into the city and then transfer to the subway to get around within the city. No big deal, I was fine with that. So we went into the city, went to a fun bar, and had, in general, a very enjoyable night. \n\nTHEN, on the subway back to get our train, we decided that we would just catch whatever train heading back to my hometown that happened to be leaving next (that late at night they usually leave about once every hour). one of my friends, we'll call her Emily, mentioned to me that she kind of had to pee. I told her that's fine. \n\nWe get to the train station, we find out that there's a train we'd be able to make by about 5 minutes. As we're speed walking there, Emily is now freaking out about needing to pee. I ask if she can just pee on the train (the trains have bathrooms), a question which she does not answer, and instead just ditches me and my other friend to find a bathroom. \n\nWe miss the train by about a minute because me and my other friend didn't want to leave without Emily. Literally watched the train pull away as Emily walks over. Naturally, we were both kind of annoyed by the whole situation. It was late and we all just wanted to go home. My other friend and I started to call Emily out a little bit. \"You could have peed on the train, why did you have to be annoying about this whole thing\" etc. which she FREAKED OUT about, exacerbating the entire situation, and while both of them were arguing, she was to the point of tears, specifically because she thought we had no right to be annoyed with her. \n\n  \nEmily's defense she gave later was that a) had we arrived 5 minutes AFTER the train had already left the entire situation would not  have even ensued because we didn't have a definitive train we wanted to catch until we got there, and that b) she was on a train once where the bathroom was locked, so she didn't want to \"risk\" getting on the train. I think the logic on both of these kind of fall in on themselves, but i guess I get it. Anyways. Am I (and my other friend) the asshole here for being pissed she made us miss our train? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR my friend made us miss our train back really late at night, got very mad at us for being annoyed about it.

My daughters father gets hurt was in the hospital so I tried to help him around the house for the first week he was out(ex and I are great at coparenting and wish no Ill will towards one another ) and my S/O got jealous and instead of talking to me about it started a POF account, downloaded snap chat and connected with a chick over a cartoon called One Piece. (I’m in my thirties and he is almost there as well. ) I forgave, tried to forget and move on, we have kids and plans and the one sticking point the one thing I can’t get over and past (which he knows) is I want no sign or talk about One Piece.

      "description": "A bit of backstory:\n  \n3 years ago I broke up with my ex that I loved truly and dearly. She worked as a hostess in an Asian only karaoke. This place was riddled with rich Asian dudes from Japan and Korea. Execs of companies like komatsu, Hyundai etc. This was your typical Asian place, where you can pay for a girl to sit, drink and chat with you. I was fine with her job, even though she was one of the very popular girls there. I trusted her, and she never gave me a reason to distrust her. She was \"the one\" and I was getting ready to possibly propose to her. Until one day, when she told me that this one guy kept on coming in and asking for her. At first, I was happy she finally got regulars, and she seemed happy about it to. But things started to go south. First — expensive gifts, which, ues, were hurting my self esteem, but I kept cool. Then guifts became more personal like Lingerie and stuff. I confronted her about it, and she said she's wierded out by it as well, but I'm the only one she's showing it off to. Then meetings outside work hours, which supposedly we're just \"extra income\".  And then he called her on a week long trip to Korea... which she agreed to! \n  \nNow, no duh I was against it, because I was already starting to develop trust issues from all the intimate gifts , meetings and texting. I told her that if she goes — she can forget our relationship. She did.\n  \nNow I hated that Korean piece of shit. I'm not an idiot. I know what happens on trips like these. Waving around wads of money in front of a young girl that was raised pretty poor and dreaming of a better life. Of course that bitch agreed to go. I found him online, found his wife and sent her screenshots of his husband's suggestive texts. \n  \nTwo days later he calls me and threatens me in broken English (99.9% sure he got my phone number and the fact that I speak English from my ex) telling me what a pice of garbage am for breaking his family. \n  \nA week later I get a text from my ex, saying \"thank you for cancelling my trip. He got fired, are you happy?\" (I'm pretty sure that was his wife's work, definitely not mine)\n  \nSo, your just-asses, am I the asshole?\n  \nP.s. the worst part about all of it, is that I now consider myself a racist piece of shit, because of some shitty pavlovian defense reaction I now subcontiously hate Koreans. \n  \nFuck you, former VP of ******* CIS LLC.",

I was confused, so I opened it and inside was a thank you note with a gift card from my neighbor.\n\n(Before I go any further, I want to say that I'm extremely grateful for this note and card.  I know he didn't have to do that and it does mean a lot that he did.  I just don't want to appear like I'm an ungrateful dick.)\n\nI go to work and forget about it.  After I get home, I ask my parents if they put it there (I still live with them) and they said they didn't.\n\nI told them how I didn't like the idea of my neighbor just going into my car and they basically said how I was being ungrateful and how im just over reacting. I told them that I'm thankful and how it was the principal of the situation and that he could have , and he has before, just put things in the mailbox.\n\nI'm not super pissed or anything, just a little weirded out since I'm not very close to this neighbor.\n\nAlso before the 'lock your doors' comment comes up, I'll say that I have a decently old car without a key fob and sometimes I forget to lock the doors once I'm out.

I have asked him about every week to start paying me back, and he always agrees he will yet never does. This infuriates me.\n\nSo one day while I was at his house, i asked him once again for the money. He replied with \"maaaannnnn you always asking that\". I got fed up, so i told him that i was going to take some of his videogames/booze collection and sell the games on Craigslist/online/whatever. So i literally walked into the other room and grabbed a stack of his old games (that he never even plays anymore) and went and took a few bottles of his liquor. He never tried to physically stop me, but instead called me an asshole.\n\nSome notes for you all: He is NOT broke or struggling, he works full time at $28 an hour and splits rent with our other friend. He has enough money to go out for dinner often and party but seemingly not enough to pay me back? He also isn't an alcoholic and rarely drinks, but just collects all sorts of random things, a large volume of liquor included.\n\nI kept the liquor for myself ($300 value) and sold the games for around $250 for the stack.  Half of the value retrieved, he told me that he will pay the remaining $500 soon.\n\nMy friend is not *too* bothered by this, we have gone out since, but looking back, it seems I may of been an asshole.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "AITA for not wanting to go on a free cruise?\n\nMy husband works in a stressful industry where perks are usually non-existent. He didn't mention it to me, but for about a year he was working towards winning this award which would give him + an adult guest a free cruise.  He brought home the paperwork and was so happy to tell me that he won. I am very proud of him, but I had to ask him, in that entire year did you wonder how we would be able to make this happen?\n\nWe have two kids and nobody in our family that we can trust to watch them. Both sides of grandparents are elderly and not able to keep up with the kids. He has a brother that smokes pot and lays around the house all day and neither one of us want the kids around that.  Those are the only options for family to watch them.\n\nI have one close friend that we would trust, so I tentatively asked her what she thought. She said sure no problem, but then a couple weeks afterwards let me know that my kids would be alone, all day, from 7am-6pm in their house, and was asking me if I am okay with that?  I am not okay with that.  To have to fend for themselves in an unfamiliar house, and basically be housebound because they live too far out to walk anywhere, just doesn't sit well with me.\n\nI thought about hiring a nanny, but the cost would be extremely high.  We even thought about just purchasing cruise tickets for the kids and bringing them along, but then the \"free\" cruise gets to be pretty expensive.\n\nTo add to all of this, I never once in my life wanted to go on a cruise, and I get extremely seasick.  To leave my kids behind to be sick and miserable for a week is not appealing at all.  I'd be fine with my husband going with a buddy or his brother or anyone really.  I'd miss him but I'd be happy that he was having fun.  He, however, is hell bent on getting me to come along.  AITA for wanting to dig my heels in and say I just don't want to go?  ",

      "description": "Ok, this might sound cruel but hear me out. A few years back at school I overheard that a girl that I've never spoken to or even been in the same class as in our five whole years of high school together wanted to ask me out. I had less than zero interest in this girl and thought that a 'missed opportunity' would be better than rejection for her. At least that's what I'd prefer if I were in her situation.\n\nI know she is an extremely emotional girl because even though we've never been in the same class I've seen her cry almost ten times and she had also taken a couple weeks off of school when she broke up with her, then, boyfriend. The first time I had heard that she was interested in me was at the end of school dinner and then suddenly I noticed that she kept staring at me from across the room. I didn't want to reject someone after I'd had such a good night so I left the nanosecond the principal said we could. After that night I didn't know what to do. I'd never been in this situation before and thought that maybe she would be less hurt if she never got the chance to ask me out rather than me rejecting her in front of her friends. \n\nAs we were never in the same class and I played football/soccer during our school breaks it was easy to avoid her for the final two weeks of school but on our final day we had a 'fun' day where we would relax by the pool and the school would hire bouncy castles and crap (we're 17 year olds btw but that doesn't matter). Basically, every year 12 has to hang out in a small area. This is when I felt the worst because I could see her looking for me and wherever she was I wasn't. I was doing everything I could to not have to reject her. After a few hours I decided to hang out by myself by the pool just to chill and then she and her friends spotted me. I see her and her mate walking towards me in my periphery. I deliberately made sure I didn't make eye contact so maybe she would think that I genuinely didn't see her, I stood up and made way for the football pitch. I think I got away with it not being obvious as they were still roughly 20 metres or so away and that was it. School was over and I've never seen her again.\n\nAm I an asshole for doing this? I honestly thought that rejection would've been worse, especially for her but I'm not by any means an expert. \n\nHow would you have dealt with it or how would you have felt as the girl? Would you prefer rejection or a missed chance?",

      "description": "Disclaimer: I have no idea how to title this as it's still quite puzzling in my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm in this group of 3 where we are ex-schoolmates who love to bowl (professionally). Let's call my other 2 friends 'AL' and 'RY'. Last night, AL said in our groupchat that he wanted to bowl with us today. I agreed since I wanted to bowl as well. However, RY asid that he couldn't come as he was moving houses (I have no idea if it's true or not but we let it slide). As the conversation continued, I assumed that the plan would not go through. At that time, I still wanted to bowl. So, I asked my cousin (who's not a bowling enthusiast at all) if he wanted to join me since I would have went alone anyways. He agreed and I called the alley to book a lane for 12noon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today 9am. I woke up to a massage from AL where he said that the plan would continue just without RY. At first I thought \"shit, now I have plans with 2 different people at almost the same time.\" But then since the first meeting was at 1030am with AL, I thought that I could finish up with him before playing with my cousin. However, when AL and I reached the alley at 1030am, the place was full and I had to wait until 1130am at the earliest before being able to play. So while waiting, I discussed the issue with AL and he was completely fine with bowling with my cousin. So, we just continued on. Unfortunately, I completely forgot to ask my cousin if he was ok with this arrangement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AL and I got a lane and started playing whilst waiting for my cousin. Before I even left my house, I was contemplating whether or not if I should reschedule my plans with my cousin since his schedule was much more laxed compared to AL. But my final judgement was \"screw it, lets just bowl together\". When my cousin arrived at the alley however, he did not expect me to already be bowling with someone he didn't klnow at all. So he just turned around and just went back home.  While he was walking away I called him to ask as  I was puzzled myself.  It went something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Hey, why did you leave?\n\nCousin: You could have told me if you were busy\n\nM: Can't we just bowl together?\n\nC: Fk it, I'm going home. My firends are going out later today. I'll just ask if I can join them.\n\nM: ...\n\nM: ok\n\n\\*End Call\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfterwards, AL and I just stared at each other like \" WTF was going on?\" About 5 minutes later, my cousin called me back asking if I wanted to reschedule. And so we did for tomorrow. So now I have no idea if I'm completely at fault, he's just overreactinng or if it was mistakes from both sides.",

      "description": "To preface, I don't use street parking at all.\n\nI'll cut to the chase. I don't like it mainly because it's a beaten down lifted (really high) truck. Had he parked a SUV, normal truck, mini van, or sedan, I wouldn't have cared at all. One of my other neighbour park their Hyundai SUV there too, and I don't care at all. \n\nA couple of things really ticks me off. His drive way is empty during the day but he doesn't want to move his truck onto his own drive way. At night, he parks this truck horizontally across the sideway in-front of his house because there is no street parking between 2AM and 7 (or 8) AM. (he has two other cars parked on his drive way) I hear him moving the truck around 12-1AM every night. It's loud. (Not a concern of mine) The height of the lifted truck also obstruct the view of the front of the house as well as the street which can cause slight difficulty reversing my car in the morning. \n\nThere are two violations from the city bylaws that I've found.\n\n1. in front of or within 1.5 metres of the entrance to a driveway or so as to\nprevent ingress to or egress from such driveway;\n\n2. for a longer period of time than 3 consecutive hours;\n\nThe reason I'm posting is because both violations doesn't effect me. If they did, I would'nt've hesitated about calling the bylaw officers. His truck being inches away from my drive way exit doesn't really affect me too much. I can deal with this. I did a rough measuring and it's about 12 inches away from my drive way. I'm capable of reversing out of my drive way without any trouble. Also I don't care if he park how many hours. It's just THAT truck. ",

      "description": "Okay so there is a lot more background to this but I just want to know if I'm in the wrong here. \n\nTo begin with my family is extremely conservative and pretty religious so I have been raised the same way as well and right now its nearing college time. (Quick note we are in Canada) My parents are willing to pay for my full tuition and I am more than grateful for that, but when I was registering for universities my mom was upset because she has her heart set on me going to a specific university in the United States, this uni is super conservative and aligns with most of my personal values, it will be hard though because I am not religious and hide that from my family. For example I drink and smoke and am bisexual, these are huge no-nos at this uni in the USA. So for a lot of reasons (even including cost) I am thinking of going to a campus here in Canada close to home. Now on to the actual AITA today I called my mom as one of the colleges here requires a 500 dollar deposit which I agree is kinda bs because If I do decide to go to another college they keep the 500 dollars, after telling her this  she said on the phone \"Well I guess we won't pay the 500 dollars then\" which to then I said \"Well then I guess I'm not going to that college then\" at this she began to get upset and practically yelled at me asking \"You really want to go to that college x3\" At this I just said I don't feel like talking to you right now and hung up. I called my dad because he is supportive of wherever I go. When I got home from school I just got some angry looks hardly any talking from my mom and it's clear that she is very mad at me. I understand she wants what's best for me but she needs to see my side too? Maybe it's just school and I need my spring break to come faster...\n\nI just don't know anymore AITA?",

      "description": "Apologies for the long post. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nEven though this happened over five years ago, the decision has stuck with me clear as day. It bothers me almost as much now when it comes to mind as when it took place. I wanted to put it here before the court of popular opinion to see how others view my actions.\n\nSome context, I’d been teaching mathematics as primary instructor at the college level for two and a half years. Mostly Calc II and III with some higher stuff mixed in.\n\n At the time, I’d gotten my Masters in the field and was working toward my PhD. Despite considerable personal constraints on my time, I was passionate about teaching and took it very seriously. I commonly made time for impromptu office hours to suit my students’ schedules and held extracurricular review sessions before each exam, including the final. \n\nMy classes weren’t easy by any account, but I laid outa clear path to success. I look back at my career as an educator fondly and my reviews invariably warmed my heart; the majority of my students acknowledged my efforts and relayed that I was tough but fair. My general philosophy was that I would match any student’s sincere efforts in kind. The end result was that there was rarely a student that came to both office hours and reviews with little to show for it.\n\nEnter the subject of this post, let’s call them E for effort. I was teaching Calc III in the Fall semester and encountered E earlier in the year when I had taught Calc II the previous Spring and had the unhappy experience of failing them. They must have taken a Summer offering of the course in order to stay on track with their program and then signed up for my next class.\n\nThis time around, E knew how I rolled and made a great effort. There was seldom a week I did not find E in my office at least once and they made all the exam review sessions. E admitted mine was the only time offered for the course that fit their tight schedule (I think I would have been avoided otherwise) and that they needed to pass to graduate on plan. E wasn’t doing stellar going into the final, but had at least a passing grade up to that point.\n\nNow, one of the great benefits of teaching math is that a correct answer is unambiguously distinguishable from a wrong one. I happened to grant partial credit in several cases, but the form this took was generally predictable and my rubrics were established before I ever saw an exam. Moreover, I graded all exams by one problem at a time rather than a full exam at a time, so bias in grading was not really a thing.\n\nI say this all to make it clear that when I was done grading the last problem on the last exam, tallying my students’ scores was a complete surprise to me. So when I came to E’s test, I was well and truly nervous on their behalf. As I went over it page by page, my heart sank. They had failed the final.\n\nThe test was not so tremendous a failure as some other students, but it was bad enough to push E’s grade below passing. As I completed filling in my gradebook for the year, I saw that E sat fourth among students below the invisible passing line in terms of accumulated points for the course. (For reference, this is really close as I was teaching a total of 80 students that semester among the different class times for the course.)\n\nThis is where the bargaining began in my head. E had tried as hard as I think possible for them and they were failing at subject matter that was really unlikely to be relevant in their field. I could fudge the grade line and modify my rubric so no one could claim otherwise.\n\nIn the end, though, I submitted the grades as they were. I weighed out the chances that other more silent students in those situations were never given similar consideration and settled that the line had to be drawn clinically for fairness. My role was to assess their passage or failure of the material as a whole, not whether it would affect them.\n\nBut then again, we’re not robots and I wondered if some bias isn’t really inherently wrong if I consider how easily I might have weighed my rubrics a little differently throughout the semester to have pushed E unknowingly over that threshold. The closeness of the margin was really annoying and I gave pushing E and the three other students’ grades up some serious thought.\n\nNow I know graduating a semester later isn’t the greatest tragedy in the world, but the struggle kind of stuck with me anyway. So I leave it to you all, am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR - Student I failed in a previous class needs to pass a new one to graduate on time. They make a very sincere effort all semester but still don’t scrape a passing grade by a narrow margin. I thought it was unlikely that the material they messed up on would affect them in any professional capacity and considered changing my cutoff. Still failed them (again) in accordance with my original  rubric, singlehandedly delaying their graduation.",

This also the case if said item were to break under the possession of one of us and it has worked until this morning. \n\nLast night i decided to bring one of our shared items to our friends house and it unfortunately broke. I knew i'd be responsible for paying back my roommate for his half and i'd accepted that fully.\n\nHeres the problem:\nWhen i told him this he became visibly upset (understandable) but tried talking to me in a calm manor. According to him since i didnt inform him that i was taking the item to our friends house and then broken it i am even more responsible for it breaking. He is demanding i pay him back his half for the item ($25 ) in addition to more money to compensate him for his loss (unspecified, probably more than $10). If i refuse to pay him back extra hes going to refuse to pay me back for other items we are currently sharing and keep said items. I told him I refuse to pay him more money than he invested as he is walking away having lost nothing and i would be down $50 and the item, worse off than i would be if i bought him out normally. \n\nSo i need to know reddit, AITA for refusing to pay him more than his initial investment??",

      "description": "Before I begin I should lay some groundwork for my story. A local high school sells some fundraising cards that offer coupons to a lot of local businesses. I bought one and frequently use said card at a local haircut chain that offers $3 off each haircut.\n\nThe closest haircut chain place to me closed about 8 months ago. The fundraiser card only works in two cities, and the store that closed was the only one of its type in that city. The other city is at least a 20 minute drive for me. Meanwhile there’s another place right on the border of my city/other city but technically not either of the cities listed on the card. They offered me some good other coupons for switching over to their store post-my store closing, but after those ran dry, I’ve been asking if they’d honor my coupon card which they've said yes to 3 times.\n\nSo I’ve been going to this place, getting my usual haircut, which is basically a buzz cut. Everyone always comments on how super easy it is. I don’t know if that’s hairstylists commenting on how they enjoy easy ones sometimes or if they genuinely believe it’s a haircut that isn’t worth their time.\n\nDuring my haircut my hairstylist (whom I've had before) gets an insane amount of hair off per swipe and pushes it off my head down the front of my face. Not just once or twice, but a few times in a row. My eyes and nose are caked with hair and I’m having a hard time not starting to tear up cause it’s irritating my eyes. I didn't say anything, since I'm an introvert by nature and secondly, you don’t really want to piss off a person with a razor.\n\nHairstylist says nothing either, uses her fingers to wipe off most of the hair on my face a few minutes later. We finish up after less than 10 minutes and I go to pay with this fundraiser card coupon. It takes bringing over the manager to get the coupon added. I never made a big fuss about it, just explained how I went to the old store, it closed, and would like to use it if I still can.\n\nAfter it’s all settled, there’s a screen on the card reader that asks for a tip. You have to manually press a button to type in the amount and each time it makes a noise. It's obvious if you tip or not cause the hairstylist can hear an amount being entered in.\n\nMy hairstylist says “here’s the tip screen! Remember that?” I unenthusiastically say “yup” and just hit continue so I can swipe my card. Out of the corner of my eye I notice her face pales a bit, but she hands me my receipt, thanks me, and I go on my way.\n\nI really feel awful about when people skimp out on tips as a society. I’ve never worked a tip job so I don’t know how much it actually is necessary as far as their wages go. Am I the asshole for not tipping after my poor experience, even after what they did for me with the coupons?\n\nTL;DR: my old haircut store closed, got good coupons with them, had to move to a new store within the same chain, got a subpar haircut, asked if they could honor the coupon, then didn’t tip based on the haircut I received.",

      "description": "So, I just want to state that I have some aged issues, but please send me some actual reasons if I’m an asshole or not. \n\nSo this girl, right, I like her and well she doesn’t “yeah ok, fair enough” but I decided, hey just don’t talk to her for a week. I Wanted to see if she cared about our friendship, I had been building it up, and because she ignored me often, and I thought to myself, “hey I just need some time to get over it” of course, I felt kind of bad for just not talking to her, (she’s got some issues with family but has a lot of friends including me supporting her) But, y’know if she talked to me first or needed something I would’ve responded.\n\nThen, the girl which I’ll call Alice,  responds with “it’s fine” , I wanted to make sure she really was just okay with it all, so I said “You’re just fine with it?” She responds with “I’m used to being ignored.” I said a half truth, saying that “I thought you just didn’t want to talk to me, so I didn’t.” (This is true by the way, just not the whole reason)  and “if you wanted to talk to me you could’ve just started it.”\n\n“Also, you always wanna seem to talk to someone else, like you always say where’s such and such, or Where’s this guy” (I’d say that’s kind of an asshole thing)  She says, “Why should I talk if no one is there for me?” This is what got me pretty angry, as these two people in particular always try to help her, and I know as I’m close friends with these two. and her definition of being there is “helping me with all my problems.” She then says, “I’M A BURDEN TO ALL OF THEM, they probably became friends with me because of pity”  (now she’s assuming things) \n\nThen she says “Okay, to use me then!” This kind of makes me angry. I was saying how a bunch of people weren’t using her and what not (I handled it badly, IMO) but she seems to think everyone wants to use her. Then after I say, “Look, Alice not everyone is gonna use you!” She responds with “lmao who” this gets me mad, and this is where I question “Am I a asshole?” I say, “You don’t want help you just want pity, saying how she undermines the help people give to others and to her,  Then I end it with “You’re so stubborn that what I’m saying won’t phase you!”\nAnd well, after I didn’t talk to her at all.",

      "description": "Pardon the length of this post, but it requires a bit of context...\n\nI’m at a university with fraternities that have recently been forced to allow females to reside within their frat houses. I’m friends with a lot of the fraternity brothers at a certain house, but not actually a member, although they keep asking me to pledge. Anyway, just before mid-winter break (the week before President’s Day), I met one of the three ladies that actually live in the frat house. We hit it off instantly and spent the rest of the week together, getting to know each other and having absolutely ridiculous mind blowing (protected) sex. She’s smart, funny, interesting, and likes the same nerdy shit that I’m into, and I was really thinking of asking her to go with me exclusively. Shit - she even said “I think I love you” post coitus, and it made my head swim like I’d never felt before...\n\nFast forward to this last Monday, when I passed a brother in the common room who casually says “Hey bud, you owe us a keg!” - I laugh and say “Yeah man I’ll throw in on the next one, no problem.” And he replies “No, no - you already threw it in (this girl) - now you have to buy us a keg- house rules!”. After a brief moment I realized the implication of what he was saying but only managed a meek muttering of “yeah sure”, and left immediately.\n\nAfter a few targeted conversations I come to find that my new lady friend gets around - a lot... like 20 dudes is my current count, and she’s only a sophomore (I’m a freshman, btw). I’m no saint myself - but, 20 dicks... Twenty dicks - that’s a lot of dicks, right? And there’s certainly more that I haven’t discovered yet.\n\nAnyhow the next day I’m back at the frat to visit the girl, and I see the same brother coming at me. He jokingly asks “So where’s our keg, bud?!” And I reply with a curt “Fuck off!” And left the house without seeing anyone else. Turns out I’m now “blackballed” from the fraternity house, and not allowed in or even on their lawn. My “friends” in the frat say the guy’s an asshole, but he’s a senior asshole, and apparently if I just fold and buy the keg, I’m back in his good graces. They all think I’m being a hardass and should just buy the keg and be done with it...\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to buy this damn keg?\n\nBonus question - WIBTA if I actually tried to date my new lady friend? I feel like I’d be a g-damn laughingstock and people would look at me/us with distain... But damn though... 20 dicks?\n\n20 + X = too many dicks, right? Or AITA for thinking that? Please help Reddit, you’re my only hope.\n\nP.S. I haven’t spoken to her face to face since Monday and really don’t know how to address it at all.\n\n",

      "description": "So I met this group of gaming friends a few years back through a game called Arma and the same core of people have stayed together but originally the group was larger. This someone I recently got very angry at and wanted to remove from all of our online community communication methods, from my point of view, caused a lot of the problems that caused the original group to break up, we shall call him Mr. Z for this period of time.\n\nBackground:\n\nMr. Z has always been free thinking and didn't follow community rules that well. He would always cause trouble for those writing papers to better organise ourselves when the paper would infringe on his right to act less serious than some of us, including me, would have liked. Mr. Z would also commonly side with people who cause chaos because these people oppose the set rules or common courtesy's set in place.\n\nOne major thing that Mr. Z supported was this character we shall name Mr. K. Mr. K would always assume the role to destroy the heaviest enemy targets immediately as they popped up and would cause who ever was running the session that night to up the difficulty. Afterwards there would be large dissent because that session was more 'difficult' than normal. Mr. K after these sessions would also brag about how he destroyed the heaviest enemy targets that might have other wised presented a suitable challenge for everyone else. Back to Mr. Z, he would also support Mr. K and in the end Mr. K Would be removed because of his lack of compliance to follow rules and regulations. Mr. Z did notboike this and would for the next several sessions bring everyone else's session quality down by being even more obnoxious.\n\nAnother major thing Mr. Z did was when ever we would play a game he disagreed with or in the game Arma 3 play as a faction other people would like but he didn't, Mr. Z would take the obnoxiousness and stupid act and turn it up a notch. We play as Guerilla fighters to try something different? He acts like a literal terrorist and actively is a detriment to the other participants. Not fighting the enemy he would like? Mr. Z would dress very similarly to the enemy. Mr. Z doesen't get the mission type he likes? He complains so that everyone would hear.\n\nThe last thing he really did that really angered me, This all was a few years ago by the way, was that when we would all try and settle our differences sit down and talk about how people feel about each other deep down. He blatantly said to everyone he had no problems and believes this activity was stupid and left. I was fine with that because I didn't find out later he was talking with someone through a private chat window about how he has all of these problems with everyone.\n\nTime now:\n\nThe big group fell apart a few months after. Fast forward a few years a lot of us are older have jobs and some out of High School so we believe we've matured enough to get together and form a new group. The same core of people including Mr Z and I stuck around and when we did our first session I wasn't surprised but I wasn't happy that he didn't mature one bit. I went on a very pessimistic tirade of how we should get rid of the peoblem, Mr. Z, and remove him permanently because of how he caused so many problems and continued to cause problems until now. I called him a number of things like a parasite, worthless member of the online community and a ton of racial slurs.\n\nI come here asking if I went overboard in wanting him removed completely and if my harsh comments fell into the 'asshole' level.",

      "description": "Me and my two best friends(one of which is my girlfriend now since just very recently) were planning to hang out this Tuesday. I'll can my gf A and my other friend B. We usually just go out for lunch and catch up, we all have busy schedules especially recently and don't get to see each other as often. Not that what we were doing to do is very relevant. Anyways, all was well until he texted out group chat asking where were going. We talked a bit more and then B said something along the lines of 'how about you to just hang out, you need to bond'. I was confused and said I still wanted to hang out with my friend too which he just replied \"no she's your girlfriend\" then I said I was referring to him. He responded again saying out of nowhere he was a bad friend(which honestly seemed joke-y since it really had nothing to do with what I said). I again responded just saying 'what' and he again just said repeated that me and A 'needed to bond'. I got a little peeved saying that if I wanted to bond with A we were perfectly capable of making plans on our own and that we made plans all together because he's our friend and we want to spend time with him too, and that if he didn't want to hang out he could just say so. Was I being too rude? Idk if his intentions were good or he was just looking for an excuse to back out of plans..he hasn't responded to me yet. \n\nAlso this may be pretty irrelevant but me and A are both female and B is a guy who is crushing hard for someone else, so I don't think jealousy would be an issue here.

My girlfriend sends me memes now and then, and I always respond laughing even if I've already seen them. i specifically make sure to never be like \"saw this already\" or anything to that affect, because I think it would be annoying and I know she feels good when I laugh at the memes she sends (one time she almost teared up from being happy when I full-on bellylaughed at a meme her brother had made and showed me when we were in the car)\n\nBut today she basically found out because she went to show a mutual friend a meme that she had just showed me, but I already sent it to him like a day or two ago. From there she pretty much figured out the whole ruse. She thinks I was manipulative and childish, and she feels embarrassed and doesnt want to share jokes with me in any form now. I think she's being ridiculous, but I thought I would run the situation by you lot to get some feedback just in case. So reddit, am i the asshole? ",

      "description": "Throwaway account because they know my Reddit, we're 16\n\nThis happened last week\n\nA little backstory, My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years and have known each other for 6. My boyfriend (N) lives with his mother, older half brother and grandparents in loft-studio combo. He shares the loft with his mother and brother while his grandparents are downstairs. N and his bother (D) are VERY close and are only a year apart. N\"s father's parents live in another state and have a \"no sex in our house\" rule and we both follow it diligently. We carry this rule over to his house to avoid being walked in on UNLESS everyone will be gone for a few days and even then, we keep it to the shower. His mother and grandparents don't know we're having sex. And another thing, his family, minus his brother, don't like us together or me in general for multiple reasons.\n\nNow the story.\n\nD had a sports thing to attend out of state for 3 days and his mother(S) and grandparents all attended leaving us to housesit. Everything was fine until day 2 when after we got back from a date, things got really heated and as soon as we got in the apartment my shirt and bra were downstairs and we were not.\n\nThat same night we were cooling down after being intimate in the shower and were now in bed doing oral, they came back early with no warning. D was the first one in the door and upstairs. We didn't have anytime to cover up before he yelled to his mom and ran downstairs . (I later found out that he was in a sour mood because his team had lost.) N and I managed to cover up before his mom made her way to the loft, and boy was she pissed. \nS yelled at me something like, \"You have five seconds to get the HELL away from my son and out of my house!\"\n\nN, who had stopped me from telling her to get the fuck out and is beet red at this point, had calmly told her to go downstairs so we can change. \n\nS looked liked I had slapped her mother but complied after shooting daggers at me. We got dressed, me using N's shirt.\nAs soon as we got downstairs, S threw my shirt and bra at my face (nicked my eye) and told me that if she saw me around her sons (yes, including D who I rarely talk to) again she'll get me arrested. Both N and I told her she couldn't do that to us and she replied with, \"I have every right to keep my kids away from a lying slut.\" I told her to go fuck herself and a few more colorful words before I stormed off home \nto check on my eye and tell my grandmother what happened. \n\nI didn't hear from N for a few days and was blocked on everything by his mother.\n\nAccording to a mutual friend of ours, N and S got into a huge fight followed by an argument between D and N. N is currently on lockdown for what happened and I can't help but blame myself for it as I was the one that initiated the sex. My grandmother thinks that we should've been more mindful but my brother and friends thinks we did nothing wrong. \n\nI love my boyfriend and I hate seeing him in trouble for this. AITA?",

      "description": "So I am currently getting a masters in a two year program. Right in my first semester, only 14 months ago, I got engaged. We decided to wait 2 years to do the wedding, so I’ll be getting married soon. We did a lot of the planning very quickly, so most of my new friends from grad school didn’t make the guest list since I had only just met them at the time. At a later time when save the dates we’re going out, I decided to invite 2 very close friends from school but no one else. Now, a friend that is recently beginning to engage more so we’ve gotten to know each other, keeps asking about the date, “can’t wait to see the save the date, oh send me your wedding website,” etc. While I do consider her a better friend now, it’s clear she expects an invite, and I know she’ll be very sad and hurt when she finds out I didn’t invite her but I did invite the other two girls. Not even jealous or mad, just sad and I don’t want to hurt her feelings but also the budget is tight and specific and it would have to be her and her husband and it’s just a lot. AITA for not inviting her or do I still do it?",

It's ok when he's out watering the garden or something, but I dislike it when we're sitting in the living room together. Every time I want to speak to him he has to take out an ear bud and shout 'what?' at me. I made a snarky comment tonight (which I shouldn't have done) about it and he got really angry. I know people these days spend a lot of time on social media, but I don't feel that listening to podcasts with his headphones in is the same thing.

      "description": "Bit of backstory,  there's this girl who I've been \"friends\" with for the last 10-ish year. I use quotation because I don't think I've actually enjoyed being friends for the last 6 years at least but she doesn't know that and I wont tell her because she doesn't have other friends. She's always had a bit of trouble making new friends and she loses them quite easily because shes not the most tactful.  I have been on holiday with her in the past and she doesn't really like me talking to other people when we're together and she gets kinda cranky when having to be social for more than like 2 hours (so plane rids and REALLY hard). Don't get me wrong it's not like I hate her and I definitely don't want her to be alone, she's just a bit hard to be around for an extended amount of time. \n\nSo this is where my problem arises. Last year I went on holiday with a couple friends to Asia, had a great time and would love to go back. On one of my outings with my \"friend\" she asked me about the trip and I mentioned that one day I would want to go back. This is when (and she had never mentioned this to me before) she mentions that she really wants to go to where we went and that we should go together, she even mentioned here that her mum said she wouldn't go with her (she has no other family) and that it would be perfect as I want to go back and she doesn't know anyone else who wants to go. Neither of us have the money at this time so she suggests that we go in a couple of year, I try to move on without really agreeing and we do (move on). I had hoped that that would be the end of that... but unfortunately she's mentioned it every time we meet up since. I've never actually agreed but I've never said no either. \n\nAITA for not telling her that I don't want to go? I kinda fell like I'm stringing her along but I know she really wouldn't take it well if I said I didn't want to go. I'm worried it would mean she would stop wanting to be friends as that would leave her with none.",

It was to make a loud noise as a metaphor. I personally, don't care for it nor does it apply to me. I also did not participate in it. But I understand what it's meant for and why some people need representation. However, there were other people that expressed that they were disturbed by the loud noises and that it triggered them. I said that's tragic, explained why other people needed this, and what they can do when they get their triggers (like remove their selves from the place, practice their calming technics, or find a quieter place as this was a temporary thing). I was told that they shouldn't be doing the event anyway as they don't get how it helps. To which I replied, it's probably not for you then and we can't control what other people want to do and what brings them purpose. I then got called insensitive to people with mental illness and condescending as well as perplexing that I even have a background in psychology. To that I said there is no excuse to manipulate people into conforming to accommodate one person. Making people feel bad for you because of your mental illness to convince them to be on your side is fucked up. ",

      "description": "The title sounds bland but there’s more to this, I promise.\n\nI use discord a lot, and I even own my own server with a little under 100 members but we’re fairly active and enjoy each other’s company. I host ORGS (online reality game shows) over discord, sort of like DND campaigns online. People enjoy them, and even though I’m still fairly new to the hosting scene some people have told me that I’m better than most OG hosts (+5 self esteem points woo).\n\nAnyways, I was hosting an ORG a few days ago. One of my friends who tends to get a little emotional over stuff was making a plan with the other players. There was currently a motive that if someone didn’t die within the next 24 hours (ingame), a random player would be paralysed. In an act of “kindness” my friend decided to sacrifice (suicide ingame) himself. I reminded him in character that he couldn’t come back to life as the players didn’t have access to the spirit book (an item where you can do things like possession, summoning and specifically reviving dead players). He was confident that people would bring him back to life, even though I kept telling him he wouldn’t be able to come back into the game, but he could spectate.\n\nHe dies and then asks if I can revive him. I remind him for the third time it can’t happen. Here’s something I want to mention; The specific item of the “spirit book” isn’t my original creation, it was a suggestion a friend made. He made all the rules for it and I don’t have permission to modify them, and besides I didn’t even want to change them cause I wasn’t going to bend the rules for one person. He comes up to me in DMs and starts questioning my ethic and all that. I don’t want to go into too much detail, but this is what I mean; \n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/427194874027048960/544115804115828746/image0.png\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/427194874027048960/544115792476766209/image0.png\n\n\n",

      "description": "I'm 27M. My brother's 20M, and in college studying comp-sci. I have a financial tech (which I'll be referring to as a 'fintech' company) company. My brother, for whatever reason, wanted to be just like me and decided he was going to be a programmer just like me. Problem is, he has no skill at programming whatsoever. To his credit, he's a hard worker, but he just doesn't *get it*, so to speak. He's probably skilled at some other field, but even with hours of studying, his grades are completely mediocre. \n\nSo anyways, he was looking for summer internships and was convinced he could get an internship at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. He got rejected, and turned to me. I'm not one for nepotism, but I told him to send in his resume, and I'll look over it.\n\nAfter looking it over, he's completely unqualified. His grades are average at best, and he's not involved in any research or clubs related to comp-si. My internship pool is pretty competitive- not Google by any means, but I still get a fair share of really good candidates. And my brother isn't one of them, and I can't justify giving him an internship.\n\nWhen I told him this, he got pissed and called my parents, who also told me to give him the internship. I still refused, and he confronted me with a bunch of angry texts. I texted this back to him:\n\nLook, if you're set on a career in tech, you should get used to rejections like this. You're a hard worker and presumably you have talent in some field. Find that field, and your hard work + talent will help you succeed. \n\nHe texted back:\n\nBut I've found that field already. It's programming.\n\nI texted:\n\nNo. You're just not a programmer. You're not cut out for tech, so if you're intent on the field, prepare to be rejected a lot. \n\nHe got pissed off at this, and he and the rest of my family aren't talking to me.\n\nAita?",

      "description": "My friend (F20) and I (F19) live together with two other roommates in the town that we all study in. My friend, let’s call her Jane, studies the same thing as me at the same school. \n\nWe knew eachother from before we moved in together and because of this, living together luckily hasn’t been a very big issue. We get along most of the time and if we ever argue, it’s because she is very stubborn and never believes she is in the wrong for something or because I get irritated easily (which I’m working on, also kinda why I’m asking if I’m the asshole). \n\nUsually we take the buss together for lectures, but Jane has had her car here resently, and asked me if I wanted a ride. I said yes because I can sleep longer than if I have to ride the buss and I find it more enjoyable. Something also worth noting is that earlier this year, when there weren’t any snow, I had my car with me and I drove us to school together everyday for a short period of time (the reason why I leave my car at home instead of bringing it with me to the town I study, is because it has been winter and we get alot of snow here, and my car is a bit bigger than Janes so it’s more difficult to drive around and park in our neighbourhood). \n\nToday, I woke up so that I would be able to ride with Jane. We talked while we were making food and everything seemed alright. I then brought my food with me to my room to eat there (because I’m really grumpy in the morning, lol) and Jane went to FaceTime with her boyfriend in the livingroom. Half an hour before we usually leave I hear Jane leave the house, while on the phone with her boyfriend, but I thought maybe she was going to buy some food or snacks or something. When I finished eating ten minutes later I get a snap from her which says the she left for school. At this point I have to run to catch the bus, because I wasn’t prepared to have to ride it, and it just put me in a bad mood for the rest of the morning. \n\nNow, AITA for being upset? I know it’s her car and that I’m lucky to ride with her, but I feel like she could have told me in person and while we were making food or something, so that I didn’t have to stress my way to the buss. \n\nSorry if my english is bad, I’m not a native speaker.

      "description": "(Sorry for the format. On mobile)\n\n\n\n\nSo my wife (25) and I (29) have been Married for two years. I'm currently in the military and my wife as the title says, is unemployed. We have no kids, unless you count our cats, and have no plans on getting any. My wife also has really bad anxiety but thanks to military benefits we've been getting her medication to help with that. Anyways, while she's not working, she is working on her art. She said that she wanted to make a game of some sort, such as an RPG or something of the like. And to her credit, her artwork has become more and more amazing. \n\n\n\nBut her artwork has been reflecting more of our DnD characters and other DnD games she's in. And frankly I haven't seen any kind of new concept art for her \"game.\" The house will fall into disarray and she rarely cooks anymore. Plus she's been smoking a lot of pot as of late. Anywhere between 30 to 50 bucks a week. She says that it's to help her eat (self diagnosis) and to help her with art. But she's also been smoking pot before her DnD sessions as well. \n\n\n\nAlso to add more to the pile, this morning I was looking for my keys. And I checked my wife's jacket since she had the car last. And what do I find? A pack of cigarettes. We both quit back in June, and granted to this day we both get cravings. So I know for a fact she's using my money to buy cigarettes now. \n\n\n\nSo basically, all morning I've been wondering if I should confront her about this. And basically demand that she needs to either make one room in the house spotless, or show proof of a job application. She's told me that she's put in a few applications already. But now that I saw the cigarettes, it honestly makes me wonder if she's lying about anything else.\n\n\n\nSorry if it sounds like I'm rambling. But I'm at my waits end. AITA? Also any advice would be much appreciated.",

      "title": "AITA regarding a friend I broke contact with a few weeks ago.",
      "description": "First time posting here, I don't really know why. I feel like I've lost the ability to give myself some sense of closure for this who situation, and there's been a pretty big internal conflict of me telling myself that the person in question is right and I'm a piece of shit and all my friends and peers telling me that no, they're the one in the wrong. This story requires some context, so I don't know how long it'll drag out.\n\nLet's begin with context. Made contact with a girl I met in Intermediate school through a mutual friend near the beginning of this year. Had a crush during the Intermediate years and kind of idly held onto it for the next two and a quarter or so years. Me and this girl, who I'll call Kate, started talking on a daily basis and ended up getting pretty close as friends. I began to see signs of what I interpreted as depression, history of self-harm, extreme stress and anxiety, trouble sleeping, stuff like that. Brought it up with Kate quite frequently, encouraging her to go see the school counsellor (we attended different schools, if at all relevant) or talk to her parents. Refusing to do both of these things (was intent that she was fine, and had pretty serious parent issues, as well as trust issues which made seeing a counsellor/her parents all the more difficult) for a couple of months, I finally convinced her to go see the school counsellor. Went once, on the second to last day of school for that term, then never went again, I'll get back to that later.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, to a few weeks ago, and we've decided to break contact, not in a happy way. Sent me some images that implied she no longer wanted to be my friend. When I asked her what was up, gave me a paragraph about how even if she did have feelings for me (which she says she didn't), she would hate being in a relationship with me because I'd be \"\\[physically and psychologically abusive\\]\" (paraphrasing because I can't remember the exact wording, and how I'd be extremely jealous of any other boys she was around because I'd feel like my position was being threatened. Then proceeded to tell me, and I quote almost perfectly here: \"When you do get a girlfriend, which you will because there are 7 billion people on this planet, I'd feel sorry for her.\"\n\nAfter that whole shebazzle about how I'd be terrible in a relationship, proceeded to tell me that she was absolutely fine regarding the \"depression\" thing, self-harm was just a temporary thing and stress is what kept her motivated and she'd be fine. Then went further to say that actually I had been gaslighting her by telling her that I think there's something wrong with her, that she was \"broken\". Told me that she hadn't gone to the counsellor to get any sort of help for herself, but instead to get me to shut up about asking/telling her to go, because she was evidently sick of it. Few more lines about how all I've done is hurt her, lied to her, manipulated her, etc.\n\nFast forward a week after we've completely stopped talking, sends a poem through a friend. I don't really know why Kate decided to send me a poem, but it was kind of self-pitying and I still can't figure out if it was designed to upset me, make me feel bad, or just as a strange way of saying goodbye? The interesting thing here is that Kate often remarked on how she'd just stop being friends with people, without any real drama, and yet here she is sending me a poem. I just took that as a sign that she'd grown somehow attached to me, which in a way doesn't surprise me as she often described me as her closest/most trusted friend.\n\nAnyways, onto the actual question of this. Am I the Asshole here? Granted, this hasn't given Kate's side of the story, and I'm sure she'd have a lot to say, but I can't read minds (wish I could). I confess I wasn't always the best friend ever, there are certainly times where I can pin \"Asshole\" squarely on myself, but beneath all of the petty and often somewhat unkind things I did/said, I truly did care deeply for her. And I'm not saying that I was a piece of shit 24/7, I was mostly (at least from how I see it) just a normal, supportive, caring friend. It was just little things that evidently stacked up enough to topple her patience with me. I try to justify that I'm in the right by looking at how many hours I spent worrying, even crying over her and her (perceived) issues, but even that seems unfair because that could just be me being melodramatic. I guess what I'm trying to say but not very well is that I always cared extremely deeply for her, and all the telling her to go to the counsellor, or talk to her parents, was done with good intentions and the hopes that she could get the help for what I saw/thought was wrong with her that I wasn't able to provide.\n\nAs I wrote this, it occurs to me that my writing in a way kind of makes me look like an asshole, but maybe that's the truth, I don't really know. I guess that's why I'm here. I'm not going to lie when I say I'm a little bit bitter and upset about the whole thing, but I guess that's just the nature of this kind of shitty situation. Thank you for any input you have.",

      "description": "So I’ve been with this guy on and off again for a while romantically which started off with me actually being an asshole, but then it kinda just flip-flopped with him sexually assaulting me when we were supposed to be just friends and all. He blocked me everywhere after that (long story) and we didn’t really talk much till maybe beginning of November when I found his new Snapchat and we started opening up to each other again. We agreed we were friends again, and I told him not to block me this time and he was fine with that.\n\nWhen talking about his sexual misconduct and all, he refused to apologize because he didn’t feel guilty yet. Then he told me the guilt finally hit him and begged for my forgiveness. I wanted to so badly in the moment, but told him I couldn’t. I know I couldn’t because I was never going to be truly over it and couldn’t have him use my forgiveness against me in the future whenever I bring it up again, and I didn’t know how trustworthy he was. He understood my decision, making it seem like he was going to try a different approach better than simply messaging me a long paragraph, but he never did that.\n\nEventually it seemed like he got colder towards me. Because he told me in his apology that he couldn’t help but hate me because of his guilt, I asked if that was still bothering him. He assured me it wasn’t but continued to appear cold towards me with him sending memes when I was serious, leaving me on opened, and not taking me seriously in general. I changed my view on the acceptance of his apology to “I don’t even want to forgive you now”. He told me “thank you for telling me” and that was that. I also thought I implied I didn’t want to talk, but clearly that didn’t go through since he started messaging me random stuff maybe two days after. That was when I started making snarky comments and admittedly bitchy replies. \n\nHe calls me out on it, saying “bitchy comments like that makes me want to talk to you less”. I told him his recent behavior was why I send bitchy comments. He didn’t understand, I brought up I didn’t want to talk to him a while ago, and started losing it. I tried to keep my calm as he sent messages in all caps. I told him to calm down with the caps while trying to explain, but then he made comments like “Oi nothing to worry about princess” when I asked what was wrong. I told him he wasn’t a good friend anymore, unlike my current friends. \n\nThen it turned into me ranting about my problems I had with him. I thought if I gave more specific examples, he’d be able to address them on if I was wrong or not with my interpretations. Like maybe he wasn’t a dick after all. But instead, he told me to get out of his life and blocked me. Some of those messages included, “you suck”, “you bring out the worst in me”, “I can’t believe I thought I could actually be friends with you”, “you’re stupid for letting yourself deal with this”, “MMMMMM”, “STAY OUT OF MY LIFE”. And no I sent nothing in between those messages to garner the change in texting styles.\n\nBut the reason I think I could be the asshole is because I could’ve handled that better probably.  I feel like I failed as a friend when I told him I was done being nice. I couldn’t maintain the balance of being nice and being stern with him. Then again, he did break his word at times and our last conversation may have been a misunderstanding.",

      "description": " \n\nI worked as a house cleaner for a company. From the start, I felt like my boss took advantage of me. For example, he scheduled me for a small apartment notorious for having dog poop all over. He told me to wear a face mask and vacuum around the dog poop (we are not allowed to clean body fluids). It smelt so disgusting that I gagged when I walked in, with all that poop confined in one space. I sucked it up and did this job for my boss bc it was a new company and I knew he needed any money at this point. I feel like I should have quit after this, but I continued working there. \n\nI begin to break out in severe cystic acne bc of stress. On another job, a customer made fun of it and would not leave me alone while I was trying to clean. She was talking bad about my skin to my co-cleaner in Spanish (I know a little). I left this job bc I started getting really upset. He was sticking up for the customer saying I should have gotten over it. \n\nI was one of his best cleaners. I would often get the job done faster and more efficiently than my coworkers except one. She quit. Leaving me and 2 other cleaners to be the only ones. I told him a week in advance that I was going to take 3 days off bc I was getting burnt out and I really did not want to leave him high and dry like my coworker. I purposely wanted to come back on a Tuesday bc I had a regular house that tipped well and I cleaned her house for the past 10 weeks and she requests me.\n\nMy boss was salty that I was taking these 3 days off. Coming into work, I already felt like I was going to put my 2 weeks in soon. I go in expecting my regular house, but out of spite, he gives me a 6hr new house that usually he would have split between two people bc it really means 8-10 if it is dirty. On top of this, he gave my house to a person who has worked for the company for 2 weeks. I feel like this was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\n\nI go to the house and do a walkthrough of the house and based on how dirty it is it was going to take at least 10 hours to clean, vacuum, and mop. (5bd, 4bath, 1half bath, 2living, kitchen,dining). There is no AC and it was the hottest day of the summer. I begin cleaning the baths but I feel dehydrated and overheated. I clean for a total of 3 hrs. I sit down and try to continue but I am fed up that my boss gave me this house in the first place instead of my regular so I left and did not tell him. \n\nI write down the 3 hours I worked and do not show up to work the next day. I feel bad mostly for the family that had to show up to a house they thought was going to be cleaned. However, I know my boss will send someone else (probably two cleaners) to finish the job. My boss calls me a few times and texts but I don’t pick up. I eventually text him saying that I quit bc I can’t handle the stress of this job and my skin keeps progressively getting worse. ",

      "description": "Hey folks, I’m going to try and tell this as bias free as I can. Important info, we live in BFE so the doctors appointments/PT are at least 45minutes away. It made more sense for them to go to the doctor/physical therapy with me than for me to drive 45 minutes to the appointments, 45 minutes home, and then 45 min to town and then 45 min home. I tried for two days straight to take my fiancé out for Valentine’s Day. I would be paying for the lunch, movie, and gas for the date. The only kicker was that I had physical therapy one day and a doctors appointment at the other so we needed to leave the house before noon both days. Well the first day arrives and fiancé won’t get out of bed and I finally tell them that I guess I’ll just go ahead to physical therapy without them since I would be late and they weren’t even really up yet. I go to the date and come home and we agree that we will go to the movie the next day. Well the next day comes and they get up and are sullen at the doctors appointment because they don’t feel good. They are sullen at lunch because they don’t feel good and I ask if we should cancel are plans.  They pussy foot around it and I explain that if they aren’t going to have a good time I don’t want to go. So we agree to not go and go to Walmart and then home. Am I the asshole for being upset that they couldn’t get it together enough to go on two different dates that they agreed to?",

      "description": "Short backstory: I’m a college student now and have been interested in a friend of mine since about junior year, but she got a boyfriend about a week before I was going to ask her out. I decided I was pretty satisfied with just being friends with her, but it was always kinda difficult to talk about her SO. Fast forward about 2 years and she broke up with the guy for the second time (since the first time was kinda hidden from everyone) and now they’re done. \nI made a New Years resolution to throw out the past and come into 2019 fresh, so I asked her out about 3 months after her breakup completely knowing I’d get rejected. Just wanted a fresh year where I got over old feelings, you know? But let’s just say shes been drifting away from me since then and we don’t really talk as much. I realized whenever we spoke I didn’t feel happy like I used to. Recently my life had kinda been crashing down with family passing and other stressful problems. So over the weekend I decided I wanted to get rid of the avoidable things that are making me sad. Her in particular because I don’t think I can see her through another relationship with how I feel. \n\nI just can’t determine if this is me trying to take control of myself, or I’m on some kinda nice-guy-incel stuff. Basically AITA? \n\nTLDR: Got rejected by girl, but we have been friends and stayed friends. I’ve been feeling like shit for family reasons and want to stop being friends. ",

Me and my sister M used to be pretty close but grew apart after she went to college. While she was away me and my other siblings grew much closer to each other. Fast forward to today me and my other siblings do not get along that well with M. She claims that we don't want her to be part of the family anymore. We try to invite her to stuff but she usually declines. The reason we don't get along with her we'll any more is because we've caught her lying multiple, always have to make things about herself, and can never admit when she's wrong. The four of us are pretty done with her but try to make an effort for our mom and dad who want us to all get along. Now that M's graduation is coming up soon Mom wants to know who is all coming because her school is out of state. At first it seemed that she did not care all that much if we came or not. But now that's changed that the twins won't be able to go because they are part of the school play and have to be there for tech week. S is staying behind to watch the twins because they are still only 14 and he has work. M is now acting upset that they are staying behind and Mom has started to ask me if I'm going. I will be free the weekend of her graduation so I do not have an excuse not to go. I haven't said it to he face yet but I don't want to go. I know this will probably upset her but I don't want to spend my weekend at a school in the middle of no where just to hear a bunch of names get called. ",

We both are nurses, wich doesnt pay very well, atleast in my country. She also studies further in the same field, so i assume that moneys extra tight for her, dunno If she still Works at the same time. We both have new SO's, hers is a fellow student, mine a working person.\n\nOur eldest has autism (kinda relevant). Here goverment pays you monthly for each kid you have to support clothing, hobbies etc. And if you have special needs kid(s) they try and compensate what you approx. lose in wages (evening/nightshifts and weekends etc) This disability benefit covers about half of what i'd earn on working all shifts instead of 7 - 15 like i mostly do now.\n\nUpon separation and divorce we agreed that i'll keep the disability benefit for the eldest to be able to handle kids therapies, doctor appointments and such. Both kids are on daycare thats open only on weekdays due to needing that bit of extra support. The goverment assisted childsupport goes to My ex wife so she can buy the kids all the clothes since shes always been the one who handles that part. That childsupport should be then enough for that purpose alone. It won't pay for high end brand clothes, but good ones nonetheless. The kids live week/week, equally with me and their mothers\n\nNow my ex thinks that i should buy increasing amounts of clothes to my kids becouse she doesnt have time/money. When i pointed out that we agreed on benefits distribution so that i can afford to handle the special needs and she can handle the clothing she got livid. Now she's talking about taking me to court for child support for the clothing money, becouse apparently \"i work so hard and my SO also has a job\"\n\nDont get me wrong, ofc i'll buy clothes for my kids. But i also want to stay on what was agreed.\n\nTL/DR: My ex and i have a verbal agreement considering child benefits and shopping. I want to stick with it, she wants me to handle stuff we previously agreed is her responsibility",

      "description": "This is a throwaway account because I don’t want anyone I know irl finding out \n\nBack story : when I was in grade 4 my dad cheated on my mom, she had enough of his bs and took my sister and I with her and moved to Canada. She tried to divorce him but he’s a very good lawyer with a lot of power where I come from so my mom couldn’t find a single good lawyer for her case. The only one she found was a rookie lawyer who was extremely irresponsible which is why 6 years later she’s still dealing with the segmentation. \n\nSo fast forward to now, I’m in grade 11 and my dad contacted me last year. Ever since he first contacted me I’ve been talking to him and telling him about my life, I even spent a summer with him. I never grew up with a dad so the minute he turned up I was secretly hoping that he would come back and everything even though my mom warned me about him and as much as I despise him for his non existent morals and what he did to my mom, he’s still my father and I uncontrollably want to impress him and build a good relationship with him. \n\nHe gave me a total of 4 credit cards, 11 debit cards and an Asian version of the elite credit card with no limit, countless cash and luxury goods in the span of 1 year since I met him. He showed me a life that I would’ve never lived or even seen if not for him. Starting from last year September, I started giving my mom money, paying for everything, Groceries, clothing, my sister’s therapy and even for the house mortgage (5000/month), my dad asked me in the beginning why I all of a sudden spent such a large amount of money but I just lied to him because I knew he wouldn’t be okay with me spending his money on my mother. At the time I had absolutely no guilt lying to him because he’s counselling fees was a minimum of 800$ an hour and i knew the money I spent was nothing to him, I felt like my mom deserved to get something back from the years she was tortured with him.\n\nBut since February, I keep feeling guilty for lying about it after he told me he was going come to Canada to accompany me through university (I finished all the requirements so I’m graduating in June) and on top of that he wanted me to work I bid firm, I’ve always wanted to be a good lawyer like him and he is literally giving me everything I ever dreamt of. I feel like this one time he is actually trying to be a good dad and try to repair his relationship with me. I don’t want to lie to him and scam him if he is actually trying to be a good person so for the past 2 month I keep feeling like a huge asshole and everything \n\nI don’t know if this is wrong given my situation, so please tell me am I the asshole for scamming and lying to him even though he’s trying to built a good relationship ",

      "description": "My mom's friend is a really nice women that always buys treats for our family whenever they go on vacation and my mom treats their family as if they were part of our family. Their daughter's about the same age as me, in high school.\n\nOne thing to note is that they don't really speak fluent English because they've only lived in Canada for a few months. They originally moved here from Argentina.\n\nAnyway, my mom's friend's daughter got put into a french class because she showed up in the middle of the year and didn't really get to choose her courses. While she can understand English, she has absolutely no clue for French. Feeling bad, my mom suggested that I help her with her homework, which I did for a few months.\n\nEventually, as time went on, the homework got harder and harder (for her), and as that progressed, it went from me explaining to her what to do to me doing all of the work for her. At some point, I snapped out and cut off contact with her, telling her that she was a freeloader and that she didn't care about being my friend and that she only wanted to use me so she wouldn't fail French.\n\nNow, cutting off ties is ridiculous with a family friend. We still see each other every so often when our families decide to have dinner together, but we don't talk. Honestly, being distant feels safer for me, because at least then she won't have the courage to ask me for more help.\n\nLooking back at it, should I feel bad for the way I responded? Does it make me an asshole?",

      "description": "Sorry in advance, this is gonna be a long post. Also on mobile, so it might contain some errors. \n\nSome back story: my brother is the youngest of 7 and he’s spoiled. Like really bad. My parents kinda let him do whatever he wants. They were super strict on all of us, and eventually got easier with each kid, so I feel like they kind of stop the disciplining by the time they got to him. \n\nHe’s currently 20 and an hour away for college. My mom always want him to go home when he’s free or on weekends but he always makes excuses, like I’m busy with school or I have work. If he does go home, he would go hang out with his friends. He’s also quite a  liar. He always uses the excuse for school when he’s really not doing stuff for school. \n\nNow my brother has a spending habit and it’s fueled by my parents! He has a job and should be able to support himself but he doesn’t. Parents give him weekly “gas” money (100 a week I think). He lives with my other two sibling in my parents house that they bought for us. Everyone pays rent but my mom doesn’t make him pay, saying he doesn’t have money (idk where she gets this idea). My sibling that lives with him makes him pay like 100 a month for utilities and most of the time, he can’t even cover it! My siblings are pretty much done with him. They don’t really care to talk to him bc of this. \n\nHe goes out a lot and does college kid stuff, which is fine, but he can never pay his bills. (He doesn’t really have any, just the rent and his phone bill, which is 30 a month). \n\nWell during this time, he gets into some trouble and basically my mom had to put out 2800 to cover this expense. I told him he has to pay for it and he agreed, but my mom wouldn’t allow it. So I told him he will give me the money and I’ll give my mom the money back when he’s done with the payment. I told him he can’t take any vacations until he’s done paying it off, and he agreed. It’s been over a month and he hasn’t mentioned it or attempt to give me anything for it. \n\nFew days ago, he text me and ask if he can go Disney Land for his birthday. I told him I’ll think about it and text him next week. I’m livid bc we talked about this but he still has the audacity to ask me if he can go. I know he’s of adult age but he doesn’t act like one and is very irresponsible. We’ve had so many talks with him about how he needs to grow up and support himself and show some accountability. He tells us he’s sorry and that he’ll change but nothing has change. \n\nI’m torn bc I want to tell him no and that he needs to hold up his deal but at the same time, it’ll be his 21st birthday and I feel bad that he won’t be able to do what he wants. \n\nSo AITA for this? \n\nSorry if I’m babbling!

      "description": "My 71 year old cousin (my grandmothers niece) is living with me an my mom now. Too long of a back story.  I am a minor btw. \n\nI get home from taking Standardized Testing, I was sitting in a cold room for 2 hours, answering stupid questions. \n\nI come home, and I eat dinner that my mom made for me. I put the bowl in the sink. My cousin tells me “You gonna wash it? I am not the maid.” She keeps saying that stupid shit, but she doesn’t even do anything in the house besides watch TV, drink water in my moms room and places the bottle on the floor ( and my mom keeps yelling at her for it), leaves Apple seeds on the counter, and drinks only some of the water from the water bottle, and leaves like 3/4 of the water in it, cooks disgusting food and leaves it in a pot that she won’t even eat, and when someone calls her out on it she makes all these bullshit excuses like: \n\n“my doctor said ‘I can’t do this’ or ‘I can’t do that’ something is always wrong with her, and me and my mom stopped believing it. I am tired, I don’t feel like washing a single dish right now. So once she says, “You gonna wash it, I am not the maid.” I lose it, because she always starts shit with me, and my mom doesn’t do shit about it. \n\nI yell at her, “For one thing you don’t even do anything in the house, besides watch TV, you do nothing! All you do, is expect my mom to drive you everywhere, and expect me to order food for you. And you can’t even wash dishes correctly, you still leave food in THE DISH. You only unload the dishwasher every other month. You give my dog, eleven dog treats that he won’t eat, and leave them on the floor, you don’t make up every single bed in this house, you don’t mop the house. You just sit there and talk on the phone and annoy the mess out of everybody. “\n\nThen she says, “ I CANT CLEAN THE HOUSE BECAUSE MY DOCTOR SAID.. I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MY LEGS.” When she walks around, drives a car, carries heavy ass bags, maybe she do have problems because she does that stupid shit. \n\nShe begins to talk shit under her breath. And I call my mom and ask “does she do anything around the house?” My mom says, “No.” I begin to explain that she started with me again, and she says “I’ll talk to her.” My mom didn’t talk to her, my mom enables her, but my mom got mad when she said some stupid shit the other day and yelled at her for 30 minutes straight. \n\nI know I am not supposed to yell at adults me being a minor, but she is so annoying, and everyone has their limits.

I was having a relatively stressful day and could feel the anger creeping up - but - I always try to keep it under the surface and deal with it later.\n\nI would never be able to win at poker because my face gives away all my emotions and I can be very intense. When I say very intense, I mean very intense.

I am however trying very hard to manage my temper and attenuate my reactions to small things now.\n\nI touched the individual lightly on the arm, made eye contact and said \"I'm sorry if I got in your way.

I'm very sorry.\" I was trying to be polite but I knew my body language and facial expressions were not as friendly as I would have liked.\n\nResponse: \"Oh I didn't say anything.

      "description": "I'm a grade 10 ALP student, and this scenario applies to my Civics/Career course.\n\nAt the beginning of the semester we were given an assignment called \"Call to action proposal\", which was a plan for something we'll do as a group to help the world. (We don't actually have to do anything, but we do have to make a legit and realistic plan for it, but I didn't know that because I arrived at the class a few days late)\n\nSince I arrived late, I didn't get to pick my group and just got randomly assigned to a group that's missing a person.\n\nFast foward a few weeks, because of the high amount of snow days in February, we missed a lot of school and our teacher wanted us to catch up. We didn't pay attention to the schedule and it's 2 days away until we hand in the proposal. \n\nOur group still had no idea what we're doing, the only thing they did is to bring up the government's volunteering page and said \"We're going to volunteer\", but the volunteer takes place in the summer so that's a no-no.\n\nThe day before it was due, one of our group members sent me a short paragraph and said that's his part. And the other group member can't even be contacted although he's playing games on Steam.\n\nThen on the day we're supposed to hand it in, our four part proposal have only had 3 parts poorly completed. So I asked the teacher if we could hand it in that day after school, since we did it online. The teacher said sure, but before 11:59, which was the standard for due dates.\n\nSo I completed the rest after school, with deep thoughts and very specific planning, because I thought we actually had to do it, so I did the planning very specifically with extreme high quality, and put thoughts into every little detail. I turned the one paragraph my classmate sent me into a page of detailed description, did all the work for the other classmate, who got on at this point but didn't do much and was basically having google docs opened but doing other stuff.\n\nI finished our 4 pager, and had to give both of them credit for doing the work as they \"did\" part of it. Also the teacher said that each group member must do one of the 4 parts, so I gave them credit to save our group marks.\n\nFast foward another few weeks, the teacher handed out our results and the plan got an overall rating of 97%. My group showed no appreciation whatsoever and I got cocky. I told them how I did everything for them and got them a 97%.\n\nIn return they told me \"We don't care because we didn't ask you to do it for us\" with a terrible attitude. In return I said \"Yes because if I didn't do it my marks get affected as well and I wasn't gonna let you guys ruin my marks\", but they just told me I was being a prick.\n\nIn Short: I did all the work and got my group a 97%, they didn't show any appreciation and told me I was a prick because I only did it for myself.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I began seeing eachother in the summer. I asserted to him that he was 'just sex' - I didn't want a relationship and would never be anything more. I would only be living in his city for two weeks, too, and made it clear I had no intention of seeing him after that. \n\nExcept I did and I made the six hour drive to see him and spend a week with him about once a month for the next three months. \n\nWe'd made it clear that we were one at a time people - essentially exclusively fucking. I told him that if he were to develop an interest in anybody else, to tell me and break it off.\n\nWe finally admitted it was probably a bit more than sex and we began dating about four/five months in in September/october, and we love eachother despite the difference.\n\nHowever, I recently discovered that during the summer, while I was driving up to see him, he took another girl home after a party and she spent the night. She left hours before I arrived. They didn't have sex in the end but he admits that that was his intention. This was at the end of July.\n\nHe didn't tell me this, despite me asking throughout our relationship if there had been anybody else. He deleted the messages with this girl before I could ever read them but he swears he only sent her one and then ghosted her. \n\nGranted, we weren't together. And I was adamant that he was just a shag at the time which probably didn't make him feel too good about himself. But I was driving the six hour journey to see him...\n\nWhen this came out I also discovered he used to have a sexual relationship with a close friend of his, despite assuring me he had never slept with any of his friends (I have - and he knows exactly who it was and what went down). He assures me nothing has happened with her in the time he's known me, despite keeping this from me. It turns out they've met up a few times, alone and with other friends. Again, he's deleted the messages with this girl so I have no evidence of anything happening but I'm suspicious because the messages have been deleted and he lied about who she was to him.\n\nI am incredibly insecure about all this and have lost a lot of trust in him. It generates many arguments between us. He thinks I should believe there's nothing more than he's told me, and draw a line under it all and live happy ever after. AITA for being unable to do this?",

I told her 'please don't, you don't know what kind of things she has said' but she ignored me.\n\nThe awful girl was super nice around my gf, all the time. It was really weird. After about two weeks of being forced to be around the awful girl i had enough and didn't accept mt gfs invitations if i knew she'd be there.\n\nThat didn't work. I'm ashamed to admit i became really jealous and tried to show my gf what a lair that girl was. She had an excuse for everything on her behalf.\n\nI told my gf that i didn't want her to be friends with that girl. She (understandably) told me that I couldn't decide her friends. She hung around that girl until she moved.\n\nWe broke up shortly after.\n\nAnyway, was I the asshole? I know it happened like 7 months ago but i still wonder.",

      "description": "Well, to be fair, it's a little more complicated than the title implies. So I've been friends with this girl for some 3 years right, and we talk pretty much every day, about pretty much everything. There wasn't much I didn't know about her and vice versa.\n\nAnyways, we're in a group chat with some mutual friends and one of them posts an online quiz sort of test. I thought it was pretty dumb, so I ignored it at first, but she egged me on to take it. Well, it wasn't that long, so I took the online test. She wanted to know my results, so I showed them to her. Then, I asked her what she had gotten on it. She said she kind of wasn't comfortable sharing that info with me. Now, I know I have an issue where I can sometimes be pushy about these sorts of things; I just like to know things. But on this occasion, I caught myself before I could get into it and just went with \"understandable, have a nice day\". Changed the subject and moved on.\n\n Later on in the day, however, the online test got brought up in the group chat. Some of the others in the group chat wanted to know her results, and I expected her to get defensive about it again. Instead, she said, \"I'm not really comfortable sharing that in group chat, but I'll pm you my results\" to the two that were asking. One of them she'd known for maybe 6 months to a year.\n\nNow, rationally I know she's not obligated to tell me anything, and if she felt like spilling her guts to every stranger she met and not me, she'd have every right to, but I still felt pretty upset about it. She sort of sensed I was mad and tried to talk to me about it, but I don't think she got the idea that it wasn't the fact that she wouldn't tell me, it's the fact that she wouldn't tell me, who I thought she was close to, but *would* tell someone else who she didn't know as well. \n\nAm I the asshole for being upset about it?

      "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend to go get me some milk after he drank it all?",
      "description": " Hello. I know this is a pretty mild one compared to the others but who better to ask than reddit.  \nMe and my boyfriend have been sharing food, since we live together for 1,5 year now. We always split the bill in 2 and we usually determine who's gonna shop for groceries by who is going to be near a shop that day. Well.. almost. I am usually the one who makes that effort, which takes time and time is important to me as a student, he usually just deflects that responsibility by \"we don't need anything\" or \"I don't want to go today\".  \nI am also the one who cooks the food and he usually cleans the dishes even though sometimes he complains that it takes longer to clean it.  \nAnyway, we went to a grocery store recently and we usually just split, I buy what I need for cooking and he buys snacks or if I tell him to get something he will. I asked him how much milk should I buy when he hits me with \"I don't want milk\". As I know he loves milk and eats it with cereal/ drinks it with chocolate sugar, I am confused by this but just proceed to buy one carton for myself.  \nThat day I decide to have milk for dinner so I pour myself about 1/5 of the carton and have some cereal with it. The next day he asks me whether he can have some for his chocolate milk, I raise my eyebrows and comment something about him saying he doesn't want and tell him sure. That day was pretty full for me and I only got around coming home around 7pm and after only eating breakfast I was pretty hungry and wanted something quick to eat. So again I decide on milk and cereal. But of course there is no more milk.  \nI go to him ask him where it went he said he drank it, which irritated me cause he did not ask me if he could,I was hungry and he specifically said he doesn't want any, I mildly irritated said \"then you will have to go and buy me some\". We live in a dorm and there is a small shop here where you can buy some groceries and is just 11level away, and buying some milk takes literally max 7 minutes, but of course it's a bit more expensive.  \nHe hits me with \"maybe\" and proceeds to play LoL and ignoring me. I get even more irritated, raise my voice and say \"you better go buy that milk\" and just let him play and wait until he finishes the game.  \nAfter waiting on him for 20 minutes I start calling for him \"Boyfriend, go buy me that milk I am hungry. Hello? Boyfriend? Boyfriend? Hey?\" cause of course he acts like he doesn't hear me now.  \nI throw my bra at him which catches his attention he puts down his speakers and he starts \"maybe if you asked nicely\".  \nWow. Am I in the wrong for getting absolutely pissed off at this? I asked him whether he wants me to plead him to go buy me the milk he drank and said he doesn't want in the first place and after some deflections of his I get very angry and start yelling at him how lazy and selfish he's being. He said something about me always getting angry and never saying \"please\" and that he was \"very close to going but after you acting like a bitch I am not\".  \nI don't think I should be pleading him to go buy me something he took from me. If it was me drinking something of his I would go buy him a new thing without him even asking. Or should I have been nicer?  \nHe always does something like this, that when he is in the wrong and I call him out he turns it around on me and I end up being the bad guy. Last week he wanted me to wear these high heel to go eat out with him, he knows I cannot walk in high heels, he knows my shins hurt when I walk in high heels for a while, he knows the shoes we got from aliexpress are too small for me and he still wanted me to walk in them for at least an hour in Prague(if you ever been to the city center you know what kind of walking areas are there in Prague), raining and cold outside. I told him I won't and that is a bad idea at which he said I promised I would wear them and completely turned the situation on me, despite him wanting me to be uncomfortable in order to get me to wear the shoes he likes (way too much).  \nDo I just have anger problems?

I want to add that i don't care if they eat meat, as long as they don't make stupid comments about what i eat.\n\nLast saturday my mother said that we should go to a restaurant and that my father didn't care which one. I've heard about a great vegetarian one and as i never been at a full veg one I said that we could try this one. When my father heard that, he went full \"how could you force us to not eat meat\", \"i want to be able to eat meat if i want to\" etc...\n\nI was and still is really mad at him because we always eat in restaurant that says \"vegetarians welcome\" but mostly it means they only have one option that doesn't contain meat or fish.\n\nSo am I the asshole for that ?",

      "description": "I (24/M) became friends with someone new to my city a few years ago, for the sake of privacy let's call him John (24/M). We got along great at first. We had a lot of similar interests... we both liked film and comedy stuff, so we started hanging out a lot and things were a lot of fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut about a year or so ago, things started to change. Every time, I hung out with him he was angry at something and all he did was complain. When I would show up at his apartment, he wouldn't even say hello it was straight into \"Ugh, work is so boring... my family is shitty.. my neighbors are annoying. etc etc\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first, I just figured he was dealing with some personal stuff (he had come out to me a couple months before his anger issues became clear to me), but now over a year later, he's just as angry, despite things being better with his family (they are very Catholic and were not very accepting of his lifestyle, but things have improved. they're not perfect... but they're better).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first time I noticed his anger is when he asked me to help him set up a website for his short films. I said okay, and drove over an hour to his place. After 15 minutes of showing him what he would need to set up a website (domain name, hosting provider etc.) he said \"Fuck you, I'm not paying for any of that shit. You're probably getting a commission on this!\" Then he stormed into his living room and started playing Call of Duty. It was really strange. I offered up my time to help him and then he accuses me of trying to get money out of him? And I didn't feel like I had to put up with it, so I left and drove to my GF's place who lived about 15 minutes away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second time I noticed his anger was when he hosted a poker night. It was me, him, one of our mutual friends and a couple friends of mine that he'd never met before. Things were fine at first. I brought a 6-pack of beer for us to drink during the poker game, but after one sip he went \"Ugh! This tastes like shit. You're banned from bringing shit into my apartment. You have the worst fucking taste, I don't know how you guys are drinking this piss.\" Really fucking rude, right?\n\nAnyways, I'm humiliated, not by what he's said to me, but how he's acting in front of my friends that I had invited... But anyways, the game continues. And my god, what a miserable game it was. The whole time he accused us of cheating. He accused me of stacking the deck in my favor, he accused me and my friend of swapping cards mid-game, he freaked out whenever anyone put their hands below the table where he couldn't see them.... and the strange thing was this is how he acts when he's WINNING. \n\nSo the poker night ends. Me and my friends leave and I apologize for my friend being such an asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOccurrences like this started happening more and more often to the point where I didn't really hang out with him much. Maybe once every month to two months. And I would never hang out with him alone because that's when he gets really irritable and angry for some reason (?), I would only hang out with him if another friend was there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut two nights ago he had a board game night. (It was my first time seeing him in about 3 months.) Some of our old work friends were going to be there so I was actually excited. Until I got there and he said, \"Looks like you're the only one coming\". I was pretty irritated, but fuck it - maybe he's gotten better? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe asks about my GF and I tell him that she got a new job working as a Paraeducator. (someone who works alongside a child with special needs in a general ed classroom) I tell him the kid she's been assigned to is so sad. He's high functioning autistic which means he's pretty aware he's different, he'll say things to her like \"Can you not sit next to me today so I can look normal like the other kids?\" and he goes \"Oh I know what that feels like... when I as a kid I got put in a class for kids who the teachers thought needed extra help and I had to beg my mom to get me out of that class.\" When he says this he suddenly makes more sense to me.... my asshole friend is autistic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beginning of the night was pretty fun actually. We went to a bar, had some beers and told me about some new guy he's been dating. (He tells me things are going well and that this guy is from Spain and doesn't speak English that well. Another strange thing about him is that this is the 2nd guy in the past year he's dated who doesn't speak english very well... my theory is that these people stick around because they literally can't understand that he's an asshole.) I go to the bathroom and when I come back he tells me he's paid for our drinks ($10 total) and that one of our work friends is on their way. I offer to pay for my drink, but he says \"No, it's cool! You just wanna get the pizza?\" Sounds fair. I agree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get to the pizza place which is on the way back to his house. He orders it and then when the woman at the counter says the price ($30) he turns to me. \"Uh, we're splitting this... I didn't know you were gonna order a $30 pizza.\" \"YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE AGREED TO THE DEAL THEN! HA!\" I want to punch him in his dumb fucking face, but at this point I've decided fuck it... let it go. He's causing a scene in the pizza place and I don't wanna put up with this shit anymore. I'm never hanging out with this fucker ever again. So I pay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get back to his house and I go to the bathroom again. I come out and I'm not even joking he's eaten an entire half of the pizza while I'm in the bathroom. And when our work friend arrives he offers him a slice from my half... god, I'm getting so angry at this point in the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe start playing Catan. It's going alright, except he constantly accuses us of cheating. Everytime we go to trade resources or build a settlement he has to count our cards and double check everything. It's infuriating. But when it gets to his turn, the cards fly, we can't tell what he's doing and somehow he's built 2 settlements in one turn. It's very suspicious and definitely looks like cheating. Our work friend keeps looking at me and making a weird face. I'm glad to have someone there to be on my side and see this shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we finish the game, he wins, and of course starts gloating. We don't care. Me and our old work friend are talking and catching up... we talk work, movies, etc - then suddenly \"ALRIGHT - You guys look tired, you should probably get going home before it gets too late\" We get up to leave. But we keep talking. We're just standing now and my asshole friend, for this entire conversation is just staring at his phone and sighing, huffing and puffing.  Our work friend says \"Alright, I guess we should take John's obvious hint to leave.\" He denies that he's giving us hints to leave, but We put on our jackets and head out the door anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a deeply unpleasant night. I realized the only reason I've been his friend is out of pity. I'm pretty sure I'm his only friend in the city. But fuck him. He's a mean, self-centered asshole. And I know he lives his life thinking people avoid him because he's gay, but he will never realize it's just because he's a piece of shit. I don't care that he's gay or autistic, the way he treats people is unacceptable and I've decided to never talk to him again. his \"friendship\" is not worth the time or the effort. I shouldn't feel bad about myself or uncomfortable every time I hang out with him. I hope his loneliness drives him out of this city. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, reddit... who's the asshole? Me or him?",

      "title": "AITA I want the bride or maid of honor to compensate me for shoes my friend forgot behind, which the bride agreed to hold on to, but subsequently lost.",
      "description": "I let my friend borrow my shoes for a bridal shower event that happened during Summer 2018. The event was very out of the way, and my friend worked the next day, so she wasn't going to go. She agreed to go bc the bride pleaded for her to go, and the maid of honor agreed to give her a ride back home to facilitate everything. \n\nAt the event, my friend's feet hurt after wearing the shoes, so she changed into slippers and left the shoes in the trunk of the maid of honor's car. The maid of honor scored a Tinder date that same night so she told my friend that she couldn't drive her home anymore. This news was very upsetting for my friend; in the midst of trying to find another ride, she forgot to get the shoes out of the maid of honor's trunk. She asked the bride for advice and the bride just said \"she always does that, just stay!\" My friend ended up paying a bunch for a cab ride home.\n\nAfter that night, she asked the maid of honor for the shoes multiple times in the span of 2 months. She even told them they didn't belong to her and that I was asking for them. The maid of honor got offended that my friend kept asking and claimed she was just busy and stressed. Instead of giving them to my friend, she gave them to the bride. The bride agreed to hold on to them, but when my friend asked her for them the bride couldn't find them. Then all was forgotten.\n\nI told my friend that they are very inconsiderate of her time and ppl's things. I told her I want to ask them for my shoes/a replacement/or compensation for them directly. She tried to talk me out of it because \"they're just shoes\" and because the bride will get mad at her bc since she already asked her. That didn't feel right to me. But I left it alone.\n\nRecently, after the wedding, my friend occasionally complains about the fakeness of the bride. She still hangs out and talks to the bride because theyre still coworkers. I took this as an opportunity to revisit the events of the night the shoes were left in the trunk. My friend offered to pay me for them to \"squash the whole thing\" and refused to talk about it bc \"it's in the past\".\n\nI told my friend I am angry at her and really disappointed. I told her I want them to take responsibility by admitting they were inconsiderate and by finding/compensating for the shoes. I don't want my friend to pay me. That was my original point. \n\nThe more we spoke about it the more I felt she's scared of the bride's reactions. She says there's no need to say those things because she and the bride are just acquaintences. She wants to avoid \"unnecessary drama\" because she knows the bride won't take my perspective lightly. I hate that she'd rather keep non-friends appeased, than to let me rightfully and politely ask for my things or stand up for her and myself. I feel like my friend cares more about the reputation she has with the bride, than her  thoughts and feelings towards her. It also affects me too, and she doesn't care (relatively speaking).\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Little bit of background: My little brother had problems with his bike. [It was this kind of bike](https://static.webshopapp.com/shops/164735/files/126658685/450x450x2/kerri-zwart-fietskrat.jpg). The krate in the front was loose, so my mother (who is one of the most helpful people I know) tried to fix the krate. She was working on the krate in the living room (don't ask, it is common with us) and she was having problems with it. We (me and my sister) were nearby on the couches so we saw she was having trouble, but we didn't act because we were watching YouTube videos on our ipads with headphones. So my mother asked to help her. We didn't hear her. Then she asked again. I can imagine that she was very irritated right now, but then she began screaming in the loudest voice I have ever heard against us to help. At this moment we noticed her and put our headphones away, but I kept my ipad in my hand. When we ask with what we had to help, she just screamed that we should come over to her. I asked her to calm down, but she continued screaming that we should come over to her. She kept screaming and screaming that we should help her and my sister began to cry. I began screaming too, saying that she made my sister cry and that she should stop screaming, but she continued screaming and also began complaining that I still haven't put my IPad away (extra context: I use my Phone and laptop a lot, almost to the point of an addiction). After a half a minute of screaming we finally began helping her. We were argueing over what just happened, but this time with less louder voices. After we were done, me and my sister went straight to our rooms because we were both mad and angry that she screamed at us.  \n  \nSo I am confused. Were we the assholes to not immediately help her? Was she the asshole for screaming at us? Or were we both in the wrong?",

      "description": "My girlfriend [f/26] and I [m/26] have been together 4 years. I'll refer to myself as me, and her as gf. \n\nFor some context: a few hours prior to this gf had a headache and decided to eat a cupcake(stay with me lol). A couple minutes later, she said \"I am definitely addicted to sugar my headache is completely gone\"\n\nNow on to the main story - We were sitting in \"my\" room (home office with my desk, PC, and a squat rack/weight bench)\n\nI was sitting in my computer chair and she was sitting on my weight bench. I was fidgeting my legs (which I do pretty frequently, I'm not exactly sure why but I think it has to do with ADHD in some way because it usually is the worst if I forget my medication or late at night when its aleady worn off.)\n\nGF: stop fidgeting your legs it's annoying me\n\nMe: you stretch out your legs and fidget them when they cramp and I understand it and it doesn't bother me (she sometimes even has me leave the bed so she can stretch out fully, she has bad leg cramps at night or on long drives etc and I'm understanding) how is this effecting you\n\nGF: you're shaking the whole room and you're giving me a headache\n\nMe: (intending to be joking but i guess it missed..) I don't know if it's my legs giving you a headache maybe you need more sugar\n\nAt this point is when she gets mad.\n\nGF: wow that was mean. I was just trying to tell you to stop and you get defensive and be malicious \n\nMe: what i wasnt being malicious I was just trying to say how you fidget and I understand how is that being malicious\n\nGF: it's not the same at all you are just trying to turn it around on me when I bring up something to tell you not to do it you just are trying to tell me something I do wrong so it's okay\n\nAt this point she leaves the room and gets in the shower, I walk out with her -\n\nMe: that's not what I'm trying to do at all I wasnt being malicious I was just trying to say I understand when you fidget why cant you understand when I do\n\nGF: no that's not the same at all I do it because my legs hurt you just do it because of habit or fidgeting or anxiety or something\n\nMe: are you fucking serious so just because  it doesn't make you feel better I'm just doing it for no reason?\n\nAt this point I leave the room and go back to my room. When she gets out of the shower she comes and talks to me \n\nGF: I dont like that I tell you something and open up to you and you just throw it in my face to be mean and try to hurt me.\n\nMe: what? I wasnt trying to hurt you at all. I wasnt being malicious I was just trying to point out that you fidget your legs too and I understand so I don't get why its such a big problem I do.\n\nGF: no about the sugar you just threw that in my face to hurt me\n\nMe: i was just joking about the sugar because of what you said earlier I wasnt trying to hurt you it was just a joke but I'm sorry I promise that wasnt my intention to try and hurt you with that it was just a joke.\n\nGF: no it wasnt just a joke you were mad at me for criticizing you and you got defensive and were malicious to try and hurt me\n\nMe: no, I was not being malicious and you are not going to get me to say I was. I take responsibility for making a joke at the wrong time but you have to take some responsibility and accept it was just a joke and not malicious\n\nGF: no you were being malicious and trying to hurt me why else would you say that you weren't joking I saw your smirk when you said it you were trying to hurt me\n\nMe: yeah that smirk was me thinking I was telling a stupid fucking joke I'll apologize for what I did do and that's tell a badly timed joke but I'm not going to apologize for being malicious because I'm telling you I wasnt being malicious I just made a bad joke\n\nGF: and I'm telling you that you were being malicious you weren't just joking you were being mean\n\nMe: are you seriously trying to tell me how I meant something I wasn't being fucking malicious I'm not a fucking bad person I'm not naturally mean so stop fucking projecting that on to me like I am (shes said multiple times in the past that she believes people are inherently mean and have to try to be nice. I dont believe this personally and I've told her that whenever it comes up, usually in the aftermath of something like this where she gets her feelings hurt(whether it be by me or someone at work) and I talk with her through it)\n\nThis I'm not being malicious yes you are loop repeats a few times until she tells me to leave her alone, and this brings us to the current, me typing this in the parking lot of mcdonalds.\n\nI really don't understand how the fuck this got to this. Was I a huge malicious asshole?   I feel like this happens a lot where she takes something I say in literally the worst possible way and it ends in a fight that ends up wasting the rest of our night. I dont know if I'm the asshole here and would like opinions. \n\nSorry for the length.",

Original plan was to commute but taking into account the cost and comfort of travel, we decided to take our car. We were planning the itinerary when we started discussing about buying an inflatable car bed and somehow it turned into a debate wether to bring the carseat or not which is a no-brainer IMO. \n     As far as i know, it's not illegal in our country(philippines) to have your child seated at the back with only a seatbelt on. She says she can't sleep in the backseat if we were to use the carseat. I argued that she would take our daughter's safety for granted and trade it for a nap. Argument goes on a while and I told her it's either our daughter seats on a carseat during the trip or no trip at all. AITA?\n\nEmphasis that here in the Phil., we are no bound by law to use a carseat and it is not what we people are not generally accustomed to, though it is frowned upon by some.",

      "description": "This happened a while ago and I’ve honestly moved on, but I was recently made aware that the woman in question has not, so I’d like to ask.\n\nI took a girl to homecoming my freshman year of high school, let’s call her Nancy.  There had been some weird, maybe sexual but probably just teen awkward dynamic between us for at least three grades prior, so after giving her a smooch at homecoming I asked her out a week later.  We were fine for about three months after this.\n\nEventually I noticed some cuts all along her wrists going vertically and I asked.  She initially said they were from her rabbits (she’s an odd mix of computer nerd and farm girl) and I accepted that because I was dumb and didn’t want to confront it.\n\nLater on a date at her house, and I forget exactly what circumstances led to this, but I found a notebook in which she had written about how I was her only reason for living and how if not for me she would’ve killed herself, how she wanted to bear my children, etc.  I was obviously spooked.\n\nNow it was April and we had a band trip to a big theme park for about a week coming up.  Nancy and I were in the same chaperone group.  I asked my mom about what to do and she basically told me that Nancy needed some space to calm down and not worship me, but it was up to me to tell her before or after the trip.  Instead of going with before and making the entire week awkward for all 10 people in our group, I decided to play nice and tell her afterwards.\n\nWhich I did, except she was desperate to hold my hand and do as much rubbing on me as was concealable in public.  Her friend kept telling me to kiss Nancy more because she wanted me to and basically forcing us together all trip.  Whatever, I enjoyed myself and I intentionally didn’t let up that anything was wrong.\n\nSo on the bus trip home (18+ hours on coaches) we ended up in a pictochat (classy, I know).  She told me to join a private room and then basically told me she loved me, something I had yet to say to her for obvious reasons.  I immediately pretended as hard as I could that she did not exist to avoid making anything worse.\n\nOnce we were home I typed up an email (and if using email makes me the asshole I’ll accept that) saying that I didn’t want to stop being friends, but that she needed a kind of help I couldn’t provide and that we oughtta take a nice long break from the romance.  She responded saying she wanted no more to do with me and apparently got a counselor, so I was fine with her decision.\n\nShe then either ignored me or pulled a bunch of petty stuff on me for the next three years (and then going to the same college as me) which is really another story entirely and irrelevant for now.  AITA for leaving her?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to include another department in my shift's food day?",
      "description": "My coworker (A) and I decided to sponsor a salad day.  At first, A only wanted to include 1st shift (our shift) but I said that we should include 2nd shift as well, since some of them are also participating in our Biggest Loser challenge.  I said it would be a great way to bring everyone together, and since the two of us were helping it wouldn’t be as hard to keep track of everyone.\n\nA agreed and we made lots of flyers that explained the cost ($4.00) and the times we’d have the salad bar open (11am-2pm.)   These things were clearly stated and in addition everyone that participated was emailed a copy of the flyer.\n\nWe set everything up and left it out until just after 3pm, essentially giving everyone an extra hour to get a plate.  Announcements were made throughout all departments around 11am to say it was open, and at 1pm to say if you wanted seconds you were free to go around again.  (At this point ALL departments involved had already arrived and had been at their desks for at least 1 hour.)  At 4pm, coworker “J” emailed me asking if she and 3 other people were able to get salads.  Turns out, those 4 people hadn’t gotten even 1 salad.  I told her the leftovers were in the fridge if she wanted to help herself.  Cue attitude, complaining that if they had known they weren’t going to have salads at that time, they wouldn’t have participated.\n\nApparently sometime last night, someone went into the fridge, took lettuce, and didn’t properly wrap it back up so it all went bad.  We had to throw away an entire tray of lettuce.  My manager found out about the lettuce, went to all of the departments, and said there were leftovers but no lettuce b/c it wasn’t properly wrapped up overnight.  That was it, no accusations, nobody was singled out.  (It could have been anyone; we have had issues in the past about random people going to the fridge and taking food that wasn’t theirs.)  Manager said everyone was now welcome to get some of what else was left.\n\nJ emails me saying that it wasn’t her that didn’t wrap up the lettuce incorrectly and that she “just wanted to make that clear.”  I’m honestly clueless b/c I had no idea what even happened about the lettuce going bad overnight.  I forwarded my manager the email and said that I no longer wanted to help run anything like this again unless her department is no longer included; making this event a 1st shift only thing.  (Before you ask, this is not against the rules so long as the company does not give us any money toward it.)  Manager proceeds to give me the biggest guilt trip ever, saying that is not right, etc.  I did not respond to J at all.\n\nSo, AITA for apparently not holding everyone’s hand and making sure they all got a salad between the specified hours?  AITA for wanting to make this a 1st shift only thing going forward?  (And would I *be* an asshole for telling 2nd shift they were not invited to next month’s salad day due to unforeseen issues this month?)",

My dad isn't helping much at all in terms of money.\n\nMy mom is a great mom and has always been there for me but we still argue sometimes.\n\nI have no friends at school. I've never had a \nhobby.\n\nToday I asked my mom if I could get into some basic flipping over the summer as a hobby. I don't mean serious flipping, I'm not a professional and serious flippers have to dedicate a lot of time to it. I mean more like drive by the thrift shop, find something, sell it on ebay for a higher price, that's it. I don't expect to get rich quick or anything. I told her this.\n\nShe said no because I won't have time and no one can drive me.\n\nI asked if I found someone to drive me would I be allowed. She still said no.\n\nI got mad and told her that doesn't make sense and then she got mad and started going off on me about how I'm ungrateful and she can't believe I would even ask her this right now.\n\nThen my sister came out and told us to stop arguing. I was sent to my room to chill out.\n\nIf you have any advice I'd appreciate it.",

He agreed and everything was good until today, our fist session, when suddenly he wasn’t okay with it anymore and resented me for being controlling.\n\nHe asked well what if the guys want to hang out after? And I was against this saying 3hours every week is enough time, I was frustrated because we already agreed about this yesterday. He said well you don’t have to be there and I said I’d feel awkward if they hung out after and I had to go hide in the bedroom until they left, and make awkward uncomfortable speed runs to the kitchen to avoid talking (in order to get alone time). He said he’s frustrated that he doesn’t get to hang out with his friends because I have a hard time being alone, which I got really upset about, I feel that’s very untrue. Now he’s saying I’m being selfish, and having a double standard because I ask him to say a quick hi when my friends come over to be friendly, note - this happened once, I didn’t ask him to hang out with my friends when they come over, and this was something he said he was uncomfortable with.\n\nSo am I the asshole for keeping him from hanging out his friends because I want as much time as I can get to relax freely in the weekends?",

      "description": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is about I guy who’s been my counselor at a summer music camp for two years now (I’m in high school). He also helps coach band kids during the school year sometimes. I’ve always considered him super friendly and cool, just seemed kind of day-dreamy and mellow occasionally. The other counselors sometimes joked that he was high all the time.\n\nOne night I decided to google him to see if there were any videos of him playing trombone in a concert. To my shock, the first results that popped up detailed a hit-and-run incident that resulted in one death and a conviction.\n\nThe details are pretty horrifying, so I won’t go too much into them: according to witnesses, he hit an elderly man crossing the street, didn’t stop or even slow down, and was later arrested after hitting a tree seemingly in an attempt to cover up the dent mark. Apparently he was intoxicated when this happened.\n\nIt’s taken me a while to process this. We got pretty close this past summer, playing card games and joking around during camp. He’s been nothing but incredibly kind to everyone around him, so seeing his smiling mugshot right after such an awful incident was just painful. I know I’ll run into him sometime in the future, either at school or at the local music store, and I don’t know exactly how I’d react to seeing him again.\n\nOn one hand, I think this is a very serious crime made much worse by him trying to cover up his actions instead of calling an ambulance or the police. It was a severe blow to the level of respect I had for him. \n\nOn the other, he’s already gone through the court system and whatever legal reprimand he received. And he hasn’t done anything to me personally- it’s not like he hit one of my relatives with his car.\n\nI don’t want to make him trying to fix his life any harder than it already is. But I also think this crime shows a huge character flaw and I think I would be a little afraid to be around him. WIBTA for acting distant or just cordial if/when I see him again? \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for being annoyed when my mother tried to buy my friend's present for me?",
      "description": "I know I'm probably sounding a bit ungrateful right now. Being annoyed that someone tried to do something for me. But please let me explain. This happened this last Christmas, but it's been bugging me a bit so I feel I have to ask.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was out shopping with my mother, both of us trying to get some Christmas shopping done. We'd spent most of the day looking through stuff together, but then we split up for a short while. We were in a big shopping center, and both of us wanted to take a look in different stores. So we split up for a bit. When we met up again, she began showing me some of the things she had bought.\n\nAnd then she handed me something, telling me that I no longer had to worry about buying a present for a friend of mine. I was confused at first. But then she explained that she saw this thing, and thought it was something my friend would like. So she bought it, telling me to give it to him for Christmas. Marked as being from me. She bought my Christmas gift to my friend, for me. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI wasn't too thrilled about this. Partly because I put a lot of thought into the gifts I buy, and it felt weird that I didn't pick this one out myself. But mostly, because it felt...wrong? A gift is something you give to someone to show you care. That's the whole point of Christmas. You have someone close to you, so you give them something to show you appreciate them. I just felt that giving my friend a gift that *my mother* bought was a bit...insincere. It wouldn't have been from me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNot only that, but I am a grown adult. I understand that a mother bear still feels the need to mother, even when the cubs are all grown up. But I'm capable of picking out and paying for gifts myself. I wasn't shopping with her that day because I *needed* to, but because I *wanted* to. It was meant to be a fun shopping trip to spend time together and stuff. I didn't in any way expect her to buy anything for me. And it seems a little weird at my age to be handing out Christmas presents that my mother picked out. Especially since it was for one of my friends, not a family member or anything. Plus, I enjoy the gift-shopping process. It makes me happy when I find something I just know will make someone else happy. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd to add to that, we were both in the same building at the time. Different stores, yes. But both stores are located in the same main building. We weren't that far from each other, and it wasn't anywhere near close to closing time. Plus, we both had our phones with us. She made no attempt to call, text, or even just come find me before just going ahead and buying it. Didn't run it buy me, or ask if she should get it. No communication whatsoever.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo taking all of the above into account, I was slightly annoyed  when she handed me this thing. Not angry or anything. Just mildly irritated. But I wasn't going to say anything at first. I said thanks, even. And was just gonna roll with it, because I knew she was just trying to be helpful. But it must have shown on my face that I wasn't all that enthusiastic about it, because she asked what was wrong. I didn't want to go into detail on every reason I didn't like it, though. I didn't want an argument, so I just tried to casually say something along the lines of \"oh, I was just hoping to pick something out myself, that's all. But this is fine! I think he'll like it\". \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut she wouldn't drop it. She asked why I wanted to pick it out myself. I was treading carefully at this point. I love my mother, but she has a heck of a temper. I could sense she was getting annoyed, and I just wanted to let it go. But she kept asking *why* I wasn't happy she'd done that. I was trying to word my responses carefully, but made the mistake of saying it was the \"principle\" of it. He's my friend, so I should buy his present. And. She. *Exploded.* \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat set her off yelling at me. \" *Principle?!* What principle? There's no *principle* about it! Does it matter who bought it? He won't know you didn't pick it!\" Yelling all sorts of things about how I was ungrateful, and should just have accepted the help. And I get where she's coming from. She was only trying to help. I get it, and I am grateful that she does try and help me. But I feel that this particular occasion, she overstepped a little. I was right there in the same building. It wouldn't have been hard to ask me first.\n\nAnd also I was only mildly irritated, at best. I feel she overreacted by yelling like that when I tried to explain why I felt that way. Not to mention, I didn't even say anything until she asked. But at the same time, she was just trying to help. And now I feel like I'm in the wrong for not appreciating it as much as I should. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis incident ruined what was a perfectly good outing at first, but we're both over it by now. She ended up keeping the gift and giving it to someone she knew, while I got to pick out a new gift myself. We've all moved on. But it still bugs me sometimes. So what do you guys think? Am I right to be annoyed she did that without asking me? Or am I just ungrateful for not appreciating the help? AITA here?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL:DR-- My mother bought something for me to give to my friend as a Christmas present from myself (without asking me first). She then got angry that I would rather pick something out myself.",

People tend to be more understanding now, I guess the fact we are adults and I have explained makes it easier. \n\nI'm (27f) a terrible eater, always have been, over the years I came up with tactics to not be a dick about things e.g. if someone else's food smell (like fish) bothered mein the office, make a coffee and if it caused me to feel sick hold the coffee under my nose and sip slowly.\n\nI have told friends not to invite me over to dinner because I know I am a nightmare. I've seen a lot of posts here about picky eaters. I just hope that by saying to people its probably easier they don't cater for me I'm not the AH. Its hard because I'm in a relationship with someone, but I warned him I was like this and have tried to be fairer (still pretty bad)\n\nSo just want some thoughts on this.\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "  \n\nMy girlfriend and I regularly visit her parents, and whenever we do, she insists we play a particular card game popular in their retirement community. The specifics are unimportant, but know the game takes about 3 hours to play and is very much based on luck.\n\nAnyway, for whatever reason that I cannot explain, I get absolutely livid playing this game. I’m a very calm person who generally doesn’t mind losing, but there is something unexplainable about this game that makes my blood boil. Maybe it’s because I feel like it’s mostly just luck so the odds should favor everyone at one time or another, and yet I am on a losing streak that goes back several months.\n\nI have tried very sensible things to counter my frustration while playing, including deep breathing and doodling calming pictures on the scorepad, such as flowers or animals. And yet, each and every time something triggers me and I get furious.\n\nThe thing is my girlfriend INSISTS on playing every time even though I have trouble dealing with the game. Her parents are just thrilled to spend time with us and couldn’t care less what game we play while we’re there. Yet my girlfriend likes to use the excuse that we must play because they want to.\n\nAITA for 1) getting so upset over a game and 2) for thinking my girlfriend should compromise and not expect me to play this game every single time we visit her parents? I love her parents like they’re my own and I get along famously with them. But then I get embarrassed when I get frustrated over this game which ends up ruining the whole visit.",

      "description": "Background: I'm a guy in 3rd year of college, met Annie since freshman year since our hometowns were very close to each other. She's had a boyfriend all 3 years and I never once hit on Annie. Over the past 2 years Annie complained to me and our other mutual guy friend in our group chat about some of her BF Jonathan's flaws. I shared one mutual class with Jonathan but we've definitely never been very close. \n\nA few weeks earlier, I had a dinner party for my 21st birthday, and invited most of my friends (over 10 people), including Annie. Originally Annie asked me if Jonathan could come too, and I said no, because if I make an exception for a +1 for her, then everyone would bring a +1 and I didn't want the dinner to be too big. So Annie said that she wouldn't be coming then, and then me and my other guy friend basically called her out for ditching something that was planned far in advance (I made a FB private event 3 weeks before the actual dinner). 2 hours before the actual dinner she said she was coming and I thought that was the end of that. She verbally said she would spot the Uber/Lyft to make up for the inconvenience (bill was about $15 dollars)\n\nAfter that incident we didn't really talk too much, but a few days ago I saw Annie and Jonathan on the street for the first time in a while and I smiled and said hello. They made eye contact with me and as if they rehearsed it they split up and walked around me from both sides. I was PISSED. The day after that incident Annie messaged me and was like \"Sorry I was studying for a test how are you??\", but I ignored that and just said \"We're still friends but it's probably better that we talk less since this semester is busy for both of us\". We said some more small talk but she never referred to when she ignored me on the street or apologized for her behavior. \n\nYesterday she asked me if I can pay her back for the Uber/Lyft, and I told her no since she said at the time that she would spot everyone. She said that she never said that and then some passive aggressive shit like \"If you want to lose a friend over $15 then this is over\". So I just ghosted her after that basically - am I in the asshole in this situation?",

I have a Fiat Fiorino so I had pretty much everything on it, save for a few items that were in another car. G and another friend travelled by bike. G had to take a spare helmet, a big \"bowl\" to cook at night and one of the tents. \n\nAt the end of the trip, it dawned on me that G had no way to take his items back. The rest had to be dropped off at their house so everything was on the other car, except G's items and a few others which are irrelevant.\n\nSo he asks me that if I could do him a favor and drive to his house whenever I was free to deliver the items. I said I don't know, we'll see. His car isn't available but he did admit he could swing by with his company car. And I mean, I feel like I already did my part by using the truck to carry the luggage around. Nobody paid even a cent of the cost (gas) which I was fine with until this happened.\n\nHere's the thing, he doesn't live very far. Must be like a 20-25 minute drive. This was 3 days ago and I still haven't gone hoping that he can just pass by. We didn't fight over it or anything, I just feel like I'm being a bit of a dick. AITA? ",

      "description": "I (16 year old guy) own a Nintendo Switch and recently bought the new Smash Bros game. My older cousin (24-26 year old guy) lives with me and my sisters in my mother’s house and does not own a Nintendo Switch. When I bought the new Smash Bros game I played it with my cousin a few times because I knew he liked Smash Bros and I used to play Smash Bros Melee with him whenever I went to his house when I was young. \n\nRecently my cousin has been inviting his friends over to hang out and play Smash Bros on my Switch. I first found out when I went downstairs to the kitchen to get some food when I heard him playing Smash Bros on my Switch with his friends in the living room. He never asked for permission to play with my Switch, but I brushed it off because I was busy doing homework at the time and just went down to the kitchen for a snack. This happened again a few times and now he invites his friends to come over once or twice a week and they play on my Nintendo Switch. I never really minded it, but recently when I was playing on my Nintendo Switch I noticed that one of my controllers was acting weird. I found out that one of the joysticks got a bit messed up and realized it was probably from when my cousin’s friends were using it. I also sometimes want to play on my Nintendo Switch but find my cousin and his friends using it so I play games on my computer instead even though I wanted to play a game on my Nintendo Switch. I tried bringing my Nintendo Switch up to my room instead of leaving it in the living room, but when his friends come over he comes to my room and asks if he can use it. I say yes when he asks because I am not using it whenever he asks and would feel guilty if I didn’t let him use it. I also don’t like being mean and don’t really like confrontation and would rather not hear “Why” if I say no. \n\nMy cousin is a kinda nice guy. He has bought me lunch/dinner a few times after, but we don’t interact much because his room is in the basement while mine is upstairs. Whenever I am out of my room he is usually out of the house working or doing something.  \n\nI feel like I would be a dick if I stopped letting him use it, but I own that system and bought it with my own money. Why should I have to stand aside like a little bitch whenever he wants to play on it with his friends? He hasn’t even offered to let me join while he plays with his friends. Meanwhile I let him join while I was playing Mario Kart online with a friend just yesterday. I had to play split screen so this fuck could get 8th place. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I told him that he can’t use my Nintendo Switch anymore?\n\n",

      "description": "As soon as a coworker or a friend asks to hang out, I start to frantically search my mind for any excuse not to. And when I do have plans it just feels like a chore or another task to complete for the day. I'm not anti-social or anything, I have a social life and I do know how to socialize but I just hate it. I'm completely fine with just hanging out once a week because I just prefer to be doing my own thing at home. \n\nI know it's weird and I can't really explain it but I just lose interest in people so quickly. Like I could meet someone and we'd get along well and I'd be genuinely interested in this person and think \"okay this is it, I found someone that I actually enjoy being around\" but then give it a month or two (sometimes less) and my interest just disappears out of nowhere. I feel like at this point I should just stop making friends or trying to talk to people if eventually I'm going to lose interest in them. \n\nAnd here is the part that makes me question my morality:\n\nDuring the time that I have college classes going on and stuff, I'm completely fine being on my own for months because I get to interact with people almost daily. This also applies to work. But then one time during the summer when I wasn't taking any classes and after about a month after I quit my old job and all my then friends were on vacation I started to feel a bit lonely. It almost felt like the loneliness was almost eating me up or whatever and it was so bad that I didn't even want to exist. I felt like I was going crazy.\n\nSo I then realized that okay, maybe I do need to be around people BUT I just don't want a close relationship with anyone. I just want to have acquaintances. The thing with acquaintances though is that they eventually become friendships and then I have to sorta push them away slowly. I try to do this without hurting their feelings but come on, that obviously doesn't work.\n\nI know one thing for sure that I will NEVER do is this: I won't EVER get into any sort of romantic relationship because I KNOW that it would be wrong to put someone through that. Like, I've had guys hit on me and approach me in public many times and sometimes I'd be interested and stuff too but I immediately shut them down because I know that the interest will eventually go away. Most of my current friends have boyfriends and they always ask me why I'm not in a relationship but I can't tell them any of this for obvious reasons so I just say I'm not looking for one. People tend to think I'm stuck up for this.\n\nSo I refrain from having romantic relationships but I still have friendships and I pretend to be interested in those people because I don't want to be alone. \n\nIs this wrong?\n\n(don't know if this is important but I feel like some people are gonna bring up age and say that \"it's normal to become less interested in socializing/partying as you age\" but I'm 18. I know this isn't normal lol)\n\ntldr: I befriend people and push them away after about 2 months because I don't want to let them get too close to me. I genuinely don't think I'm hurting them as much if they haven't known me for a long time but that isn't always the case because people still get hurt. I do this A LOT. Like A LOT A LOT.",

He helped me out when I needed it and I helped him when he needed help in life and we really got along super super well. After many years of being super close friends and hanging out a lot we kinda stopped talking for maybe 4-5 months just because we were really busy in life. Recently he tried to start talking to me again and I thought it was awesome that we were connecting again. After having a small conversion I found out that he was selling drugs now which is very weird. He was always somewhat of an entrepreneur but never could I imagine him selling drugs? I’m not sure what specially he was selling, I doubt it was anything extreme maybe just weed or something but it still really bothered me. So I blocked him from all forms of communication. After thinking about it for a tad it really just seems that ditched him. I’m not sure if what I did was too extreme or maybe it was warranted hopefully I can find some guidance here. ",

      "description": "I live with a housemate and her boyfriend. Their bedroom has an ensuite, \"my\" bathroom is the main bathroom in the house which is used by myself and guests, and probably by my housemates. \n\nWhen I first moved in, I was at home a lot more and so always made sure that I had spare rolls of toilet paper in the bathroom. The last 6 months or so though I spend 3-5 nights a week at my boyfriend's house, plus work from 12 til 9 most days so I am rarely at the house. I'm there so little that my boyfriend and I jokingly refer to it as \"the storage shed\". \n\nOne week I noticed that the four pack of toilet paper I had bought last time I was home was empty, even though the only roll I had used personally was the first roll in the pack. After this I made the decision not to replace the toilet paper anymore. My housemate has since been replacing the paper in the main bathroom with her own. I know toilet paper isn't super expensive and I feel a bit petty at my behaviour, which is what prompted the post here.\n\nSo, am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So I haven't actually done anything yet, but I'm seriously considering it, and just wanna know if this would make me the asshole.\n\nI have this teacher (he teaches geography) and he is an absolute terrible teacher, and also kind of an asshole. However, he has a big passion for his job and I know he loves teaching.\n\nSome backstory on why he is an asshole:\n\nHe has on multiple occassions insulted my choice to take a gap year after high school, by saying it's not a valid choice, it's postponing my life, bla bla.\n\nHe has also sent me out of class for not bringing my books with me to class, when we never ever use the books, and then putting me in the hallway and telling me I 'need to stand here and rethink my attitude' like I'm some 5 year old.\n\nHe also thinks that just because we're smart kids, we're better than everyone else and regularly tells us we're the 1 percent of society and we should use that to our advantage. \n\nHe is also a terrible teacher. Geography is relatively easy and I get good grades because I study hard, but his classes contribute 0 to that. He explains what's in the book for the entire duration of the class, which is either 50 or 100 minutes, then continues to dwell on things we already know or things that don't relate to the subject whatsoever. No one actually pays attention in his class, because it's absolutely useless. \n\nSo I've been playing with the idea of reporting him to my dean for a while, because it's our final year in high school and we really need a good teacher. Before, it was kinda funny how terrible he was, but now it's really not anymore. However, I know he has a lot of passion for his job and teaching and geography, and I don't know what will happen if I report him, but I know he will be super hurt if he finds out. AITA if I report him?\n",

      "description": "To preface: I took a job I didn't look too far into because my then-current job was worsening my depression and I couldn't find a job. I realize how many red flags come up - I knew I needed to get out ASAP, but was not able to find another job, and had bills to pay. I only stayed for as long as I had to.\n\nBACKSTORY: The company is owned by an ex-con, and his brother. Both are good 'ol boy racists. They would constantly use the N-word (hard R) at the office, and made fun of me when I told them it made me uncomfortable (I am a progressive white person), plus other racist stuff I'll add below. In addition to this, they ran their company using pretty shady practices.\n\nBasically, they asked me to go out and canvas, tell them they had a bad roof even if they didn't, and convince them that they needed an inspection. The owner would come out and create \"non-repairable\" damage to the roof. He would then go to the homeowner, tell them they needed a new roof and that the their insurance would pay for it. I would get 20% for anyone who signed a contract.  \n\nGranted - this shady practice is actually super common in the roofing industry, but he sells his company as supposedly high-end and above reproach, and would specifically say to home owners that his company was not one that did this.  (HE WOULD  INSENSITIVIZE PEOPLE TO LEAVE 5-STAR REVIEWS)\n\nThat job then evolved into them basically asking me to pyramid scheme the whole thing and hire people (RF) ,and he told me \"Absolutely under no circumstances can I hire a black person.\"\n\nHOW I GOT SCREWED: About 6 months ago, I got a call from the owner's wife. She said that he had been sent back to jail. Although the brother said that business would continue as usual, I knew that with him gone I would be the one having to complete these shady things - or at least I was expected to. I knew I wasn't willing to do that, so I stopped getting new contracts. Well, the owner got out of jail about 3 months later and was pissed that I had not continued work. At this point I am still owed OVER $5K for past contracts that got dragged out. I continuously asked the brother when I would be paid  and he'd just assure me it would be soon. After I texted the owner (now that I knew he was out of jail), I got two belligerent voicemails, telling me that because I did not continue my work, he would not be paying me.\n\nI know I could possibly sue, but I'm worried about getting buried in legal fees. \n\nWIBTA If I retaliate by leaving bad reviews everywhere he is rated, thus ruining his perfect 5-star ratings, and exposing him and his company just as Roofing Season getting started?\n\nTl;dr I unwittingly took a shady job working for a racist, and after he went to jail and I stopped taking new contracts, he has refused to pay me the over $5k he still owes me for my previous work. WIBTA if I leave him bad reviews exposing him and his company, ruining his perfect 5-star rating?",

      "description": "So, my great grandma just died at the age of 104. My mom was adopted and we didn't meet anyone from that family until I was eight years old. (Currently 28F.) So we've never been as close with them as we are with other branches of our family. \n\nMy mom is an impressive woman. She used her skills with the piano to win pageants and pay her way through school to become a doctor. She fostered a love of music and performance in my sister and in me. We did community theater together my entire childhood. Weirdly enough though, she never played the piano to sing with us during my childhood, nor has she done so in my adult life. \n\nShe and my sister are natural talents. Music comes so easily for them. I've always been a little ashamed that despite my years of theater and choir, I've never been able to read music. So when I finally decided to learn an instrument (guitar and more recently ukulele), I really had to fight tooth and nail to get good. As a result, I really only play music with my two best friends: my sister and her husband. My brother in law is just now learning guitar, so we like to play together. And my sister, BIL, and I love to sing. But they don't live nearby so we have to just take the chances we can get. And I kind of like for our music to be just for us, you know? \n\nThe last few times that I've gotten to see them, my mom's been there too. And we try to play and sing when we have privacy, but I always end up looking around and seeing my mom covertly filming. It makes me super uncomfortable. I've asked her to stop and she acts like I'm being selfish. \n\nSo with the death of my great grandmother, my mother kind of ambushed me the other day saying, \"Hey I was hoping you'd learn these songs on ukulele for the funeral.\" I told her that I wasn't sure, both because of the ukulele being my weaker instrument and my lack of familiarity with the family. She just said, \"well your sister's already agreed to it.\" Which she kind of did but super begrudgingly. \n\nAnd this is honestly only a small percentage of my issue, but I've been an atheist for more than a decade and my great grandma was a super devout christian. All of the songs are old spirituals from the early 20th century. And my involvement, especially given my lack of connection with the family feels... disingenuous? \n\nI honestly don't know. Am I being an asshole or is my mom just being passive aggressive? ",

Last year he was abroad and I lived with really messy people, so I had to clean everything alone and started to getting used to clean every 3-4 weeks only (bit then very well). Now I live with my friend again and we switch witch cleaning. Now I skipped one week because of exams. Everything looked perfectly fine in the bathroom and so on...\n\nThis weekend I planned to clean and he also asked me to do it so I said yeah I will do it. 2 hours before I started to clean he went on a 60 minute phone call rant about me not cleaning. I think he thought I couldn't hear him through the wall. \nThen I cleaned everything for over 2 hours (which I would have done anyways).\n\nMy question is: Is skipping cleaning for one week (we have a 2 week rhythm) such a big thing? Why didn't he bring it up and then rants for so long? \n\nMy guess is he is bored right now because he has only small exams and only lives with me here so he tries to find a reason for being angry at me or sth.\nHow shall I react?

      "description": "So today I needed to print my class notes on the family printer. To do so I had to use my mom's computer instead of mine because it's the only one that runs Windows XP and the printer is only supported on it (We have another newer printer but can't use it because its ink is expensive). I tried to use the printer but as usual the paper got stuck while printing so my mom took over to help me. She saw my class notes and said that it was too messy and started formatting them. I just wanted my notes printed because reading on a screen was hurting my eyes so I told her that she didn't need to do that but she wasn't listening. My mom then lectured me on why formatting a document is important, what if someone sees how messy it is etc. and it was then that I blew up on her. Told her that those notes were just for me to read so why would I care as long as I understand what I wrote and that she was wasting my studying time over unnecessary bs (exam is tomorrow BUT I think she didn't know). \n\nI feel like I got angry at something trivial as she was just trying to help but I am also annoyed about the whole thing. I just wanted to print something and somehow it turned in a lecture. ",

Every time he says something about it, i tell him rather blatantly, \"if the door is open, I cannot stop her from going in all the time.\" I work, and my fiancee is taking care of our newborn son all day. But he continues to leave the door open and then get angry when she goes in. \nYesterday, while I was at work and my fiancee was tending to our child, my roommate left the house, leaving his bathroom door wide open. This morning, he finds his charger for his Clippers eaten and torn to shreds.

      "description": "So...blow jobs. They're great! I dont mind giving them, but sometimes I don't think guys realize how it feels to be on the giving side. After a fun little session with my boyfriend I asked him if he knew how blow jobs feel from my perspective. So I thought I'd show him. I asked him to put his fingers in his mouth, and with his permission I began to push them in, he was gagging, but I continued for a bit shoving them in. This is what guys do to girls, right? You push their head back and forth and it feels good because the gag reflex makes the muscles of their throat tighten. I thought it'd be a funny little experience, because I really didnt mind, I just wanted to show him what it was like.\nBut his face was so somber, he looked so guilty, thinking about how that was what he \"put me through\" and I kinda felt bad. He said he\"d never ask me for one again and that wasn't what I wanted at all. My poor baby was scarred. I didnt think it was that bad, I stopped when he asked/pushed away, and I didnt think it'd be THAT bad, but now I feel kinda guilty. But should I? I mean I'm perfectly willing to do the deed, and I don't think it's that bad, but it isn't a great feeling, and I did really want to show him what its like. This is kinda funny, but I'm wondering if me doing that was an asshole move. ",

      "description": "Back in high school, I (22F, 16 at that time) was friends with this guy my age. It was purely platonic. We had a close group of friends and had a great time. I used to be a very quiet kid who got very emotionally invested in *everything*. One day, he suddenly stopped talking to me. I never found out why but apparently something I did triggered it. He never explained even though I asked several times so I still don't know if I did something bad. That period of time really upset me. A couple months later, he decided to \"forgive me\" and we made up. Another 5 months later, he cut off all contact again with no explanation. He had many issues and was always burning bridges with people and I did not need that drama in my life. He'd make a big deal of avoiding me/whispering/being strange when I was in the room so I started being very vocal about how I hated him. He'd try to get \"his friends\" to be super exclusive and cut off people who were \"my friends\", which was a real dick move, but it just ended up backfiring on him and most people disliked him. We graduated that way. \n\nFast forward several years. I am now rather blunt and sarcastic. I attended an award ceremony/ball event that usually doubled as an alumni reunion. I ran into him and he tried to strike up a conversation. I don't hold a grudge anymore. I barely even remember what happened, but I know it had been the most emotionally stressful time in my school years. I told him that I wanted nothing to do with him and to not waste both our times making small talk. I had no interest in reconnecting and since I went to college out of state, we were probably not going to run into each other ever again. My friends panicked and separated us at that point. \n\nMy friends understand my reasoning but told me that it was rude and that small talk never hurt anyone. In highschool, he was an asshole. I was probably an asshole back. AITA for not wanting to be friends? Was I too rude? ",

      "description": "My parents want me to tutor my sister but I know that would just be a waste of time. The kid isn't interested in learning and never listens to what she is told, I don't want to because I don't care nor do I have the patience. I am the oldest of 4  (ages 11,7,4) I tolerate them but I don't love them. My parents allow them to do whatever they please until they get annoyed. They are not good kids, really spoiled and entitled. The middle one (7 sister) is basically failing primary school. She doesn't have any responsibilities other than doing her school work: she has a laptop.  a tutor every Saturday for 1 to 2 hours, unlimited access to books, and programs for learning. She has everything she needs but isn't interested in learning, she'd rather play. I don't care about her education if she succeeds or fails it wont impact my life. My mother is being really manipulative. I am every name under the sun if I don't do what is asks of me and then I must forgive everything and act like there is no issue without an apology.\n\nWhen the first kid came I was almost 8 and I hated it but suck it up ( I hated being touched, hit and vomited on, also was ignored but that was for the best). I have always been expected to put their wants/needs over mine while ignoring all the issues they caused me if not I was selfish or whatever else my parents could think of. Honestly not bitter my mom doesn't like children and didn't want all of the stress that children cause, I was a young and independent kid that wanted approval from my parents so it makes sense. \n\nAnyway I'm just saying the kid isn't my problem, she doesn't want to learn and I don't want to to teach her. I even recommended to get the kid tested for some illness or something that was refused so then I explained that she would benefit from just planning to get a GED and going to trade school. School isn't for everyone so it is better to work at her level and stop holding people responsible for her.\n\nMy mom keeps telling me if she fails then I will have to help her but if that was the case she would be homeless. I am aware that isn't \"nice\" but she has no work ethic so sucks to suck.\n\nTLDR: I refuse to teach my younger sister (age 7) considering she has a lot of resources and is choosing not to progress.",

      "description": "...I'm bad at titles but I think that summarises it.\n\nIt's kind of a small thing, but I recently joined a university society this academic year which meets 3 times a week. I was really enjoying it, so much so that I bought a term pass (where I can go to all sessions) for £80. Other than that, it is £4 per session, so economically if you go 2+ times a week it's cheaper that way.\n\nThe only thing is, is that about half way through the term I dislocated my knee, had to go to a&amp;e and all that stuff. Per the request from the hospital, I did physio and didn't go to the society until past Christmas.\n\nI'm facing a small dilemma, because although I really want to buy another pass, I'm worried something will happen again and I'd have wasted my money again. I've chatted to the society organiser and he basically told me that when you buy a term pass you run that risk, and that the only options were to pay per day or that.\n\nI'm kinda annoyed, because if I didn't get my money's worth because of laziness then I'd be okay, but because of something out of my control means I waste my money. I haven't said anything because I don't want to piss off anyone.\n\nIdk, am I right in being annoyed or should I just suck it up?",

I told her I didn't really have an opinion on the topic and that I wouldn't care if he was or wasn't and just mentioned it because its considered \"gossip\". She said she was sure he wasn't because they go to church together and she knows him well. I tried to move the conversation along because I didn't think saying that was going to be a big deal but she left and ignored me for the past few days.

My sister paid the first 1.5 of taxes.\n\nThis past year I have been going to school so the bills have been stacking up and I actually had to use a credit card to pay for my half of the taxes.  I asked her to pay for her half of the bills, but her response was that she paid for the taxes this first two years so we should be even.\n\nIn addition, my sister has been paying my father's house taxes and bills for almost 20 years prior to his death.  I think she wants credit for that as well.  She's offered to buy my portion of the house.  I don't want to sell because it's been our family home.\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "The title makes me look like an asshole but there is a little bit more context. I am a senior in high school and have liked This girl for a while, probably since grade 9. We never really had the chance to have anything in terms of a relationship because she was always dating another guy or someone new. When our senior started, we started hanging out more and more. We would chill after school and go to the library almost everyday, all around just enjoy each other's company and make an effort to see each other everyday. Now I know that it is possible for opposite genders to be great friends, but considering she would be flirty with me, (touching, constantly laughing, she even invited me over when her parents weren't home), I assumed that she liked me. I genuinely thought that because of all this behaviour, she might actually like me. So I made the decision of asking her out... And she told me she couldn't get over her ex boyfriend. I respectfully told her I understood and it was over. It sucked it really did, but you can't have everything. So for the next couple days I was obviously a little bit upset because rejection is nothing to be happy about, so I made a little distance between us, and this made her very angry. She messaged me saying how I was being selfish and how I was being too emotional. The funniest part is, she lied to me, my good friend informed me right after that she actually is seeing someone at the moment. Now this would make me really upset, but I figured that she lied to spare me from greater harm, instead of saying shes seeing someone, I guess she layed me down easier. So i started ignoring her, and she is still upset about it. This was a while ago and we are still semi friends. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for being mad my aunt wouldn't lent me her car?",
      "description": "This one was a good years ago and of course I am not mad anymore but here is the situation.\n\nI got my drivings license when I was just about finishing university, I couldn't afford a car, so my family didn't bother to incentivise me to get it sooner (smart of them). When I got into university most my friends drove of course, I saved as much I could both for the license and a car. I payed for the license but the money from the car had to be used to pay other stuff.\n\nAt the time I was living with my aunt who is really close in age to me, and my grandmother. My aunt had everything handed to her, parents payed for her university, her license and sadly she kept my grandfather's car after he passed. Even so as I was getting my license she seemed really supportive, more than most of my family who would mock me as to why I was bothering taking it if I didn't have a car while they knew the money for the car was being spent on them.\n\nShe would usually say \"You don't have to worry, anytime you need I will lend you my car, if you want to go out at night with your friends or anything, just tell me\".\n\nI would thank her and say I would get by fine and get myself something. But for some years I couldn't, as I was helping my Mother paying her bills.\n\nFor months I never asked her for the car. I would only drive when we were going somewhere all of us or occasionally take my step-mom's car for a ride alone. I just didn't need it.\n\nOne day I did. It wasn't for something really urgent or important but I didn't think it was a big deal. My student group in uni was organizing an event, and my best friend, who does not go to our uni was helping and giving us supplies that I would need to collect at her house after class and then go back to uni, all in all about 20 min ride each way. As I didn't want to bother any of my classmates and I thought I would have a car by then, I asked her a week in advance if she'd be willing to lend it. No problem.\n\nThen the day before came. I asked her for the keys so I would take off in the morning for classes and she freaked out at me.\nHer: \"Why should I go to work by bus and train and you should go by car???\"\nMe:\" but you said you would lent it to me?\"\nHer\"sorry, but no. It doesn't make any sense. I never said that. Plus you are a new driver, you don't have any experience\"\nMe: \"so... I shouldnt drive to get experience because i don't have experience?\"\nHer:\" look, I know you are in a hurry to grow up, but life takes time, I didn't take my license when I was 18\"\nMe: \"neither did I, I was 20 and I paid for it myself\"\nHer: \" I just find it hilarious why you don't ask your mother\"\nMe: \"her car is broken. She did lent it to me before for small rides. She is far away now for me to get the broken car. And she never promised me anything of the sort.\"\n\nShe stopped the conversation after that. Did not lend me the car, and I had to ask my classmates to go do what I was supposed to. Luckly one of them lived very close to my friend and didn't mind at all.\n\nI never asked for any favour again from anyone in my family. Now I have my own car and live in another country anyway. The other day I just remembered this and I don't know if I was a spoiled brat or if I was right this time...\n\nTL;DR: Aunt kept telling me she would lend me the car if I needed it, when I needed she refused, I got mad, argumment happens. I still remember it time to time.\n",

      "title": "AITA (F20) for being mad at my boyfriend (M18) for not texting me during my trip with friends.",
      "description": "I'm split on my feelings right now. I feel like a shit person for getting mad at him but hear me out. \n\nI told my boyfriend 5 days before leaving that I would be going on a road trip with 3 friends (All female who he's already hung out with) to Flagstaff for 3 days 2 nights to see the Grand Canyon and explore any other monuments. We both have a good relationship, we communicate and comfort the other when we have something to say with one another and don't keep secrets if we feel it affects each other.\n\nRecently he's been overjoyed that his female childhood friend who is also his \"cousin\" I don't know if she's a genuine cousin since he has alot of honorary cousins who are usually kids of his mother's friends. He texts me that a few weeks before hand that his cousin Mary has finally started texting him again as in the past he told me about how he was told she had gone missing for the past 3 years and has recently resurfaced as he found her on Facebook. Apparently she has never gone missing but has been through some tough family problems was taken away from her family and had a choice to either go to Child Protective services or on her own but I don't know the full story as that is what she told him on text.\n\nFirst night on my trip to Flagstaff I'm asleep and when I wake up the next morning I see he left 2 messages at 3 am telling me not to be mad or upset. I call him at 6 am asking him what happened and he told me he wanted to hang out with Mary on Thursday to catch up before she moves to another state and mentions she has a boyfriend already and lives with him. Now I wasn't upset that she was a girl but I always felt jealous when he mentioned her and acted to excited and telling his little brothers whenever she sends him a new message. He understood I felt weird about how much he talked about her and was getting jealous and he apologized. I felt upset but I told him he shouldn't be too hard on himself because he said she was the person who was there for him when No one else was when he was little. \n\nI felt bad and told him while I had all these uneasy feelings I trusted him and that the only reason I was worried was because out of all his family I never met Mary. He told me everything is fine and that I should trust him. I told him alright and we were done with it. For the rest of that day I've tried to text him just as we always do with the usual \"hey what you up to\" and all the typical conversation starters but he's just been ending it quick with just \"have fun with your friends\". Now this was okay the first few times because I know he had online school to work on. But I've been wanting to talk to him because I just missed him and told him so and he just kept ending the conversation after miss you too and he says bye because I just think he had to run an errand which he in my experience always has to deal with. \n\nFor the rest of the day I've been waiting for just starter message from him but nothing came so after I returned to the hotel room at night I called him but he sounded busy since he wanted to hang up because I think he felt nervous that I wanted to talk to him with my friends were in the same room as me. I asked him if everything was okay over there and he said he would tell me later and that I should just have fun with my friends. I kept pushing on my texts saying if he was okay because when I sent him messages he read it and wouldn't reply but it was just in a span in five minutes so I was probably overreacting but I wanted to know what was going on with him and saying I missed him which is why I was texting him and wanting him to text me back. \n\nWe both seemed to get angry in text and he kept saying he was fine and babysitting his siblings and his other honorary aunt's kids too and said that he would just tell me later what was on his mind. \n\nIdk I just feel really bad for being angry for something like this but I feel all this is just happening because I felt uncomfortable about the whole Mary thing. Am I the asshole here for making a big deal out of this? I just wanted to chat with him and have everything back to being us just being goofy to each other. I wanna just apologize to him because I think he just has his own problems and just wants to leave me to my friends. I guess it's probably because I'm comparing myself to all my other friends who currently are occupied texting their own boyfriends.\n\n",

Better perspective I guess.\n\nMy Mom,Moms Mom and My Great grandma have been seeing the same doctor.\n\nHe was a nice doctor and would ask personal questions which I fidnt mind asking since I liked to talk about my struggles with family.( Not knowing it,I seriously needed a psychiatrist)\n\nMy mother's a drinker and is kind of going down hill and her job is killing her.He says that but personally it is which him and I talk about(He brought it up because we both know she isn't honest about her usage and I wanted him to know for  her benefit for meds and such)\n\nEvery visit though it seems that he just pushes psych pills? I always felt iffy to it since hes a regular doc.\n\nI had a car accident and told him my back hurt. He wanted me to go to physical therapy to decide if I needed more than that.\n\nShouldn't he take an xray or something before pushing me off to somebody else?\n\nOne time,while I was waiting,I overheard in the next room(thin walls) a girl screaming. It's not my business but the Doc comes into my room and says,\"If I knew it was you I might have asked you to talk to her.\"\n\nI'm thinking,\"That is none of my business and isn't that against patient confidentiality?\"\n\nMy grandma is a nurse and started looking at this doctor differently when I talk to her.\n\nAnywho,The last time I saw him,he walks into the room and with no comment from me says,\"I'm sorry you had to grow up with the mother that you have.\"\n\nWtf??? My mother was a very hard working person with 3 kids,with neither father helping financially and I was so upset that I could barely muster out,\"I think I should leave these convos for my psychiatrist!\"\nI think he realized what he said but offered no apology and he didnt even know what I was there for. His receptionist and nurse knew but he didnt until I brought it up before he left the room.(Had a severe reaction to meds and my feet and legs swelled up where I could barely walk)\n\nToday came for me to see him but I got severely anxious and pissed for what he said(Also was exhausted due to depression,trying to get sleep after 35 hrs)and just decided to not see him and have them drop me for missing too many appointments.\n\nI've also have had a hard time going out in public lately due to the anxiety and depression so I was pretty happy to have an actual reason to leave my house.\n\nCould have said I cant see him anymore and found a new doctor. I know it isn't confrontation but I'm not good with it and putting people down.\n\nFeel like a pussy and feel bad for the receptionists and nurses and not standing up for my family.\n\nI know I was wrong for the other 2 appointments I missed but I thought what he said was truly uncalled for.\n\nI didnt even see him for a full year.\n\nAITA?????",

      "description": "This seems pretty straightforward, but I’d like to give a little background so you can see things exactly as I see them.\n\nI’ve been friends with my now girlfriend for 8 years. We met when we were 11. We’ve always had a bit of a “Jim and Pam” dynamic but things never quite worked out. \n\nWell I finally had the chance to make a move on her, and she was so happy I did, but she wasn’t quite ready to hop into another relationship because she’s been from guy to guy for years. Totally understandable. She told me that she wanted to be with me, but just needed some time to herself. Again, I was totally fine with that and wanted her to take all the time she needed. I want things with us to last forever, and she needs to be happy and healthy by herself before WE can be happy and healthy together.\n\nSo now the fun part. She’s been friends with this guy who I’m not a huge fan of. Just overall not the best guy, but he treated her well and helped her in a couple times of need. They just started getting close around 10 months ago. I always felt like he had feelings for her, even before they got close. \n\nShe would tell me about how they hang out in his room and watch movies and chill in his bed and stuff. Big red flags for me. I’m sitting here like “duh of course he’s into you” but she just didn’t believe me. She thought that things were purely platonic. \n\nWell surprise surprise, during this period of her trying to “discover” herself or whatever, he told her that he had feelings for her. He knew that she was into me, and told her that he didn’t want to make things difficult so he wouldn’t pursue things further. He said that he just didn’t want to lie to her anymore.\n\nWell, a few days after that, the two of them were hanging out and he kept asking her questions about me. What she likes about me and stuff like that. He than began comparing himself to me to look like a good option. He clearly had big time feelings for her and still does.\n\nWell, her and I are officially together now, and I’m feeling a bit uneasy about the whole situation. One one hand, I don’t want to be controlling or an asshole by telling her I don’t feel comfortable with her hanging out with him. On the other hand, I’ve seen first hand how fast platonic friendships can turn into so much more. Hell, it happened with her and I. \n\nI’m not worried about her cheating on me, I do trust her, I just don’t like the idea of them hanging out, and her venting to some other guy about me. I feel like that’s how feelings develop. \n\nIdk, maybe I’m overthinking things, that’s why I’m here. So...thoughts? If nothing else, I hope to create a discussion a dialogue about whether or not you can be friends with someone who has feelings for you, while in a relationship.",

      "description": "Last year I had to move back home after failing to live on my own. Some non related things happened and I was pretty broken up about it for a long time. I had spent a couple months without a job living off of saved up money and a friend recommended I go work with him.\n\n I had originally started working for this company when I was in college but quit to pursue job opportunities in a different field. During my first stint working there my friend was in a similar place and I recommended he come work with me which he did. I quit not long after.\n\nNow having moved back, his department needing people, me out of work and having the relevant experience, I took the job and he was my supervisor. He started out pretty alright but as time went on and management started to tease him with promotions, he got a lot more annoying. Showing up late to relieve me, leaving clean up work for me to do when I would come in, passing off difficult customers to me etc. He would leave the section to go talk to the hot cashiers when it was busy, spent way too long out on break and would leave half eaten food and other garbage in drawers and on shelves that I would find when closing up.\n\nI had a bunch of conversations with him about it and never made any headway. From his POV I was a lazy worker who didn't clean up adequately and didn't listen to him when he told me to do things. From my POV he was letting the position get to his head and instead of leading by example he was choosing the \"do as I say not as I do\" method. He mentioned to me that if I didn't like the way he did things that I should get promoted to supervisor so I could do his job.\n\nAfter a couple months of this I had enough. I gave my two weeks to my manager, got another job in another field and left.\n\nI still maintained contact with this person for a while after until he got drunk one night and spilled his guts about how shitty I was at that job and how me leaving was an insult to him because he \"got me the job\". I haven't spoken to him since then.\n\nAm I in the wrong here?",

Me and my friends didn't believe this could be done, so we did a little digging and found out that all of \"his\" remixes are just remixes made by other artists with the cover art and names slightly altered. I messaged him privately explaining that passing off other artist's songs as your own is theft, and generally a bad thing to do. I told him if he posted another song like this, I would expose him in the comments of each video and report him.\n\nWell, the next day comes, and a new stolen remix comes out. So as promised, I exposed him in the comments, where all his friends would see, and then reported him to YouTube.\n\nHowever, I am starting to feel a bit of guilt. This kid has a slight learning disability along with some anger issues and is often in and out of school. I don't think he meant any harm with his videos, he just wanted to look cool and get some recognition from his peers. Am I the asshole for doing what I did?",

      "description": "Katrina (I’ll call her; all names are fake) turned out to be the type of person who ignored me the minute she got a boyfriend. We were incredibly close before she started dating. Close to the point where she considered dating me, but we were long distance and I didn’t see her that way. Then she started dating Anthony, and I was pretty much nonexistent from her life from then on. It hurt a lot. It showed me how much I actually meant to her - disposable. So I continued being nice to her when she did pay attention to me. I was going to let her get rid of me when she felt it was time. \n\nThe time did come. Thanksgiving. Leading up to Thanksgiving, there had been times when people would unnecessarily tag me in their life events on Facebook, such as a baby picture or a making-out picture (one person does this literally all the time. Any time she posts a baby picture or a picture with her and her “hubby hub hub”, she’s always tagging me; and I’m not involved with her in any way). So every time Sierra did that, I would rant to Katrina how annoyed I was, and how annoying it is for people to tag me on their life events on Facebook if I’m not involved. So she had some level of understanding when she did exactly that on Thanksgiving Day. I woke up to a Facebook post in which Katrina posted a photo of her and her boyfriend with the caption “I’m so thankful for my boyfriend, my most favorite person ever, on this Thanksgiving Day”. I was tagged in it. I texted her that day and asked her to untag me from that post. Well, that was a mistake. She got suuuuuuuuper pissed off at me, claiming I don’t appreciate her as a friend, and I’m bitter because she has a boyfriend, and that she was trying to be nice to me on a day thanking friends and family and showing appreciation. She unfriended me and blocked me, then called me a manipulative asshole who is a lonely bitter incel who can’t accept the fact everyone around me is in love and I’ll never find love because of that.

So I genuinely am concerned whether AITA or not in this situation. \n\nSo my closest friend took me out for my 21st birthday to get me drunk and she totally succeeded. So my dilemma is her mom who randomly showed up to drink with us got too drunk&amp; naturally her daughter offered to drive her home. Ok yeah makes sense and I have no issue. Then the vibe changed when we were walking up to my bffs car to drive her mom home. I was two steps away from the passenger door and her mom called “shotgun”, to which I jokingly said “but it’s my birthday!!” AS I got into the back seat. It seems relevant for me to say that her mom is a very large woman and fitting into seats has been an issue so she actually needs the front. I wasn’t even thinking about that aspect and her mom laughed so I genuinely thought no problem jokey jokes I’m messed up who cares. But now my friend is saying I disrespected her mom and was being mouthy and I seriously don’t think that I even semi came off that way to her mom or in general. I apologized but\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to move closer to my SO's cancer-stricken parents?",
      "description": "My SO and I have been together for nearly a decade. We are not married--we are both women and initially we couldn't legally marry. I proposed to her once and she rejected me. Later, she explained that she was worried her parents would be upset if we got married. That was probably 5-6 years ago.\n\nWe moved to a city that is a few hour's drive from her parents about 4 years ago. When I visit I am hardly talked to or acknowledged. No one in her family has ever shook my hand, patted me on the shoulder or given me a hug. Her sister calls me my SO's \"friend\" to her children. Part of the lack of talking is there is a language barrier so I assumed that this was most of the issue. However, my SO's BIL's mother does not speak their language and one year at Christmas it was striking how much more broken English her parents would use with the MIL vs. with me. It was pretty clear they just don't bother putting a lot of effort into getting to know me or making me feel like part of the family.\n\nRecently this came to sort of a head just before Thanksgiving. My SO's father got very sick and was in the hospital for a couple of weeks. My SO mentioned that I would be coming up to visit and her mom became visibly flustered. She didn't want me to come. My SO tried to explain to me that it was customary in their culture that you feed and house any guests and her plate was simply too full to handle me coming. Iniitally, this made sense but the more I thought about it I found it upsetting to be viewed as a burden. After talking about it more with her mom, my SO asked me to cancel my visit. When my SO got home (Dad made a recovery) I talked more with my SO about how upsetting it was and I decided not to visit them for Thanksgiving.\n\nMy SO's parents are both struggling with cancer and have been for the last year. Her sister has the main burden of taking them to appointments and dealing with things on a day to day level. She is starting to put a lot of pressure on my SO to move up there to help out. The thing is, I really don't want to move to that area and even more so, I don't want to for the sole reason of us spending more time with her parents. They don't seem to view our relationship as valid or as important as a marriage even though we do. Furthermore, in the time that we have been together we have put off so many plans because \"what would her parents think\" or \"what if my parents get sick while we are gone.\" I know that if we move up there these sentiments will only intensify. I would gladly be there for her and for her parents but they've made it pretty clear they don't want me to be, so why should I put myself through that for likely many years to come?\n\nI think this is the point where I call it quits with our relationship because I can't do this anymore. I can't live according to the wishes of people who don't even like me. But it also feels like a total dick move to make this choice when her parents are both dealing with cancer. ",

So I disliked all images in the chat (iMessage) well we usually dislike each other messages for fun, so I don’t see any problem in that.\nHowever, the story is basically about Judy got a new girlfriend instead of boyfriend, so one of them was like “you homophobic?” \nI replied 😉, well they are my friends so they should know me well that I’m not. So I kinda trolled around. After a while I was like “I was thinking about keep trolling but I don’t want you guys upset so no” \nThen they started to be like “you are basically joking about hating all of us”, “sometimes is not good to joke about”, “it is like saying to a black dude am I racist”\nWell first thing is I wasn’t the one who brought up this word, and it is not the first time THEY joke about I’m homophobic. Sometimes we had some arguments unrelated to sexuality and then one of them will be like “you homophobic” and then we all laughed. I don’t understand why this time I would be the one who is wrong.

I started to have some intense doubts about whether or not i actually romantically liked her, despite knowing i liked her as a friend. I eventually made plans to break up with her on february 12th; unfortunately two days before Valentine’s day. I couldn’t do it then, so even worse, I had to do it the day before.  I surmised that i didnt have time to assess my feelings because of how fast the relationship moved, and that she was becoming very dependent. So, I broke up with her, sat with her for a half hour while she cried, then notified a few people close to her what had happened so they could keep an eye on her. A while later, after she had talked with an ex-friend of mine, she came back to talk to me, saying that I was a jerk for breaking up with her how I did. I recognize the whole don’t-break-up-on-Valentine’s-day thing, but would it have been better to bite the bullet and “fake it” through Valentine’s day to break up with her a while afterward, risking my own well-being?",

Im 18 years old, and i will graduate this year. I dont have any serious motivation in life. What i strive for is always being happy, and im fine with living a quiet, happy life. Im also really emotional, and cant for the life of me mask my emotions, even when i try. My grades are okay-ish, except from physics, which im absolutely shit at. My mom started to really act cold around me the past months. I always do what she asks, but she still finds some minor stuff that i do wrong, just to scald me. I try to be happy, but it got really hard recently. School sucks, but when i get home, its always good to know that there are people here who love me. But recently my mom was just really cold, didnt talk to me much, always sighed when i tried to talk, and when i said i had a bad day, she didnt listen to me, and just said that these aernt real problems, and i will see how hard it really is, when i become an adult. Yesterday my principal called her about my physics grade, and so we sat down to talk. After scalding me for a good hour, i finally burst, and told her how i felt. I told her i feel like she doesnt really love me anymore, and is just waiting me to leave. She then told me that im a massive disappointment, and she thought i would become better. She said that i cant grow up, and what im saying isnt a real problem, im simply just a crybaby. She also told me that my problem is that im too honest, and that when i talk to a teacher i dont like, i cant mask it well, and thats why most of my teachers hate me. She aldo told me, that she heard i played a prank on a teacher (i got her to say ligma, i live in a country where most people inc, her dont speak English. So she didnt even understand what i said. I agree it was a stupid joke tho) and that now the teachers are out to get revenge on me or whatever. It might seem like im biased, so ill say that she might just be acting up, because there is some shit stuff going on at her work. So basically my question is. Should i really try to suppress emotions more, am i really a crybaby, and is this stuff really not a big deal? and is this a reasonable response to me performing not so well in school? My parents want me to be a dentist, so thats why they want better grades from me. (this account i a throwaway for obv, reasons)",

      "description": "(posting this for my brother who doesn't have a Reddit account) Long story short, my mother gifted me some soft socks with different fun prints for Christmas this last year. My dog, who has a scrapped up paw pad has been crying and obsessively licking it on and off for the past month. The vet recommended that we try and tape a sock to her paw to prevent her from continuing to interfere with the hearing process. The softest sock I could find was one of the ones she had gifted me. When my dog chewed through the sock to remove it so that she could again obsessively lick the wound. My mother became standoffish and said \"you could have used any sock\" that she got them because she thought \"they would be fun\". I like the socks although I do not often have an occasion to wear them, and I didn't select these socks because they were a gift but she still seems upset about it regardless. Am I The Asshole?",

      "description": "Back in October of 2017, I decided to make a blog on Tumblr and I met... let's call them A. After a bit of interaction, I noticed there was some drama on A's blog and decided to try and comfort them. A became a very close friend of mine and after 3 months, we started dating.\n\nAny little thing could make A upset and I always felt like I had to be careful of what to say. I broke up with them and in December, told them I didn't want to talk to them anymore. I apologized the next day but pulled the exact same stunt two weeks later. Apologized again but A said they needed time and space. A had sent me messages here and there during this. I thought it was okay so I started messaging them but A constantly ignored me. A told me that they still wanted me to be able to vent to them with my problems if I needed. \n\nI made sure they were online. I asked if could vent and A said I could. I wrote things down and just wanted someone to hear me out and be comforted. A disappeared for 4 hours. I deleted the messages 2 hours after sending it, I wanted to cry and head to bed. In the morning they explained their situation. What I had sent was overwhelming for them and they ignored me on purpose due to that. I apologized once more. I didn't want to say anything a being angry at them but after that, A said they were ANGRY at ME, That I shouldn't delete my messages because \"it stresses me out more!\" And \"stop apologizing for bothering me! You're not! That stresses me more!\" My anger subsided in the moment and I felt even worse. They apologized for ignoring me in a not very sincere way. \n\nI kept trying to keep check up with them and when I saw that they had entered another relationship, even tho hey said that they would be taking time to heal from ours and that they won't rush into another one, I sent them a message saying congrants. I was really anxious for messaging them so I stared at the screen for a long time.\n\n[A is typing a message]\n\nI waited... I know A had seen the message. I went into panic mode and started deleting the messages, accidentally pinning one. I panicked even more and just started deleting everything, unfriending them in a panic. I had fucked myself over as their messages were only set to friends. So now I had no way of contacting them at all. I didn't talk to them at ALL after this.\n\nA month has passed since that incident and I was lonely and wanted to say hi, to shake off those thoughts that A hated me. I sent them an ask and A's BF sent me a message saying it was from A. They said they were SICK of me, that they made it clear by blocking me on all platforms possible (I wasn't even aware. All I knew at that time was that they wanted space and time to heal.). That they wanted me to stop pursuing them and more, making it seem like I was being an asshole towards them. I don't understand what I did that upset them to this point. After some words from me, I blocked A's BF. \n\nI'm close to 15 now... AITA?",

      "description": "It sounds like I'm the asshole but hear me out. I became friends with this silent girl when I first started the university. Let's call her Susan. It was the first year, so we made different friends at the end of the year. However her friend failed the class and she started to sit near me in the classroom again. I introduced her to my close friend, let's call her Jane, and we started to hang out as a trio. I and Jane were both talkative, so when all of us were together we were making the most of the conversations. Susan was still silent. We tried to make her talk. She should be talking with us at least. Because we told everything about our lives to her but we barely knew her. It wasn't fair. \n\nA lot of things happened but let's fast-forward to the last year. We had a thesis and we had to read articles in English, because there was no research that was done in our country about that subject. Yet Susan was not helping. She was always saying: \"your English is better than mine, I can't understand the articles\". She was not even trying. I could speak English but I also didn't understand articles at the beginning. With reading a lot, Jane and I started to be more competent about the subject we were working on. Our professor was delighted but she wasn't seeing Susan's lack of effort. Moreover, she wasn't listening us when we were talking even in daily things like what we should eat when we get home. She was always on her phone and it was driving us crazy. \n\nLong story to short, we were *close* friends but she never shared anything about her life or her thoughts, never did anything that she didn't want to, even if that means we would have to do her parts in the projects, never listened us enough to care. And we were *close* but when I had some tough times, she didn't even call even though she knew and that was the final straw. I ended our friendship. I know shy people struggle to communicate but I don't think she's that shy. I think she's just using her shyness as an excuse. I always felt that she didn't care for us in the same way we cared for her, so after ending our friendship, I felt relieved. Now, am I the asshole for leaving that shy, lonely girl by herself? ",

      "description": "Niece (my brothers daughter) is turning 9. For her birthday me and my Mom are hoping to take her to a concert nearby for a singer she loves. The paternal side of the family have hardly ever done anything with my niece without her parents, however the maternal side (my brothers wife’s side) have taken her to countless places without my brother and his wife. Another example of being treated differently is that this year we wanted to go on a big family holiday but my SIL stated that long haul isn’t appropriate for her young son, yet she is going to the exact same destination with her side of the family next year. My sister in law has a great relationship with my parents, and it’s decent with me. I’m not her biggest fan but I don’t make this outwardly known. I made my suggestion to my brother regarding the concert and he asked if his wife is invited. I did want it to just be me and my Mom treating my niece and having our own quality time with her, but found it hard to put it across without it seeming like my sister in law isn’t invited. So I said she’s obviously invited but I can’t afford to pay for her too, and that we are happy to take her on our own the same way her side of the family does and I am now awaiting their response.

      "description": "So I met a girl on internet around 3-4 years ago, she quickly became one of my best friends even though we've never met each other and we live pretty far away.\n\nWe met when we were 15/16 years old and on a point of our lives where everything was bad, so we would rant and complain about our lives but make each other laugh at the same, that was our way of bonding. We would listen to each others problems and give advice if we asked. It was really nice having someone to understand and actually listen to me, specially at that age.\n\nSo now that we're in college, everything seemed to go well until, long story short, I didn't get into the college I wanted or the career I wanted to study, but she did. She started hanging out with new friends and I'm really proud of her because she's always been a shy person.\n\nEverything was going well for her for a while, until she started having problems with her roommates.\n\nI've always been a good listener, and like I always do, I listened to what was the problem. It turned out to be a tiny thing that could be solved easily, but it continued and I told her that if her roommates bothered her so much, she should try and ask for a change. \n\nAnyway... it's always small things, but she never. Stops. Complaining. I can't talk to her because she keeps playing the victim in every little problem she has. And I've told her that multiple times (without being rude ofc). Every time she texts me it's because she feels sad, angry, frustrated, etc., and I just can't take it anymore.\n\nI'm not in a good place in my life right now, so even reading about how her day wasn't good (which is every day), or how she had a fight with someone, or how toxic her friend is annoys me and ruines my whole day. \n\nI can't just stop being her friend because I love her and I don't want to throw years of friendship in the trash and she's going to get more upset and I feel like if I stopped being friends with her, I would be ungrateful because years ago she used to be my rock. \n\nPd: sorry if i have any mistakes, English isn't my first language",

      "description": "On Sunday, my girlfriend said she wanted to surprise me with a gift at noon for today. She wouldn't tell me what the gift is so I assumed it was something like a card she wrote for me (our anniversary is coming up and she loves arts and crafts).\n\nThe next day, I accidentally spoiled a TV series for her that she was watching and she got mad at me. She texted me \"Don't talk to me\". I apologized, saying I didn't know she didn't get up to that part yet and she left me on seen. I think alright, she'll get over this later. She never responded back so I got petty for her ignoring me for something I didn't mean to do intentionally.\n\nWe had no contact since then (until today) and I thought she was still upset with me so I went out to grab lunch with my coworkers a little before noon. She messages me at noon, telling me she's downstairs and to pick up her gift for me. I told her I went out for food because I didn't think she would still pull through today because she was mad and ignored me. She told me to pick it up anyway.\n\nI got my food to go, met up with her, and picked up my gift. I asked her what it was but she wouldn't tell me. She looked sad, which I assumed was because she thought I was upset with her (I was because she ignored me for 2 days). I hugged her and she started crying and that made me feel really bad but she told me it was ok and she left. I went back to work, ate my food, then looked at the gift (it was in a big bag) and found out that it was food for two. She planned on eating lunch with me but because she didn't tell me anything beforehand and I was being petty, I ended up eating my own lunch before opening her gift and finding out it was food for the both of us.\n\nI feel terrible because she was probably looking forward to it today but she ended up leaving sad and hungry.

      "description": "In March of 2018, I lost my father to cancer. He was battling it for a little over a year and it was very severe. In December before he died, I flew to see him and we had a good couple of last days together (I live in the US, he lived in Israel). I didn't go to his funeral because I was at university and I knew he would have wanted me to prioritize my education over flying halfway across the world for his funeral. My aunt and I feuded over this, as she thought I should have been there for the rest of my family (in person), but we resolved it.  In August of 2018, my maternal grandmother died unexpectedly and I did fly for her funeral (in Ukraine) as I didn't have school at the time.  My paternal grandmother became extremely depressed after my father's death. She hid it for a long time, acting fine on the surface and starving herself in secret. I visited her this summer and we had a great time together, going to places and doing lots of things. Right now she is in the hospital with my aunt (her daughter). My next school break is in March, and I was planning on visiting her then (she lives in Moscow), but now I'm not so sure if that's a good idea. She's the type of person to feel guilty about not being able to do things for me or go places with me. Plus, her daughter is there with her. It's extremely likely that she will die soon, she's on kidney dialysis and not really in the mood to keep living in general.  Is it wrong to want her last memory of us together to be us doing things together, not me at the hospital basically waiting for her to pass... I don't know if my thinking is selfish because I'm so emotionally exhausted from all these deaths, I want to remove myself from them as much as possible, but I'm scared I'll make an unwise decision.

      "description": "So, this story all starts when me and a co-worker where placed abroad together, we get along most of the times, others not so much, this was our first big fight only after two months into living together.\n\nWe'd just moved in with a third girl who had been living in the appartment for longer and we mostly got along, our upstairs neighboors were three boys who used to work with us aswell. She had a bit of a crush on two of the boys and would often joke I could have the third. I had just came out of a complicated situation with a guy back in my home country so I would dismiss it and say I would pass.\n\nOne week arrived in which both my flatmates were going to be away to visit family and friends so I'd be alone in the house and in the country for the first time. The day before said flatmate went she got into going for a walk with one of the guys from upstairs, which resulted in kissing, according to her. Not according to him.\n\nThe day she left me and him went to bring her to the airport to say goodbye and found some more friends on the way over, we were all going to be off the next day so we decided to go out and get wasted. Since I was alone, we started the night in my appartment and finished there, where in the end it was just the two of us and it happened. We agreed not to tell anything to her, but while She was away she'd text me how she missed him and wanted to come back to him, and etc.. so when She came back I told her the truth..\n\nShe seemed mad at him first, but didn't talk to me for the rest of the day. I gave her space, and thought we'd talk better the next days. We didn't. She started completly ignoring me, when She would adress me she would be pretty nasty, and just the day after she came back and I told her what happened she went and started sleeping with him. It didn't bother me then, but it bothered our other flatmate.\n\nIt really only started to bother me when he started spending the night over, without any notice from anyone. He slept in 3 nights in a row and he would come to wait for her in our appartment when she was at work. I talked with him that it made me unconfortable, and we talked to her about it. She just told me that it was her house, she was paying rent and She would bring home whoever she wanted and I could do the same.\n\nOne day she went over his place and left me alone for hours, as I was already used to at this point, she only texted me to tell me to order pizza. I told her we could order with the guys. She told me not to be with them. That day I got done. I felt like a criminal, being punished while my \"partner in crime\" was being rewarded. Meanwhile I couldn't even be with my friends because She didn't want to.\n\nI told her to get home to talk. She told me she was being mean, yes but because I betrayed her trust, by sleeping with someone I knew She was into, and on top of that trying to impose living rules to fit my feelings on it...\n\nSome time has passed since then, we now live only the two of us and moved passed it. But everytime she gets the chance she throws a jab on how I was a awful person then, so.. Am I really the asshole?\n",

I think growing up around a racist family has impacted me in ways that I didn’t realise. I spoke to her about the incident and I apologized. We both started crying. She wants to take a break from the relationship, rightfully so. I’ve messaged my family and told them that I won’t be speaking to them anymore until they get their shit together. I’m heartbroken but I don’t blame her. I just hope that I can win her back. Thanks for educating me.",

      "description": "Having a really hard time landing on a decision with this, need some advice/perspective other than mine.\n\nMy brother has his wedding planned for this spring at a very expensive all inclusive resort in the Caribbean. 6 months ago he informed my sisters and I that he was already married and had eloped at his city hall 6 months prior (just celebrated his one year anniversary). It’s my understanding that it’s common/necessary for couples to do this before an all inclusive wedding because they need to be officially married in the country they live in so I understand and congratulated them excitedly.\n\n\nMy partner and I live comfortably but on a budget. The resort package cost for a week was going to be $1900 (each), we live two hours from the international airport so we would also have travel and parking costs, as well as boarding fees for our pup. Overall this is significantly more than we would ever pay for a vacation, so that, accompanied with it not even being a destination we would have picked alone made it an immediate stress. We decided to look at other options and are currently planning on booking for only the weekend of the ceremony but that only reduces our per person total to $1100 each and shortens the boarding time/cost for the dog by a few days. Still more than I want to pay but when I suggested to friends that we might not go I was met with a lot of “what’s!?” and “really’s!?”.\n\nSo I don’t know help me out, AITA if we don’t go? Would you hold a grudge against your sibling in a similar situation? Am I obligated to go? Thanks for your time and opinions ❤️",

Her mother is currently employed, living prolly the same level. Her stepfather owns a construction company, so work is contract and not always around (he’s kind of lazy about finding new work).\n\nMy SO is in Law School, and there’s the catch. She has already racked up a whopping $90k+ in student loan debt, and she still has a year to go, plus the BAR, so more debt to come. Her mother has borrowed money from her before for reasons such as risk of eviction, and repo of car, which my SO states is due to her own mother’s mismanagement of funds, and the fact her stepfather isn’t the best at helping (and that couple fights quite often). Both the residence and the car are in my SO’s Mother’s name, as they were purchased before she married the step father. Her mother has always paid her back, though the timing of how long that took is a bit hazy. This time around she borrowed around $1200, which was all my SO had saved for eventual paying off loans, rainy day fund, etc. and her mother enticed her saying she would pay her back MORE than what was owed (amount unspecified, maybe $100-$200). I was told this last night and she already knows how I feel about her mother borrowing money from her.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nTl;dr\nSO’s mother is borrowing money from my SO, but my SO is currently in school with a $90k+ student loan with a year left in school to go.

      "description": "Okay, a bit of a multi-layered story but I’ll try to be brief. TL;DR below. \n\nIn high school, I sold a 95 Mazda mx6 that my parents had gifted me at 15, and a Honda 500 bike that my dad and I had originally split. I used this money to pay off most of a Jetta, and my parents covered the rest for my graduation gift. fast forward many years and my Jetta finally dies. I mean, this thing literally went down in flames. Insurance gave us 3500 for it, and I set out looking for a new car. While looking, my mom let me drive her 94 Jeep Wrangler, which was so awesome of her. \n\nAfter a couple of months of looking, we found an 07 Jeep Compass online for 6500. I loved it. We ended up paying 6k, and with the insurance money, came to a bottom line of 2500. My grandmother had recently passed, and the buying of this car happened to coincide with my parents selling her house. So, knowing I was already struggling to make ends meet as a single public school teacher with massive loan debt, my parents decided to use some of that house money to just cover the car. (“Don’t tell your siblings” my mom joked). \n\nIt should be noted here that my family and I all have a great, open relationship, and that I’m the only sibling of three with massive student loan debt. The other two do extremely well for themselves for not having taken the same educational route as I did, and are consequently in a much better financial place than I am. I’m also the only single person without a family, so I really struggle to make ends meet every month. \n\nAnyways, a couple of weeks ago, I was in an accident and totaled the Compass. Insurance is paying out 3000 for it, and I’m terrified to have to take on a car payment right now. There is literally no room in my shoe string budget for it. So, my mom offered me the Wrangler in exchange for the insurance money. But here’s the rub, the Jeep is definitely not worth three thousand dollars. \n\nI looked up the KBB value, and compared it with same and similar vehicles selling in the area, and it’d be more in the 2000-2500 range, tops. I know that I owe my parents immensely for all of their help over the years, and I would kind of feel like an asshole for nickel and dimeing them over this. I actually think my parents would find it very reasonable if I asked them if they’d take 2500 and just let me keep 500 for bills, especially with some recent financial hits that I’ve taken. They know my financial situation transparently, and they’re very stable financially, with multiple properties and assets. \nBut I just want to know how much of an asshole I would really be to not just let them keep all 3000 of the money just because I’m not in a financially stable place? \n\nTL;DR my parents want to sell me a Jeep for about 750$ over its value. I could really use that money, but my parents have saved my ass so many times over the years, that I want to know if I’d be the asshole for trying to haggle it down from them. ",

      "description": "First time posting here, and on Reddit in general, so apologies in advance in advance for any errors in formatting/posting.\n\nSo, a bit of background on my friend (18M) and I (18M) have known each other for a few years. We used to be quite good friends but I developed a one-sided crush on them, needless to say things became awkward between us and eventually I decided it would be best for us to stop talking, we didn't talk for around 1 year and I figured that was it for us. \n\nRecently he got back in touch with me and we started talking again. Things were awkward at first but I was determined to try and work past it. One night I decided to ask him where he thought our friendship would go in the future and he told me it was better if we didn't bring up the conversation again, that decision upset me though I didn't voice it and instead simply agreed to not mention it again.\n\nAfter that I decided I wanted to see him in person again and we arranged to meet up at his house, the day went smoothly and we played games and then went out for a walk while talking to one another. When it got late I was getting ready to go home and we hugged, though after that he told me I was bad at picking up on social cues, when I asked him what he meant later he told me he didn't remember. This again upset me but I decided not to voice it yet again.\n\nThe next day I questioned him on something. I had previously asked him if he wanted to stay round mine and he agreed to it, the day after we were round his he told me he didn't want to stay round anymore as things were still awkward. I told him I wanted there to be full honesty between us, I was again upset by his actions, this time it was because he had lied to me. That evening he told me that we don't see each other the same in this friendship and that we should stop talking, I've tried to contact him since but I've just been ignored and this whole ordeal has made me miserable.\n\nI keep wondering if I had simply moved too fast, that I should have given him more space and that it was me who was making things awkward. So, AITA for moving too quickly and potentially driving him away?",

      "description": "I honestly don't even know how I can represent this as a serious conversation. If I've ever lost a friend over something dumber it's truly beyond me but here we go....\n\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with Discord, it's a program pc gamers use for voice communication. But it can also be used for voice communication in groups socially as well. Earlier today a friend of mine was talking to me in a lobby and we were about to start playing a game. We were sitting in the lobby talking for a few minutes. I currently am on day 5 of having the flu. My temperature has finally broken, but I still am not feeling very stellar. But I felt ok enough to get up and play some games today.  As we were setting up my friend began to receive text messages on his phone. He has a very loud tone with a minions voice saying woohoo text message. If you would care to listen to it, this is a clip of how it sounds.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPObfg7o0jk\n\nThe sound went off 3 times in about 2 minutes, and honestly it wasn't a big deal. But it's loud especially when you're wearing headphones and his phone is either very close to his mic, or it's just that loud. On the 3rd time I said \"Man, that sound really is annoying\". And honestly, that was it for me. But it set my friend off. He said he was tired of being nit picked and bitched at. Now I do understand that because of this statement it does mean that he's holding onto some other thing that was said at some other point. But all I can tell you is that if there was it was from a completely different day because we both just got online. \n\nI know that bc I'm sick I'm very likely moody or whiny. But Jesus, is that really so awful to complain about? I mean I've heard other people comment about it before. Was I supposed to just ignore it?\n\nI'm honestly stunned at how dumb this all sounds typing it out but I'm in the situation and I feel like I'm definitely right here. But I know this guy feels he's right too. So I figured i'd bring my stupidity to you for judgment. \n\nSo have at it.",

      "description": "I work as a cart pusher at Walmart, so I'm in the parking lot most of my day. One day this lady and her family show up in a truck. They also have a dog, which they leave in the truck. It was a cold day so I wasn't worried about the animal overheating. The lady's family got her a mobility scooter, and when she got on it and was on her way, the dog jumped on the lock and locked all doors in the truck. When they got out of the store, they found themselves locked out. She called roadside assistance, but they wouldn't help for some reason. The manager talked to them briefly, then did nothing. I tried to help them, we didn't have any wire hangers so I bought this marshmallow toaster thing (to make smores I guess) It was made of wire to impale marshmallows. I handed it to them and said they should see if they could bend it, the wire was too thick. So on my break I used a lockpicking kit (that I had in case I locked myself out of something) to open it for them. I was called in to the back office to talk to the manager. She gave me an official warning and said that it was against company policy. I was told not to do it again. When my grandfather (who I live with) found out he got pissed at me for not following the policy. My family thinks I shouldn't have done that. I thought what I was doing was the right thing to do. Am I the asshole in this situation?",

From the conversations I've had with her, she seems to be the type to say 'oh I'm crazy' and things like that. \n\nNow, it was around October, and since the weather wasn't too cold, she was wearing short sleeves. Now here's where the problem comes along: she had self-harm scars on her forearms, but it wasn't just that. They were fresh, the blood was still scabbing over and red. I was so uncomfortable at that moment but I was too shy to say anything. \n\nMonths later, the situation was brought back into my mind when I discovered this subreddit's existence. And boy do I feel SHITTY for being uncomfortable. My friend tells me I'm the asshole for even feeling like that, since I don't know what that girl's been through. I kinda feel like since it was just a feeling (I didn't think anything bad, I was just kind of unnerved) and I didn't actually do anything that I'm not the asshole, but I still feel shitty.

At that point I told her that either she wasn't listening to me when I told her how important this was to me, or she was lying when she told me she understood. This of course kicked off a new argument. \n\nWas I an asshole for saying the sentence which kicked off the second argument?",

We're walking back to the car and he says \"I'm super hungry, we should grab some Mcdonald's or something.\" I said \"Bro I literally just offered you McDonald's.\" So I was kind of annoyed right off the bat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut anyways I'm driving him home and agreed to go through the drive-thru for him. I told him he can order since I'm not getting anything. The cashier comes on the speaker and asks what he wants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe asks for a hot fudge sundae, and she says the ice cream machine is down. He immediately says in a condescending voice \"It's down? It's 8:48 PM.\". I was like\"Dude. don't be a jerk.\" So he asks the cashier if he can do a smoothie and she says yes, but she clearly sounds annoyed. He orders some fries too, and she gives the total and says to drive up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said \"You realize this makes ME look like an asshole now right?\" because I was the one driving, and she wouldn't have known it was him ordering. He just tried to play it off and say \"Haha, but it WAS you who said it!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo instead of going to the window I immediately left and he didn't pay for or get his food. He said he was joking and asked me to go back and I said no. I just headed towards his house. I've gone out to other restaraunts with him before and it always surprises me how rude he can be towards food workers when he himself is server. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe made some excuse about it and I said \"I would think as a server, you would know food service workers don't want to be yelled at for things that aren't their fault.\" And he was again quiet after that, and I dropped him off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got home he sent me text saying he was hangry and wasn't thinking straight and thanks fr helping him save $10. I responded no worries, sorry I drove off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my wife when I got home and she thought it was super funny, and that I was a bit of an asshole but not entirely in the wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what do you think, AITA in this scenario?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I have this flatmate - let's call him Jim. I live with Jim and two others in a shared apartment. Jim and I have two separate bedrooms next to each other on one side of the apartment, while the other two have their own bedrooms on the other side. So it's only me who hears anything from Jim's room at night.\n\nJim has the tendency to stay up until 3 to 4 AM playing video games with his friends very loudly. I've asked him to at least keep quiet after 2 AM two times already, but both times he's lasted less than a month before starting back up again.  \n\nHe's complained that since his gaming friends are mostly European and he usually has classes in the afternoon he can only play with them in the middle of the night,. He's also made passive aggressive comments in the group chat about how \"the Internet is so much better in the middle of the night.\" and has lashed at out me for doing simple things like asking him to clean his dirty dishes after they've sat in the sink for a week.\n\nI'm getting the sense that confronting him directly a third time will just start something and I would rather not live in fear of retaliation when our doors don't have locks. I'm already leaving the apartment in less than two months, but finals season is next month and I don't want to be sleep deprived during that.\n\nI've tried earplugs, but I can still hear him through them. I've tried listening to music, but I can't get to sleep. Sometimes I manage to sleep, but then I'm jolted awake because my earplugs or earphones fall out during the night and I hear one of his screeches.\n\nSince I have 8 AM classes every day and have to wake up anyways, I was thinking of leaving my alarm blaring at full volume for the 15-30 minutes it takes for me to get ready, figuring if he's forced awake as early as I am, he won't stay up so late. \n\nI know it's kinda a dick move, but I'm just so tired. Literally. WIBTA?",

Every time we start having a heated conversation, instead of talking about it he just decides the conversation is going to be done and walks away.\n\nIt really bothers me because I feel like it’s disrespectful and it’s equivalent to saying that he doesn’t give a shit about what I have to say if I’m not agreeing with him. \n\nIt’s just the way he copes with being in a tense situation (by choosing to not cope with it) but I don’t think it’s productive, and the only thing it accomplishes is making my blood boil which escalates the situation.\n\nIn my mind people can have a conversation like adults and even disagree and it’s normal and healthy for every one to have the opportunity to state their opinion. \n\nBecause the way that we choose to cope with problems is just different, I can’t tell if I’m just mad so it SEEMS like he’s being immature and a jerk, or if I’m the asshole for expecting him to deal with things the way that I would.

I was looking forward to this trip for ages, but now that I'm here I am feeling homesick and I'm also physically sick with a cold/migraines.\n\nHe wants me to go to a party with him tonight. H  hates going to stuff without me. Even though I don't know anyone there and no one will be conversational in English.\n\n He is a really sweet and understanding person, so he wouldn't be upset if I told him I don't want to go. But when we talked about it today (well yesterday now) I could see that he would be disappointed.\n\nI try to make an effort to speak their language, the pathetic amount I know, but every time I get extremely anxious and feel a panic attack coming on. So yesterday I just sat there, blanking out trying to ignore my migraine, this newfound crippling anxiety, and my homesickness.\n\nIt's so beautiful here.. I want to be a good girlfriend and I want his friends to like me. So far it's been so emotionally exhausting for me. I need a chill pill but I just constantly feel this, \"what the fuck is going on\" feeling. I'm paranoid about whether I'm following cultural standards or if I'm too quiet.\n\nI ask my SO if he can interpret for me since he's bilingual, but usually he says \"Ask them in English\" or encourages me to try to speak in their language. But I get so nervous because I am not used to being bad at a language. But when I try his suggestions it doesn't always go well, and I feel sick to my stomach. I don't understand what's happening to me.\n\nTL;DR\nI don't want go to a party with my s.o where I'll have a really bad language barrier that gives me really intense anxiety.\n\nAm I an asshole if I want to stay back?\n\n\n",

      "description": "For some context, I am a senior in high school and I have broken off all contacts with a previous friend. We used to be great friends from when we were Young, but because of certain actions she's taken I now avoid her.\n\nFirst off when we were still on good terms we would talk and joke about many things, however she would tend to gossip about other friends. While she wasn't necessarily rude and disrespectful some comments were a bit disconcerting.\n\nSecondly during our sophomore year in high school we made plans to go to our winter formal as friends. However the day before she informed me she was no longer going and was going with someone else. Granted we decided to go as friends and I was perfectly fine with her going with someone she liked, but it was hurtful to be informed so late.\n\nDuring that same year she was having some car trouble and I helped her jump start her car. However the next day I learned that the car I helped jump-start was not hers and that she ran away out of state. well I was not punished since I knew nothing of her plan, I felt betrayed in a sentence since she used me like that.\n\nDuring our junior year she was having some trouble with her family. And her personality seemed to change. She started to have some falling outs with my other friends, And her comments on people became more vindictive. We still talked and hang out but there was always this growing sense of dread in the back of my mind.\n\nDuring this current year we have not talked much due to school work and getting ready for college. However on occasion we did talk but I no longer saw her as a friend. Eventually I stopped talking to her all around and avoid her. I hear different stories going on with her, and have this unpleasant satisfaction of no longer having to deal with her.\n\nbut the reason why I'm bringing this up is because last week she confronted me on why I no longer talk to her. Granted I was not kind with the words I spoke but I don't feel remorseful for avoiding her, and now she and her friends despise me. So am I the a****** for avoiding and ditching her in a sentence.",

      "description": "I’ve been afraid to post this and it’s a bit different since it’s me who thinks that I’m the asshole in this situation as others say (including my crush\" that I wasn't the asshole\n\nContext, this was about a month ago during a me spending winter recess with my mom, I was talking to my we’ll call “Turtle”, and Turtle knew that I like him as we've been close for 4 years and he's care so much as to not hurt me and loves me a lot but never made it official, he's a caring guys and always wants to help me with my problems.\n\nDuring the break, I saw tweets from Turtle and this other girl we'll call \"Lizard\" and Turtle was saying  to her \"goodnight darling\" with heart emojis around it, thinking that this might be a joke I just tried passing it off as one until I saw the response and more heart emojis shown with lizard saying \"goodnight, the one I love calls\" my heart sank and I was figuring to tell him about it the next day as he was asleep by then, I had a heart time sleeping that night.\n\nWhen I woke up I saw that he noticed me liking the tweets and he was annoyed saying \"before you freak out, this is a FAKE relationship between us in order to make her feel better\" not wanting to escalate the situation and making things worse I brushed it off and pretended that I did know such a thing and went along with my day, part of me really was mad at him and want to yell at him but I try not to think about iI.\n\nSo for the majority of the day I was in a bad mood and biting my tongue as I was beginning to break apart with my feelings being bottled up because I thought I lost him, and started crying to him about my past lovers and how awful life is for me, even though the real reason why I was so upset was because of him and Lizard, the floodgates opened when mentioned Lizard again and I had enough and told him how much it was burning me up on the inside as I saw his tweets with her and reading the bios of the two and I cried more and more.\n\nI was scared shitless as I thought I was gonna fuck things up between us but Turtle found out about how I really felt after I told him how much pain I was in when he started fake dating Lizard, he first tried comforting me saying he won't make those tweets again but I pushed him away as I told him that it doesn't make the tweets automatically disappear, he then deleted all of the tweets between her and him and removed Lizard's name from his bio and vice versa then tried calming me down.\n\nTurtle keeps on assuring me that he was in the wrong and how he wasn't thinking about me and glad that I told me because he cares about me and my mental health, but a part of me thinks that I should've said nothing and minded my own business\n\nAITA??\n\nTLDR; my crush started fake dating a woman and I ended it immediately after.",

      "description": " We're in the car and mom parks in a fast food place and pulls out her phone to watch a video. Immediately I'm hit with blaring squeakiness and screaming at top volume from the video she's watching. 15 seconds pass and she doesn't turn it down, and it's about as irritating to me as a dog listening to fireworks. So I tell her to turn it down. Admittedly I did raise my voice, but I had to or else to wouldn't have been heard otherwise.\n\nShe doesn't turn it down. She says, \"Oh, but I'm watching a video.\" So I told her there was no need for the video to be so loud. She still won't turn it down, just moved the phone away from my direction, as if that'd stop the issue. I said once more loudly \"Its hurting my ears, turn it down!\" \n\nNow she's mad at me, and starts calling me her usual names like \"negative\" and \"miserable\" and all that jazz, cool whatever. So I realize she's mad and bring up a fair point that I thought would shut this stupid situation down. I asked her if she'd play a video that loud in a public space. Her response:\n\n\"It's not a public place. Its my car, I can do as I please.\"\n\nSo this tells me she fucking knew she was being obnoxious with her volume. But I persist, and ask the question again. She calls me names n' shit once more and says she was every right to play her video in her car. I tell her yes, she does, but she should be mindful there's two people (my brother and I) and a dog (who has sensitive hearing) in the car. She says some stupid insult once more and leaves the car to get food.\n\nWas I the asshole for telling her to turn it down? ",

      "description": "Me(17m) and my best friend(18f) of 2 years are going to the same school. We are in our third year  We always secretly liked eachother but nothing happened untill about a month ago when she kissed me. She had a boyfriend at the time( still does) and told me she wanted to break up with him for a long time and im the one that makes her happy. Well one week pasess we are still making out between classes and breakes. And then  she  sudenly becomes cold. After a week i asked her whats wrong and she told me she still loves me but she cant break up with him.\n\n I said okay and asked for a little space. The next day she proceded to have a mental breakdown and told me she cant live without me. I feelt bad for her and made up with her. Now we are hanging out like the usuall but things just arent the same. We both expressed that things are a little weird and we took a little break from talking/ hanging out so much. We made a deal that if something happens and we feel like we really really need to tell eachother we would call or message eachother. \n\n She didnt come to school for the entire week and i didnt message her once but she send me messages all the time she send me about 15 memes on instagram and she would message me something on snapchat every 2 or 3 hours or she would send me a text. \n\nI still love her very much and she still looks at me with that non platonic look in her eyes and still touches and tickles me all the time. And i know we cant pretend to being just friends atleast not right now. So i decided that tommorow when she comes to school after class id ask her to have a talk with me. Id tell her that this is very hard but i dont think that this is healthy for me or for her and that we cant be just friends so we need to take a proper break to think. ",

When the bus driver said something to the effect of “I don’t really know the street numbers, I just know the areas” my dad responded with a heavily sarcastic “that’s scary”. I proceeded to give him a dirty look to which he responded with “what?”. Later when we got off the bus I kept saying “that’s scary” to him with the same tone of voice and made it clear that he was being a dick to the guy.

I didn’t think she’d be dumb enough to tell someone in our family, especially the most immature one. She got defensive and told me that she trusted our sister and told her everything, and “who would she tell anyways?” Even though my sister personally knows him and his friends. She said I was being immature, and just cause she told one person doesn’t mean she’s gonna tell anyone else. She never said she was sorry or that she shouldn’t have said anything.",

      "description": "This just happened about 10 minutes ago.\n\nDinner had just finished and as a ritual in many Irish households, tea is served straight after. My parents had just came back from America and my mother proposed an app idea. That hasn't yet been done here.\n\nThe idea is a fairly simple and if correctly implemented and would prove rather convenient. The idea itself is about checking prices between different items. My mother asked how easy would it be to implement.\n\n*This is where trouble begins* \n\nMy brother coming from a place of academia and no experience in his degree granted he finished a masters in eCommerce. Myself currently working in IT part time and studying computer science.\n\nHis point came down to there wouldn't be a huge market for this. Nobody would be interested even so how would they keep track of things. \n\nMy point was the majority of this could be done using APIs that would update in real-time, nothing fancy and rather efficient. \n\nAfter a while it came down to my mother wanting to hear his point and exclude my point. I found this frustrating as he has never worked in the area and is somehow an expert. \n\nBy the end of her questioning he kept saying market research as answer. This is even though he claimed it couldn't be done for a range of things. \n\nI pointed this out and asked if he could stop hiding behind a blanket statement such as market research. \n\nI was then interrupted by my mother saying it does not matter and looked remorseful for bringing up such a question. My brother then said \"ylmcc I have studied in this for 5 years I know what would work\".\n\nAITA for coming at this with a point of view that knows how simple the app would be and frustrating him over his inconsistency ?",

I found a glitch on one of the sites that lets you vote a unlimited amount of times and I made alot of money off of it. Eventually everyone in the server knew that i was doing that and people started accusing me of duplicating which is against the rules and threatening to get mods to ban me. I was worried about that since glitches like that arent mentioned anywhere in the server's rules and it's a gray area so I decided to give him all the money and asked him to keep it safe so i dont get greedy and waste it by gambling or if i get banned it doesn't go to waste and he agreed. Today i asked him to give me the money back cause i was making a Iron Golem Spawner farm to make more money and he refused, asked me to waste 10\\~ minutes of my time exploiting the glitch to get him alot of keys in return for my money. I refused and said that if he gives me the money first, I'll get him some keys later on. We fought like that for about 2 hours while he was insulting me by making fun of my autism, calling me retarded and so on. I said that he can keep the money but im gonna give everything he put in the base back in his base and not gonna let him access my base.

(Nobody has ever retaliated to being slapped by him because  in our culture we are expected to respect and obey our elders which he is the oldest in the group) I stayed relatively calm and told this older guy and everybody in the card game that I will 100% retaliate if he messes with me again.\n\nWe continue playing cards and sure enough outta nowhere he slaps me in the ear. So I removed his glasses and punched him in the mouth. One of his teeth was loose and his nose was bleeding pretty bad. I stood up and put him in a choke hold and asked him to call me his uncle.

      "description": "Years ago, my cousin and I were basically childhood friends (I’ll call him Dave for privacy sake). We’d always celebrate birthdays and holidays together until he, unfortunately, moved away to a different state. We were still kids at the time so we’d only be able to communicate with each other here and there if our parents called each other, since we didn’t have phones or computers of our own. Finally, this changed as we got older and we were able to connect through Facebook and text. That’s when Dave asked me out of the blue if I’d like to join him and his friends and play some video games. \n\nI loved gaming as much as he did, so I was ecstatic. I eagerly agreed and had a blast with them. We played everything from Left 4 Dead 2 to Minecraft almost every day for hours on end. I didn’t talk much when they were streaming or recording their gameplay (I was pretty self-conscious about my voice) but they didn’t seem to mind, and we had plenty of time afterward to talk and game together normally when they were done. \n\nHis friends and I, I’ll call them D. and Kat for short, all got bored of the current games we were playing and eventually moved on to Overwatch. We played there for nearly a year together before things suddenly changed. I stopped seeing Dave and his friends online and stopped receiving gaming invites from them. They most likely got bored of Overwatch too, which is fine, but they still continued to play different games without me and never went out of their way to speak with me. \n\nI thought maybe they were busy or just needed some time from me to game by themselves, but weeks had passed now without receiving a single word from them. I finally gave in and messaged Kat, just hoping to have a conversation with him and possibly reconnect over a game or two. Most of his replies were short, however, and he eventually stopped messaging altogether and left me on read. D. went out of his way to contact me though, I was so excited! \n\nMy excitement quickly diminished, though, when he cut right to the chase and asked to commission artwork from me. I’m not a professional artist by any means, but I’m good enough to catch the attention of my friends and family who will commission me from time to time. This will become a bigger issue as the story progresses. \n\nI sucked it up and did the art he requested, just to have D. go right back to not speaking with me after he received the artwork. I tried talking with Dave but the same scenario would repeat itself. I would ask to hang out with him, he would tell me ‘maybe later’, ask me for artwork, then stop replying to me. This continued for a whole year before I finally got fed up with it. I decided that I was going to be blunt with him and not take no for an answer. \n\nI contacted Dave and told him that I have never played this roleplaying game before, but I’d love to give it a try with him. Right away he tried to derail the conversation to artwork that he’d like to request from me, but I wasn’t having it. I told him that I would do the artwork, but only if he were to play the game with me. This didn’t have much of an effect on him, however, so out of desperation I offered to make his commission free of charge and to even draw his roleplaying character for him. This seemed to pique his interest, and I practically held my breath as I waited for his response.\n\nHis answer was nothing. Just a ‘maybe in the future’ and a quick question about the commission he was ordering. I have never felt more like an employee than a friend in my life up until that point. Out of anger and frustration, I blocked his email, his number, his friends, and deleted every single account ever tied to him. That included my Facebook, Discord, Snapchat, and even my DeviantArt. \n\nI haven’t seen or heard anything from Dave since. The part that hurts the most is that I’m not sure if it’s because I ghosted him and his friends so well or if it is because they don’t care enough to try and contact me. This all went down recently and I am still left with so many questions. Should I have tried even harder to connect with them? Was it because I didn’t speak very much while they were streaming? I feel like I’ll never know. \n\nBasically, AITA for ghosting my family member and his friends because they only spoke to me when they needed to commission artwork from me?",

      "description": "Throughout my life I’ve had a few close guy friends, who I knew had crushes on me, do what I would consider “out of their way” favors for me. Just things where they would offer to pay for something, walk me somewhere, give me a ride home or to get food, help me with a project, or give me something for free that normally a friend would have asked for a bit of money for. Think stuff that is just a tad more than a typical friend would be easily willing to do. \n\nI’ve always believed that I’m NTA because I don’t ask for anything (except for small things that I would ask a typical friend for as well), but I’ve started to feel more guilty about this with the most current guy who has fit this role in my life. He’s just such an amazing, nice person who I honestly wish I was physically attracted to because he’s such a genuine friend. He has dropped some hints since I’ve known him that he has a crush on me and his best friend has acknowledged it as well. I’ve never done anything to suggest that I would be interested in him and I think he very clearly knows this. Still, he is much more willing to do me a favor in comparison to my other friends and, tbh, I have started to expect these favors which is making me feel even more guilty.\n\nSo basically, AITA for “stringing along” willing men even if I heavily imply that we’ll never be more than friends?",

I totally get it, I have my issues about turning up aswell however they KNEW weeks beforehand that this rehearsal was on Mother’s Day, so they shouldn’t really be that annoyed cause it’s not like it’s a surprise. \n\nOne of the ensemble is saying how she’s not going to turn up because ‘she needs the show but the show doesn’t need her’ and bullshit like that. The sort of ‘I’m fourteen and this is deep’ crap. I tell her to grow up, if she doesn’t show she’ll be cut from the numbers. That wouldn’t be our decision but the directors and they’ve told people this.\n\nEventually I tell her I don’t care if she shows or not, she doesn’t have a solo and isn’t involved in my solo so it doesn’t affect me but I’m not about lose something I worked quite hard to get. People start assuming that I’m not going in because I ‘don’t care about the show’, which is what I never said. I tell them to read my replies properly. Im one of the youngest in the group so I’m often just looked over as immature, but they keep saying that ‘nothings changed’. So I send them a screenshot of me saying I’m going into rehearsal. \n\nMy ex boyfriend (who currently likes me but is insensitive), asked when I got so sour. I explain that if people weren’t so ignorant towards me I wouldn’t be sour.

      "description": "Let me make one thing especially clear: I am *not* a slow driver. \n\nMore often than not, when I look at a freeway, I don't see cars, I see a slalom course. I see just about everybody else moving around me at about five miles per hour too slow. \n\nMind you, I try not to be overtly aggressive -- I avoid tailgating, or making harsh swerving through traffic, or going 100+ mph, or generally calling attention to myself. \n\nBut sometimes, I lose it *just* a little bit, particular in the face of people who are, in my eyes, mouthbreathing idiots. I can't stand people failing to match speed in the fast lane, forcing those behind them to slow down to 60. Or who make a perfect horizontal line in front of me with the other cars and make graceful passes impossible. \n\nSo perhaps it's because of this that I find myself attracted to and respecting those who travel at around my pace -- those who find the freeway to be a puzzle of sorts, or an obstacle course. \n\nWhen I find these people -- usually late at night or in the wee hours of the morning, when there are fewer people -- I find myself sticking closely to them. While not exactly \"racing\" them, I try to keep up with them. Sometimes, it turns into a small group of people, forming a line that slithers its way through the gaps in the masses. \n\nWhile I flash my headlights sometimes, or *try* to wave, it's hard to gauge a reaction through the dark. And I can't help but wonder how these people think of *me.* Has anybody else felt this way about other drivers? Do they find see me as fellow company in the group of people who feel the need to get around with a little more purpose?

When I met him he was a shy, insecure and lonely boy, I have always been a relatively happy and confident, verging on cocky. I don’t and never have believed anyone should feel as he did, I decided to spend lots more time with him, as time went on, he trusted me more and more telling me stories of his depression and all of his anxieties. I felt trusted that was enough for me at the time. Since then time has past we’ve grow older and we have grown apart, still very close but I struggle to show him how I feel. Very frequently I see him teasing someone in my college, including myself. I have never been someone to take teasing to heart, unless it is super personal. Since he knows me better than anyone, he has the ability to use what matters against me. I have told him face to face on several occasions that what he says isn’t appropriate, but it is always been ignored. I don’t know how to tell him. I have always felt he doesn’t have the right to tease others, and there’s always been a feeling in my heart that, as evil as this sounds, that he uses his insecurities as way to be protect from teasing. I know it’s a childish thought, but he now has a girlfriend - he refuses to see that it’s a failing relationship. I am also currently struggling with stuff myself and have to consider that when the tables where turned it was so different. Also I he has a way that whenever I mention anything it makes me feel so uncomfortable to say anything, my old confident self has slower been crippled into a fraction of what I used to be. He’s become more and more confident which I couldn’t be happier to see, but in the process, he been draining me. \n\nI go to a relatively small college so it’ll be difficult to ignore him there and he’s friends with many of my friends. There’s such a toxic aspect about our friendship that I can’t get over. \n\nI don’t know how to tell him how I feel. I’ll repeat, I’m not a sensitive person to feel free to say whatever you what because I need complete honesty. \n\nIf you read this far thanks! But yeah aita? ",

      "description": "I'm an 18 year old boy currently at college, and I share a small apartment with my friend Sarah. She's a couple years older than me, but I've known her my whole life and she's honestly like a sister to me, it's all platonic.\n\nAnyway, about two months ago I stopped working to focus on school, and this brought my income way down. Sarah agreed to actually cover some of my rent if I did a little more of the house work while I'm around, like cleaning and stuff. I agreed, knowing it was a sweet deal.\n\nShe's out of the apartment most of the day working, leaving me alone. Sometimes she'd text me something like, \"Can you get the dishes from this morning?\" or \"Can you make sure the tub's clean?\" None of this bothered me and I was happy to help. \n\nBut recently, she's been getting really demanding with it. She expects me to clean almost everything in the house, and be the sole one responsible for chores. Her reasoning is that I'm \"only out of the apartment 10 hours a week and she's out triple that.\" If she has friends over at night, she asks me to cook for them, or same if her boyfriend's over. She tells me that because she pays a good part of my rent that it's my responsibility.\n\nI told her that I don't owe her all of this, and that I'm not her servant. Now she says I'm an asshole for doing this. ",

      "title": "AITA for asking my girlfriend questions to which she thinks the answers should be obvious?",
      "description": "Sometimes when I’m talking to my (very long distance) girlfriend she takes my followup questions the wrong way and tells me that I would know the answer if I was listening to her.\n\nFor example:\n\nSome period of time ago her roommate, Z, moved out of the apartment leaving an empty bed frame, nothing on the walls, and empty shelving and cabinets cluttering the place. Albeit I only had a five second glance at her room. I didn’t find it of note that there was nothing on the floor but there wasn’t.\n\nGF was packing up to move yesterday. She told me that she had taken everything off of the walls and that her room was a disaster area! I asked if it looked like Z’s room. I had an image of bare, empty walls and empty shelving and the question just popped out.\n\nShe told me she felt like I wasn’t listening to her because she had just told me about how it was a disaster area and that questions should have had an obvious answer and that sometimes she thinks I talk or ask questions just to fill space.\n\nI replied that, no, that question might have had an obvious answer to her but I clearly wasn’t thinking about it the same way that she was or else I wouldn’t have asked it. I told her that I didn’t appreciate being told that I wasn’t paying attention and that, if she didn’t understand how my question applied, she could have asked.\n\nMaybe I said something insulting by accident but she ended up crying and yelling at me. I’m not really entirely sure why, it was pretty overwhelming. Then she hung up on me. After some time she texted and told me that she feels like I care more about being stubborn and defensive than about how she feels.\n\nI told her that I thought we were having a nice conversation and that having it derailed because I asked a question she thought was dumb so that she could try to change my thought patterns was stubborn and that she could maybe work on the way she reacts to things. And that she didn’t seem to be considering how being told that I’m not listening, when I am, makes me feel.\n\nShe told me she tried to tell me she was upset without sounding annoyed or accusatory but that I didn’t seem to care and got defensive and “replied saying she called my questions dumb when she did not. It’s like that a lot. Maybe I’m too sensitive. She feels bad because she feels like she did a good job controlling her emotions but I shit all over her efforts”.\n\nI told her that I didn’t think she was processing what I was saying and asked her to repeat my position back to me. And that I didn’t think that she could. Then I did my best to rephrase what she was saying back to me.\n\nShe never bothered to read those messages so I called her about thirty minutes later and asked her if we could try to resolve things. And that I’d like her to read my message to see if I was right about how she feels about the situation and that I’d like to hear what she thinks I feel is. The call was kind of a mess and she ended up telling me no, she wouldn’t read it and no, she wouldn’t try to restate my position to me. And that she wanted to be alone and that I had wanted to be alone at one point so I should understand. I reminded her that what she was referring to was when she started a fight about a long ago issue which she promised to not bring up again (literally 100+ fights about this) and I broke up with her and ignored her 30+ calls over the next 12 hours until she literally flew to my city to talk to me. She told me she wanted to go so I tried to do the typical “I love you” goodbye. She hang up on me again without replying.\n\nShe proceeded to ignore my attempt to call her back, assuming that she just didn’t hear me.\n\nLater on she texted (on a different app so she wouldn't have to read my other messages) saying that she was depressed and wanted to move her India trip forward. She’s Indian and needs to go home to get her visa stamped. For a long time we’ve been talking about how I’m going to come and all of the things that she was going to take me to see. I asked for how long she was depressed and she said “today”. I asked if that’s why we fought earlier and she told me we fought because I put words in her mouth. I asked if she wanted to go home because she had a fight and she said yes. I asked if she didn’t want me to come anymore. She told me that she didn’t think about it and that it’s not always about me.\n\nI reminded her that she was talking about moving the time of a trip we were taking together due to a fight with me and that, sure, maybe it’s not “about” me but I was both part of the catalyst and the plan and that I needed to be kept in the loop in order to participate. She told me that I hadn’t even committed (which is not true) so I told her to consider this my commitment.\n\nThis isn’t the first the time trip has come up in a fight. We fought once and she told me she didn’t want me to come anymore. She ended up taking it back a few months later.\n\nAnyway, I asked if she wanted to make up and she told me she needed more time by herself. I said okay. A few hours later, while I was asleep, she told me that she wanted to make up but feels really sad. In the morning I replied that the point of making up was to fix that. I didn’t get a response.\n\nEvery morning we have a call on my walk to work. I shot her a text saying I didn’t know if she wanted me to call or not but that I was heading in. A few hours later and I still haven’t gotten a response.\n\nThe time she was referring to about me having asked a question she thought meant I wasn’t listening to was, I think, a time that she and I were going climbing at the gym (remotely). We’re long distance so we do a lot of activities at the same time so it feels like we’re doing them together. She had invited a friend to join her climbing that day but her friend flaked. Her friend flakes a lot.\n\nI asked her if she was bummed that her friend wasn’t joining and she told me that she didn’t appreciate how I always wanted to talk about sad/negative things. I told her that I didn’t want to talk about sad or negative things and how she brought it up and I only wanted to know if it bothered her, since she was still going with me. She thought it should be obvious how she felt. Maybe it should have been. We ended up fighting about how I should have thought more about if she was bummed before asking if she was bummed. \n\nAnyway, I know this was long.\n\nI feel like it’s a lot to ask me to stop and consider every follow up question carefully before I ask it to determine whether she would find the answer too obvious. I feel like a question that seems reasonable to me could seem (and has seemed) unreasonable to her for a reason I don’t even realize. I feel like active listening involves asking questions and that maybe not all of them will be the most profound.\n\nBut maybe I’m wrong. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Now, hear me out. Context is important. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my closest friends, lets call him \"W\", dated a girl for around 6 months. In high school, this is a fairly lengthy relationship. He broke up with her due to loss of feelings. For a while after the breakup, she mad multiple attempts at turning our friend group against each other, and even trying to convince a different friend's girlfriend to dump him for no reason. Also, every single day, she makes every attempt she can to piss us off, even basic things like leaving class early to steal our lunch table. Basically, she's one of the most obnoxious, narcissistic, self-centered people I've ever met. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to  present day. Another close friend, let's say his name is \"R\", now likes her. He remained friends with her through and after the breakup, despite what she was doing to our group. He asked her to prom, something we all said was an awful idea, but W said he was ok with it, as long as they didn't start dating. R agreed to this and asked her, she said yes. However, now R asks her out at least 4x a week, even though this girl has made it very clear she has no romantic interest. Whenever we mention something about her that isn't positive, he loses his shit and starts defending her vehemently. We recently also found out he tells her everything we say about her. Basically putting her over us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are all graduating within 2 months, and she is permanently leaving for college anyway (her parents are moving with her). So not only does he turn a blind eye to how awful she is, even if they did date, she's leaving soon anyway, so what's the point?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bring it up almost every day, openly saying how I feel about her and how he's acting. He freaks out every time and defends her, completely ignoring what we say. IDK how else to approach it, because it's tearing our friend group apart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My friend is going after another close friends ex, who is a complete bitch. I insult her and tell him how much of an awful decision it is every day, and he ignores it. IDK what else to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. I don't know if this is quite the right forum for this, but I thought I'd try it. ",

      "description": "First of all, this is extra, extra long. I apologize in advance. TL;DR is at the bottom, but honestly reading the entire post is kind of a requirement to truly understand what's happening. This is being typed and posted from mobile so formatting may be incorrect, I'll fix what I can.\n\n\n\nBackground: My Japanese grandfather recently passed away. I grew up in the US so I have no idea how anything works in Japan (this is important later). I recently decided to move to Japan in 2018 to be with my grandparents and work since they are old and don't have a lot of time left. My father is bilingual, English and Japanese. He was born and raised in Japan and moved to the US around 30 years old. I was born in Japan and lived there for 4 years before moving with my family to the US, I barely speak Japanese. I can ask basic questions and understand basic responses.\n\n\n\nI don't like my biological father, that's why I call him my biological father. He didn't raise me, there is no emotional connection. He had custody of my brother and I during the summer time when we were kids. He would force us to do Kumon (Japanese after school homework program) during his time with him. He was verbally abusive and some times would get slap happy when we didn't do something right. Nothing that left bruises or anything. After middle school I cut off all contact because I could. He never made an effort to reach out to me either. That was fine, I enjoyed not having to deal with his bullshit.\n\n\n\nRecently we've been talking more only because I've chosen to live in Japan with \"his\" family. He likes to refer to our family as \"My father...\" or \"My mother...\" instead of \"Your grandpa...\" or \"Grandma wants you to...\" so it seems like he's not including me in the family, but I just write that off as not being 100% fluent in English nuance and natural phrasing.\n\n\n\nThere's been a lot of paperwork recently with my grandfather, his money, plans for the funeral, etc. It's a big deal as all events like this are and a lot of preparation has to be done.\n\n\n\nAnyway, on to the main story:\n\n\n\nMy grandfather (his father) passed away last week. We had a funeral service tonight (5pm Japan Standard Time) and it went well, only two hours and it was mostly close family with some neighbors. After the service we went back to my grandmother's house and relax. As I've said before, I'm not familiar with all the customs and rituals. Considering my father can speak both English and Japanese and has knowledge about the customs and rituals, I figure now would be a great time to ask him since neither of us are busy.\n\n\n\nNow, in my experience, it's usually a great time to ask questions or talk about something when people are aren't busy. My father claims the exact opposite.\n\n\n\nI asked him about the schedule for tomorrow and what I should prepare for. He vaguely tells me about what will happen, \n\n\n\n* Wake up at 8\n* Start of the ceremony at 10\n* Cremation at 12\n* More ceremony later\n* Finish\n\n\n\nThis doesn't really answer my questions, so I ask about the specifics, \"Will it be like tonight?\" - \"How many people will be there?\" - \"Will the same monk come and do more chanting?\" - \"Will I have to stand up and do anything?\"\n\n\n\nHis response was: \"DerpHard, why don't you look it up on the internet?\"\n\n\n\nAt first I was dumbfounded, but then I remembered the kind of person he was. Still I pressed on to make an effort to get him to talk to me. To make this easier, I'll be turning this into a dialogue, M is me, D is dad.\n\n\n\n---------------------\n\n\n\nM: Why can't you just tell me?\n\n\n\nD: everything you need to know is on the internet.\n\n\n\nM: Yes, but as your son, you should teach me about family rituals, because you know, that's your job.\n\n\n\nD: Why? It's much easier if you just read it on the internet.\n\n\n\nM: I agree with you, but you are my father and I'd like to create a bonding experience.\n\n\n\nD: DerpHard, I'm relaxing right now, you had the past 4 days to ask me about these questions but you didn't.\n\n\n\nM: the past 4 days you've been busy making funeral arrangements, talking to relatives, figuring out finances, making sure everything is in order. Why would I bother you during all of that to ask you questions about the funeral?\n\n\n\nD: You know what? The best time to ask me is when I'm busy. My brain is in the right state at that moment, I'm already thinking about those things so you should ask me then. You need to learn to not bother people when they are relaxing and ask questions when they are busy.\n\n\n\nM: *scoff* that doesn't make any sense. Why would I bother someone when they are busy talking to other people and writing down information?\n\n\n\nD: That's how people do it, it's a fact.\n\n\n\nM: no, that's not a fact, I've never heard that in my life. I was always taught in every life situation not to bother someone when they are busy. Of course there's situations at work when you need to ask for directions or how to do something, but asking for **knowledge** about something is usually done when no one is busy.\n\n\n\nD: That's your opinion.\n\n\n\nM: yeah that is my opinion, but what you said is also an opinion and not a fact.\n\n\n\nD: no, it's a fact, everyone knows that.\n\n\n\nM: so you want me to ask you questions in the middle of being busy?\n\n\n\nD: yes, that's what you are supposed to do.\n\n\n\nM: Okay, I'll remember that.\n\n\n\nD: I don't know how you grew up with your mom, but maybe you need to find new friends because you don't know how the world works.\n\n\n\nM: what does any of this have to do with my friends?\n\n\n\nD: They're the people you talk to. Maybe they are asking questions when you are relaxing and that's why you don't know anything.\n\n\n\nM: That doesn't make any sense at all. My friends and the people I talk to are completely irrelevant to this conversation and have nothing to do with asking someone a question when they are relaxing. \n\n\n\nD: It does. These are the people who taught you how to ask questions and now you don't even know when to ask questions.\n\n\n\nM: You know what, forget it. I'll figure it out by myself.\n\n\n\nD: you can laugh and think what you want, but I'm just trying to teach you when to ask questions.\n\n\n\nM: You could've taken this time to teach me about the funeral ceremony happening tomorrow, but instead you decided to \"teach\" me when to ask a question.\n\n\n\nD: I answered your question, you asked me about the ceremony and I told you to find out on the internet.\n\n\n\nM: I don't want to use the internet, I've used the internet my whole life because no one answered my questions. Now that we're sitting here and literally nothing is happening right now, I want you to answer a couple questions about the ceremony. Why can't you just answer the questions?\n\n\n\nD: I'm relaxing right now, you don't ask people questions when they're relaxing.\n\n\n\nM: Alright, nevermind. Forget I ever asked anything.\n\n\n\nD: I'm just-\n\n\n\nM: No no, don't worry about it, you're relaxing right now, I don't want to bother you. It's fine.\n\n\n\nD: Everything you want to know is on the internet. Just look it up yourself.\n\n\n\nM: yep that's what I'm doing right now, thank you for your great advice.\n\n\n\n-----------------------\n\n\n\nNow, **AM I THE ASSHOLE** for bothering my own father while he was relaxing and asking questions about the family funeral? Should I have handled that differently? Personally I don't think I'm an asshole, but that's why I'm posting here. I want your opinion.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I ask my biological father about family customs and ceremony rituals and admitting this would be a bonding experience for us, he tells me to look on the internet instead of bothering him while he's relaxing. He proceeds to lecture me about the right time to ask questions instead of teaching me about the family rituals. AITA?",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago and a friend recently told me I was an asshole for doing it so I wanted to check on here. \n\nMe and a friend had been at the mall and we didnt have a ride, so we decided to go home in a cab. We asked the taxi driver how much it would cost to go to our neighborhood and he told us it would be about 15 dollars (there aren't set rates where I live). We agreed and my friend decided to pay for it. \n\nOur neighborhood is pretty big and my friend lives in the part closest to the mall so we dropped him off first. He gave me the money for the cab and we set off to my house.\n\nOn the way I could tell the can driver was unhappy that my house was so deep into the neighborhood so I told him to pull over a couple blocks before my house and decided to walk the rest of the way. I handed the cab driver the money but he started demanding more. I told him I had no more cash on me and he refused to let me leave. So I told him I'd go into my house and get the extra money. I think he must've thought the house we had pulled over in front of was mine. I left him with the money I had and just ditched the cab.\n\nAt first I thought the cab driver must have been the asshole, but thinking back I don't think we told him how far into the neighborhood we wanted to go, and I do live in a less populated section so most people wouldn't expect him to go so far.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "For reference, we are both RN’s working on different units as Charge Nurses. I’ll call her Mattie. For the past few weeks, we have had an issue with our 3-11 aides disappearing, leaving the unit and just overall not doing their jobs on her unit. On Super Bowl weekend, my aide brought Mattie’s patient from the TV room where Mattie’s aides were sitting and watching the game instead of being on their unit. The aide for the patient knew he was vomiting everywhere and still sat on her ass while my aide took him back to his room and asked me to page his aide to the room since she was obviously unconcerned about the situation. And I did page the following “CNA assistance needed to room so and so and as a friendly reminder if you are not on your designated break or lunch, you are to be on your assigned unit.” Well, Mattie gets pissed off at this and tells another nurse that she is going to report me to the DON. So I call Mattie on the work phone from my office to hers and ask what the problem is with me paving the cna. She denies that she has said anything and says explicitly that she has no problem with what I did. Immediately after this, she states to the same nurse that I must be afraid of her calling the DON on me since I called her about it. She left shortly after this so I called her on her cell. She didn’t answer so I texted this “I don’t understand what your problem seems to be with me, but I have no reason to be afraid of you or anyone else for doing my job. Your patient was actively vomiting, your aide was sitting on her ass watching the game when you allegedly couldn’t find her so if anyone should be “scared,” it should be you. Honestly we are both too old for this. You are old enough to be my mother and I’m not the one for this petty, childish drama. So just stop.” \n\nShe didn’t reply but later reported me for “making her cry” \n\nAm I the asshole? ",

The told me that it was covered under warranty, and to bring it in. I even have 2 emails from them confirming the appointment, and the warranty coverage. We dropped the car off, and after 2 days they said they could not replicate the noise and for us to come pick it up, which we did. On the drive home from the dealership, the noise came back so I got it on video, put it on youtube, and sent them the link. They saw the video, thanked me for it and said to bring it back now that they confirmed the failure. My wife dropped it off, they supplied her with a loaner, and then right before closing they emailed me saying that it's NOT covered under warranty. \n\nI've been going back and forth with the service manager all evening arguing that they should honor the original deal. It's only $253.00 out of pocket for me, but that's not really the point in my opinion. The part is only 86.00 shipped, and I have a full lift in my garage (I restore old cars as a hobby) so I am more than capable of doing the job. \n\nAm I the asshole here for expecting them to honor what they promised me?

      "description": "So.... I don’t really know if this is a common occurrence or just something that happens with jobs as I haven’t had much luck with them over the years but I’ll just try and summarise it the best I can.\n\nI applied for a part time position in a call centre and about 2 hours later I got an email saying I’d passed the first stage and that I’d be getting a phone call shortly to discuss the phone interview stage. I was clearly excited for this as I’ve been struggling with jobs for almost 3 years now due to stress and anxiety of college not working out for me.\n\nWhat made me even more excited is that I received TWO emails stating that I’d passed and that they can’t wait to speak to me so I thought that might have been some good luck.\n\nSo I’m sat there, waiting for this call and it comes through and I’m nervous but answer and boy oh boy... a short intro to tell me that yes indeed it is the company I was expecting and verifying who I am.\n\nHere’s where I get a bit lost, this guy starts immediately grilling me and asking me why I didn’t answer his calls in November and I was completely caught off guard at first but told him that I had been given another opportunity at the time where I was actually training in another job that I thought I was going to get so I thought there was no point in starting anything else in another job so I just stopped answering the calls (must have been like 2 calls at most) because I assumed that’s what people do when, y’know, they get another job or assume they are.\n\nSo I told him that and got nothing more than an ‘mm’ in reply and then straight away moves on and says ‘why didn’t you answer my calls in January?’. Now I was just confused at this point because I didn’t apply to this company at all at any point in January and I know that for sure because I was having medical problems back then so I told him that I genuinely don’t know what he’s talking about and that I didn’t apply in January.\n\nHe then basically tells me that they won’t be accepting my application anymore and that I’m not welcome there? I’m genuinely... so confused.\n\nLike I said I’m new to jobs and I know I probably should have just rang him up in November and told him I have another job lined up but basically banning me from ever working there because of it?\n\nIt’s seriously demotivated me a little bit because I honestly don’t understand what I’ve done so wrongly, especially because I was hopeful and expecting a great phone call and I was just put down.",

      "title": "AITA for choosing to \"ghost\" someone rather than explain why I felt uncomfortable?",
      "description": "I started having text conversations with this married guy. I met him once, back in college. Since then we've just admired each other from afar on social media. Until one day we struck up a convo and I decided to give him my phone number, thinking hey, why not, I could use more friends in my life.\n\nOn and off since this past summer we texted, but it got more frequent since the beginning of this month. We exchanged favorite songs and talked about TV shows, sending occasional (PG) pics on Snapchat. He started sending snaps of himself playing guitar and singing to me. Thats when it got weird.  I'll admit, I was enthusiastic the whole time. I thought, hey, this guy's pretty rad. He's big into music, so maybe it isn't too weird for him to just be sending these kind of \"more intimate\" snaps.. until he said \"he's never done that for anyone else before\". During our last convo (which took place over Snapchat) I suggested we grab a bite to eat some time soon. Well in that same night, he kept showering me with compliments. \"You're so cool / unique / rad\", \"You're way too good to be talking to me\" etc etc. Really odd things to be saying to someone that you just want to be friends with. I started to regret inviting him out to eat. Let me emphasize again.. he's MARRIED. He just had his anniversary too. Not ONCE did he bring up his wife in conversation. I brought it up just to congratulate him.\n\nThe convo was getting more complicated (long chunks of text to each other), and I was starting to feel like it was getting too serious and personal (not sexual).  It was getting late so I put my phone down to try to sleep. Twenty minutes later, he's STILL messaging. That's when I sort of went into panic mode. From personal experience, when a guy I'm not romantically interested in messages me later at night, it's never good. So I never opened his last messages, because I don't want Snapchat to show it as \"opened\". So I left it. All because I didn't quite know how to say \"Hey, I know you want to be friends, but you're married. Is your lady comfortable with this?\" It sounds simple in theory to say, but I don't know. I chose the route of \"ghosting\" because I just had a bad feeling in my gut if the convo were to continue. I think I didn't actually WANT him to reassure me that it was ok, just so we'd actually hang out. Truth is, at that point, I no longer wanted to hang out. The interest in being friends just kind of left after seeing the way he kept trying to talk to me.\n\nHere's where the guilt comes in. A friend mentioned something the other day about how \"you're basically a coward if you ghost someone, because it means you can't actually express your true feelings\". Well, my argument is that, you don't owe people explanations all the time. If you feel uncomfortable in a situation, it's perfectly fine to ghost.\n\nBut... there's a voice in the back of my mind that's saying, \"is it, though?\"\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Get ready for a therapy session, cause here we go:\n\nMy mom has had alcohol addiction problems almost my entire life. Growing up I had almost no friends and so she was my deepest confidant. Then I got old enough (mid to late high school) and realized that she had been drunk essentially my entire childhood. She had been under the influence driving me for hundreds of miles to campgrounds (one time on a cliff, it's the only time I knew what was happening during tho), under the influence when I cried on her shoulder, under the influence when I wanted advice.\n\nMy dad thought tough love would work and that's how he handled it once I (the youngest of the kids) was aware of it. She's gone to rehab, halfway houses, 12step, all if it. My dad went into crippling debt to help her and despite that he kept us afloat. My childhood memories have shifted from my mother being my best friend to my father being a man who worked non-stop despite problems to give us the best life possible. I cherish him for this.\n\nMy mother and I have had a strained relationship since I left highschool. She's tried to guilt, pressure, and bribe me to include her in my life. Knowing how deep seeded my distrust of our relationship is, I get angry easily and now that my dad is in his 70s, I get enraged that she manipulates him. He's basically given up on helping her and now just tries to hide it. \n\nMy husband and I made an offer in hopes of repairing this relationship. They come buy property here where 100% of his family is (*my* family too, in laws or not) and we would live on the property in a separate house and help them as they are no longer capable of being 100% independent. In return they would be near their incoming grandchild and try to have that bond restored. I'm from here, so it was really just asking them to come home. \n\nThey eagerly accepted, bought acreage with two houses and began moving. My husband and I agreed to move into to our house early (serious repairs required) so that they could have our rent as the mortgage was at the top of what they could afford. \n\nWe have since realized we are getting the short end of this. I expected most of it, but a few things bother me. My father, once calming and logical and doting, has turned to blame me for everything my mother does. She was required to stop drinking or not see the baby, end of story, and she agreed to it beforehand. She has not, and my father blames me and my trust issues as the reason she hasn't stopped. He is aggressive and hurtful in ways he never was before. \n\nI will not deny that I am firm, blunt, and have no patience for her gerrymandering. I see it for what it is and don't let her manipulate me like she does my older sister.\n\nNow that I am very much pregnant, the pressures and blame they have placed on me have become overwhelming and I'm starting to sleep all day on my days off, etc. I know that I have the power to change myself and so does my mother. So when she tries to blame me, I hold firm. Yet I still don't have reliable water, a shower, washer and dryer, or even fucking floors in parts of my house. I am five months pregnant. I am grumpy and upset and tired of her bullshit. The physical issues our house only add to it. \n\nI can't help but see my mother as useless, having never worked consistently and blaming my dad for everything while being jealous and wanting anything anyone has for herself. I have worked since I was 14 and been independent since the day I left highschool. I'm not perfect, but I have never let myself fall on others to save me because I see it in my mother and despise it.\n\nThis is not what we signed up for.\n\nI would like to think you'll say I'm NTA, but sometimes even my husband says I'm making things harder. That's surprises me because he's been so supportive this whole time. Yet he has told me on several occasions that I am a terrifying when I'm mad and I'm *always* mad at my mom. But he thinks her behavior is wrong too.\n\nI don't expect to change my mother's behavior, but I intend to change mine if I must. So please tell me, AITA?",

      "description": "Ok, so the title may automatically make me NOT sound like the asshole, but allow me to explain.\n\nMy friend, we'll call her A, has divorced parents. She is usually with her father, but of course still visits her mother sometimes. A loves her Dad more than you can imagine. They have a lot in common, and they can always make each other laugh. A's mom, on the other hand...that's a different story. A still loves her mom (I think) but definitely not as much as her father. Her mom has a boyfriend that annoys the shit out of A, they don't have much in common, and A generally isn't happy around her mom for many other reasons that I have forgot (Yeah, there's a lot of reasons, and it's not easy to keep track of them).\n\nOne day during lunch, A was talking about her mom being a bitch to her and stuff like that. The following conversation went something like this:\n\nMe: I'm glad you're around your dad more than your mom.\n\nA, in an offended tone: Why?\n\nMe: ..Because..your mom doesn't seem like the nicest person... (I get nervous when people seem offended by what I say, and I kind of just spit out words. I basically meant that I knew she was happier around her father, which is why I said my first line of dialogue.)\n\nA, even more offended: You don't get to say that about my mom. You don't even know her. I can say that stuff because she's my mom, but you can't. * Walks away angrily *\n\nI didn't know what just happened. I later tried to explain what I meant, but it was no use. She was still mad. I never actually meant to say that her mom was a bitch or anything, but it just kind of happened anyway because my brain doesnt like confrontation. Am I the asshole here?

      "description": "So recently I've received some student loans and have been using this money to buys stuff online, books usually. It's interest free and I don't need to pay it back until I earn a certain amount so what I buy really doesn't matter. I go through books really quickly and order new ones every couple days. My older brother is at home and he's usually the one that has to take them in. Recently he and my older sister have been commenting on the sheer volume of stuff I've ordered in an attempt to shame me. My brother has been saying that he \"knows all the delivery drivers because they're here every single day\" and that it is an \"inconvenience in his life\". He also states that the mail man has been getting pissed off with me, but when is spoke to him today he seemed pretty chill. Today when my sister came home from work and she found out that I had another delivery today she said that I was being \"selfish\" and that I need to stop \"breaking the mail man's back with some many books\" (they aren't that heavy). My brother then said that it is an \"inconvenience\" in his life that he has to answer the door and put whatever I got in my room. I brought up the fact that back in summer I slept in and missed a package for my sister and that they yelled at me for it, but they said \"that was different. You should have been up.\" (they also shame me for how much I sleep and have done for the past couple of months, but that's a different story). After they said that I walked away  and told them to shut the fuck up. I should also add that whenever I get something my brother like to hide it and not tell me it's arrived.\n\nI know this I really petty but I honestly need to know if I'm the bad guy here. I feel that since the mail man is already delivering letters to our house that it really doesn't matter if he has to carry a book or two. Am I wrong for thinking this? ",

The manager’s response was to demand a doctor’s note stating the reason for her absence in addition to the date she’d be cleared to return to work.\n\n   Is she the asshole for thinking that her general manager is being unprofessional?

      "description": "TLDR: friend of mine and I got arrested because he had drugs, I'm getting punished, he is ignoring it and I have every intention of squealing on him.\n\n\\-----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was driving his car across country, pulled over for speeding, he had drugs, but since I was driving, I got hit with felony possession as well. Despite him telling the cops it was his. ( Reason why I was driving was because he was too fucked up from the night before ) When the cops asked me, I said 'No', and the cop said 'Sounds like a yes to me' and cuffed me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDrugs really aren't my thing, I've tried them sure, but that was limited to pot, which was only when other people had it, never even bought any for myself before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe both took a plea deal,  2 years probation and dropped from felony charges to misdemeanor. part of the deal we both got into was that we had to report in person to the city we got busted in, a 10+ hour drive from where we both live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do my part, stay sober, pay my fines, play by the rules, check in when i'm supposed to, keep my head low. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend, drunk every weekend, Continues to do drugs, gets angry and mutters about how he wants nothing more to see that cop dead, dumb shit like that. Has all but told me it was my fault we got arrested. Constantly says one of us should have took the blame and claimed the drugs, heavily implying that I should do it, because now he is worried about losing his government job, and \"it doesn't really matter\" if I get arrested and stuck with felony charges. Even has told me that if his boss discovers his record ( apparently they do regular background checks ), and contacts me, that I should say it was all mine and he didn't do anything wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend makes 6 figures and doesn't take anything seriously, I make a salary that would make a science teacher in a oklahoma public school feel rich. All this has cost me my entire savings, cleaned out 10 years of 401k investing, maxing out credit cards, and i'm still in debt to the tune of several thousand dollars. Living paycheck to paycheck previously now has me considering selling my car to help pay for some of this.Each visit cost me an additional $400 in flying to the city, hotels, fines, etc. I could drive, but that would require at least an extra day off work, that I don't have the vacation time for. Life hasn't been easy, while my friend bitches harder than I does, but the financial punishment is nothing for him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get a call to go up to meet with my Probation Officer, make the arrangements, and go up. My friend never heard from them. My probation officer has no idea what crime I did to end up there, I tell them what happened. They scheduled me for my next visit.  Keeping pretty quiet and not giving any more info than asked about, I play my hand and I ask my PO why my friend hasn't had to come up yet. They tell me they have no idea who he is, despite us both having the same PO. some time goes by and he has never heard from them. All while continuing his behaviour, saying how lucky he is that he doesn't have to go up there, continuing his current behaviour, and being a dick to me for suggesting that he contact them because they can easily fuck him over if they see he hasn't checked in like he was supposed to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes I understand that by knowingly driving a car with drugs in them I committed a crime. Not disputing that. But I am 100% bitter about it, and hate that my friend is effectively getting off scott free and continues to imply its my fault, and rubs it in my face that I have to spend the time and money to go visit when he does not all while he is constantly breaking the conditions of parole and is even stupid enough to continue to do drugs all this time. \n\n\\-----\n\nNext time I go up I have every intention of being more direct asking why my friend hasn't had to come up, why I have to when he doesn't, knowing full well it could cost him his job, his income, and possibly even face serious felony charges facing 5-20  years.\n\n  \nIf I do this, am I the asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm using the term 'friend' very loosely now. We text in a group chat but that's about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "(This will most likely be different than what you usually see but please bear with me)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for some background, I've been roleplaying with this group (of eight) for about 3ish years now and the problem was indeed something that was going on for a while, but only with these past months have things gotten worse. For the entire duration of our time together, myself and I believe a few others, considered each other to be friends. And for a while we have had a problem with OP(overpowered) characters in our group and we've come to the conclusion that they're fine as long as they don't ruin anyone's fun/mess with other people. We also have run into the problem have having different styles of roleplaying(the ways people approach things while roleplaying) conflict with one another. Usually things can be resolved and forgotten. We \"try\" our best to treat everyone equally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem with me however is that my \"roleplay style\" and character are disliked by \"everyone\" but in reality it's only hated by two people who have taken it upon themselves to \"be the leaders\" who both greatly hate me. They constantly bring it up and demand I change my roleplay style and character or else they'll kick me from the group, BUT one of them interferes with my ideas or action with their own \"op character\" and another member does almost the same things as me and yet they get next to no warnings/demands like I get. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdmittedly these problems of my characters being \"broken\"(too strong) have been going on for a while but the same problem has been happening for a while for everyone and I was a much bigger asshole in the past but have gotten in better and some of them have admitted that. At this point whenever they bring it up or complain about it I will just ignore them, give them the bare minimum response, or in rare occasions try and hold a conversation which ends in a large argument that makes me not want to change even more because I see it as them being unfair. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have gotten better and tried to change the way I roleplay and my character to best suit them in the past but now I'm done.     \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I'm used to people never remembering what I like or don't like because it's been like that my whole life.\n\nI don't know why this is what made me react, but my sister ordered subway sandwiches for me, my brother, and my mom but she put things my brother likes on mine, even though I always tell them I don't like balsamic vinegar or onions.\n\nSo when I got the sandwich I wasn't able to eat it because the onions were so strong that they over powered anything else. At first I said it was fine, but after a few minutes I got incredibly mad, threw the sandwich in the fridge, and said I wasn't going to eat it because I hate onions.\n\nNow everyone is mad at me because of this. But I'm not mad over just a sandwich. I'm mad because they do this stuff all the time and I always have to act like its fine or I'm \"overreacting\" and \"being rude.\" I went off on fb about it, which I know I shouldn't have done, but I don't think it's fair that I'm expected to be calm and not bothered by anything all the time.\n\nMy sister claims that I wasn't clear in my texts and that I didn't seperate the orders for me and my brother, but I absolutely did seperate them!\n\nI told her that I wanted a BMT. And in the text after that, after a few texts from her confirming my order, I said \"[insert brothers name here] wants blahblahblah.\" After that I asked for a dr pepper with no ice. But I know for a fact that I seperated the orders just fine. She just didn't want to be blamed for getting it wrong and even tried to blame it on the staff at Subway, saying \"They would have gotten it wrong anyway\" which just pissed me off even more.\n\nI'm not the type who shows emotions much because whenever I do they act like I'm being overly sensitive.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to eat the sandwich and getting mad over this?",

I nodded. \n\n“I am Varsity.” He said. He started to move towards the locker, but I said, “I was here first.” That seemed to make him move, but I definitely felt bad afterwards.

I am currently working abroad and supporting my mother and little brother with what I am capable of. \n\nMy brother has had it rough for a long time now, he got a divorce last year, and is barely making ends meet. Now to add to that, he hasn’t been the most responsible person - so here is where my girlfriend thinks I should not take it lightly.\n\n3 months ago he messaged me and asked me to  lend him some money because he wrecked his friends car and needs to fix it. And his friend really needed the car and hence he was facing a big problem. He said he will pay me back come March and I said ok and sent him the money.  I honestly do not expect to be paid back, so it is all forgotten. Please keep in mind that I do what I can and I do not make crazy money that I can just dispose of; as I mentioned earlier, I support my mom and my little brother (15M) monthly.\n\nMy girlfriend was against this idea because she believes that he should be responsible for his own actions and when she asked me if he paid me back, I said no and I am not expecting it either. She thinks that this whole act of “jumping to the rescue and helping out of goodwill” isn’t cute. Bare in my mind that she totally supports the fact that I support my mom and brother.\n\nSo to conclude, AITA for taking this lightly and holding my brother to his word? ",

I confronfed her about this and told her that even if I had a girlfirend, I am simply too busy in the day to reply fast to her. \n    This started her asking me if I like her and I told her not that way...just as a friend. This started a lot of fights between us for a few days and in the end I got fed up and told her the real reason i won't  date her. She is 144 cms and I really do not like dating a girl who is that much shorter than me (180), it's just my preference and I was always sure to not flirt or lead her on.\n      I confessed to her that I do not like to date girls on the shorter side, she got really offended and yelled at me for not dating her only because she is short. She won't talk to me now. \n   I feel bad for confessing to her why I do not like her but I feel like nothing else would have have stopped these arguments and I wanted to save the friendship (haha).

Now this is what's been going on I guess you could say im sheltered and most common sense things go over my head and she's clear to point it out seeing how she gets so upset at me. Be it little things like if I use a broom facing the bristles the wrong way or if I microwave my food differently then hers. She constantly asks me to do things for her which I don't mind but then she gets mad because she has to ask me to do them. In my opinion I expect her to do them until she asks me. Also I'm slower than most people (physically and verbally) I don't pronounce things correctly and sometimes she makes fun of me for it which hurts my feelings. I can't go fast because of my weight and I try to but every time I do I get clumsy. Maybe I'm overreacting but it feels like the right thing to dom because I'm unhappy.",

      "description": "This May, I became a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. For those of you who don’t know, that degree can cost up to 300K. I’m pretty much drowning in student loan debt, but it’s all mine, my parents did not help whatsoever. I became pregnant last year and took some time off to have my daughter. She’s the light of my life and I don’t regret my decision for a second, but completing my clinical year with a child under the age of one was fucking grueling. But I did it. I didn’t yet mention that I went to school in Ireland, so I had no family to help through the year, no car, and a shitty one bedroom with your typical predatory Dublin landlord.\n\nI’m proud of myself and my accomplishments. I don’t think a lot of people could have persevered like I did. I’m grateful that I was able to achieve my dreams and overcome so many obstacles. It just sucks that no one in my family seems to give a flying fuck.\n\nI got back to the states after my finals and started my new job as a veterinarian after a two week break. I didn’t even get to walk at my graduation because I couldn’t afford the round trip flight to Dublin. I’ve been an associate vet for almost 6 months and my parents have yet to even come visit my office.\n\nMy parents wanted me to become an MD. A veterinarian has a silly job to them because they feel that animals don’t matter as much as people do. My older brother is the hero in the family, an Iraq veteran turned hometown cop. We took trips all over the states to visit whatever base he was stationed at when he was in the army.\n\nRecently I kind of lost it on my mom. I don’t even remember how the subject came up, probably because it’s constantly in the back of my mind. I broke down about how I felt like my becoming a doctor went largely unacknowledged. She asked me what I wanted, and said that she “didn’t have a party because she knows I hate being the center of attention.” I told her that I just wanted money, if they weren’t going to give a shit then I wanted money so I wouldn’t feel so financially suffocated.\n\nShe gave me a check. It felt gross. I feel like I emotionally blackmailed my parents into giving me 3K.",

      "description": "I'm in my final year of high school, about three months away from graduation.  In September I met a student now attending my school.  We had a really, truly lovely relationship for a good long time.  Unfortunately, I was manipulated into not being faithful with my partner and we eventually split.  However, we remained friends and they made sure to inform me of goings on with them.  There was a person who we'll call John who we had both agreed to avoid after he inappropriately touched them in school, and some time later, inappropriately touching them in his house without consent.  In fact, when we were together John would frequently message my partner, saying how pretty she was, how he was struggling with depression and send them photographs of his self inflicted wounds.  He didn't approve of us being together and it was his mission to split us apart.\n\nFour weeks ago, my ex began a romantic relationship with John.  I don't know whether it was out of pity, or if he had done something to manipulate them, or if they actually developed feelings for each other.\n\nI tried to not let it bother me, but I kept thinking of all the conversations that we had.  About what a bad person John was.  This really wasn't about jealousy, rather keeping my friend safe.  Had they forgotten about what we talked about?  Seeing my ex and John together became very trying, so much so that I fell into a serious bout of depression.  This all boiled down to one lunch hour two weeks ago.  John and I were arguing about how he likes to ruin people's food.  It's regular for John to throw people's food that they're eating, or put gross things into it so they don't want to finish it.  Everyone gives John shit for it and he just cackles.  He responded to me, **\"Well, at least I didn't ruin somebody's life.\"**  I responded **\"Well, at least I'm not an abuser.\"**  This shut John right up.  The room was completely silent.  My ex was visibly angry and left the room to talk to someone.  When they returned, I made a big show of talking to them.  I said **\"Hey, I just wanted to let you know that you look very pretty today, but I'm very sad.  Do you want to see my scars?\"**  This was obviously way too far over the line, considering what I had just said.  My ex-partner told me to go fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm ignoring both of them.  I'm honestly just not interested in their drama, but they keep trying to involve me in it even though I've stepped out.  I have deleted all my social media, but life at school is proving to be very difficult, even if I graduate soon.  John and my ex have broken into my locker to leave a bag of yogurt, and are consistently saying very mean things behind my back.  Even when admin intervened to talk to John about his crimes, he is still as smug and rude as ever.  I don't even want my friend back.  I've said my piece and whatever they do isn't my business.  I just want to graduate.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hey guys, first time OP here. \n\nSo my SO (25f) had her Christmas party this past weekend. When she found out about it, she was excited and wanted me to go. I too was excited because I finally get to meet all the people shes always talking about and it's nice to get out and be social. \n\nLeading up to the Xmas party, her work had an employee dinner the week prior. Now, I know she hangs out with a group at work and said that she was going to be late, which is fine. But that whole day, she hardly messaged me at all until way later in the evening, Which is odd for her since we generally text throughout the day. She had left around 2-3, I texted her at about 6:30pm just asking how dinner was and didnt get a reply till 9. She said she ended up at her work with the girls and they started drinking and that she wanted to as well. She asked if it was okay to stay the night.  I told her that I hadn't heard from her all day and I had to be at work for 7am. Since she drove my car, I said it's not the best idea because I work early and that she cant just ask me last second to stay somewhere when you cant even communicate with me in a reasonable fashion. She continued to lose it on me and said I ruined her night. \n\nThe next day, she made a big deal out of her dinner. I explained that I just needed to be told a little in advance, so just in case she drank too much, that i could make arrangements for someone to watch our 4 year old and i can get to work on time. She called me controlling and manipulative and said it's probably best I didnt come. Well, she goes without me, essentially does the same thing and doesnt talk to me. I told her that I was really hurt that I was uninvited because I was supposed to be included and was excited about going. She tells me she did nothing wrong and that she uninvited me because she wanted to have a good time with her friends and thought I'd ruin it. \n\nSince that day, I have hardly talked to her and refuse to engage her in a meaningful way. I think it's not okay to disregard your SO feelings and she has to make reasonable effort to apologize, which she hasn't. She expects me to act like everything fine when it's not. I'm pissed off and hurt and I refuse to pretend like things are cool between us. AITA?",

      "description": "Here’s some backstory on this: I(ME) and my close friend(CF) were friends with this girl(G).\nThis happened last year. All of us like to draw, and not to brag but I thought I was the best of the class. CF was just a rookie and G was straight up copying from mangas. I’m also a people pleaser and I’m kinda sensitive. G also likes Undertale, talks back to the teacher, criticizes my art when hers is worse and acts ‘depressed’. In reality, she draws sharp-ass chins and twig-like bodies but she thinks she’s ‘the best’ at drawing. We’re all Asian in an English course I can’t tell you about, which means we eat and sleep in our class. G wants to be a manga artist in Japan some day.\n\nSo, one day when I wasn’t friends with G yet, I saw G’s drawing cuz she was showing it off, it looks weird and copied but I ignored it. This continues but I didn’t care at first cuz loads of my past classmates and present classmates do this.\n\nNext, I saw CF showing everyone a drawing her friend (not from class) made. The next day, G comes to school with the same looking picture but it’s badly drawn, I start to get annoyed and made some lightly critical comments. G receives it and said she’ll fix her drawing, but she didn’t.\n\nThen, I talk to G about OC’s(Original Characters for non-artists) and she showed her’s to me. She had 3 OCs and all of them were too OP and Mary Sueish like one was a demon assasin with a deep backstory, one was an angel loved by everyone and they’re gay and they like each other and can genderbend and bla bla bla... stuff like that. I criticize her art and her OC, she says she’ll fixed it but absolutely nothing was changed except that they had a child who is half-demon, half-angel and can genderbend and the angel was now a half-forest nymph half-angel. (Sorry if this is long, it just stress me out as an artist.)\n\nAfter that, I talk to CF and another art friend about G’s ‘art’. They completely agree with me and made some comments like: ‘She doesn’t receive criticism well.’ or ‘Her OC’s are too OP.’\n\nOne day, I finally snap because she just showed me a notebook full of copied drawings, I finished my lunch and approach G, who was sitting on the floor talking to CF about anime, I sit next to them. I can feel the uncomfortableness oOzInG from G because she doesn’t like me nearing CF cuz CF was the only one who actually wants to talk to her. We talk for awhile cuz I didn’t wanna be aggressive, I wanted to help G. I then bring  up the topic of art. I lightly mention a sentence about G’s art and how she should stop copying but she heard it. She stood up and talks about how she’s ‘referencing’ and getting ‘inspiration’ from other people’s art.\n\nThis was my first time dealing with someone like this because Asians are actually very nice and sucks at drawing. I stood up, CF awkwardly watches in the background but at least I have a witness. I confront her about the fact that she’s straight up copying other people’s art and that she didn’t accept criticism. She starts to yell and everyone around us walks away or ignore us. The teacher wasn’t here, she would often come late so no one stopped us.\n\nG: It’s not copying! I’m just (heavily) referencing from other people because it improves my art!\n\nME: No it doesn’t, I’ve seen your art and it doesn’t look like the copied art.\n\nG: IT’S NOT COPIED!! IT DOES IMPROVE MY ART BECAUSE IN 4TH GRADE, I DREW SO BAD BUT WHEN I START REFERENCING, MY ART WAS BETTER!! \n\n(yeah right, your OCs hair looks like a fake anime wig stick together poorly by used glue, the head is bigger than the body so it’s starting to look like Stewie from Family Guy but bigger and uglier, the joints are so thin I dunno how the character supports itself with that big-ass head, the eyes are just fully black with two white dots lolololololololol, I didn’t actually say that cuz I’m afraid to hurt her feelings)\n\nME: It doesn’t look the same, y’know? If ya don’t believe me, you can compare your OCs with your copied notebook.\n\nG: FOR THE LAST TIME, IT WASN’T COPIED! YOU HAVE NO PROOF!\n\nG storms out the class room. I sat down on the floor and look at CF.\n\nCF: Yeah, her art is copied from mangas cuz she wants to be a comic creator or something in Japan, but I doubt she’ll even survive a day in Japan, due to her Japanese being only from anime and that her art is copied, everyone will certainly call her out.\n\nME: I know, and if no one calls her out, she’ll still receive some criticism, she doesn’t take criticism well  and her only plan was to be a manga designer, nothing else.\n\nCF: She doesn’t like criticism because she’s too proud of her art...\n\nWe continue rant about G until she came back. The next day, we were all buddies again but I still despise her art. \n\nI know that there was a happy end and all that but I feel guilty about insulting someone’s art, even if their copying. That’s why I came to Reddit to ask you, Am I The Asshole?\n\nPlot: A girl from my class starts stealing art and I confronted her about it with support from CF. She got angry and had a little tantrum. We all became friends after that but I still feel guilty.\n",

Say anything or have a differing opinion of him, he'll ban or time you out from speaking. \n\nThe moment Discord was gaining traction I quickly made a server and gathered my friends to use that instead. I was actually quite chill and never timed anyone out and always just asked who joined the server and that's it. He joined the server and noticed the server is to spite him (making fun of him and his ways, childish but he did pissed me off enough to make my own server). \n\nSo I was playing with my mates but he gives the shittiest advice and always sucked his own dick. Like \"you should have gone back the same time as me.\" \n\"I did\" \n\"You should have gone back earlier than me because I am *faster*\" \n\nHe is sucking his own dick and doesn't let anyone else have a word in. I just had enough after that encounter and just memeing him after he was having a bad time in game, quoting his past lines such as \"I'm going to be in diamond in a month.... it's been 6 months since he said that and still silver 4\" and \"lowest on the damage charts again, you sure you dont want to play a solo game?\" And ofc \"maybe if you stfu and stop telling me how to play based on bad advice and stop sucking your own dick for each thing you do that's semi decent , maybe you'll get better at the game and make us actually like playing with you.\" \n\nFriend said I might have gone on the asshole way about this but he is starting to irritate me when he opens his mouth. AITA for saying this?",

      "description": "So I have a friend who I go way back with. I’m at his house almost every week. Last time I was there, his mom mentioned that they got a new board game. Having played the game, I told them I’d love to play it with them, however I also mentioned that there was one flaw in the game that was overpowered for anyone who knew it. I didn’t tell them what the trick was, I just let them know that it existed. My friend’s mom was very angry with me for letting them know there was a flaw with the game. I spent over an hour explaining them the game and played a practice game with them. The friend’s mom claims that I ruined a game that she spent 45 USD on in order to spend quality time with her family. She says that the family can’t truly enjoy the game now, knowing that there’s a trick that is overpowered. The family discovered the trick from playing pretty quickly. My friend told me that his Mom wants an apology for ruining a game they spent hard earned money on. I apologized, but I’m not so sure that what I did was soooo wrong, and I think her reaction was a bit extra. Am I the asshole, or is she overreacting?",

      "description": "My[14] birthday was yesterday so last weekend me and two friends(A&amp;B) got together to hang out eat. \n\nThe day after that, we were at a meeting thing for an after school activity and B told me that as soon as he got home, his brother ate his leftovers. My other friend(C) asked about the leftovers, and I told her that it was nothing. She asked again so I told her that B was talking about leftovers from Olive Garden.  She got kinda upset and asked more about it, so I told her about the day before. She acted fine until ten minutes later, she started crying. This kinda annoyed me (being honest) because she pestered me about details so I had to tell her. (I was planning on not telling her because she wasn’t invited, didn’t want to be a douchebag) \n\nShe asked me why she wasn’t invited and I told her that I didn’t want to talk about it in the middle of this meeting in front of the entirety of my friend group. A few minutes later she got up and left the room, I figured she went to the bathroom, but after like ten minutes, it was obvious she didn’t. \n\nI asked one of the (3) leaders where she went and no one knew, so for the next fifteen minutes we had to pause the meeting and look for her. C was nowhere to be found in the building, and I was the only one who had her number. She said that she was fine and she went home. After one of the leaders called her ma, it was discovered that C had texted one of the leaders who didn’t have their phone with them, then texted her ma and got a ride home. \n\nLater that night C texted me asking why she wasn’t invited, all that stuff. I just said that she wasn’t invited because there weren’t enough seats in our car. C said that she didn’t believe that was the reason why, so I asked her what reason it was, and she didn’t text me back. \n\nThe next day at school, I didn’t talk to her more than I had to until lunch, when she mentioned she was pissed at me to another friend. I didn’t say anything and just read some book until the bell. \n\nThe next day after that, in choir I leaned my head back to talk to the people behind me and C flicked my neck. If you’ve never been flicked on the neck while you’re leaning back in a chair, it really freaking hurts. I yelled at her but didn’t get her trouble. Literally everyone else was laughing except for the other altos because they were the only ones close enough/ paying attention to know what happened. In lunch, C asked me to do something so I flipped her off and started talking to my other friend (A) next to me. She got up at left and apparently, (I learned this like two periods later while getting ready for gym) sat down and started telling a whole bunch of girls from our school how pissed she was at me. I try to have good relations with people from my school, so this kinda made me mad. \n\nThat pretty much brings us to the present. I was just wondering AITA because she quit one of the after school things three days before state competition. So, am I?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my BFs ex that we're together",
      "description": "So me and my boyfriend have been together for almost a year. He broke up with his ex two years ago, after he cheated on her with me (it was a one time thing, not a long-term affair). I know, asshole move from both of us. It sucked, they split. After about a year, BF and I reconnected and decided to start over and date. We have been serious for almost a year now and are very happy. We don't live together, he has a apartment, that he shares with two roommates.\n\nOne of his roommates had planned a birthday party for this weekend. A couple of days ago she told my BF that she had invited his ex. He was pretty surprised, but apparently the roommate had kept it secret that she was still good friends with her (she is super non-confrontational and avoids uncomfortable talks if she can manage). She asked whether my BF had told her about our relationship and he said no. Neither had she (avoiding the unpleasant topic). So she told my boyfriend: \"Then make sure that \"dirtysecret\" doesn't show up, I don't want any drama.\"\n\nBF told her that he really didn't want to hang out with his ex to which she said:\" Well, you could sort it out beforehand.\" He said, he wasn't interested and he would rather stay away that night after which she joked: \"At least, you don't have to get a hotel, you can stay at \"dirtysecret\" 's house. \"\n\nEver since then me and my boyfriend have been feeling pretty uncomfortable around his apartment. It feels like our relationship is some dirty secret that she has to hide from our friends. As the person, BF once cheated with, I am admittedly pretty sensitive about that. I know, it was a shitty thing to do but I feel like we moved past that. I don't want to her to make me feel like some slut that hangs around her apartment makes her friends uncomfortable by my sheer presence.\n\nThis is why I want this secrecy to stop. She made it clear that she doesn't want to bring it up to the ex (I personally would absolutely tell my friend something like that so she doesn't get in a really awkward situation if she finds out some other way) . My BF is not in contact with her anymore and doesn't want to contact her just to tell her this. So I wanted to do it. I told my boyfriend and asked him to give me her number. He was hesitant at first but then said: \"Whatever, do what you think is right.\"\n\nSo I sent her a message yesterday. She just responded that she doesn't give a fuck and the conversation ended with that. But my boyfriend is upset now that I actually went through with it. He thinks, I should have waited until after the party. He fears, I might have ruined the evening for his roommate and now the mood in the apartment will be even worse. I just didn't want to be treated like the dirty secret any longer. I really don't think she will care after two years. The party isn't until tomorrow, so she has two days to get over it and neither me and my boyfriend will even be there to trigger any unpleasant situations. \n\nSo AITA? ",

It's the winter, he snorts the mucus up his nose instead of using tissues which gets annoying if he does it all day Constantly interrupts or talks over people. Uses \"you know what I mean?\" instead of fully explaining a point multiple times on a single topic. \n\nI want to start small like coming in early and leaving tissues on his desk.

Other times he would hit my sister in front of me until I started crying and apologizing for whatever minor thing I did. Both my parents were extremely verbally abusive. \nFast forward to 2019.My dad is visiting and on Tuesday last week, my mom berated me for not being as good as my sister, I called the Suicide hotline because it really got to me. The next morning I woke up my son early to study, he had to retake a test after getting a 0. My son didn’t want to study, after lots of pleading, I lost my temper and yelled “sit down and study” my parents then started yelling across the house telling me to shut up which I ignored, when we finished studying, he went to get ready. I went into the kitchen and told both my parents firmly that They needed to stop saying things like that in front of my son, my dad told me that I shouldn’t talk to my son like that, this struck a nerve because of the night before, I told him neither of them even showed respect to me even as a child, I reminded them of how my mom used to keep a belt by her side when we studied, and how she would hit me for giving the wrong answers, and that I would never do that to my son, yelling wont hurt him. We had a lot of back and forward until my dad just told me to leave cause he didn’t have time for this, and I yelled at him and told him I want to talk, I’m done with you guys always telling me I’m a fuck up, you guys are terrible parents and I really only want to have what my friends have with their parents” he rolled his eyes and started laughing at me. I took my son(who by this point was in the kitchen hugging me, telling me it was ok) and didn’t come back home until my SO was out of work. I didn’t talk to my dad after that, he went back to our country and my mom has only talked to me to let me know how much of a bitch I am for not saying goodbye to my dad, and that I should be grateful to my dad as he has worked so hard to give us a what we have. and that she wasn’t kicking me out because she didn’t want my son to suffer but she was done with me too. \n\nSo AITA for my outburst and for not saying goodbye??

      "description": "This happened fairly recently. My sibling and I live together, and we live with our parents. Neither of us have house keys and my parents are very strict about locking the doors at night before going to sleep. We used to be pretty close before the incident, hanging out, playing together and ragging on and chatting with each other. Fast forward a few years later and we're in our 20s, somewhat drifted apart but we still have a very good relationship. \n\nA few months ago I got myself a gym membership and it was great. I'd sometimes go after my classes were over or late at night (the gym is open 24/7) when everybody else was sleeping. One day, while I was at the gym late at night, I got a message from my sibling asking about my whereabouts. So I tell them I that I'm at the gym, and they get angry that I'm out and left the house unlocked at this very late hour demanding that I come back immediately. I, too, get angry over what I thought was unreasonable because we live in a very safe neighborhood so leaving the house unlocked for a few hours is a non-issue, and refuse their demand. They tell me that they'll lock me out of the house, and I respond that they're being silly, and that's the end of the conversation. When I return home, I discover that they were not messing around as they did indeed lock me out of the house. I'm shocked because I didn't really think they would go through with it, and hurt because I thought our bond was better than that. Now it's about 3 AM, everybody home is asleep, and I don't have keys to the house. I could ring the doorbell or call someone inside the house to open the door for me but I figured it's really shitty to wake them up at this hour so I just sleep in my car for few hours until morning. \n\nThat day I decided to block this sibling from a chat app that we were very active over. The next day, they ask me about why they couldn't contact me and I told them that I blocked them and that was that. In person, we're still friendly to each other in our conversations, but in a more strict way and we stopped hanging out together so there is very clearly a new boundary between us. A month passed and my sibling sends me a text message accusing me of being childish for still blocking them. \n\nI realize this is a very minor incident in the grand scheme of things, but my feelings are still hurt over it because it came from someone I value dearly, and I'm not sure when I'll let bygones be bygones. Am I an asshole for still blocking them even after a long time has passed?\n\nTLDR: Blocked a close sibling over locking me out of the house, they think I'm being petty.",

      "description": "Sorry I’m on mobile. \n \nMy boyfriend and I live together and share the $1000 rent, half and half. We also share grocery expenses. All of this money goes into a shared bank account which he has the debit card for. Last month, the card was lost. I don’t blame him for this, it was an accident. So, we transferred the landlord the rent on February 1st and then just used our personal bank cards for groceries and whatnot. We recently got the replacement card for our shared account, which is great. Today, we were grocery shopping and our shared card was declined. I was confused because we each usually put in a few hundred for groceries and definitely haven’t spent it all. I ask him what was up and he said he didn’t put any money into the shared account (rent, groceries, nothing) because he used his personal card for groceries when the shared card was lost. I asked him to please put rent in for March, because it seemed pretty unfair that we both paid for groceries on our personal cards (he says that he spent more on groceries, which is fair, but he also makes more money than I do), and that it was March 20th and still hadn’t put in March rent. He said he’d have to calculate how much he spent from his personal account and then pay the rest. I say pay all $500 rent and don’t bother with grocery money, but he says he shouldn’t have to pay all $500 in rent. \n\nWe are university students with part time jobs so while it may not seem like a lot in rent, I think it’s unfair I have most of the rent on my shoulders. \n\nHis edit: I admit I forgot to do the calculation when I got the card so I know how much to put. What if I spent over $500 on groceries when I usually only put $100-$200 for groceries. \n\nI’m sorry this is confusing\n\nTL;DR. Boyfriend spent personal money on groceries, says he shouldn’t pay all his share of rent as compensation. ",

      "description": "Some back story: my husband works about an hour commute away, each way, while I now work 10 minutes from home. However, he typically stays awake until 1-2am playing video games, after getting home around 6. (He leaves for work between 7-8 am). With work/gym, I’m home around 7 (I leave between 6-7am). For reference, I go to bed around 9-10.\n\nMy question: am I the asshole for berating him about getting a closer job or getting up earlier and getting home sooner to work out? He’s gained weight, which does not bother me, but it bothers him and it is affecting our love life. I’m not trying to cut down on his video game time-we all need to relax- but I feel that maybe 2 of those 6-7 hours could be working out/finding a job nearer to home. I’ve tried bringing it up, he agrees, but then the same old keeps happening. I’m in a highly stressful PhD program working 9-14 hours a day in research, so while I don’t begrudge “me” time, I only have sympathy for so much. We maybe are intimate every other week, and when I try and initiate, he’s playing games with friends or too drunk. \n\nAm I the asshole asking too much? ",

I wasn’t in the best financial position after leaving my last job, and haven’t had the money to pay my phone bill.\n\nMy generous, loving boyfriend offered to pay my bill today, knowing I will pay him back Friday when I get paid (my phone has been shut off).  We are at his apartment, and he offered to let me log into my account on his laptop.  This may seem dumb, or childish, whatever, but I didn’t want to. I have had awful experiences in past relationships with men breaching my trust and manipulating me.\n\nHe gets annoyed with me (which he never does, which is why it’s disturbed me to the point to see if I really am being an asshole) after I refused to log in, and is offended that I don’t trust him enough to log on on his computer.  I explained that I don’t really understand computers that well, and I didn’t want it to save it. He said that’s not how it works and then explained why it doesn’t work, but i don’t understand, so who am I to know what he’s saying?\n\nAnyways, he thinks that I don’t trust him, and I’m concerned that he’s not respecting the fact that I have trust issues.

      "description": "So I've (F/21)  been neglecting or putting off  doing housework when I get home. My boyfriend (M/29) and I share an apartment and we split everything 50/50 including housework which means taking turns doing different rooms in our place every week and ordering food. I bought a calendar for us to keep track of who is doing what each week.  I chose a specific day of the week and he didn't choose one but we both know that we have to have everything done by Sunday. I've missed my designated day for 3 weeks in a row now but I always have it done by Sunday. My boyfriend gets upset when I don't have it done by X day because I always put things off. This week it was my turn to have groceries in by Sunday which I forgot to order, and I was called a \" selfish stupid bitch\" for not having it in because he specifically said he would be at home all day to pick up the groceries since it's his day off, and because my boyfriend went and bought spaghetti sauce and waited to make it for us when I got home (so he didn't eat all day). I forgot to tell him that I had already eaten at work because someone brought me a sandwich and salad at work since a coworker called off and I ended up doing an 11 hour shift. I'm constantly putting things off because by the time I get home I'm DEAD tired. I go to school full time (two in person, two online), I work full time, and I have a 20 hour a week internship, my boyfriend does have a full time job as well but he's graduated and that's his only obligation. I feel like shit because I know he relies on me for keep our place afloat, but when I miss out on my deadlines I'm hit with the \"this is why I can't live with you\" and \"you need to find a new place to live\". Am I the asshole for not keeping up with my end of our agreement? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I live with my boyfriend and he hates when I miss deadlines for my housework. I work full time, go to school full time and have a 20 hr internship, he only has his full time job. AITA for not keeping up with our schedule?",

      "description": "So, backstory first: This was my (28M) first truly abusive relationship. She was manipulative, bi-polar, a liar, and I have reasonable proof that she was attempting to sleep with other guys while I was living with her, and at the least emotionally cheating by talking terribly about me to these men and how she needed a man to “put her in line” which I confronted her about because she’s a grown woman and I’m not her goddamn father.   \n\nAnyways, on to the debt. During this time, I moved back to Austin, Texas without a car. I was in the northern part, and I’m a bartender by trade, so I knew I could find something in my area. I found a job that was decently south, maybe 8 miles by freeway, but of course I didn’t have a vehicle so I didn’t want to take her. She is like “well, let’s just work it around our schedules and we’ll give each other rides”. So that’s what we do, she works mornings, I work nights, and during the day I was using her car to do Postmates delivery to make extra cash. I offered to pay for gas and give her a flat % of the pay but she was like “nah babe it’s your money just pay the gas it’s fine.” Also, need to add that I was doing postmates on her account because I didn’t have a car, so the money went into her account and I could track it and ask for her debit card and get it out when needed. \n\nOk cool. Well, at night she would have to pick me up from my second job at 11pm. So I’m working basically 10am-4pm, pick her up, she drops me off, work 5-11pm, get picked up, rinse and repeat 5-6 days a week. She’s working max 35 hours a week, I’m working closer to 60-70. She would consistently fall asleep when she had to pick me up and leave me stranded at work where I had to call an Uber. It was normally $15-20 every time she forgot. This happened several times a week. She told me to just put it on her paypal credit and pay it off as time went on, and I was gonna use the postmates money to do that.  \n\nThen, she lost her job, and had rent and health and car insurance. Suddenly, all that postmates money was disappearing. Wasn’t consulting me about it, just using it on her own bills even though I earned it and was filling her gas and buying dinner etc. I was constantly anxious and miserable, and her bi-polar attitude led me to move out and break up. \n\nNow, afterwards she wanted me to pay back the $700 credit bill. I felt bad, but at the same time she easily took over $1500 or more of that postmates money for herself for bills when she was broke. I paid $50 for 2 months before my best friend talked to me and told me I was still being emotionally manipulated and it’s not my problem. I still feel like it is, but I understand where he’s coming from. Either way, I cut all contact with her because after I didn’t pay her one month she went ballistic and tried guilting me and saying “I make way more money than her and it’s you’re responsibility.” Even though it was her laziness that led to the paypal bill. Oh I’m sorry you can’t work 6 hours without going home and sleeping most of the day. I blocked her and haven’t paid her a penny in 3 months but i know she’s going to be struggling with the bills.    \n\nSorry for the long story, I hope I explained it coherently. AITA for leaving her high and dry, even if she took advantage of my trust in our finances? I feel like that $1500+ easily takes care of the bill she has currently and she’d of been evicted and lost her car without me working 70 hours a week for us. ",

My mom, sister, and grandma on my dad’s side received invitations (my other grandmother passed away a few years ago). I got a call later from my dad asking if his sister or sister-in-laws were expecting invitations as well. I was not informed on who was receiving invitations to the bridal shower, so I asked my fiancée. She said that none were sent to them, as typically there are two bridal showers: one thrown by her mother and they invite their family, my mom, and my grandmothers, and the other thrown by my mom who invites our side of the family, her mother, and sister. \n\nMy first reaction was, “Really? I’ve never heard of two bridal showers. That sounds excessive.” But I guess for where they are from, it is a thing. My mother isn’t in a financial situation where she can throw a bridal shower for her, and all of my family is scattered across the states, while my fiancée family all live in or around the same small town. My fiancée told me she doesn’t expect another shower, but her mother is hesitant at send more invitations, even though I’ve pointed out how bad and inconsiderate this looks from my side of the family. \n\nSo AITA for asking them to send another, or is having two bridal showers an actual thing that I or my family have never heard of?",

      "description": "Throwaway because of normal reasons.  \n\n\nSome background for this first, my partner and I have been together for a while (like over 5 years). We live together, but the last few months have been tough. We've been having a few issues and we've both been working together to hopefully change our relationship for the better and get past this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso relevant is the fact that I had substantial disabilities, physical and mental. I don't use the mental ones to excuse bad behaviour, but it means sometimes I have to do some damage control if I feel like something will cause a flare up of symptoms (I'm in therapy to try to manage it the best I can). The physical disabilities mean that I can't do some things that other people would do without thinking, like cooking food.  \n\n\nOne of the changes we have made is for him to go out with his work friends whenever they have plans. As long as I have enough notice to sort out something to eat, I try to have it as a rule that I'll never say no to any of these plans. If I can make it work I will, because I understand that he needs his space and some freedom.  \n\n\nLast week I had to break the rule. He scheduled something for thursday. Valentines Day. Once I realised it was Valentines Day I brought it up, and he said he didn't realise that it was Valentines on thursday, but he still wanted to go. I put my foot down and asked him to reschedule, feeling that as a couple we should be spending Valentines together and that sitting at home alone on Valentines would be a magnet for mental health issues, and would be very upsetting. I asked him to reschedule it (since apparently nobody in the group realised the date) and he did so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey rescheduled it into two separate meet ups. Both this week, Wednesday and Friday. Not the easiest thing but I thought manageable.  \n\n\nThen Tuesday night my grandpa died. It hit me hard. I was close to him and loved him very much and he deserved much better than the end he got.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother came around Wednesday so my partner still went out. He told me it wouldn't be a late night, but he ended up later home than expected, so I was on my own for a few hours. It was bad. I always find my mental health symptoms are worse at night, which combined with exhaustion and grief left me a wreck. It was incredibly distressing and I wish he had been there for me.  \n\n\nHe's meant to be going out again Friday, and this time my brother won't be there. It'll just be me, on my own all evening. I know these evenings are important for him, and I already said no the first time. I also know that the group probably won't reschedule it for him (bit different to valentines when a lot of the group couldn't make it). But I'm hurting so much and I don't want to be on my own. WIBTA if I asked him to cancel and stay with me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I am the asshole, please be a little gentle, I will accept it but it's been a rough few days.",

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I have been dating for almost two years now and a while ago we both agreed that neither of us would do drugs or smoke (that includes vaping). \nI have personal reasons for specifically hating drugs and smoking so I followed this rule easily but she however did not. We got into a fight the other day because I found out that for the past year she had constantly been smoking behind my back with her friends and asking them not to tell me. When they inevitably told me and I confronted her she immediately denied it but once I told her I have proof she admitted it. We then got into an argument where she told me I’m too controlling and that I can’t not let her smoke. She also then said she did it behind my back and told people not to tell me because she knew I would be mad (of course I’d be f-ing mad). I think this was unfair what she said because we had both promised each other that we wouldn’t do it then when she does it she blames it on me. What do you guys think?",

      "description": "A little background info, I moved to the U.S when I was 10 about 15 years ago. If you ask me, my mom and dad don’t really know/speak English well, so they go to me for anything English language related. They make me call places to deal with issues for them. This has been going on my entire life ever since I learned the language. I know they speak English sometimes at work and communicate with people it’s just pretty poor, and they don’t seem to want to get better. Usually when my mom and dad ask me to call or do something I ask them or tell them to try it first before I do anything. This usually makes my mom or dad mad as they say I’m never helping them or that if they ask me to do anything I always get mad and hate doing it.\n\nYesterday my dad has a problem with his card and I told him to try calling the bank first. He calls them and listens to the options. He then gives me the phone for which one he should press, I feel like at that point he didn’t even bother listening and just expected me to do it. I was playing a video game and got mad that I pressed the wrong button, and made like a hand gesture. He then got mad at me, saying I don’t help my parents at all and they do all this stuff for me, which they do a lot for me. \n\nAITA for this? I’ve always hated doing things like this and I feel like after 15 years they should be able to do simple tasks, like calling a bank for an error or the cable company. I know I should help them but I feel like they need to try and help themselves with stuff like this before I do it for them. To at least attempt it, and not just call the place and come over by me to do everything.",

I renewed my membership at the local sports center and today was my first day back. Now, the multi-purpose room, which is essentially just an indoor basketball courts with dumbbell racks and a badminton net you can set up, is open use from 6-8:30 am. My plan was get in as early as possible so I'd be able to play without bothering anyone/being bothered, for maybe an hour or so until I can go longer. Today at around 6:40 these 2 guys came in with badminton equipment and asked how much longer I'd be staying, saying there's a group that usually plays from 6-6:30 and maybe I should join them. I just shrugged and said something along the lines of \" Oh maybe, I'll think about it\", and then left. Now, the badminton setup takes up the whole room basically because of how much space you need to move around, and I feel like taking up a whole room for two people is kinda selfish. At least what I'm doing only takes up half and can involve 5 other people. WIBTA if I go back some other day and refuse to leave until I want to?\n\nTL;DR I go in early at a gym to play basketball, two guys ask me to leave before I want to so they can play badminton even though the room is free use.

      "description": "Last night I visited a friend of mine (who we’ll call FF) at her workplace (where I used to work, as well)\n\nI’m standing with FF and talking when two boys (who we will refer to as B1 and B2). They were 14 and 15, so a few years younger than my coworker (18). These two boys had been around before and were sexually harassing other workers there, asking them for sex and even grabbed a female worker’s ass (which went unreported).\n\nI’m talking to FF when B1 interrupts and asks “why are you talking to my girlfriend?” Which is whatever, I ignore him and move on. But eventually they come back around and begin trying to antagonize the both of us. When I’m standing with FF, this is the conversation that ensues:\n\nB2: “Is that your girlfriend?”\n\nMe and FF: “No”\n\nB2: “let’s pretend she is. Are you gonna punish her?”\n\nMe: “For what?”\n\nB2: “She said she wants to hug me.”\n\nB1: “yeah she’s been texting me nonstop. She said she wants to suck my dick.”\n\nB2: “she wanted to hug my dick with her mouth.”\n\nThey both made comments like this for a few more seconds, talking over each other. My blood was at a boil. I got up from my leaning position and stood upright to confront both of them. Mind you, these kids are pretty big for their size, at the time I thought they must’ve been 16 or 17.\n\nMe: “okay that’s enough why don’t you both just leave?”\n\nB1: “why? She’s the one who wants to blow me.”\n\nMe: “I said that’s enough. Just go.”\n\nAt this point I’m trying to usher them away from FF, pointing in the direction to go and going as far to give a small shove when they were resisting. They eventually go, but bring back their older brother (BB) and his friends. They call FF over and begin talking to her in a group. I see this and step into the group.\n\nBB: “What’re you doing stepping up?” (I ignored this comment)\n\nBB: “We’re not doing anything bad we’re just-“\n\nMe: “No, these two kids right here are sexually harassing this girl. I don’t fuck with that. You guys should just leave.”\n\nBB perked up and raised his voice, FF walks away\n\nBB: “Do you work here? What authority do you have?”\n\nMe: “No, but you need to shut the fuck up, or I’ll beat your ass.”\n\nBB: “You’re talking about these two kids? They’re 14 and 15, you’re really gonna punch them?”\n\nMe: “Hell no, I’m not getting arrested for assaulting a minor. But you’re borderline, and the authority figure for them.”\n\nAt this point FF is calling me over and calls for management. The management collects the group of boys and talks with them. They are threatened to be kicked out permanently and go home. Management is really cool with me because I know everyone, but warn me that they just don’t wanna kick me out, either.\n\nI know Reddit is very anti-white knighting and stuff like that, but I just feel like this was a situation where I was right in my intentions, but just let it get too big. I’ve felt bad ever since, because last night was supposed to be a fun happy night.\n\nTl;dr: two kids sexually harass a friend of mine at her workplace, I get in their brother’s face and threaten to beat his ass in place of them.\n",

He is selfish. He has almost no friends. He doesn't care about others and babies our dog that needs training. We share a Nintendo Switch. He is in community college. He doesn't have a job. He is constantly rude. He almost always has his headphones on and can't go 10 minutes without his goddamn phone. He has no inspiration. He doesn't have a driver's license. He has submitted ONE job application and didn't get it, which doesn't surprise me. He swears A LOT. He is worse with chores than I am.\n\nAfter all that background information, I feel the need to point out one specific thing. He had bought a game and wanted to play it first because it was his, which makes complete sense. He is seldom not home before me and complains about not having any free time to play. This is horseshit. He has more time than me, his younger brother. I had confronted him many times about the issue because I wanted to play it to and he was being selfish and controlling. One day, a few weeks before Thanksgiving, I asked it I could have a date to play because I was done with his shit. We agreed on Thanksgiving of that year. He didn't hand it over until I called out mom down (we don't live with our dad) and she talked about it. In one week I had played 18 hours, which I felt was a really long time.\n\nHere's where it gets good though. He has played for at most 3 days and has around the same amount of time, let's say 15 hours. I used ~1/9 of my total time in that week playing. He has used ~1/5 of his time in those three days. I talked to him about it and he blew up in my face and started cussing me out. \n\nI would generally say I am rude to him, not nearly as much however. My mother does not want to buy him a PS4 for Christmas because he wastes his time enough as it is. I agree with her concern.\n\nNow people of this subreddit, AITA and do you have any advice for me on my situation?",

      "description": "Is a Summer \"friends with benefits\" okay? So my ex and I used to date over the period of a summer. We weren't arguing 24/7 or anything but it was a fairly normal relationship except we mightve gotten a bit attached. We were pretty intoxicated by each other and began to have frequent \"sleep overs\" it was pretty much whenever we could; in movie theaters, at her house etc. We ended on slightly awkward terms but nevertheless good terms. I feel guilty for thinking of asking her to be friends with benefits and don't want to date seriosly again, my problem is should I ask now that she will be back in town over this upcoming summer? I can't help but feel guilty to only want to ask her for a purely \"recreational\" relationship is it wrong of me to want that? If not how should I approach this?\n\nI feel like shit knowing perfectly where my intentions are but I'm still conflicted to wether its taboo to even mention the topic or if its something plenty of people ask for\n\nI patiently await your opinion,          youraveragedumbass9\n",

      "description": "For context, I am a mid 20’s male who went to school late so hasn’t graduated yet, and I live with my parents.\nShe is in her mid 20’s, is about to finish up get bachelors,  has a 10 year old boy, and lives with her mom.\n\nWe had dated in 2013 for a year before falling out of contact and reconnecting in 2017. We fell in love again and everything was good for a while. Around mid summer 2018 she floated the idea of moving back to Arizona (having lived there in HS) because it is cheaper than California. It is and I agreed and said I would love to in a few years when we have our finances in order. (I don’t even make enough to live on my own right now). \n\nOne day I get a call for a really decent paying position in a good school district. It could potentially set up a life where we would be OKAY if she didn’t work and comfortable if she did. I nail the interview and so the district said they would contact me about a second interview. Well that week, before the district called, my SO finds out her mom is getting payed some 60 grand for a disability case she won in addition to my SO getting a hefty 10 grand tax refund. (Mine was about 1 grand if that reflects my financial situation). She decides she wants to go to Arizona for a few days to just look at houses. I say sure that sounds like fun.\n\nI’d like to also add in here that she never said to me “I am going to move to Arizona this summer” but instead used language like “I want to move” or “I’d really like to”. To me, this is fantasizing and not a concrete plan of action.\n\nThe plans are made, and we are to stay with her child’s blood relatives. \nHowever I receive that second interview scheduled for the day after we are to leave. I say I’m sorry but this is really big and, seeing as I didn’t have a job at the time, felt as if I had no choice but to go for it. She was livid saying I flaked on our plans. We didn’t talk much when she was over there.\n\nLong story draggged out, she ended up buying the house with a combination of her own + her mother’s lawsuit money, and co-signed with her uncle. I have no hand in the property. \n\nI don’t know how to feel about this. She needs me to move over there because she did all this for “us”.\nI kept defending my stance saying I never asked for this, I never expected this, this was all her actions and if it was for “us” then I would’ve played a bigger role in the buying process. She says I’m ungrateful and can’t appreciate what she’s doing for me.\n\nGranted, she shared a small 1 bedroom garage-to-apartment with her son and mother. It was becoming cramped and her son does need his own space. They all do. I get it. I understand why she would make that move for her mother, her son, and even herself.\n\nBut I personally never wanted to move to another state. I could only see myself doing so when \n1. I am financially stable\n2. I’m so in love with the person that it didn’t matter where we were.\n\nOnly the second condition was met.\n\nThis has become one of the major issues in my life right now. I feel like my options are to drop my life here and go move with her (which I can’t even afford)\nOr to end it.\n\nAITA for not moving in with my girlfriend?",

      "description": "I've been friends with him for 11 years now. We first met on the xbox 360 in 2007 and had a group of me, him, and another friend.\n\n after i built my computer in 2016 the friend we would talk to would start to slowly talk less and less with my ex boyfriend. and now he completely stopped talking to him because everytime we would talk or play my ex would become upset and negative for really small reasons, like getting killed in a game, or because i would talk with my friend and he felt excluded, i would try to make him talk and include him in everything we would do because i know how it feels to be left out.\n\n in 2017 he asked me out and i said yes. for the next 2 months it was great, sometimes he would break down, or his mom would become hostile towards him for something really minor, like he would clean his room but he missed a dust spot behind a desk.  i didn't mind and understood that he had some problems, and that his parents could be abusive at times, i would comfort him and tell him that what his parents were doing are wrong. and to keep seeing his therapist so he can manage and improve himself. \n\n As a kid he would get constantly spoiled by his mom, She would get him whatever he wanted, he would occasionally brag about what he had when we were on Xbox and since me and my friend were poor we would tell him we can't, but he would keep doing that. i admit that i was mean to him on the Xbox and used to make him rage since it was funny when i was 11 at the time and didn't know he had Aspergers. i feel bad about doing that now and have said sorry for it, he forgives me and said that he would've done the same if he was me.\n\nAs we were dating i was always a yes man to everything, and if he had an opinion that i didn't agree with i would lie and go along with it because i was afraid to lose him. if i was feeling depressed or anxious i would lie and said that i was okay because i didn't want him to be sad or worried about me, he figured out that i was lying and got really mad at me and would yell at me because i lied. after that i would stop being so much of a yes man, and slowly started to improve myself, i still have trouble being honest about my feelings and would still sometimes lie because most of the time i'm sad, and scared about my future. i told him this and he understood, but to be honest to him and to be more open.\n\n Since he was young he had to move state to state because of his parents and he never really developed any long lasting friendships with kids at school because of it. and when he did he made friendships with some girls when he was younger and would tell me that after he asked some out, they would eventually stop talking to him, and one even becoming hostile to him too. He told me that his worst nightmare was if i were to leave him like my friend left him after almost a decade of talking to him, and that he doesn't want to lose me because of his disabilities. after he told me this he started to become more and more anxious about me. and this is about the time he slowly started to try and control me. \n\nAbout 4 months in he would start to become upset and breakdown almost every single night for about 3 months, I would help him for as long as he was upset because i deeply care about him, he would get upset because of his family and because of his friend leaving him and how he has mental issues. no matter how late or long it took i was there for him and he was grateful for that. and when i got upset or scared he would help me too and be there for me. but then he just started to get upset over me saying cute things to my cat. or because my family started to talk to me for 3 minutes. he started to breakdown and cry and called me the worst girlfriend because i had to rake the leaves for 5 minutes. \n\nOne night he was upset for over 3 hours because he wanted me to love him as much as i used to when we first started to date, he wanted me to stay home all the time and say cute things to him constantly. and if i went out to get dinner, or if i wanted to talk to my friend he would cry and beg me not to. and when i had to go to the doctors for a checkup he almost broke down because i had to enter the office and he wanted to keep talking to me.  through the months i have been giving him chances and telling him that i can't take the controlling aspect of the relationship, and how he would get upset over literally nothing sometimes. he understood and started to work on himself because he was afraid of losing me like he lost his friends. i would still get annoyed from him getting upset when i was just playing with my cat for 5 minutes while he was making himself food.  \n\nAbout a year in i started to not be as affectionate as i used to, i would still say cute things because i cared and would try my best to help him when he was upset, but i felt so tired of it. i tried my hardest to be affectionate but i was drained. at this point i've been only texting my friend for about 8 months and he was about to end our friendship because of my ex. i didn't want that because he has been the only one that i know of to never get mad, or cry over something small. he helped me through everything that happened between me and my ex.\n\n I have made mistakes and have gotten annoyed too in the past, and i have been unfair. but i couldn't take his stress and anxiety and yelling anymore. before we started to date i was depressed, stressed, and scared for the future, i still am but i tried my best to make him happy and to help him out. but when i wanted to talk to my sister or go get a coffee i would be too afraid to ask him because i didn't want him to cry, or beg me not to. \n\nOver the months my own family started to notice the stress and how everytime i wanted to go somewhere i couldn't because he would get upset. they didn't think it was a healthy relationship. even his own friends would notice, like when i had to rake the leaves i said i would be back but he started to get anxious and he didn't want me to go. his friend said that it would be okay and that i would be back and to calm down. or when me and my ex were playing fortnite and he was mad, one of his friends started to discuss politics and he thought we excluded him, even though he didn't want to say anything because he was mad i would still ask his opinion on topics because i didn't want him to be and then he still got upset.\n\nThe night i broke up with him he broke down. he has told me in the past that if i were to break up with him he would commit suicide and has cut himself on the thumb for very minor things in the past. So i waited for his parents to come home to say it to him. He didn't do anything that night but got upset because my sister said hi and how is it going, and that is when i had enough. \n\nHe became delusional on the same night, he called me at about 3 am because he couldn't fall asleep and i tried to help him. but when i told him that i broke up with him he would say that we were not and that i was 'just taking a break' i told him that he can find someone better than me and that he deserves someone better than me but he said 'why would i cheat on you since we are still together'\n\nI feel bad for breaking up with him because i still care for him and know that he has problems, but he has had so many months and chances to fix himself. I told him that i still want to be his friend and that i still care about him, but that i want my own freedom and to be able to talk to my sister. \n\nI feel like i have been going insane for the past 8 months and i don't know who is wrong. i think its both our fault and i want to know what you guys think. I'm still trying to improve my self and im starting to look up therapist to go to. Sorry for the long post but i wanted to make sure everything was explained to the best of my abilities.\n\nplease tell me if i could improve on anything so that i way i know in the future.\n\n thank you for reading.

      "title": "AITA (26F) for smoking weed when my roommate (29M) hates the smell?",
      "description": "Living together for 5 months, friends for over a year. Separate rooms. \nI bought pot a week ago and self medicate. (Please, let’s not drug shame. It’s legal, this isn’t my first time, I know how to handle it, yes it’s necessary.) The first day I had my small piece out in the kitchen. Roommate comes home, sees the weed (he knows I smoke), we talk for a bit, joke around, everything’s fine. He goes into his room. Comes out 10 minutes later completely different person, with a deadpan look. He says “NO smoking in the apartment... You can smoke in your room, but not out here.”\nI was so caught off guard by how authoritative and aggressive it was, it took me a moment to respond properly. Like a “hey man could you do that in your own room” would’ve worked. But of course I was super embarrassed and apologized and reassured him that he had every right to ask that of me. \nSo now I smoke in my room, but I guess you can still smell a little in the hallway. I never noticed anything, but roommate has completely iced me out so I can assume the smell is there. Not only that, but his entire attitude towards me has changed even when I’m sober. He’s always been judgmental and hypercritical of me, but now it feels even more so. When he’s angry it is frightening. He shows it, like slamming doors, death stares, those sharp exhales through the nose every time he walks by you, etc. I’ve tried to make normal conversation with him these days. He either just stares back and then ignores me completely, or sometimes responds condescendingly. Tonight he came home right after his gf confirmed how pissed he still was because of the smell, even though we all obviously knew. I started to say “hey, sorry I opened some windows and bought some room spray” but he just angrily said “yup” without looking at me, stormed into his room, and slammed the door. \nIt’s felt like walking on eggshells around him since day 1 of living together (even before weed was in the picture) and I’m honestly sick of the treatment. I’m sure he’s unaware that he does this (because he has a good heart) but he’s just always in a bad mood and has to suck everyone into it too. The second he walks into the room, the vibe changes. There’s so much tension and anger with him, I’m literally scared to be in my own home these days. It’s like a psychic attack every time I see him. \nSeems like the only solution is to not smoke in the apartment at all? Which I would’ve happily agreed to, if he had just asked me himself instead of hiding behind angry attacks all week. His behavior and attitude are so disgusting I don’t really feel like changing my lifestyle for him either.. but I do believe in being respectful of shared space at the same time? He has a big reputation for being the stereotypical “angry negative French man” so he obviously needs to learn how to manage his emotions and communicate like a grown ass adult. \n\nMixed reasoning. Genuinely wondering AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to participate in my (27F) close friend’s (27F) baby shower?",
      "description": "Hi guys, I’m looking for some outside perspective on this.This post is probably going to be long but it is important I don’t leave any important details out. Let me start off by giving you a little bit of background:\n\nMe and my close friend Camila met in our freshman year of high school and ever since then we’ve been great friends and have gone through multiple milestones together. \n\nDuring junior year I befriended this other girl, Daniela (26F) and me and her shortly became best friends. A couple of years later, I introduced my friend Camila to my bff Daniela and they hit it off right away. They also became good friends and the three of us became inseparable. \n\nCamila has a couple of other close friends and all of us would hang out sometimes but they were mainly her friends. Anyways, I moved to a different state in my early 20’s and during that time Daniela and Camila grew even closer. Daniela also ended up moving to a different state a little while later and so did one of other Camila’s close friends (Felipe / 27m). We all ended up in different states but that didn’t stop us from staying really good friends and we all kept in touch online. \n\nMe, Daniela and Camila got into very serious relationships around the same time and we all bonded over the fact that we had new relationships. We all made a few trips together and hung out with our SOs and they all got along really well, especially because our bfs were very similar in the sense that they are all very chill, homey people that rather stay home than go out.\n\nMy bff Daniela has been doing really well financially so she’s been able to travel to our hometown a lot more frequently and has been able to hang out with our friend Camila more than I have. \n\nAbout 3 years ago, Camila’s bf proposed to her but she didn’t tell me anything. I actually had to find out through public announcements. She later got married at court but I only found out through Daniela the day before. I started to feel a bit left out, especially because I started noticing that Daniela was more aware about what was going on in her life than I was. A few months later, Daniela got proposed to by her bf as well and got married soon after. \n\nDuring that time (about 2 years ago) me and my bf at the time were talking about the future and we found out we wanted completely different things: I wanted to get married one day and have kids. He did not. Also, I started to feel bored in my relationship because we would never do anything exciting and I wanted more out of life. I decided we needed to go our separate ways because we were not longer compatible. I told both of my friends about it and even though they were supportive of my decision of breaking up, I could tell Camila wasn’t really about it, especially because my ex and her husband got along well and she really liked my ex as a person.\n\nA couple of months after my breakup, I met a new person and we connected so well we started dating almost right away. My curren bf is a musician and because of him my life became a little bit more exciting. I started going out to shows and concerts and going on tour with his band. My life changed completely, I  became a lot more outgoing and extroverted because of him. \n\nI dont know how to describe this, but I had a feeling Camila was not a big fan of my new lifestyle. Or my new relationship. She started becoming more and more distant and would only reply to my messages days later or sometimes not reply at all. Her and her other friends, including my bff, started taking trips together without even asking me if I wanted to join them and I would later see pictures of them together which made me feel very left out. \nRegardless of this situation, I tried my best to not take anything personal and never stopped trying to be involved in their lives and made a constant effort to stay in touch. \n\nDaniela still checks up on me regularly and has been there for me, especially during a really rough time in my life last year when I was dealing with really bad depression and kind of having an ‘existential crisis’ (which I’ve finally recovered from). Camila was not there for me at all. She also failed to wish me a happy birthday the past couple of years, even though I know she was aware of it this past on because I saw she watched my stories on Instagram celebrating it with my boyfriend.\n\nSo basically, I feel completely excluded from Camila’s close circle of friends and even though I understand we have changed a lot and become completely different people, I can’t help but feel, idk, ‘judged’ by her ? Like it almost feels as if she looks down on me for not being married and for still wanting to go out and maybe not having a more ‘stable’ life. Or maybe that’s all in my head, but that’s just how it feels.\nMe and my bf are very much in love and are talking about marriage and kids but aren’t ready for that just yet, we just want to enjoy our 20’s being childfree a little longer.\n\nThis is where the last straw comes in though:\n\nA couple of days ago, I was added to a group chat named ‘Camila’s baby shower’. And it had Camila’s closest friends it it. Her friend Felipe wrote in it “as you all know, Camila is pregnant...” and I was completely caught off guard because I had NO idea. Nobody mentioned anything to me. Felipe was throwing ideas for the baby shower, and they are planning on doing it in Orlando (which is far from me) and rent a very big and expensive airbnb for the weekend. This trip with airfare and everything else would cost me close to 1k. \n\nWhen I expressed I was not aware of her pregnancy (she’s almost 3 months into it), she kind of responded in like an annoying tone like ‘yeah, Im pregnant but I want to keep it in DL for now’. Everyone went silent on the group chat and I could feel a sense of awkwardness at the fact she had not tell me about it yet. It was also very obvious she wasn’t expecting Felipe to make that group chat and that I’d be in it.\n\nNow, this is very important and Im beyond happy for my friend and I don’t want to make this about me at all, which is why I haven’t said anything to anyone about how I feel. But I was wondering, WIBTA if I don’t spend all that money to go to an event I don’t really feel welcomed to? Am I making this too much about myself? Do you guys think I’m just reading too much into it and she’s just too busy with her life to be catching up with me? Please, I need any kind of perspective on this.\n\nThanks in advance for your replies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

His wife, not so much. She recently posted an unflattering picture of me on her Twitter page and said I was exploitative and selfish. Since she called me out, I thought it would be fair to call her out, so I said some unflattering things about her on my Twitter page, which I normally use to talk about my company and how things are going on it. Now I'm being told that was inappropriate, even though I've posted about people I don't like in my Twitter feed before. Kevin doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Personally I think, if anything, Kevin's wife should apologize for putting Kevin into this situation (and if you ask me I think Kevin should divorce her and I'm not afraid to let the world know that).\nim curious what people who aren't involved one way or the other think.

So this morning my bf lost his phone, and couldn't find it. So naturally, he climbed on top of me and starting screeching like a child making me wake up. I instantly was livid and threw him off me. He claims that he didn't know I had trouble sleeping that night, so I have no right to be mad. I'm still so fucking mad because I just want to sleep and I can't. I can't put into words how angry I am, he knows that is have insomnia.. I apparently don't have permission or the right to be mad because he didn't know I had trouble that specific night, apparently I have to communicate and wake him up and let him know I'm having trouble sleeping. AITA for being mad I was woken up?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; OP has insomia and child-like boyfriend.

      "description": "Sorry this is going to be a long one. So my friend let’s call him Noah has a YouTube Chanel and one day on Minecraft introduces to me his friend let’s call him Bobby. After some gameplay he goes on about how annoying Bobby and I are and says that I stole his stuff even though I found everything and when I asked for it back he just would go in creative and give it to me. Now some background knowledge I always tell him how I want achievements and don’t want to cheat and his response is always “WHO CARES?” Obviously I do but he thinks my opinion doesn’t really matter except if the situation isn’t as critical. I also don‘t really stand up for my self until I have reached Middle School and grew up. Back to the story so Bobby and I make a new world called “No Noah’s Allowed” and Noah gets mad at the name and he goes on about how annoying Bobby and I are. I then ask him to make a list of how annoying I am and he does one for Bobby too. So when he tells Bobby he just ignores Noah so Noah goes to me. He then goes on about How annoying I am and How I loud to him even tho the list is supposed to be how I am annoying and I only was loud because of my mom couldn’t here me or it was by accident.  My iPhone then loses battery since my brother is using the charger so I go get it. When I get back on discord he gets even madder and goes on about how I spam him and how I’m never serious even though I can be it just depends on my mood and he knows that. Suddenly Bobby texts in a different group chat if I wanted to play and I said not now. Noah then says for me not to get out of the situation by talking to Bobby and I show him a screenshot of him talking to someone else while he was arguing with me. He claims that he was talking to his other friend before he talked to me and I show him the 5 hour time difference in the texts. I then call him a hypocrite since he does all the things that he thinks is annoying. He then calls me a nuisance and goes on about how I can only joke and what I say is a joke so then I say Noah. He then says and I quote ,”Alright I’m gonna go u go play with bobby maybe two nuisances can handle each other” ",

Besides him, I really don't have anyone to talk to. Sure, I have friends, but I don't really talk to them on a regular basis- maybe 2 or 3 times a month.\nI've recently made a friend in one of my classes. He wasn't flirtatious but did buy me a drink, so I let him know that I have a boyfriend in case I just wasn't picking it up. The way he talked to me didn't change at all, so I trusted that he was just trying to get to know me as a friend. Now we hang out after class from about 11-12:30pm, and besides the class we share that's the only time we see each other. We also call and text each other occasionally.\nThe problem with that is the only time I can talk to my boyfriend before a much later time is 11-11:40am, so the past 2 times I've hung out with this guy include talking to my boyfriend for half an hour or so, and if ",

      "title": "AITA For not wanting a Snow Day due to a phobia despite the fact that my brothers are practically PRAYING for one?",
      "description": "I want to get this out of the way. I have a phobia of snow, specifically icy roads. This is because of an incident last year when our neighbourhood froze over and my mum's car got stuck in the ice when she was lifting me and my brothers from school. Our car was 11 years old with worn down tires and my mum nearly broke the engine trying to get traction on the ice. She even crashed the car TWICE on this occasion. Once into another car and once into the pavement. She just couldn't get up the hill and we were stuck for an hour circling the neighbourhood trying to gain enough momentum to get up the hill to our house.\n\nBecause of this, whenever the weather forecast predicts temperatures below freezing, I get into a panic. I live in Ireland, where it rains 75% of the year, so the ground is always wet, which then freezes over. Also, the roads in my area are never salted since they are the suburbs and not the main roads.\n\n This day last week, we got stuck in another ice patch because some idiot tried to melt the ice on the roads by throwing hot water onto it. Which is the WORST way to melt ice. It's like trying to put out a fire with fire. It just creates more fire.\n\nI'm very open about my fear of snow and ice and always pray for none of it during the winter. My brothers mock me for this, calling me a 'fun sponge' and saying things like 'Only demons don't like snow. They constantly call me 'paranoid' as well. They want as much snow as possible so they can get a day off from school and are always praying for the roads and pavements to be caked in the white stuff. \n\nI think this is a terrible idea. Why? BECAUSE OUR SCHOOLS DON'T CLOSE IN COLD WEATHER. The last snow day we had was in 2015 which was 4 years ago. Last year, the snow was so bad that people living up in the Sperrin Mountains and other higher places couldn't even leave their homes because the roads were covered in so much ice and snow that their cars couldn't get through. My friend who lives up there missed all of her Mock GCSE Exams because she was snowed in. Not me though. I had to come in through the ice and snow and sit through three exams a day for a week because the school didn't want to close despite half of their teachers and countless students being unable to come to school.\n\nMy point of view is that if we do get enough snow to close most of the schools in Northern Ireland, my school and my brothers' wouldn't close because they are stubborn b\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. And then we would have to come to school anyway through the horribly icy roads with a car that can't handle it. (Old, weak engine, tires with no grips) \n\nAnd yet my brothers insist that I'm ruining their excitement and that I'm just paranoid. \n\nAm I?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I’m close friends with this girl. We’re both university students. But because she’s not that good in English but is studying in English, she usually sends me pages of her text books for me to paraphrase them for her in our language (write the translated thing in a document and send her to read). She also gives me her assignments to do, like a 16 question paper on a documentary, essays, etc. I even did two of her sister’s assignments because she’s not good either. Now I do all of that happily and it’s my pleasure to help. And yes they take time, but my English is fair so I can get things done, and I know she doesn’t have someone else to return to.\n\nThe last assignment was to write a ~750 words critique on a research paper, she sent me the paper, the guidelines for writing one and what I should include in my paper. I did everything that was asked for, or at least that’s what I think. I really did my best. But to be honest, I sent it an hour late after the due time, and she said she will loose 5 marks because of that but said it’s okay and thanked me. Now she messaged me saying that in that critique assignment I did, she got a 78/100, and this assignment counts as 20% of the total mark (which is 100). I told her so that’s a 15.6/20, not that great but not that bad either, I guess. She said no it’s a 14/20, and I was still in the A range, and this ruined my grades and I’m not getting an A. I told her I’m sorry and she said it’s okay, but her tone the whole time wasn’t really implying that, and it seemed she’s upset.\n\nNow guilt is eating me out. AITA for accepting to it when apparently I’m not qualified to do it the right way, instead of telling her from the beginning that I cannot write this one? Note that if I had rejected it, she would’ve written in it on her own; and judging by her language as I mentioned above, I doubt she will be getting higher than a 10/20.",

Upon finding out I was pregnant, Baby's Father (white American. I love him, he is fantastic) and I didn't know anything else, but decided I would be nanay (mommy-equivalent), and he would be daddy. Easy enough, right? \n\nThe actual problem:\nWell, turns out Baby's Father comes from an anti-immigration, staunchly monolingual home (this is AMERICA we talk ENGLISH). They both refused to say \"nanay\" because it's \"too hard\" (NAHN-eye. not hard.) when what they mean is \"too not-white\" and \"they can't remember\" they've had 3 years now. The Grandmother especially insists on calling me mommy, goes out of her way to do it, and follows up with and eye-rolling \"ohhh I forgoooot\" when I call her out. It's microaggression and passive-aggressive behavior, obviously not forgetfulness.\n\nThese people also love to post and say their opinions about immigrants, stating that immigrants and children of immigrants should be deported citing random made-up numbers and pseudo-statistics to back up their claims. When I've called them out on it, \"oh we didn't mean YOUUuuuuu\". \n\nI've taught the miniature creature how to count in multiple languages, he's barely 3 and has at least 1-10 in English, Tagalog, Spanish, and German. They both came around about multiple languages when they learned German was being introduced and very strongly encourage German (especially the grandfather), while giving me the \"this is AMERICA\" speech about Tagalog and Spanish. It's clearly racism, I have examples for days. I decided they are not allowed to be close enough to him to speak to him. They only get a visual of him if there is supervision, and under NO circumstances are they allowed to talk or touch (no head pats, no hugs), and they are especially not be left alone with Baby because I will not introduce my child to the normalization of hypocrisy or bigotry.\n\nThe problem is, though, it's putting a strain on Baby's Father. When there's a family gathering or a birthday, it makes the situation extremely stressful for all of us, but I'm the one who made the decision. He didn't have much room for a say in it, but did agree that his family is toxic to a toddler (note, I would *nev.er* say he can't see or be with his family, just that I would be staying home with Baby when he does). I know I'm not the asshole for seeing this behavior and calling it out, or even not wanting to be around it myself. But, am I the asshole for completely cutting off contact like that, and putting that kind of stress on Baby's Father? ",

      "description": "My ex dumped me a while back. I was heartbroken, but we ended on mostly good terms and we remained close afterwards. I started dating again a week after she started dropping hints that she was moving on/not looking to reconcile. She was aware of this because, again, we remained close and we have a lot of mutual friends, but she seemed happy I was moving on.\n\nWhat I wasn't aware of was that around the same time, my ex started seeing an acquaintance/ex-friend of mine. On the surface, he's good looking, nice, and charming, but he has a history of backstabbing friends if it benefits him even slightly and preying on emotionally vulnerable women without remorse. Based on timing, his history, and my ex's account of everything, I'm 100% certain that he targeted her at a social gathering at his earliest opportunity after hearing news of our breakup.\n\nThey both kept it a secret from me until I saw them together at a social event (later I found out he was one of the organizers, and he volunteered to handle the invitations so that he could sabotage my invitation/keep me from finding out about the event, but I found out anyway because another person organizing it asked me personally if I was going).\n\nWhen I saw them together, I was visibly upset and went silent for a long time. It was so noticeable that I had a couple friends try to console me. One of them told me some of the details of what's been going on between them, how they'd been seeing each other for a few weeks now. After that, I confronted both of them, called them out for being cowards, broke off my friendship with my ex, etc.\n\nMy ex felt bad afterward, so she reached out to me apologizing for being secretive and hurting my feelings. She asked if there was a way to make me feel better, to which I told her I'd feel better if she stopped seeing him, something I wouldn't have said if she hadn't asked outright. She was understandably angry about this, saying we're broken up and she has every right to date him. But then I explained to her that if it were someone other than him, I'd be a bit jealous, but I wouldn't have anywhere close to this kind of reaction. I explained to her the sort of person he is (an opportunistic weasel who lies, backstabs, and preys on people's weaknesses), that one day he's going to betray her the same way he betrayed me and so many other people. She eventually understood where I was coming from, but told me she'd take the risk on him anyway.\n\nWas I the asshole for telling her this?",

      "description": "I know it's ironic but: Forgive my poor English. It's not my native language.\n\n\n I'm having a group project in my college with four other students. One of them is a foreign exchange student who's not that fluent in the language of my country. Let me call her Y here.\n\n Y hasn't contributed at all since the beginning of the semester(for about 2 months). Not that she's a bad person imo, but she's not that trying hard either.\n\n Every time we have a discussion, she just sits around there idly. I know it could be hard enough for her to just catch up with conversation; so I constantly ask her questions and opinions. But she never answers the question. She just shrugs no matter what I ask(her language skill is good enough to understand the short sentences I organized to be as simple as possible).\n\n Last week, we set up a meeting to discuss one of the most important interim report of the semester. It'd be a long meeting so it was a little hard to find out when would be ok for everyone. Since it was impossible for everyone to meet up the same time, we set up the meeting for the day when Y wasn't available and told her we'd share the meeting result to her via email.\n\n I'm not sure how did she feel about that. Anyway the meeting was successful; the hardest part was to decide which assignment should we give to Y(She gotta do something we can write down on the report). We made up an easy assignment that we don't really need to avoid any trouble in case she screws up.\n\n Now I want to tell Y that she doesn't have to waste her time texting to her friends while other teammates discuss and we won't tell the professor. I don't dislike her or anything. She's a lovely person and must be really smart to study college level books in foreign language. But literally no one is benefiting here in my eyes.",

      "description": "I'm currently living with an ex (we're basically now in an open relationship as we've figured out that we do not meet each other's needs n a committed monogamous relationship) and his mother. I have recently bought a house and am working on it to get it move in ready, I will be in by the new year. While I have lived there, his mother has never asked me for rent (which I would be glad to pay, but she's the type that would be offended if I offered) so I pick up extra groceries (I do not eat hardly any of their food even though I'm welcome to it, but I buy extra things that I'm already getting and things specifically for them when I'm out) and I try to help out around the house and do some chores. I am not really there very often, I mostly just sleep there. All in all I cost them virtually nothing, which is the only reason I'm ok not paying rent and pitching in with other things. \n\nHis mother has made it abundantly clear that she does not come into the bedroom. She only does so occasionally to drop laundry off (rare occasion as I do my own laundry, but sometimes a shirt or hoodie gets mixed in with hers) or to ask her son for weed. When I initially moved in she put an extra nightstand in the bedroom for me to use- I would have gotten one myself if she hadn't already put it in there. Over the weekend (I was out of town) she came in to drop laundry off and the drawer was open halfway, I keep a limited amount of things in there, mainly sex toys, hard candy, and weed. She saw the bag of weed and said (according to the ex) \"Why is this in her drawer? It should be in yours!\". He was in the room at the time.\n\nI don't pay for the weed (though I would, but their policy is that if you're smoking it in the house, no worries). Even though I smoke every evening to help me sleep, I do not smoke very much in quantity- just a small hit. Nothing compared to what his friends smoke when they come over (which is almost every day). I have a small bag of weed in my drawer because the ex was tired of me asking for it every night after he was high and relaxed and didn't want to go get the main stash. It's an efficiency thing on his part, I never asked to have the weed, he said here, keep this in your drawer. She reached into the drawer past all the sex toys to grab the weed and took it out and put it where ever. I don't know where it is, I haven't seen it. \n\nI noticed it was gone last night when I tried to do my bedtime routine, the ex wasn't in the room as he had company downstairs, but told me what happened when he came up to go to bed and mentioned it. \n\nNot only do I see this as a gross violation of my privacy, but I also see it as evidence that she doesn't trust me and thinks I'm a mooch, which I am not. I would have left weeks ago and lived in my unfinished house if not for her insistence that I stay with them until it's actually move in ready. She also routinely suggests that I just rent the new house and live with them as she'll miss me sooooooooo much and I'm family.\n\nAm I the asshole for not immediately accepting her half hearted apology via text and thinking that the ex should have had my back (and his own) by telling her how inappropriate she was being in the moment? I no longer feel comfortable there and will be completely moving out this week as a direct result of this incident.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I live in a college dorm with two other girls; there’s only our small bedroom which we all share, and a connected private bathroom. One of my roommates is maintaining a long distance, long term relationship. At least once a week, she goes into our tiny bathroom with unbelievably thin walls and has phone sex with her boyfriend. My other roommate isn’t around as often as I am, so I don’t think she knows about it, and I don’t want to tell her if it’s spreading her private life around. \n\nFor the first half of the year, when I first heard it, I couldn’t believe it. I thought if I was feeling this embarrassed, she would be even more embarrassed if I told her. So I just put earbuds in or tried to go to sleep and endured it. But recently it’s gotten more and more frequent, and louder too. It’s impossible to ignore. They’ve started dirty talk too and I can hear it clear as day. It makes me really uncomfortable but I don’t want to make her go out to the communal bathrooms or mess up her relationship with her boyfriend. WIBTA if I told her I could hear her? ",

If I see him in the office he expects me to stop for 5 minutes and talk regardless of how busy I am and it's really starting to get on my nerves. If I just try to say hi and keep walking he'll get offended and say something like \"That's not the proper way to greet someone.\" I have a very busy job and can't stop to talk all the time. I definitely don't want my boss to find me standing around on the clock.\n\nHe only ever talks about sports even though I've made it clear I have no interest, and will just talk about \"last night's game\" over and over. We don't have anything in common and he's very clearly trying to force being friends. I feel bad because he thinks he's trying to be nice, but it's the same thing every single day. He does this to everyone else at work  and it's very obvious that they're being too polite to say no.\n\nHe doesn't seem to take hints.

      "description": "So this may seem like a small thing but it feels like a big deal, and it’s not the first time we’ve had this argument. I’d love for us to be able to work this out better. \n\nHis POV, as best as I can understand and represent it: he  works in a hospital in a stressful role and does night shift once a week. He absolutely hates it and it exhausts him. He tries so hard to limit the impact with a strict routine which includes sleeping the day before. One closest friends, someone he really likes, has a birthday today and the friend’s new gf has organised a surprise dinner at a nearby restaurant. He’s very tired and feels he is not good company and this is one of the only things he cares enough about to go out for (usually he takes it easy and has difficulty functioning the day after night shift). So he wants to arrive half an hour early and order food, eat and leave around half an hour after everyone else arrives. He says he thinks people will understand when he explains he’s tired from night shift.\n\nMy POV: I feel SUPER uncomfortable at the thought of doing this. I feel like people really don’t understand and will judge us both or think we are strange. When we have had similar situations in the past I feel he has been really inflexible and I feel other people think it’s rude. I think it is rude to arrive early and leave early, and suggests a lack of respect, and comes across as somewhat rude and selfish. I don’t want to go separately and be there on my own, either, as I will probably only know the friend (and I don’t know him that well). In some ways I think he should just suck it up, make an effort, and he should sleep more today and tomorrow and at least wait until others arrive (7:30pm) before ordering. In other ways I can see his POV and recognise I’m responding to fears about what others will think, and that I’m being pretty shallow. But this doesn’t affect my feelings. I would probably rather just say I’m sick and not go rather than be seen with him if he goes ahead with what he wants to do.\n\nI haven’t said much to him - we agreed to talk about it later. AITA? Any suggestions about how I/we can move past this argument and others like it are VERY welcome. Thank you for reading this far!",

      "description": "So I'm a freshman in college right now. When I came here, I wanted to room with someone for the traditional college feel. We met in the summer by going to lunch with our moms. She seemed pretty cool to me at first. I was still nervous that we'd end up not being friends. We moved in for a summer camp in August but spent no time together that week bc we were in diff groups and our activities ran all day long. \n\nNow during school, we STILL barely did anything together. Every time I'd ask if she wanted to do anything she either ended up being busy or she generally wasn't interested. So I was like 'okay' and shrugged it off. She never really asked me to go anywhere with her either. Eventually I just gave up on trying to do things with her bc I thought that if she really wanted to be friends with me, she'd actually try to hang out. I'm honestly a pretty chill person when it comes to my personality, you just have to get to know me first and then I'm a lot more outgoing.\n\nIn between those mixed feelings, some things happened during the first semester that made me all the more realize that I didn't want to be friends with her. First, she texts me that I sprayed too much perfume in the room and she has allergies. I say sorry I'll try not to use so much. Weeks later, same thing happens but she sounds a bit more annoyed in her text. Sounded like she was implying that I needed to go somewhere else to use it. I'm like okay..? Cool. I'll try not to do it again (EXACT words). \n\nNext thing happens near the end of semester. I'm on the phone with my bf and we're talking like we normally do. So one night she's asleep and we get a fire drill. We come back and she lays down to sleep again. I respect that so I try to be fairly quiet in the room. It's kinda late but I call my bf again when we get back. Note: Me and my roommate followed each other on insta, so then I see a post from her saying that I was too loud on the phone and I needed to go to sleep. I'm in an ldr (3 hrs apart) so it's hard to call at a decent time based on our lives so night works best for us. I stay chill and hang up 20 mins later. The problem is that I don't say anything when she's talking to her bf late at night, AND I can hear him on speaker every time they talk. So why is it just me that's the problem? \n\nSo I blocked her # and unfollowed her. Idk if that was too much but why do you have to complain on social media instead of telling ME what's wrong? She wrote that she KNEW I'd see it and that \"I could feel any way about it.\" I didn't know wth that meant but I just left it at that.\n\nSo idk what to feel now. Am I an asshole for feeling like this? I'm not gonna lie, I probably won't be making amends with her at this point.  But I honestly don't hate her. What bothers me is that she only texted me when she had issues. I like talking things out to solve problems.  I've just come to terms that I had an awkward first roommate experience. 🤷🏾",

I turned 18 last week and she ended up breaking up with her boyfriend to be with me now since I’m “not a case” in her words. She asked me out as we were both clocking out.

      "description": "Yesterday our 3 year old went on a little adventure. My husband came home from doing some errands, we chatted for a bit in our kitchen, leaving our son to play on his own like we always do in an adjacent-but-not-in-eyesight room. He usually watches TV for a bit after his snack, it's been the routine for a year now. Color us surprised when he managed to unlock the front wooden door, open it, unlock the front glass door, and open it, get down our porch all without us noticing. We noticed after about 10min and we freaked out. 911 and 3hr later, he's brought home from a few blocks away: full of mud but otherwise O.K.\n\nI'm not asking if we were the assholes for not paying attention, because I know we full well were. I do want to ask about our neighbor though and if me blowing up at her was justifiably assholish. After we had our baby back, she piped in to the police officers with us in earshot \"oh I saw him running across the street, I thought he was playing so didn't do anything\". She detailed she knew our kid got out unattended (and did nothing), what direction he went in (and told no one), and previously said she had no idea about anything (lying to cops and us).\n\nI don't get along with my neighbor. She somehow has four cars to their household and frequently parks in our driveway. We don't have a car ourselves. It's been a constant battle over the last five years to get her to stop. She's retaliated, too, but I think this time goes too far. I exploded at her and would have got physical were the police not there.\n\nWhile I know we should have been more attentive, what my neighbor did was outright malicious. AITA for exploding at her? Is she TA?",

      "description": "Context- \n\nSo my friend (we’ll call him M) is one of my closest friends, we’ve been friends all our life even thought he moved to a town 5 hours away. I see him every time he come to town and recently I got the word that he’ll be down for the next few days. His mom is my moms friend that’s how I knew.\n\nStory - \nSo I heard that he was coming to town from my mom. I was surprised he hadn’t told me but I realized he might be busy so I went with it and texted him. M answers and I learn he’s supposed to be coming down on a Wednesday morning spending a day here then going an hour away to my mom’s boyfriend’s house that he’s letting her use (he’ll stay with us) for few days skiing.  I think that this is awesome because my conference swim meet is that Thursday and I’d really love if he could come watch. M says he might be able to come and he’d love to.\n \nWe live in a place with really bad road condition so the next day (Wednesday) I’m coming back from swim practice and my mom tells me that because they were supposed to get heavy snow they came down a day early and were already here. Again I’m surprised M didn’t tell me, I think they got here late and he must have been really tired so I drop it. \n\nLater the same day I hear (from my mom again) that since they came here a day early they are heading up skiing Wednesday night instead. I get kind of angry, it’s not just that M can’t go to my swim meet but that he didn’t even bother to tell me. \nThis also effects my whole family, my mom’s boyfriend now has to come down a day early messing with his schedule and it ruins the dinner my mom and M’s were supposed to have at the local Pub. \n\nAITA for being mad that not only did they change plans last minute but M didn’t even bother to tell me?

If you have to go out of your way to exaggerate or lie about parts of the story, then the story clearly wasnt interesting enough to tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, in a recent instant where my gf was telling a story, it made me cringe when she felt the need to lie about details to \"make it more interesting\".  I confronted her about this after, alone, in private, sharing my thoughts, as above.  She did not take it well and is mad, when in truth i feel that she is actually the one at fault for, in my eyes, essentially lying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit, AITA?",

The whole time my colleagues teased this guy for giving the lowest possible amount and challenged him to match mine. He mentioned he doesn't have cash on him, and we still end up with the required amount to go ahead with it.\n\nHe later sent me a message and offered to give me back half my share tomorrow. I thanked him but declined the offer, and suggested to offer the money to another colleagues who shouldered most of it or to our boss who'll prolly divide it between whoever wants it but he kept on insisting I take it instead, over and over. I got angry and just stood my ground and replied back with \"I don't want the money. Stop being pushy.\" BTW this person likes me, and he's been guilty of being a niceguyTM in the past. I know I shouldn't question his motives but it feels like an attempt to earn brownie points from a specific person, which is me.\n\nI'll definitely apologise if I'm the asshole.",

      "description": "Last week of January, I'd found a guy selling Ram on FB marketplace. We scheduled a meetup. Early the day of, he asks to reschedule. Fine. We make plans for two days later. He misses the meet time and messages me 15 minutes late. Apologizes to me and says his work pulled him out of town. I assure him it's no problem and say I'm open to a reschedule. I'll admit, this confuses me because he says he works in the same plaza I do and to my knowledge there's no place here that has traveling employees (think strip mall with strip mall staples).\n&gt;\n&gt;\nI don't hear from him until today, 2/6. It's a gap of 8 days. He asks if I'm still interested. I say yes. He apologizes again for not messaging earlier. I say it's no issue and he doesn't message me back.\nWithin a few hours... The listing is now marked as sold. &gt;\n&gt;\nI'm mildly annoyed. I've been nothing but patient. My snark comes out a little bit and I say \"Lol so why message asking if I was interested when you sold it? That's pretty goddamn shitty.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;\nI get back: \"Faustus, I wish you held off saying that to me. I have more of that ram and I was going to message you directly. I did state in my sale that I have more in bulk of these if Interested. I just sold most of the ram to someone who bought in bulk. Selling to get money is somewhat a priority to anyone who wants to buy them.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;\nHonestly, I no longer care about the ram. It's DDR3 for a laptop I'm probably replacing when my taxes come in. It was cheap enough for me to snag it and hope it tides me over. But am I wrong for getting upset this dude blew me off twice, shows up again, offers it and then sells it after asking me if I wanted it again? Also, if Selling it was a priority, wouldn't you have... You know... REACHED OUT TO ME, THE GUY WHO WORKS A CORRIDOR AWAY FROM YOU SOONER?",

He's been applying for jobs and finally got a written offer.\n\nThe offer is for the same amount that he's been getting for years: it's a decent amount but by no means very high.\n\nI don't live with my parents and I work in a different industry, but having gone through several job offers and successful negotiations, I suggested that my dad asks for a +$5k raise. The reply email was crafted very carefully, stating that 1) he appreciates the offer and the initial meeting 2) he's wondering if there's any flexibility in the offer because he believes he can bring a lot to the team and the company and 3) finally asking if they're willing to go for +$5k.\n\nInitially my dad hesitated (I think because he's been tired of searching for a job for so long), but eventually he agreed to try it. My thought process was:\n\n1. He deserves more -- he really is amazing in his industry\n2. It's an initial negotiation and he's not asking for an outrageous amount on top of the initial offer\n3. He's never agreed to any previous offer from them (or discussed any potential salary), so there's no reason why he can't try to ask for a bit more\n4. The email was extremely professional and polite, structured so they could easily have replied back with \"no, that's our best and final offer\"\n\nTo my shock, the employer's contact called back (not emailed back) 3 days later saying they're rescinding the offer...(!)\n\nWat. The only reason I can think of is that they were so unsure of whether to hire him or not initially, that they either 1) decided not to bother or 2) found someone else.\n\nOf course my dad feels horrible now, and so do I. And if it wasn't for my convincing, he would probably have that job by now.\n\nAm I the asshole for getting involved and should we not have negotiated?",

      "description": "TL:DR- SO works 3rd shift and takes care of LO during day. Lack of sleep has taken a toll on their mental health.\n\nBackstory: SO and I have under 1 yr old child. Daycare is expensive. I work 1st shift (630-230p). They work 3rd shift (10-6a). Our bulidings are close enough for baby trade off in mornings. SO watches baby during day, naptime between 9-12p. I take over baby duty when I get home at 3, SO sleeps till 7\n\nSO has been struggling with getting enough sleep since I came back from leave. I am very concerned for their wellbeing and safety driving hi-low at work. I made some suggestions to help:\n\nThere was an job opportunity at my ideal workplace, position would be Fri-Tues 8a-5p. SO vetoed this because then I lose vacation time and forced to get my own insurance.\n\nMy retired parents could watch him a few times a week. They live 45mins away but we could meet halfway for trade off. Aside from gas money, care would be free. SO does not like in-laws since they felt I could have done better and told them such while we were dating. My parents respect my decision marrying and are civil towards SO.\n\nThe lack of sleep and general stress has gotten to SO. Angers quick and much more snarky towards me. Easily can get frustrated with LO. When well rested, I get to see that loving supportive person again.\n\nI have no longer the option to change jobs; I need the time off for relatives passing away after the holidays. I can't change my shift; its dumb luck I got to 1st and we plan for me to go back to school in evenings. My future degree will allow SO stay home. \n\nOur mutual friends have noticed the changes in SO as well; its not just my mind jumping into stuff. \n\nIf I mention about being sore or tired it becomes a game of one-up to SO. I have been accused of cheating, not helping, and delayed PPD. I stand there and take it, knowing its the lack of sleep. But I am getting to my breaking point. So....\n\nWIBTA on giving the ultimatum to SO: Leave third shift or I am leaving.",

      "description": "Don't get me wrong, I love my dad. The only respect I have for him tho, is that he is my father, not for the person he is. It's always been that he seems to only care about himself. My parents are about to lose their house because my dad has yet to find a job and my mom is about to lose all hope in him. Besides financially, it seems my dad has no consideration for my mom or the house he lives in. He flicks cig ashes on brand new things ruining them, he pees all over the toilet seat/floor doesn't clean it up, when my mom asks him to take off his shoes so the new carpet and hard floors don't get ruined, he doesn't no matter how many times he is told, he uses food that my brother buys for the house all for himself without asking, whenever he does make money, he doesn't tell my mom about it most of the time and doesn't put it in the bank to cover their overdraft and bills, when my mom asks him to help with her vehicle he prioritizes his over hers, he borrows money from family members for insignificant things when they are already short and my mom gets upset because for one he shouldn't have asked them for money and two what are they supposed to do to pay them back because they *literally cannot* pay them back, he keeps pulling money out of the bank even tho my mom has told him not to when they are in overdraft and have been for almost 2 years. He doesn't seem to able to take criticism about anything and gets very disrespectful and has at attitude like he doesn't do anything wrong, like he should do whatever he wants because it's what he wants. Sure he does help out around the house by doing dishes and home improvements, but that doesn't make it okay that he has always been that way, and he seems to think that those things he does makes it okay and forgiven. Like, sure you made a shelf thing for the laundry room, but that doesn't make it acceptable that you're inconsiderate. It's really hurting my mom because she feels like he just doesn't care about her or the house they live in and she is getting to her last straw. She doesn't know what's going to happen if they lose their house because there is nothing else they can do unless my dad steps up, but also what's the point of having the house if my dad acts like that? Now that all the kids are out of the house (my brother moved back from Hawaii so he's just staying there until he's back on his feet) I can understand that my dad may think that since they dont have kids to raise now, they have extra money for some reason, but my mom has told him sooo many times that that's not the case and they are losing their house and it doesn't seem to process in his mind and I for the life of me cannot understand that.

      "description": "So, my boyfriend and I live about a 15-20min car drive apart. When we spend time together, most of the time he comes pick me up and then drives me back home (I don't have a car available to drive most of the time). The problem I have is, that he's only really willing to do this, if it's for a longer period of time  say, like me sleeping over (this is not connected to us being intimate). We usually only have time to see each other for one day during the weekends (because he works till about 4 or 5pm and we both have to sleep at our separate homes becuase of things to do in the morning; and we pretty much only hang out at his house because I live in a flat with my family who doesn't really like him, and I have to spend one morning during the weekend at home for family stuff) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy logic is basically that we could see each other more and more often, if he were okay with us spending just 3-5hours together (either going out to dinner, movies, drinks, or being at his place), but he say's that all that driving is a waste of time, money and gas, for just a couple of hours. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for thinking that he should be more okay with spending just a few hours with me a few times a week, instead of only a set of \\~24hours during the weekend? Maybe I'm just too demanding and wanting too much... Since I don't really drive all of the driving really does fall on him, and if we were to hang out at his place, he'd have to make the trip 4 times in one day (to pick me up, drive us to his, drop me off ath home, drive himself home) ",

      "description": "I know how bad the title sounds, but I promise, there is a lot more to the story than it seems (tl;dr at the bottom). Posting this on a throwaway and [insert obligatory mobile apology here].\n\nMy ex and I recently broke up about 2 weeks ago. Ot wasn't that long of a relationship, but we were still in the standard honeymoon phase. When we first broke up, he claimed that I \"wasn't the one\". \n\nNow, I 100% think that is a valid reason to break up with someone, even though I don't personally believe in soulmates. I do believe that are a few (maybe) 100 people in the world that can be a great match for you, though not all of them are accessible. I explained this to him, while also being understanding, because he also had some really strong uncontrollable things going on in his life that I believe kind of forced him to break up with me. \n\nMe not being the one wasn't the only thing he said, however. He had a lot more excuses. \"I don't want to hurt you. I'd rather another guy hurt you (relationship wise)\" or \"I'm trying to protect you\". All in all, none of these truly felt genuine to me. They all felt like excuses, and I honestly thought he was scared to tell me the real reason why. I accepted his \"explanations\" for that day and essentially moved on. He did the obligatory \"let's be friends\" that everyone does after a breakup and he seemed to genuinely mean it. \n\nA few weeks pass and I keep thinking, \"did I do something wrong\"? So I directly asked him if it was maybe how I looked or if he was attracted to me. He said no, he loved how I look, and was actually still attracted to me. So I asked him straight out, there has to be something else, because you ended the relationship for seemingly no valid reason.\n\nHe ends up calling to fully explain.... and his huge explanation was, and I quote, \"To be honest, it's because you're not Albanian. I don't want my children to not have my culture. I want them to live in Albania, speak Albanian, be Albanian...\", you can see where this is going.\n\nI explain to him that having children with someone of a different nationality doesn't erase your nationality from your kids. He is not having it AT ALL. I tell him that it's an ignorant way of looking at things and being so nationalistic is really harmful. I then give him examples/scenarios. One of which was:\n\nLet's say you date a girl of Irish or Chinese heritage. You date and maybe eventually marry her and are together for 10-15 years. At the beginning, she never really had a stance on having children, but for the most part didn't want them. If after those 10-15 years, she asks of you want to try for a child, are you going to tell her to fuck off because your child isn't 100% Albanian? \n\nHe was kind of speechless to that and mumbled a, \"no, no, no...\". At this point, I think he realized how fucked up everything sounded, but he still wanted to hang on to his national pride, explaining to me that without people in his country being nationalistic, they wouldn't exist. Now, I know the history of the country, so I purely understand what he was talking about, but I told him, \"your heritage and culture only gets erased if you erase it yourself. Your children will always be Albanian if you raise them that way, no matter what the other half of them is.\"\n\nAgain, he completely ignored what I am saying and essentially screams at me to just shut up and stop. I agree that I'll stop trying to teach someone who doesn't want to learn, but that I'll leave him with some advice: either go back to your country or don't date outside of your nationality if you're going to think this way. It's not right to the women you could possibly date to have their hopes up (especially if the relationship last longer than a year or two) and then eventually break up with them because they're not Albanian. \n\nHis reply to that advice was that he can date whoever he wants without having children with them. This confused me even further, because we had only been dating a short while and babies hadn't even come up in the conversation (obviously). Not even including the fact that he never asked me about children in the first place. My opinion on children for the most part is that I don't want to have them unless my SO or partner wants to have one or two, in which case, I would raise the kids with that partner. He never asked me these things at all, so I'm surprised kids even came up as the reason for breaking up with me.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for telling to go back home with his ignorant way of thinking? We live in a pretty big city, where interracial and international relationships. I personally think that being so close minded and intentionally entering in such relationships are kind of a shitty thing to do. But that's my opinion, what's yours?\n\nTl;dr: My ex's reason for breaking up with me was that if he had children with me, they wouldn't be 100% Albanian. My response was that he shouldn't actively be dating outside of his nationality and/or race and that maybe he should go back to his country if he really only wants pure bred Albanian children. AITA for telling him to go back or only date \"his people\"?",

      "description": "I know the title is vague, but the issue too long and unclear to shorten. The whole thing is \"AITA for getting mad at my dad for taking his thing that I asked for back without telling me and risking damaging expensive equipment?\"\n\nI am a Twitch streamer who takes it very seriously, I was using a webcam that I wasn't happy with so I asked my dad to use his video camera. He said yes. So of course, I took it and hooked it up to my Elgato HD60S capture card [$170]. My room is very crowded, especially around my desk. Next to my desk is my table where I have my Nintendo 64 [I have no idea how much a good condition one costs], a Super Retro Trio (NES/SNES/Genesis combined) [$70], my capture card, an AV to HDMI converter [$30], a small TV [I don't know the price], and my HTC Vive [$500].\n\nThe table was incredibly crowded and something could have easily fell off if you weren't careful with it. And I used to have an internship at a TV station so I am VERY sensitive about my equipment. I take very good care of it and I took extra care of the camera and tripod. Everything worked great, and I told my dad I was going to be using his camera for a while.\n\nToday however, while I was at school, he had to use the camera for work, so he took it off my table, obviously not being careful and trying to set my stuff back up not knowing a thing about video equipment, without even telling me.\n\nWhen I got home I noticed it wasn't there, and that my vive was on the floor. I was immedietly enraged that he didn't take care of the Vive that I spent hours upon hours at work to pay for. I texted him asking him politely if he took the camera, he said yes. I was definitely upset that he never told me.\n\nSince my Vive was on the floor, I decided to check if he damaged anything else. I realised that my capture card was still plugged in, this time into my console. First of all, it was obviously not plugged in before, so he tried to make it normal again. Second of all, he plugged my console into the OUTPUT and my TV into the INPUT. I learned at the TV station that doing that can damage both the capture card and devices hooked up to it. Thankfully, no damage was done and all my stuff is okay, even the Vive. But it was all at risk, since my dad is careless with other people's things, especially money, which is my next point.\n\nWhen I was testing my capture card, it didn't work at first, at all. My dad got home from work and I told him he broke my capture card, which was a fair assumption because, you know, it didn't work. His first response was \"I didn't break anything.\" Which I quickly responded with \"Then why doesn't it work?\" He immedietly knew that he would have to pay for it, that's how it works around my house, but not with him, and everyone in my family has been cracking down on it. He then said that I would not get the camera back and that I would have to buy my own.\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Y’all hear me out\n\nBackstory: Everyone in this story is a senior in college. We’ve all been in the same friend group since freshman year. For this story I’ll refer to the girl as Anna. We’re not hella close, but we’re cool. \n\nOne night our group got together at Anna’s for a wine night like we usually do to drink and have a game night. Everyone but me, Anna, 2 other girls had just one glass of wine whereas we had about 3\\~4. \n\nWe were upstairs watching a scary movie (forgot the name). Near the end one person got up to leave and say goodbye which in turn caused some of the others to follow suit. I got up with the others because I thought she’d want everyone to leave at the same time. But when I got up she asked me to stay since I don’t live far. I didn’t think much of it since her other friend, let’s call her Katie, was also staying. (She was one of the 2 girls that drank the same amount as us)\n\nI stopped drinking at this point because I didn’t want to risk driving drunk. Katie literally lives down the street (1 street over) so she finished the bottle with Anna. For context they’re both on Anna’s bed and I’m across from them on a chair. I’m on my phone adding to the conversation sparingly. After 20ish minutes Katie says she has to leave and I get up with her bc I assumed she would want me to leave as well. Anna then asks me to not leave immediately bc then she’ll be all alone and stated that I drank and live farther than Katie so I should sober up some more. I agreed since she made a good point and it ended up being just us. \n\nAt this point she’s laid back against the headboard and says “Relax, you can jump on\". I relaxed and joined her. We start talking about our shows and start sharing funny tweets with each other. I noticed she’s been getting closer and closer and I lowkey felt some electricity between us, now since I was a little tipsy I was like “fuck it,” and went for a kiss and she reciprocated! We ended up having sex in her bed for a while and I left afterwards. \n\nFast-forward 1 week, our friend group is chilling on campus discussing the plans of our graduation trip we plan on taking this summer and while we’re on the topic of sleeping arrangements Anna causally slips out that she’s sharing a bed with X ( a friend that’s not exactly in our direct circle but just outside of it). I thought she was joking but it turned out that they were a couple! I had no idea that they were talking much less dating and had I known I wouldn’t have had done what I did since me and X are cool. Later I asked her about their relationship and she told me that they were “going through a rough patch” and were on a “break” for a while (our relations falling in that “break” window) and so what we did wasn’t technically wrong. \n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: Went to game night at friends house, slept with host not knowing she was technically in a relationship with someone but was on a “break”.

      "description": "\nSo I have had a girl who I used to consider my best friend. To help with the flow of this story I will call her R. For reference R and I had been friends since 5th grade, and I am now a junior in high school. During middle school I was very anxious and R was pretty much my only friend expect for one other person. I now notice that she was isolating me and complaining anytime I got any other friends. She would also randomly ignore me or tell me I couldn’t sit with her anymore, but she was my only friend and I was very dependent on her, so I stuck with her. She also had a habit of telling me everything wrong with myself, and also telling me that she would complain about me to her parents. I had low self esteem so I thought that was fine and I deserved it.\n\nSo then high school starts. My older sister was in high school and she helped me get more friends. I now had a larger amount of friends that included R. Me and R still stayed very close throughout all of my freshman year. So this is when stuff started going south. \n\nUsually on R”s birthday we would celebrate it the weekend after, either by a party or traveling up to the city to go out to eat. R”s birthday is about two weeks out- she reminds me her birthday is coming up and tells me we would be celebrating the weekend after. I agreed. I’m honestly a very forgetful person, and I wish this didn’t happen but I did forget her birthday. I realized the day after what I had done and I immediately apologized. She told me her feeling were hurt and I respected that. She then proceeded to ignore me for about an entire week. I tried to apologize multiple times and I offered to get her a gift, her ignoring me was making me incredibly anxious and I expressed this to her. She eventually started taking to me again.  Our friendship was strained ever since then. \n\nWe still stayed friends but I started getting new friends and working through my own problems- and I realized her personality was toxic for me. So I began distancing myself from her. I’d still talk to her but we wouldn’t hang out after school. And eventually I just didn’t hang out with R at all. The beginning of this year R left our school. They sent me a long text about how they are leaving because they don’t feel like we’re friends anymore and they don’t know what they did. I feel guilty for not being more direct. Am I the asshole for not being more direct??",

      "description": "Okay, so the basic setup is this: My immediate family (parents and brothers) live pretty far away from my extended family (grandparents, cousins, etc). Like, a plane ride away. So we usually only see them around Christmas and other special occasions. One Christmas we were opening presents and my brothers got quite a lot of money in Steam vouchers each. I was excited for mine, and opened it to find a few different Dusk products, which at the time was rather disappointing. A few quick notes:\n\n\\- It's true that I do shop at Dusk quite a lot, but I like to get my own things from there because I shop around to see what scents I like/am in the mood for at the time.\n\n\\- The Dusk products in question were actually some reed diffuser products. I exclusively used candles at the time, never reed products because I knew if I left them sitting around I would spill the oil in them everywhere.\n\n\\- There were no reeds and no oil with the reed diffuser products, making them essentially unusuable unless I bought my own.\n\n\\- I'm also an avid PC gamer. In fact, because my brothers are often using the consoles, I tend to do all my gaming on the PC, and am almost always keen for Steam vouchers.\n\n\\- This last point is kind of petty but did go through my mind at the time: since I'm the only girl, it sort of felt like I didn't get Steam money because 'pretty smells are much more ladylike than videogames' (I have always been a tomboy-gamer-nerd stereotype anyway). That probably wasn't their intention, though.\n\nSo, I was a little bitter about that. I made a very quiet offhand comment to my older brother asking if I could express my frustration to him (which he usually allows) and he told me to just be grateful for what I got. I accepted that, retreated to the bathroom to silently cry my feelings out for a minute (I cry when I'm frustrated/annoyed/angry/any strong negative feeling, not just when I'm sad, and wanted to do it where I wouldn't bother anyone), made myself presentable, and didn't mention it to anyone else at all.\n\nLooking back, gifts are gifts, and it's possible that I should have been grateful for what I got regardless of how wanted/useful it was, or if my siblings got the thing I actually wanted. AITA for being a little frustrated with the situation?",

      "description": "For my and my twin sister’s 30th birthday, I made plans with her boyfriend to fly in and surprise her, since I live in a different country and we haven’t spent our birthday together in years. She will be THRILLED, knowing her. I told my parents when I booked the ticket, and they asked if they could come along too, and we could all spend our 30th together - great! I love my family, I don’t get to see them enough, and I was super happy we’d all get to be together. \n\nI did say I thought they should tell her they were coming, because I thought it would be more special for me to show up as a surprise, but they also wanted to be a part of the reveal. I said okay, and we could make that decision later.\n\nIt’s getting closer to the date, so my sister’s boyfriend and I have been making more specific plans. I called my parents to fill them in, and they dropped on me that my aunt wanted to come too...and that she’s already bought her plane ticket. At this point, it was starting to feel like it wasn’t my trip or my surprise anymore, like my parents have co-opted it, so I asked them to tell my sister that they and my aunt were coming, and my arrival would still be a surprise.\n\nMy mother is pushing back in the group planning message thread, saying she “has some concerns” about doing that, since sister’s boyfriend has already told her to take the Friday and Monday off work for something he’s planning, and that my sister is going to get suspicious. \n\nI sent them a message this morning to say that I was disappointed with how it was panning out. Firstly because my big gift was flying in as a surprise, and it feels less special if everyone is doing it, and secondly because it now feels like it’s her special surprise birthday weekend and everyone is making a big deal about surprising her for it ...but it’s also my birthday too! \n\nAlso (my parents don’t know this), my sister’s boyfriend asked me a long time ago, when I first started arranging my travel plans and it was meant to be just me there, if I minded him proposing to my sister that weekend. He’s wonderful, and I couldn’t be happier for them, so I said yes, of course! But now it feels like everything else is going to overshadow my weekend with my sister. Also, I’m now a little worried that she’ll think her boyfriend arranged for everyone to be there for the proposal and not that it was my surprise that I arranged for her.\n\nAm I being too difficult and controlling about this trip? I’m worried they’re going to think I’m being precious about being the center of attention...and maybe I am?",

      "description": "Hello everyone, so here is the story. I have a friend in my group of friends that is a bit slower than the average person but he is a good guy and I only mind it when it comes to playing video and board games with him. It is very frustrating because no matter what game we play he always needs help with figuring out what he needs to do and always does stupid stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, we were playing Destiny 2 and he needed to talk to a guy so he can get the next quest but he couldn't find that guy. So I asked him is this the guy you need to talk to, lets say his name was Fred, and he said no I can't talk to this one. I then spent the next 20 minutes trying to figure out what mission was he on, and who does he need to speak to to progress just to realize that it was Fred all along. The mission even said \"Talk to Fred\" but he didn't knew how to check what mission was he on and what he needed to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we play any competitive team based gave like Dota 2, or a battle royale, every match i tell him \"Don't do that\" or \"Don't go there you will die\" and he never listens, thinking he knows best, and it always happens what i tell him it will happen. Like we were playing a battle royale game the other day and he was running towards a house and i saw a guy in the house through a window and i told him \"Don't go in there, there is a guy.\" and he went in, died, and was like \"I didn't really think there was a guy there.\". He does stuff like this all the time and i try not to get mad or frustrated because I know he is trying his best but I can only abstain myself so much. The same goes for board games, any team based game where you need to guess something like Alias or Activity he is useless for the team he is in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to admit that i am a competitive person. So am I the asshole for not wanting to play games with him on my team, or games where we have to work together? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA For not wanting to HAVE to live with my dad anymore?",
      "description": "I'm a highschooler whose parents have been separated for 2 years. My dad cheated on my mom since my younger brother was three, and I found out on...get this....a vacation with him in Colombia. Their separation agreement was that my brother and I would live with my mom for a week, then switch to my dads house. Standard divorce stuff really. But lately I've become very sick of it. Every time I switch I feel like I am packing up my life and moving. I refer to it as an unstable life. Living with my dad isn't great either. He doesn't support me, my interests, or my future (I got invited to a Stanford Law thingy, and he responded with \"Cool, I am going to order some pizza.\"). Sometimes he can be a really great parent, but I don't know if it weighs out the bad. \n\nThis would be a much easier choice for me, if there wasn't a few pressing issues. First of all, I am able to attend the highschool I go to only because I use his address (they offered classes unavailable else where, I am very serious about my education, so AP world at my grade level was a must). So this causes more issues. When I am at my moms, either he picks me up directly after school (since my mom can't) or I take the bus and go to his apartment, and wait for either him or my mom to take me back. There isn't any bus stops by my moms house which really sucks. \n\nIf I do choose to stop living at him, it would make everyday after school the most awkward thing. He would probably begin to refuse to pick me up from school, so I would be forced to go to his apartment everyday, where I would then see him after a few hours. Hopefully you all can see why that would be a disaster. \n\nMy only other option is to continue what I am doing. Or choose to stay with my mom, and expect my dad to be cool with seeing me everyday, only for a few hours. \n\nKEEP IN MIND : My dad is pretty emotionally immature. I wouldn't expect much from him at this point.",

So many people on reddit said go to the gym it won't have right away affects but it will get better over time. I thought that was a good idea because my twin older sisters already go to the gym so I could just go when they go since they drive. So last week 2 weeks ago I asked my mom if I could get a gym membership where my sisters go. She said no and refused to give me a answer so a couple hours ago I ask her again and explanation to her why she still says no with no explanation. So I ask her to at least give me a answer and she said cuase she said no that's why then I started yelling then she started yelling and now I'm in my room its 9 and I haven't ate dinner cuase I refuse to talk to her. My sister is saying and I quote \"stop being a little shit and come eat\" I told her to bring food to me but she hasn't am i the asshole or do i deserve a answer.",

But then my aunt comes on the family chat having started a go fund me for this shit to essentially beg for money from family members and on top of that goes on a tirade about how \"brave\" and \"selfless\" it is of my cousin to do this.\nThis aunt has never given me the time of day in the past and treats her own childeren with A LOT of favouritism (which is understandable). She once tried to guilt me into spending my entire half term working for my grandparents while her son (1 year older than me) sat and played on the ps4 he dragged over from home.\nId be totally fine with all of this shit if it werent for the ammount of praise shes heaping on her daughter. The damn thing isnt brave or selfless at all! She wants to go on a month long holiday! If it was about helping people why wouldnt you find a more eficiant use for the money than sending 15 year olds across the world to waste time being taught things that theyll do once before going home feeling superior.\nI havent spoken to anyone yet but im seriously considering it. I dont know why this pisses me off so much but, just to be clear, im only really mad at my aunt and not my cousin. \nAITA?",

      "description": "Saw a post earlier about someones dog eating their friends shoes, made me remember this story from a few years back.\n\nFor some backround; in HS my friends and I used to hang in my basement all the time and play video games, smoke some pot, etc.\n\nFor friends of mine whose parents were less okay with that, it meant owning a bong was a pretty sketchy and if they were getting picked up by their parent theyd ask if they could leave it at my place for a bit. I was always cool with it, but it was worrying bc at any given time I might have a few thousand dollars worth of glassware in a room full of stoned idiots. \n\nSo my friend left his piece on the edge of a VERY wobbly end table (i could practically turn this thing into a rhombus the legs were so loose) and didn’t mention it. He was also eating sunflower seeds and left a pile of chewed sunflower shells on said table. Didn’t think much of it, a little rude, a little gross, but i scooped them into the trash and noticed a few on the floor under the table. As I come out from under the table my head bumps the table and the piece falls and breaks.  He probably bought for 350-400, but it wasnt worth near that much if he were to resell it. When I told him it broke and that I had no money to put towards his next piece, I said that I shouldnt be soley responsible for replacing especially given the circumstances (left on edge of table, I was cleanin his mess)\n\nIn hindsight I probably shouldve offered like 100 bucks when I had it, but he got another piece and bought a nice protective case for it and was much more careful with it.

A few water bottles here and a couple of empty fast food bags. Nothing super gross though, like rotting food or pests or anything.\n\nI’ll usually clean it out and vacuum every few weeks. I, personally, don’t care too much about the state of my car because I’m usually the only person in it. I invest a lot more time in keeping our house (we live together) clean. My car is honestly the last thing on my mind. It’s just what I use to get around. \n\nAnyways, my boyfriend *always* has to comment on how messy it is. Dozens and dozens of times. I’ve tried explaining to him that I just don’t care about the state of my car and he won’t listen. The thing is, his car is always a mess too! Not that much better than mine. So I’m confused as to why he feels the need to comment on it all the time.\n\nI’ve been getting more upset when he brings it up because it doesn’t even affect him. It’s not like I’m a total slob in all areas of our life. I keep our house *spotless*. He only rarely has to deal with my messy car. \n\nToday, he offered to clean the snow off of my car and I immediately knew that he was going to comment on how messy it is. I almost told him not to worry about it, but he was already out the door. Low and behold, he calls two minutes later just to tell me how messy it is. I told him thanks for cleaning it off and hung up. I feel ungrateful, since he did clean the snow off, but I’m still so pissed that he keeps on obsessing over how messy it is. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So a while ago, a girl (24F) who I (25M) was friends with told me she was interested in me, and we had a physical relationship going on. But she later said she couldn't be in a relationship with me due to her being religious and me not. I was disappointed, but I accepted that if that was the deal breaker, then that's just how it was going to be. After she told me this, I told her that I didn't want to continue a physical relationship because I wanted to move on. About a week later, she roped me back in by saying how she was having a tough time with her feelings, so I offered to talk with her about everything because I still cared about her. So we talk, but we also ended up sleeping together that night. Weeks after that, the whole physical relationship is revamped, and to me, it seemed like she really wanted to start a relationship with me. But after that, she said the same thing about how religious differences are too much to handle and that was it. I was hurt by this because it seemed like she always knew what was going to happen in the end, but still made me believe in something that really had no chance of happening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now, and I tell her roommate the whole story of what happened between she and I. From this conversation, I find out that the girl I was with only told her roommate bits and pieces of the story. For example, she left out the fact that we slept together (although we didn't really do much of anything. It was pretty PG-13 rated), and she left out the fact that I told her that I wanted out after she said no the first time. The two of us have the same friend group, so it bothers me that she told one of my good friends (her roommate) an abridged side of the story, which leaves out details of why I felt hurt in the first place. It also bugs me because it makes me look bad since what she's saying is a different narrative compared to what actually happened. Because of all this, now I just ignore her when we're in our friend group. I won't leave a group of friends if she were to walk over, but I don't really go out of my way to say hi or anything like that anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for ignoring her after this? ",

      "description": "So i've kinda been thinking this through and i just feel somewhat annoyed/angry over the fact for this happening.  \nEarlier tonight I talked to one of my friends after she told me she had a pretty bad week, of course I wanted to know why, and it was quite odd for me as I quickly picked up, that there was a bunch of background noise. She told me that she'd rather talk about this face to face, which im absolutely fine with, and afterwards said that she just wanted to celebrate our mutual friends birthday. Let's call this friend of ours Alice.  \nSo Alice told me from pretty much when she turned 17 that i had to come to her birthday and it would mean a lot for her if i came, and as im really not a social person, the type of guy that'd rather just have a beer and stick around at home with my dog, i still accepted the fact that she really wanted me to come. I've spoken to her about this multiple times throughout this year, and i kept saying that i'd of course come as she wanted me to.  \nAfter realizing that i didn't even get invited to her birthday party (which is tonight) i feel quite odd about this, of course i know when her actual birthday is but i never knew when this party would take place.  \nThe point where i feel like im in a dilemma is that i've set all other plans aside for new years to be together with this group of friends, including her, but now i honestly don't feel like going   \nI don't know if im just acting like a twat and taking things too personal or if i've done something wrong (not that i know of) but this kinda puts me at the point where i'd rather just stay at home for new years  \n\n\nTL;DR After talking to a long time friend about her birthday for a year ish, about me coming i didn't get invited, which leaves me confused about what to do for new years.",

      "description": "This isn't a long story, and there isn't much drama, but I feel it merits asking.\n\nThis started roughly a week ago. My roommate's parents are helping with some kind of horse race event or something (They are old money farmers) and my RM is asked to help out for some money. Also for context, it's important to note that, yes, we are tight on money, but aren't in trouble (Had to pay some extra bills and such)\n\nI talk to his mother and ask her if I could also help, and when she says I could, i then proceed to ask how much I would be paid for it. She doesn't really take the question well, responding with \"Why does that matter, I thought you were going to help?\" \n\nI don't know what to think or do so I just tell her that I could use the money is all. Finally she tells me. She is offering $60 for the job. Keep in mind, this is an event that we would work from 7am, and the event ends at 6pm. Now I'm not against helping people, but I don't really feel like like working for \\~$5.50 dollars an hour (I'm prone to heat strokes. I can work in the sun, but prefer to avoid it) So I tell her that I'm not interested.\n\nShe gets super mad at me, calling me ungrateful and such before hanging up. Apparently she also called my roommate, because now he's annoyed that I pissed off his mother and is asking stuff like \"Why did you even bother asking if you weren't going to work?\"\n\nI don't feel I'm being unreasonable here, nor that I owe her my time really.

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for two years by now, But I am starting to drift away from him. I love him, but at the same time, there are incidents that are pushing me away from him. And though I try to push my feelings away from them, I still dwell on the hurt it causes. \n\nIn the past, the arguments will start over college. I am obsessive with what I want to do in the future, but never talked to him about it after he got mad at me for switching my plans suddenly. He is a year ahead of me in school, and will be graduating after this year. I did get frustrated and confused on why he gotten mad, but I also know from how he was raised by his family. When I thought he was actually finished with the college situation, he would tell his parents, who doesn't like college, and his mom would say how she went through college but wasn't able to do anything and how useless it was. It happen once, and that passed, until he asked my family to talk about it. I got that information from my mom who supports my relationship, and my decision. Later, he made me uncomfortable by saying that he was going to take a years break and look for a house to live in while I am going to college, which he got mad after I told him I did not want too.\n\nAfter we moved past with that, the problem he had was my plans to work with the FBI. For a while now it has been my dream, and something I feel like I need to do. I am aware of risks with it, which he needs to bring up when he talks about it, and I am working with my issues I know I need to sort out before joining. He before had begged me to not pursue the career, and asked me to chose between family or business. My final straw though was having his sister lecture me in her car. He had asked her if she knew I was going to join the FBI. While I was uncomfortable he watch me, but didn't help me.\n\nThe last point is that he has been very clingy. I can be clingy I admit, but at the same time, I am trying too work on it. He keeps pushing me to spend time with him, especially on the weekends when I want to spend time with my friends and family. With him pushing me though, and pushing on subjects I don't particularly want to talk about, I don't want to spend time with him any more. It feels suffocating and I need room to breath. I went through the last of my patience with him Saturday. I got sick with a pain in my side, and had to leave school early because of it. When he asked me if I could come over, and I told him no. He told me \"You didn't have to hurt yourself if you didn't want to see me\". I have been struggling with self-harm and been trying to recover. This triggered a lot of memories for me, and the pain of my side wasn't helping me. I did not talk to him for the rest of the day. This makes me really not want to see him anymore, and he doesn't seem to understand why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to spend time with my BF because of my emotions towards the issues we had?\n\nEdit: I talked it out with him. We made up, and I apologized for the issues and how I was going to work on it. He agreed, and we are both going as strong as ever. I realize that it was my fault for dwelling on the situations. And I am working on it with help.",

I saw the latest semi-cryptic post today trying to find the parents of any kids that were in a particular class. It was worded very sharply, and it was obvious it was going to be a teacher bashing post like the others. I made a light hearted comment that I feared for the teachers at her kids school (she genuinely seems to have it in for them). She blew up and posted that this was serious business before unfriending me.   \n\n\nMy intent posting it was really just to make her aware it's becoming a common theme. I mean, I think she's starting to look like one of those crazed parents, and if the school and it's teachers are such a problem then move your kids somewhere else.  \n\n\nAITA for commenting on her post?

      "description": "First, I want to say that I've never had a close relationship to my parents. I like to visit them every now and then, I'm very thankful for many things they've done for me but somehow I don't feel like I'm deeply connected to them. I've never talked to them about any emotional stuff, relationships and rarely tell them about my problems as I prefer to either handle them on my own or I think there are other people who can help me better.\n\nRight now im going to university in another city so I only see them for semester breaks, christmas and some weekends where they visit me. Last year they visited me, we went to a restaurant and my mom asked whether I could save a certain day to drive my dad to a hospital in another city because he would stay there for some time and she didn't want to drive on her own in a big city she doesn't know. When I asked for why my dad needed to go to the hospital she told me it was some kind of \"routine inspection\". So no big deal, I drive my dad there and me and my mom are going back. My mom was in contact with him, she told me the surgery went well. At that point it was the first time that I was told there even was a surgery. Two weeks later we drive to the hospital again to get my dad, he's not allowed to drive yet, so I take my parents back home. At home my mom told me that I would have to see my doctor for some precautionary examination with 30 or 35 (while the normal age for that particular one is 45).\n\nIt was at that point that the pieces fit together for me that my dad actually had prostate cancer. Since she first asked me to drive him to the hospital 3 or 4 months passed in which I had no clue. Even until now they haven't talked to me about this. My mom mentioned some keywords such as \"carcioma\" or certain kinds of surgery procedures while talking to others when I was sitting next to them, but technically she hasn't mentioned it in a conversation with me.\n\nFrom everything I've heard fortunately it was in a very early stage for my dad, the surgery removed all cancer cells, he's started working again, even does sports regularly as he's done before etc. Every time I visit them I of course ask how he's doing and he never mentioned any problems. Nonetheless currently he is in a rehabilitation clinic because healthcare pays for it while also covering what my dad would've earned working, so why not. This weekend they visited some friends, went partying, my mom sent me some pictures, so I assumed (and still assume) everything is going well.\n\nNow I haven't seen them since christmas and my mom told me that my dad mentioned to her that he's really disappointed I don't ask him how he's doing.\n\nConsidering that to this day I haven't been told what exactly is going on I don't see why I'd be obligated to ask him here. Even if, I think that he wouldn't tell me if something was wrong. I mean, they didn't tell me he had cancer in the first place, and also the fact that he's disappointed was brought to me only via my mom, not directly from him.\n\nSo, AITA here?",

Bad Roommate (BR) was crashing with my friend who had a spare room. He didn't pay rent. He didn't help out around the apartment and he would eat food that wasn't his. Like all of it. The last straw was BR sent into 11's room and found his stash of peanut butter cap'n crunch and at all but the crumbs leaving an empty box. 11 was pissed.\n        \nHe wanted to get revenge so I told him we should go down to taco bell and get some burritos and jerk off in them and leave them in the fridge. So that's what we did. There were 4 of us at the apt at the time and I tried to jerk off on a fresh burrito but I couldn't (they were laughing outside the door) so i grabbed a handful of hair from my crack and tossed them in. The other 2 dudes got the job done. The burritos were rewrapped and put in the fridge.  \n        \nBR came home and opened the fridge and saw the burritos. He asked whose they were. We're told him they were someone's who wasn't there atm and he said fuck him and him and his friend were going to eat them. As they were heating them up we pretty much pleaded with them not to eat them. So as they ate them they made a big show of it saying how great they were. A big wad fell on BR's chin and he rolled it up on his pinky and sucked it up. We were laughing so hard but they thought that they were being funny.  BR got my burrito with ass hair. We told him to take it back to taco bell (we told the kid the plan because we needed those sour cream stickers on them but no sour cream) but he pushed on pulling the hairs from the burrito and licking the beans and seed from his fingers. After he was done he burped in his friend's face and said it was so good he felt like he was just got done having sex and that it was the best burrito ever. We almost died.\n\n      We waited until the next day when they were over with their girlfriends. They didn't believe us until I asked how many hairs could accidentally fall in a burrito? They turned green and their girlfriends left in disgust, both because they ate cum burritos  and that they were dicks for eating others people's food. AITA or was this justice and a teachable moment. They never ate other people's food in that house ever again so it worked. \n\n\nTLDR: jerked off in burritos and left them in fridge so roommate who ate other people's food could learn a lesson. He learned it real good.",

      "description": "Tl:dr at bottom\n\nIt was a busy Saturday night shift working at a local tex-mex chain. One of those shifts that immediately has you shift into gear as soon as you clock in. Within a few minutes, I had my section full and got sat with an extra table. I was almost frustrated just having to take them given I still had a bunch I needed to do, but they seemed pleasant so I just moved past it.\n\n All of this culminated in me fervently trying to sketch a path in my head to get everything I needed for all 4 tables . I then entered the kitchen calculating that I would need 2 boxes, 4 pint size containers with lids and some chips and salsa to go. This was in addition to the 3 other tables' stuff I needed to gather and drinks I needed to make for the new table. Pressed for time I hurried through the kitchen to gather everything up and was about done whilst grabbing the pint containers. My kitchen manager then yells that there is food that needs to go out cause it's sizzling. I tell him that I have way too much to do at the moment and can't afford the delay. Luckily another server soon stepped into the kitchen and grabbed the tray so I thought that was the end of that.\n\n  My kitchen manager wasn't done with me though. He grabbed the pint containers from my hand and told me that these were strictly meant for to go orders. This was one of those soft rules as you often winded up needing them for something. I started getting exasperated when thinking of all the work I still needed to do and said I needed 4 containers specifically because they had pints of soupy beans, etc. that would drip or spill in a to go box. He told me I didn't need them and should just use the regular to go containers for dine-ins, which were about 3-4 ounces each. Which would require 4-5 of them for a single thing of beans. \n\n  I started to get more and more frustrated as it was obvious to me I had no way of getting past this hurdle without burdening my guest into portioning their food into a dozen containers. I eventually lost my cool and started yelling at my managers that there was no way I could do it without the pint containers. They just kept telling me to calm down. I tried to explain to them that their food would drip in a box or not fit in the other containers they pointed me towards, perhaps yelling while doing so, admittedly.\n\n Eventually one of my managers told me he was tired of my attitude and closing my section. I immediately just grabbed my stuff and walked out. Felt kinda guilty that this was the way I left after a year working here, so just wanted to know, AITA.\n\nTL:DR I was stuck deep in the weeds serving and my managers and I yelled at my managers for not letting me use the to go containers I needed. They closed my section because of my yelling, I just grabbed my stuff and walked out the door.",

      "description": "I’m a guy and i love variety. My SO doesn’t. She prefers missionary and no foreplay. I love eating her out but am never allowed to because she hates it. I love doggy but she doesn’t. She doesn’t like foreplay. She doesn’t like me playing with her boobs- the only thing she likes is if i gently suck her nipples. She says fingers in her vagina don’t do anything for her. So it’s been tough for me to get super hard without any extras. She doesn’t seem to really enjoy the lead up though she does orgasm almost every time. We usually have sex 1x every 1-2 weeks. I sense she makes herself available just to keep me maintained. Sadly sex isn’t that fun anymore and we are essentially in maintenance mode. It’s a huge problem for us but she doesn’t want to talk about it. When i try she shuts down or she gets angry. She comes from a super conservative Christian family and i think there is shame and guilt around sex. This is one reason I’ve tried to be understanding. I’ve encouraged her to seek therapy and she started but then stopped. She won’t even change in front of me. So now we are in a fight and although it wasn’t directly about sex, the frustration we both feel is tearing our relationship apart. She just wants me to be ok with what she gives and I’m frustrated because although I’ve tried, I’m just not. It’s affecting other areas of our life. I know there are couples who can’t or don’t have sex at all so sometimes i feel like i should just be happy for what i get. But then i feel super resentful that i have to be denied all the time. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Throwaway 'cause there's some personal info here.\n \nQuick background: me and my parents, especially my mom, have a rocky relationship. We bicker, she doesn't support my hobbies, doesn't ask me about school, and occasionally singles me out or makes jokes at my expense in front of my younger brothers (11 y/o twins). Every time I've raised issue with it has just stirred conflict, so I shut up and deal with it most of the time. My dad almost always takes her side.\n\nThis past weekend, we attended my cousin's wedding in a different city. This was a pretty big deal for the family (this is on my dad's side) so we kind of went all out for the weekend. On Sunday, we had a big barbecue at my uncle's house that pretty much everyone attended - cousins, aunts, uncles, the whole shebang.\n\nDuring this gathering, there's obviously a lot of catching up with family and whatnot. This happened as I was sitting in the living room among the conversation between four or five adults. I hadn't said much until my aunt turns to me and asked the classic \"taway, you should talk more! why are you so quiet?\" Everyone else in the room looks at me expecting an answer.\n\nI smiled and told her I was happy to just be there, but my mom feels the need to push further and ask me why I haven't been talking. Again, I just tell her that I don't have much to say and I prefer to sit and listen. After pushing for a bit, my mom scoffs and tells everyone \"Sorry, she's always hiding in her room and never talking to anyone at home, too. Should have just left her in [home city]\" (something along those lines).\n\nEveryone laughs at this while I'm sitting there starting to get embarrassed. In the heat of the moment, I tell her to shut up and say \"Yeah, I'd rather stay at home by myself so I don't have to put up with you\".\n\nThis came out... sharper than I thought. I was met with an awkward silence and a horrible glare from my mom. This went on for a few moments until my aunt, who seemed equally annoyed at my words, quickly changed the subject. The awkwardness eventually faded, but me and my mom didn't talk for the rest of the night.\n\nWhen we finally got home on Monday, my dad told me very sternly not to talk to my mom that way and that I need to apologize. Apparently I made her cry the night we got home, and we've barely talked since. I feel like what she did was bullshit because a) it wasn't true, I work a lot in between high school stuff (I'm 17) and b) I hate it when she singles me out like that in general. Even so, now the guilt is creeping up. I'm wondering if I was too harsh or if I damaged her relationship with my dad's family.\n\nMy younger brothers are mad at me too, and I got a text from my aunt saying that it was uncalled for. AITA for saying what I said?",

I'm absolutely not judgemental about that, that is what she loves and I'me sometimes even more supportive than my parents (because she didn't want to go to univesity)\n\n\nThere is the issue.\n\nShe has an exam tomorrow and has spend 4-5 hours studying yesterday. She told me this course was easy and felt like it was explained like it was for kids so I don't worry for her at this point.\n\nIn my father's appartment we share the same bedroom (where our desk is) that is the quietest place there because it is at the opposite of the room with the television and the computer my dad works on.\n\nSo after lunch I say I need to use our room for one hour because I need a quiet place. (Because I needed to record something and I didn't want them to hear that).\nShe accept even if she is obviously annoyed but I don't pas attention. My dad saw that and said that he could swich the tv off for her to stay there and study but she said no she wanted to be in our room.\nSo I do my thing in there and 40 mins later she comes in with an angry face saying that she needs to study for her exam, I say that I'm almost done but need some more minutes and she storms out. like five seconds later my dad comes in saying that I must leave her the room because she has an exam. I answer that she's had the whole week to study and that I only have the weekend to do my things so it's not my fault if she runs out of time for this test (that's only at 18:00 tomorrow!!) And my dad then say that MY bad organisation must not impact HER studies.\nI couldn't even answer that he also stormed out and gave me five minutes to finish.\n\nI obviously can't do that in five minutes  but I clear the deskop anyway and go find my sister. I tell her the room is free and she says \"THANKS\" like I owed that to her for decades. \n\nI now feel like I'm the AH by the way they both talked to me even if I feel this was all unfair.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to let my sister in the bedroom despite her exam ?",

When he saw it he got dissapointed and told me \"you can't do a simple thing\". When we got out i noticed that my other classmates started to stay away from me, and when i noticed that one of them is staring at me i asked what was wrong, and he said that i cant check correctly, so i knew what was going on and i left. 2 of them are my \"friends\" which i helped throughout the schoolyear so im really dissapointed because they acted like they're butthurt about what i did too.\n\n",

I admit I'm kind of a shut in who doesn't go out much and my love life is pretty much non existent. But every time I talk to a girl they ask me a million questions about it and i find it intrusive and annoying and any time I ask them to stop they just say no and keep talking about it despite my obvious discomfort  in the matter. \n\nIt gets so bad I can't even leave the house without them asking me \"where are you going\",  \"are meeting a girl?\",why aren't you meeting a girl. Disclaimer I'm a private person and I don't like telling people what I'm doing not because I'm an ass but because I'm a 22 year old adult who doesn't need to be asking permission Everytime I leave the house with my car. On my 21 birthday i Didn't want to really celebrate it because I didn't want to be in the center of attention. My mom noted my discomfort by saying \"I'm just upset because I'm a 21 yr old virgin\".\n\nNow leading up to the incident my sister and I work the same job and one day during break she told out of the blue \"I got a second job don't tell Mom\" now I have no idea why she told me because I never ask her about her personal life or where she goes and meet. Not because I don't care but because I treat her the way I want to be treated she's a grown woman in her 30s who doesn't need people asking her stuff she doesn't want to share.\n\nThen one day she ask me about one of my co workers and if I like her or not because that co worker called me her boyfriend in a joking manner. I say no (I do but I wanted too keep that between me and my coworker and I ask her to please not tell our mother) and forget about it. She then proceeded to tell me my mother and I get to find out by my mom waltzing in my room and laying across my bed and asking me if I have a secret romance with my coworker then asking me a million very personal questions , call me a prude because I don't like discussing my sex or love life with my mom,. I get mad because I never ask my sister for anything and the one thing I do ask she breaks the promise. So I told my mom my sister has a second job and she's Been lying to her about it for week's. My sister finds out about it-well I told her what I did then she gets mad at me because it \"different\" and her and Mom was just joking around and I broke a more serious promise.\n\n\n",

This gave the other team a quick direct kick, which ended in a goal. \n\n         At the moment, our team was stunned by the goal(between the penalty and the goal was about 2-3 seconds), so in turn our center defense player(a referee for a local league) tried to tell the ref that the call made was wrong. \n\n           After some back and forth between the two, the ref ended up saying “you can either play ball, or keep being smart, because I’m ref-ing a few more games in your season.” At this moment I stepped in and asked the ref “ref, are you threatening one of our players?”, to which he carded me and told me to get off the field.\n\n",

      "description": "Ok this is rather minor and inconsequential but I'm kind of feeling bad about it. I work in a Library, usually in the computer section, which is beside the study area. It being a Library, quietness is expected. \n\nAnyway, there's this one guy Jason, he's been coming in since I started work there 11 years ago. Jason is harmless, but I'm fairly sure he has some sort of learning disability. I also think he may come from disadvantaged circumstances. Anyway I kind of feel bad for the guy, but he is quite disruptive in his habits.\n\nPart of Jason's daily routine is coming to the library every morning and using his alotted 1 hour session on one of the public PCs to watch music videos on YouTube. The problem is that his headphones are constantly really loud. I can hear his music from my desk across the room, and anybidy sitting near him can certainly hear it.\n\nI have to ask him to turn down every day either by message or by going over to him. He turns down, but then inevitably turns up a few minutes later, like if I have to leave my desk for a moment. My co-workers also have to deal with Jason's loud music on the mornings I'm not working the computer area. We've all had to tell him to turn down on many occasions, it's a daily occurrence.\n\nAnyway this morning I decided that the only way Jason was going to get the message was with some tough love. After telling him to turn down already, Tina Turner came blasting out of his headphones, much louder than anything yet that morning. So I said \"fuck this\" and ended his session.\n\nHe came up to the desk and said that the computer had gone off. I explained to him that I had ended his session and why. That he had ignored messages about his music, that it was a daily occurrence and it was unfair to those aroubd him. \n\nHe kept pleading with me that he'd keep it down and just let him have five more minutes. I didn't and told him to come back tomorrow. He kind of hovered around my desk for a few minutes asking again to let him back on, but I refused.\n\nNow I feel like a dick. Even though his music was really loud, and some people were looking over, I usually like to give the guy a pass. He's not malicious, he's just not really aware of how disruptive he is being. I feel like this is the only way he'll get the message. But then again, the poor kid doesn't seem to have much going on in his life and his daily visits to the Library are clearly part of some routine he has. I feel shitty for messing with it, particularly if it could cause him distress. One of my friends has Asbergers and he freaks out if his routine is messed with, so I thought it might be a similar case with Jason.\n\nSorry about the length folks, and yeah pretty banal story, but I'd like to know if I'm being a dick here, or how I could have handled it better.\n\nTL:DR - AITA for getting fed up with a (I assume) special needs guy for constantly turning up his music and annoying myself and the people around him?

      "description": "Please note: Some (minor) details have been changed to maintain anonymity, but nothing pertaining to the actual moral issue here has been altered :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi everyone,\n\nSo here's the story: I am a 23 year old that just graduated with my undergraduate degree, and am hosting a small get together to celebrate. I am part of a tight-knit friend group of 5 people, all of us have been friends since high school, but we moved away to different parts of the country for college. Right now, everyone is in our hometown because they either just graduated or have winter break. This is a pretty chill and established friend group, and we've hung out together  regularly and kept up with each-others lives. We see each other every break, message each other all the time, etc. We're stillreally close friends, despite the distance.\n\nThe issue: One of these friends, Amanda, is really kind, fun and a great friend, but she can also be kind of a mess. She never does anything terrible like lying and stealing, but she constantly has to be talking about herself/telling stories about herself/etc and always makes events about her, even if they quite obviously are meant to be about other people (One time she cried at a mutual friends' birthday party because something she saw on the internet upset her, and the host had to spend 30 minutes outside comforting her during his own birthday dinner, to the point where people got concerned and were wondering where they had gone). \n\nShe also always does too much of whatever substance we are indulging in (We all like to occasionally drink together or smoke weed, both of which are 100% legal where we live). Everyone will take a couple of shots or take a few hits off a bong and still be completely normal/coherent, but Amanda will literally drink as much as she can or take edibles and insist on smoking a shit ton, and will then get really moody and awful to be around. She also inevitably gets really clumsy, and ends up spilling her drink, or burning holes in other people's carpet with the joint, because she's so fucked up. \n\nWhenever anyone brings this up to her/tells her that maybe it's time to chill a little bit, she will just get really depressed and start talking about how \"I'm an awful friend, you're right, I'm terrible\", but never takes steps to correct her problem.\n\nThe dilemma: Honestly, my friends and I are NOT wild party people, and when I have my event, I just want it to be a chill and nice get together with friends. I want to invite people out for dinner, I want to bring them to my apartment, and I don't want to worry about Amanda getting too fucked up on restaurant wine or smoking all of my weed. We are all able to enjoy ourselves responsibly and safely, and I don't want to spend the entire time babysitting or indulging her when I really want to be having a good time hanging out with my other friends.\n\nHowever, if I make a facebook group for this party without Amanda, I feel like she will inevitably find out and be really upset. This is her main friend group, and I know I would feel really bad if they excluded me, so I don't want to do that to somebody else. Would I be the asshole if I went ahead and did this anyway? Should I cancel the party and celebrate with my parents and S/O and skip the friend get together? Should I suck it up and invite Amanda, and try to take every possible precaution so that she doesn't taint the experience for anyone else? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for listening!",

      "description": "Background: I (27F) have the same job as my coworker (23F). We both work in Recreation in a seniors independent living complex. I've been there for 2.5 years, she has been there for 9 months. Much of our job consists of running programs, driving the bus, and basically being in front of people (seniors and sometimes their families) and running the show. She was born in Canada and only speaks English, fluently (relevant).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday we ran a Scottish Trivia program together. She said she'd read over the questions beforehand. There were about 60 people in attendance, we were up at the front switching the mic back and forth doing the trivia questions. A few times she pronounced words wrong, so I quietly whispered to her the correct pronunciation, because from my point of view it was clear the seniors didn't know what she was talking about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout halfway through she read the question \"Who is the patron saint of Scotland?\", however she read it as \"pah-trohn\", like the alcohol. People chuckled/laughed, so did I, because it was funny. An alcohol saint of Scotland, hilarious! No big deal. Or so I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the program, with our door and our bosses door (right next to ours) wide open, she asks if she can talk to me. She says that she feels very embarrassed when I correct her pronunciation doing a group activity like we were, and that she was bullied for it a lot in school and she gets a lot of anxiety about it. I reply saying that that obviously was not my intention to make her feel bad and I apologize. She replies saying I do this all the time and she's very sensitive about it (she mispronounced things a fair bit). I reply saying I only clarified the words because the seniors couldn't understand what she was trying to say, and I was not laughing at her or making fun of her. I offered for next time to go through the material with her beforehand to see if there are any words she is unsure of how to say, and I will help her. She replies saying no, it's just an anxiety thing, I get so much anxiety being in front of people already so it just happens. At this point we get interrupted and our conversation ends there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can see her point of view - I know she has issues with anxiety, etc. However, the way I would have handled it (and did, because I pronounced some Scottish words wrong too), was to laugh it off and be a part of the joke, rather than taking it as a personal attack, which it wasn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's had anxiety issues with this job before, and this was the 3rd issue in 24 hours (the first being she had too much anxiety to drive the bus, so I had to drive, the second being refusing to do a lip sync thing for an event we have planned for April, the third was this event). She's taken MANY days off due to anxiety, as in drained her whole sick bank and then a couple weeks on top of that. The majority of our job is to be in front of people and be entertaining - if that causes this level of anxiety, why work in this job at all? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

You needed a key but some of the maintenance guys had a code they could use to buzz themselves in. One of them told me it one day and I basically used the code in lieu of a key all the time because it was easier/faster.\n\nBrought my dog out one day and the lead broke during our walk. It's one of those retractable ones and the lead snapped, making it useless unless I wrapped it around my dog's neck I guess. I didn't. I decided to cut our walk short and just carry her home.\n\nI get to the door and a woman is just entering. I asked her if she could hold the door for me and she forcibly closed it. Whatever, you're not supposed to let strangers in, so I get it. It's not about decency, it's about security. So I go over to punch in my code and the door beeps, but she still holds it closed. \"If you don't have a key you're not getting in\" I'm paraphrasing what she said.\n\nAt this point I'm not sure what to do. I got my dog in my arms, I don't want to put her down, so I stand there for a moment or two all the while this woman is forcing the door closed until it beeps again and relocks.\n\nI decide to just buzz my apartment and have my wife buzz me in. She begins to walk off as I get in touch with my wife and eventually get in. She has some snide remark \"the landlord will hear of this\" and I called her the titular word as I take the stairs up to my apartment.

      "description": "I’m a fifth grade teacher. I also coach basketball in my school district for middle school aged kids. It was a home game and we had a new ref. First he made my boys take off their under shirts. They were wearing black, white, and grey undershirts. These are pre-teen boys who kinda have low self-esteem and were not comfortable going shirtless underneath the jersey. He made them take them off. The other team arrives and DOESN’T SAY SHIT SHIT ABOUT THEIR undershirts. \n\nAs the game goes on he’s just really controlling. Yelling at kids and kinda telling them what to do in a condescending way. \n\nWe play two 20 min halves and the clock . runs (barely feels like we have anytime to play!) We’re down 5 points with 3 min in the first half left and the ball goes out of bounds. A player of mine is covering the in bounder. The ref holds the ball and tells his hands can’t cross the line. Fine. That a given and my player backs off. He hold the ball longer and continues to tell my player to back off. 20 secs run off and I calmly yell “in bound the ball ref! Its a running clock!” Finally it’s inbounded. \n\nThen during the game he runs up to me and says that he doesn’t appreciate telling him about the clock. \n\nAfter the game he finds me again and he immediately gets pissed at me. Saying that he doesn’t appreciate me not letting him teach what’s right and wrong. I said that there was a time and place and that he could have waited until after the game to impose his will. Not during the game while the clock is running. I’m all for his help but when you’re already patronizing players and then decide to create a teaching moment during a game that’s kinda intense then you’re kinda doing it wrong. He just wouldn’t see it like that and said that he has the right to say and do what he wants. But I’m the coach and it felt like he was super ceding my authority. He just rolled his eyes and  never really heard me out. I didn’t argue all game\nUntil he seemed super offended afterwards that I let him know it was a running clock.\n\nHe was trying to preach consistency but when I mentioned to him that he made a big deal\nAbout our undershirts and didn’t say squat to the other team about theirs he had nothing to say! He just rolled his eyes and walked off.\n\nI’m just trying to defend my thinking and also let him know that just because he is ref doesn’t mean he can super cede anyone’s authority. \n\nAm I the asshole?????\n\nTLDR: i argued with a ref after a youth basketball game because he tried to create a teaching moment with the clock running. I thought the teaching moment could have waited until after the game because we barely have time to play in the first place because we play two 20 min halves with the clock running. ",

      "description": "I frequent a well maintained municipal par 3 golf course near my work. Yesterday after work, I met a friend there to enjoy a casual round. There was a group of 12 younger dudes playing in foursomes. Totally normal. Then I see them teeing off from different areas than the actual tee box, elongating the holes (longest holes are 110 yards.) Ok, whatever. They kept a decent pace. However if a player didn't hit the green on their first shot, they would hit a second and third ball. When my friend and I got to the greens after them, they were peppered with ball marks. This happened on every green. Some folks like, 'oh its just a municipal course, i dont have to treat it nice.' I hate those people. \n\nI play at this course all the time and I would describe my game somewhere in between bad and fair. I try to repair as many ball marks as possible so perhaps the golf gods would take pity on a poor soul. Keep in mind that the ground is fairly soggy here and these players were leaving some big craters. \n\nAs my buddy and I approached the 7th tee box, the whole group of players were now amassed on the 8th tee all playing together at this point. After teeing off, we passed each other and I called out to them. \"Hey, are you guys on a team or something?\" I asked. I was thinking for several holes how to approach these guys. Honestly I thought they were in high school. When one of their players said, \"Yeah, we're on a team,\" I lost my shit and shouted, \"then fix your fucking ball marks!\" None of them said a word. My buddy says to me, \"Geez, old man much?\"\n\nWe finished putting on the seventh green, and the entire group is was posted up, chipping and putting on 8. The 8th tee box is right by the parking lot so we decided to just call it a day. As we went past all their golf bags they left on the 8th tee box, I noticed... they were from a COLLEGE team. They definitely know better.\n\nI googled the school and emailed their head coach. I did apologize for using profanity. But yes, I did snitch on them. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n",

      "description": "TLDR: momma drama, affects my brother’s coming home cuz I didn’t invite some close fam. \n\nMy mom was a single parent for most of my childhood. She’s sweet, loving, honest and extremely loyal. \nShe tends to get caught in the middle of the family fights. Every time something happens, people drag her into it. Since she wants everyone to get along, she always tries to mediate but gets shitted on for getting too involved. It’s caused a lot of incidents where miscommunications have led to her being cast out or shunned. Whoever was beefing would treat us(her kids) as if nothing was going on but wouldn’t invite her to birthday parties and family gatherings where they would eventually shit-talk her and whatnot. Mind you, I always thought we were pretty tight knit, but now i see my mom would always get the shit end of the stick but in these situations. She wouldn’t lash out or react to keep all us kids out of the drama.(Us 2nd gen kids are super close)\n It’s taken a toll on her and i feel so bad that she’s been taking that type of abuse for so long. She loves our family, but doesn’t acknowledge just how toxic they can be. \nShe’s coming around and has decided enough is enough, and has started to cut some of that toxicity out of her life. My mom and i are super close so obviously I’m going to side with her. \nNow, one of my cousins (who is just a bit closer to my brother) was planning my brother’s coming home party with me. His mom is one of the people that my mom has decided to not have anything to do with anymore. I took it upon myself to let my cousin know of the situation. Didn’t give him all the deets of what went down with my mom and his but told him i did not want her there. He understands to some extent cuz he’s seen the mistreatments of my mom, but since i didn’t give all details of the situation involving his mom, I was scolded for “making this all about my mom and not about my brother that’s coming home.” I agree to an extent, but also don’t want to give my mom anymore shit to deal with now that she’s choosing to give herself a break from the BS. \nMy cousin’s decided to not attend anymore and is pretty much telling me I’m picking sides instead of trying to keep things neutral for my brother’s sake. Idk, I feel bad cuz we’re all affected but I’m more concerned about my mom’s well being.",

      "description": "I broke up with my ex of 7 years. There was a lot of abuse coming from both ways. After going to therapy for a few months, I came to the conclusion that I could not continue my relationship with them. I ended the relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a good relationship with their mom, I helped her and she definitely helped me. She said she considered me a son. I appreciated her a lot. My own mother was working on getting her residency. My mom is here legally under temporary protected status. Current circumstances means it's expiring within the next year. My mom works, I work. However, my mom needed a joint sponsor because despite me making enough to sponsor her alone, my taxes didn't represent that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ask my ex's mom if she can joint sponsor her, and she says of course. She herself was an immigrant, and she understood the difficulties. To explain what the joint sponsorship entails; in case of some medical or legal issues accrue. The Sponsor (Me) would be responsible in paying any and all fees that the sponsored person would have. This is only until the sponsor gets their citizenship. If for some reason, I could not do that then the joint sponsor (ex's mom) would be responsible. However, like I explained both my mom works (legally) and I work. I alone would have been enough to sponsor her but alas my taxes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later, I get a text from their mom. It roughly goes like; \"I'm withdrawing my sponsorship. I'm sorry I have no choice. I only did it because you and they were together and I did it for you as a favor to your relationship and now that it's over, I don't see the point.\" I was absolutely crushed. This hurt me so much. My mom and their mom had were on good terms.I get another text basically saying, \"I didn't do this to be spiteful, the lord frowns down on those who are spiteful.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I told their mom I understood. I did not argue, I did not get upset. My focus was on finding a new sponsor because the paperwork was already sent out, and having to replace it just further delays the process. My mom was pissed as hell obviously, but yeah. That was the way the cookie crumbles. Ex messages me saying to respect her decision and to be an adult about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut fuck, do I feel bitter about this. So I don't want anything to do with them.I feel like, how could you say I was like a son to you and then turn around and not just hurt me but hurt my mother. My mother who had nothing to do with this relationship ending.\n\n**WIBTA** if I never want anything to do with them again? I thought maybe down the line we can try and be friends. Because I considered them a best friend but after this, I just don't know. I don't think I could ever look at their mom the same way.\n\n**tl;dr Broke up with ex, their mom was helping sponsor my mom's chance of citizenship with me. Their mom withdraws their sponsorship because we broke up, and I don't want anything to do with them anymore.**",

      "description": "So I (30M) and my ex (30F) who dated for five years have been broken up on and off the past two years and officially done for eight months. We moved to a city together when we first started dating and have a lot of the same friends. \n\nThe reason I bring this up is that a few years back we tried to open up our relationship and one weekend during that time while my ex was out of town, I ended up hanging out with one of the women (35F) in our friend group for an entire weekend while my ex was gone. Nothing sexual happened but I did spend the entire weekend at her house. Things didn't go over well with my ex (I told her immediately when she got home) and at the time caused some turmoil in our relationship which we were able to overcome.\n\nThere was also tension between my ex and this woman, but quickly the two of them became closer than they ever had been before. It should be noted that my ex had hooked up with a random guy while I was out of town previous to this while she was out with a few friends so most everyone knew about this open relationship thing.\n\nFast forward to about a year ago and I was out with some friends and ran into the same woman. We hung out and I spent the night and the following night at her place (nothing sexual happened again) and that was that. We both get along well but she told me she cared about my ex and didn't want to hurt the relationship since they are closer and better friends now. I was respectful of this and that was that between us other than seeing each other at various get-togethers.\n\nFast forward to about a month ago and we find ourselves together at a bar and hit it off quite well as we do except this time she texts me after she leaves. Since that night we have been hanging out together (No sex still at this point) and things are going well. She has mentioned that she really likes hanging out with me but still has the same apprehension. I understand where she is coming from and this is the reason why we haven't had sex or started exploring this relationship more. I really want to be respectful but I am kind of letting things happen and not fully supporting letting this thing go since I like this person.\n\nI don't want to compromise my ex and this womans relationship but part of me feels like my ex is somehow controlling this in some capacity. The reason I say this is the first time after we spent that weekend together I was getting the vibe that my ex put herself more in this womans life to check that nothing was going on between us and is still doing that. I don't view my ex in a bad light and I still love her very much as a person and I know she feels the same about me but my ex wanted our relationship to end. I feel like I would have some sort of regret if I just let this all go and didn't pursue this to some degree. I have tried to look at things as if I was in their shoes and I just want what is best for everyone. AITA for not just letting this whole thing go and only seeing things from my point of view?",

      "description": "The old mate in question I was friends with in college when I was 16 and we were close for the 2 years we were at college but lost contact after that. Within that time she was with a boyfriend whom I also became close friends with but there was nothing romantic between us at all. They since split up a few years back and she moved to a different country. We haven't spoken since I was 18 and I am now 22 and it is highly unlikely the friendship would be rekindled. \n\nI recently got tinder and am just using it casually; matching most people who I know in real life too for courtesy. I matched the ex boyfriend in question and we had a general catch up and he suggested going for a drink to catch up further. It may not be anything else other than that but I feel the implication is there. WIBTA for a) doing so without the old friends knowledge and b) if it went further. \n\n\n",

      "description": "Posting from a throwaway because I feel like a major asshole and my default account has vaguely identifying info. \n\nI work as an at-home caregiver, my job involves working one-on-one with a single client multiple days a week. She has other people who also work for her as well as friends and family that know how to assist her in the ways she needs as well. It is worth noting that she is completely disabled. She cannot do anything on her own (no use of legs or arms) without someone there to assist her. I met her through mutual friends at a funeral, one of her fill-in caregivers had passed away and the person who passed away had been my friend too. She needed help badly and my heart ached for her. We got in touch via social media and I asked her what days of the week she needed a caregiver, it just so happens that my availability matched her needs. \n\nMy job is physically demanding and as much as I feel bad admitting - stressful - at times. I am beside my “boss” all day while I’m at work and although I really have enjoyed a lot of the time I have spent helping her and getting to know her, she can be pretty bossy (for lack of better words), in the “demanding” context of the word. My job is to help her with daily tasks and essentially live life, so she has to tell me what she needs or would like to do so I can do it for her or help her do it but she can be kind of mean about it which can be taxing. Between the physicality of the job and the mental aspects I can get worn out at times so I appreciate my days off to recoup. I have bonded with her quite a bit due to the personal nature of the job and oftentimes enjoy her company. I would go as far as to say she is a friend as well as my employer now. There’s been instances where her other caregivers have had appointments to be at and she has asked me to cover for them with notice and if I am able (which has been 100% of the time), I go work on my days off. \n\nThis has been becoming a more common occurrence but with little-to-zero notice (I understand life happens) but I have found myself dreading her asking me to cover other caregivers shifts. The last two instances I have fibbed about having other goings-ons when she’s asked me to cover and I feel like an asshole. My heart goes out to her so much but I also have a child in kindergarten and household responsibilities I tend to and have just wanted my days off to be exactly that... my days off. I don’t want to make her life harder by not agreeing to go in to work. I feel like she knows I’m just the “easy” person to ask because I have a hard time saying no while these other people don’t. But then again, maybe I’m wrong feeling that way. I also suspect the other caregivers are seeing that I will cover their shifts and are taking more time off and rendering themselves unavailable in return. \n\nAm I the asshole? If so, how can I better handle the situation? I work with her one on one every day so it is a bit different than barely ever seeing your boss. \n",

      "title": "AITA for dropping out of college when my sister paid for the tuition?",
      "description": "When I was 15, my father(65) died to prostate cancer. He had a modest job and didn't make much money. Regardless, he had always been frugal and managed to save up. When he died, he left me with around 25k in the bank. I had always gone to a private school(the norm in my country), so most of that money went to my mother so she could raise me and put me through high school. My mother has always been a very neurotic and unreliable person(unable to hold down a job) and could not contribute much. I did not have a lot of money leftover for college or college prep. My older sister(33) and her husband who are both the 'breadwinners' in the family, paid for everything. I had FA but that only covered about half of my tuition.\n\nFast forward a bit. I went off to school, as an international student in the US, and things do not go well. I had no friends and was overwhelmed by work and my depression worsened. I attempted to see a counselor several times but it was difficult and weeks between appointments. It's a little bit before finals and I am feeling very suicidal with no support system, sometimes not taking my meds, and generally just thinking about the best way to kill myself. I feel trapped so I write my sister a heartfelt email telling her that I am not in a good place and she tells me she will pull me out of school and send me back home to my mother. For clarity, I hate my mother and my country and it was partially why I so desperately wanted to go off to school in USA. I was bullied severely(LGBT) home and the emotional abuse my mother put me through was well-known by my siblings. My mother hits me, told me to \"kill myself\", and yelled at me for my entire life. It only got worse once my father died and I could no longer stay with him. That being said I panicked and told my sister I didn't want to go home to my mother, she told me my only other option was to stay in school. So I did....and being deathly afraid of going home but also suicidal, I didn't go to any of my exams and stayed in my dorm room and cried and ignored all of her calls and attempts to withdraw me from school and send me home. \n\nI eventually had to go home anyway(semester was over). Of course since my semester 1 grades, though good, weren't enough to counter me not taking ANY of my finals, my school sends my sister a letter saying I failed and can no longer come back to the school. At this point in my life I am very depressed and hate my sister for 'sending me home' to my mother and not doing more to help me and from her perspective, she is also upset with me for spending money on some kid out of the goodness of her heart only for them to be a failure.\n\nWe didn't speak for years...partially because I was deathly afraid that she was upset with me, and partially because I was angry at her for her response. I am doing better now and my sister and I have light conversations and pretend it never happened but I want to come to terms with it and deal with it emotionally. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": " Hello, this may be a bit long and I'm horrible at English so please excuse any mistakes in this story. This is my first post to Reddit so I have no clue if I need to do anything or not, I’m very clueless as to how this site works. Anyways, I’m on this subreddit because I feel bad for what I’ve done even though I did absolutely nothing wrong and I think if other people tell me how they see it I’ll feel a bit better, I honestly just want more opinions. My parents are good people and they would never try to hurt me but recently they sort of have. This all started when we went on a vacation to the Philippines. They loved it and they still do. We moved back to America about a year ago and they always talk about missing the Philippines, but more recently they’ve been pushing it. Each time during dinner they’d talk about it and make jokes about us living there forever (they knew I didn’t want to move there at all, I have nothing against the Philippines I just really like America) That didn’t bother me at first but the jokes were just starting to get very annoying. Once at dinner my mom said that she would feel terrible if she died before she got to live in the Philippines and my dad would just laugh. When she first started saying things like that I didn’t care it was just extremely annoying. But lately it’s been really bothering me and making me feel like a bad person. I love my mom so much and I really want her to be happy. My dad isn’t pushing it as far as my mom is but he just kind of allowed her to continue this. I didn’t say anything about how it was bothering me until today. My mom was asleep when I told my dad that it makes me feel horrible when she says these kinds of things because I feel like I’m the reason shes not happy. He said shes just saying things (I 100% think shes just saying things as jokes but even as jokes they still do affect me) I don’t know why but ever since I feel so bad at the fact that my mom would feel bad for making me feel bed. She hasn’t woken up yet and my dad didn’t say anything to her yet so I don’t know how she feels but I still feel very bad. Like I said before my parents aren’t bad people just not that self aware. Thank you for listening to my problems and maybe giving feedback. ",

      "description": "TL;DR I told him that he had a crush on a piece of shit (Pokimane), but I feel like a hypocrite because I like Belle Delphine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend has one of those celebrity crushes on a Twitch streamer, Pokimane. A while ago, unknowing that he liked her, I linked him to a video exposing her and all her wrongdoings. He got mad and refused to watch the video because he told me he liked her. I tried explaining how she's more or less a Twitch thot who abused the copyright strike system on YouTube and basically humiliated a guy on stream. I mentioned how, yes, the guy (whom was making \"Pokimane Thicc Compilations\") shouldn't have produced the content he did, but she called him out and humiliated him in front of her thousands of fans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe still doesn't like it whenever I talk shit about Pokimane, but it's not too big of a deal, so it doesn't come up too much in conversation. What really pisses him off is something that might make me seem like a hypocrite. I kinda have a celebrity crush on an Instagram thot named Belle Delphine, but he doesn't. He's telling me that she does more or less the same thing; my argument to that is: Yeah, she whores out for clicks and money but she doesn't abuse any copyright strike systems, humiliates people on stream, and isn't genuinely a toxic person, so while her career is centered around her pandering towards thirsty, sexually deprived men and women, she's not a bad person in terms of personality. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGranted, Pokimane doesn't actively try to slut out, but sometimes it's kind of obvious what she's trying to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm now understanding that I shouldn't care who people like because that's on them, but it kinda pisses me off because I don't think he realizes just how toxic Pokimane can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInb4 \"you both are pretty sad for liking Pokimane/Belle Delphine out of all people\". Yeah. We know. We're losers, lol. ",

      "description": "I want to give you guys a little idea about the context, so this post is probably going to be a little long.\n\nMy gf (19f) and I (21m) have a LDR. This obviously brings some difficulties, as we only see eachother every three months or so. We're both in uni, but she has been struggling alot with motivation and anxiety. She doesn't enjoy the path she's going and as a result has been very down the last months. She wants to quit uni, but has absolutely no idea what to do instead. I have been helping her as much as I can, I think. I am always trying to give her advice, help her with motivation, be supportive when she is feeling down etc. But I am getting a little frustrated about the fact that she is not following any advice i give her! I have been helping her with her with options she could explore instead of uni, i've told her that it would be good to get a therapist to help her with her anxiety (as I know I just simply fix that for her) etc. The problem is that, instead of working towards a solution, or trying to find a passion, she decides to do nothing. I know it is a scary situation to not know what the hell you want to do with your life, but the problem is that she has been getting angry with me because supposedly i am not helping her \"enough\".\n\nAn example is that would ask me: What should i do? Should I quit uni, should I continue? What would you do? My answer to this was simply: I would not continue with uni if you KNOW that it is not going to make you happy.\n\nShe then gets frustrated and tells me that I always give the same answer, and that she just wants me to tell her what to do! It's like she expects me to know exactly which career is going to make her happy? I really dont know either obviously. I told her that maybe you could go to the US for a couple months to study English, kinda like a gap year. But then she refuses to look into things like that. It's like she just expects to one day wake up and have found her passion. As you can understand this lethargy is making me slightly annoyed, because like I said, she refuses to actually take the advice that i give her, and then she gets mad at me for not helping her enough. Anyways, this was some background information. Now to the actual situation that I am dealing with now.\n\nLast night we were on the phone and the same subject came up. I could tell by her voice that something was wrong, so I asked her what was up. She then said that she was just confused because she doesnt know what the fuck she wants to do with her life. She then (again) told me that I am not helping her enough. Of course this kinda struck a nerve with me, because i have been doing everything i can to help her. Ive been doing a lot of research for her, exploring different options etc. Anyways, i responded with: \"babe, but you haven't been doing any of the things i told you! You haven't told your parents you want to go to a psychologist, you haven't been going to the gym, you haven't done the research to go to america, you havent read any books, you havent listened to any audiobooks on anxiety, you havent meditated, etc. I have given you so many options on how to feel better, but youre just not listening to me!\" She then gets mad at me that i always give the same answer, and that she just wants me to help her.. So i try (for the millionth time) to give her my opinion on the matter, and i try to explain to her what i would do in her shoes. But as i try to talk, she just keeps interrupting me about everything i say. She doesn't let me talk at all and just keeps rambling on about how I don't care about her, how I don't help her enough etc. I keep asking her: can you stop interrupting me please? This literally goes on for 15 minutes, i just cant say 3 words withour her interrupting me, and telling me that im not supporitve enough. So now I am getting really frustrated, because i am trying to HELP her, but instead of listening to what i have to say she decides to interrupt me and ramble on about how i DONT help her. So yea, at this point im getting very very annoyed and angry, but i try to stay calm because we've had some prior issues about me \"yelling at her\" and she says that i have anger issues, even though i have never called her any bad names other than maybe \"hypocrite\", i've never threatened her etc, but yea she stills believes i have anger issues because i tend to raise my voice in arguments when i get frustrated.\n\nSo yea, back to the story. Gf and I are still on the phone, and i keep telling her: can i talk now? Are you done? Can i please talk without you interrupting me? So then i tell her that I am getting very frustrated that she doesn't let me finish my story, and that she really has to stop interrupting me. While i tell her this, she decides AGAIN to answer mid-sentence and i just get very angry and yell at her: Can you just SHUT UP AND STOP INTERRUPTING ME PLEASE! I admit I did yell this quite aggresively, but I was just so exasperated. After i yelled at her she tells me i broke the rule (of not yelling) and that she is done, that she cant be with someone that treats her so poorly, that i do not respect her, that no matter how many times she interrupts me i should NEVER disrespect her like that etc. I then tell her I did not treat her badly, and that she doesn't see her own flaws, and that I try everything to help her but that she just doesn't appreciate my help. I then hang up. She now demands that i apolize for my behavior, and that I promise her that I will get therapy to help me with my anger issues ( which i dont believe i have). So i refuse to apologize, and she wants to break up if i do not say sorry. So yea, thats where we are now. AITA for not apologizing?",

      "description": "So, my best friend of 2 1/2 years and I have recently ended our friendship after I texted her telling her my feelings about how I was feeling left out. I will refer to her as “S” occasionally.\n\nBefore I get into what i said, let me give some background. Before the summer ended, she was very adamant that we hang out. We did a couple times, and then I had to go be a counselor at camp. After two weeks at camp, she went way north to stay with her dad (her parents are divorced) so we couldn’t hang out until like, august. \n\nThe week she got back, I had to go back to camp for another week. After that, she didn’t text me or anything until the week before school was supposed to start again in August.\n\nI asked her if we could hang out before school starts, and she said she couldn’t because she had to work, and had other “stuff”. Which was fine. I asked her what other “stuff” and she pushed it off. I moved on because it wasn’t that big of a deal.\n\nSo i went to make plans with another friend. Who said she was going to the beach with S. I immediately asked S why i wasn’t invited, to no response. Eventually we get on a phone call, we cry, we’re fine.\n\nEverything was fine until I was falsely accused of sending unsolicited nudes (which, is a whole different post for a whole different day) by this crazy Norweigen foreign exchange student around september. My life kind of fell apart at this point, and i was generally a mess. After things settled down a bit, S and I went shopping for a present for her mom’s birthday. We had a lot of fun.\n\nWe were supposed to hang out the next night, but she canceled out of nowhere. Eventually, I look on snapchat to see she posted a pic of her hanging out with all of our friends (she never posts on her story). \n\nI got very annoyed and texted her “I love it when you cancel plans on me and go bowling with our friends and ignore me 😊😊😊😊😊😊 #BFFs” at 8:17 pm.\n\nNo response. Left on read. So, at 11:37 PM, i say this:\n“You know, you wonder why i act like i don’t like anyone? It’s because I’m never invited to anything. I spend every waking moment of my life, helping my friends cope with their shitty lives, and do my best to make it better- sometimes that means being an asshole and telling them the truth. So if you want to ignore me deliberately- fine. But if you’re going to act like IM the one who caused this, I want you to remember every group chat I’m not in. Every party I don’t go to. Every time you didn’t invite me to Fugiyama. Every time I walked home, alone. Every time i ate, alone. It’s not because I choose it- it’s because people let me choose it. It’s because you let me choose it. So ignore me all night. Ignore me for the rest of your life. I’m over this “are we friends, are we not friends” thing. I’m over this being your best friend one day and not existing for 3 whole months.”\n\nTwo days later, she replies:\n“I’m really sad that you feel this way. However, the way you are treating me is unkind, and I don’t deserve to be treated in that way by any one.”\n\nI reply:\n“I agree, wholeheartedly. What i said was rude, i should have said it differently (and parts not at all). But the point is i feel left out of everything, and it’s not always my own fault... Literally everything is crumbling around me, and everyone has decided that instead of being there for me, to abandon me completely and leave me hanging”.\n\nNo response. Read receipts turned off.\n\nI text her 2 days later:\n“Let’s talk”.\n\nNo response.\n\n34 days later, i text her:\n“i am sorry.\nIdk if your mom told you, but she came to me after the concert and talked to me about what i am presuming was the (accusation) issue. She scolded me in front of everyone (not loud, but enough for me to lose all trace of my usual cockiness) about consent and yadayada, and i stood there speechless. Not because i cared that she knew, but because i worried that you believed in what terrible things were being spread about me.\nMy biggest problem since i came to (my performing arts school) has been my over-caring of the thoughts of my peers. I grew up being shat on by all people, for being gay, for having such an odd personality; yet, when I came to (my school) that changed. People saw me as a human, and I guess i got too far into believing that i was this godlike overlord. \nIn these past 34 days, i have been alone. Well, quasi alone. and it leveled me. It made me realize that without me, the world still spins (NOT SUICIDAL PLEASE JESUS CHRIST DONT THINK THAT). \nIn these past 34 days i’ve thought about how i would do this. I know I can’t do it in person because I would get over emotional. I know i cannot do it via handwritten note because i have the worst handwriting on this planet. Mr. Z (teacher who knows her and her family well) suggested writing you a note about my “feelings”, but i feel like notes are more of a non-platonic love thing, and despite popular belief- I am a fervent homosexual.\nI guess all this is just me trying to tell you that I understand i hurt you. I know that I hurt a lot of people. I hope we can mend these wounds, but if not i understand- and will accept that too. But never forget that above all people, you were the one person i could trust with anything. You were the only person who i truly cared about. And I ruined it. \nSo i am sorry. I am, so unbelievably sorry.”\n\nNo response.\n\nWe see each other every single day, and every day it pains me to look at her because i feel like an ass. I want to be friends with her again, but she wants nothing to do with me. Although i doubt i’ll ever get to be friends with her again, AITA?",

      "description": "Background: white European female, boyfriend male Indian, both in early 30s. Both atheists.\n\nSo although I’m an atheist, I enjoy celebrating Christmas with a tree, lights and spending time with family and friends, oh and the gifts are really a nice part as well (giving and receiving). \n\nAs my boyfriend is Indian, before he meet me he never celebrated Xmas. First Xmas was fine but this year he made such a big deal of him not needing/wanting anything for Xmas. His birthday is in early Jan, so I had a great idea of organising a trip to another European city so he could visit some family there just after his birthday. I paid for flights and accommodation for both of us as his Xmas/birthday gift. \n\n Went down well, however a few days before Xmas, he rang me while I was out to dinner with friends, saying we had to go to a different European city over xmas go visit his brother. (Brother was moving back to India). \n\nI really love celebrating Xmas with my family, but said if he really wanted me to come with him, he would have to pay as I didn’t have any more spare cash. I was happy for him to go solo and visit, and he wouldn’t have to drop any extra cash for me. He was like ‘no, I really want you to come and meet my brother’, so I told him I’m not 100% ok with this as it means I’ll miss time with my family, but if it means so much to you, I’ll go. \n\nSo a day before we go, I asked if he had managed to get the two games that I had wanted for Xmas. Well apparently paying for me to go to this European city was his present to me. \n\nNow this is where I ask, am I the asshole for being upset with this? \n\nI didn’t want to go, I was doing it for him and my gift to him was totally unselfish, we’d be with his family most of the time and it’s a city I’ve been to many a time, so didn’t need to site see etc. His ‘gift’ was because he wanted to see his brother and didn’t want to go alone.

      "description": "So to preface this, I always make friends with the “awkward” kids, because I understand it and I can be on the weird side to people myself because of my mental illnesses. So I make friends with a lot of people who don’t have many other friends but me.\n\nIn high school, this kid used to come up to me and always spout random stuff at my locker trying to catch my attention. I always joked back with him and tried my best to make him feel good because it was obvious that he just wanted a friend to chat with. Eventually he’d come up to my locker daily which I never minded. \n\nFlash forward two years. I was hospitalized and taken out of my high school and choose to do full time duel enrollment to get away from the bullying I was facing at my school so I hadn’t seen this kid in years. I never learned his name and he didn’t know mind that’s how not close we were. So I’m working at petstoreland and he showed up one day and recognized me. We talked for a minute, and decided to hang out sometime. I gave him my number and that was that. I ended up having to cancel our plans because of a work incident that came up. That was until he began showing up to every single one of my shifts. He must have came to the pet store every single day just to see if I was working. After a couple times I grew very uncomfortable and he just began blowing up my phone.  I told my boss about it, but because of this I ended up having a panic attack before work because I was scared he would come in again. Work is very hard for me mentally so it’s important I feel safe where I’m working and I just no longer felt safe. That’s where a quit my job no notice, which I already know is an asshole move, but Iv since apologized to my manager and he understands my uncomfort. \n\nBut I feel so bad about the situation still this much later. I feel like maybe I should have tried to be his friend more, but I’m still trying to manage being diagnosed with ptsd, severe depression, and severe anxiety. At the time this happened I was only leaving my house for work and was housebound beyond that. I don’t think I could have made a great friend anyway but I just can’t get passed how uncomfortable I was with someone showing up to my shifts to force me into talking and interacting with them. \n\nSo am I the asshole..? Should I have done more? ",

      "description": "I work at a dispensary, spoke with a female friend of mine that I'd get her some goodies as a Christmas gift. Shes a mom with like a 6 year old daughter. I talked with her that we'd have a visit for the holidays. I didn't want to come off as desperate for her company , so I didn't want to  bother her. I ended up eating her stuff during my new years party. Gave her a text letting her know ate her stuff, however I could just mail more to her. She hasn't replied really. Or like let me know she was gonna leave me hanging. Should I just also just move on give her the silent treatment aswell? I feel like in bird culture, that'd be a dick move. Btw where I work is like 9 hours away from where I actually live. More context she used to be my ex but we've remained friends. Then again I don't think friendships should be 1 sided. AITA? Like I'm not bothered personally, just discovered this sub and was curious into others opinions and responses.",

      "description": "I student teach- read observe someone else teach- two times a week. Lately the discussion has been antibiotic adherence, antibiotic stewardship, prevention of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms, and barriers to treatment. The instructor asked for my input as I am still practicing. I stated “often times, poor or impoverished patients and their families will not take their antibiotics, will take them improperly, or will not complete them due to lack of resources including financial and transportation, lack of access to a pharmacy, incomplete patient education, or poor health literacy or understanding of their diagnosis. We often see this population with increased numbers of multi drug resistant bacterial infections”. The instructor was immediate after my comment to discuss how poverty affects all races and even rural communities as if my comment required further padding for the students. \nToday, I was spoke to by my professor about the comment and importance of speaking with a diverse culture in mind and avoiding microaggressions in my comments and when addressing the class. I had never heard of microaggressions before and so I came home and googled them. I do not feel this is what I was doing nor was this racially led/ socially derogatory/ or a pointed comment in anyway. I was simply stating a common theme among populations that present within my practice as the faculty member asked my advice.\n\nAITA?",

My usual group of friends almost always goes out on saturday nights. the group consists of me, my friend (we'll call him M), his GF (B) and her friend (J). So recently M and B have been having some fights and i guess theyre trying to make a better effort in the relationship by doing more couple stuff (they had a couples night last saturday and we went out on friday which i had to shuffle plans to try and accomodate). Me and M have been friends for well over a decade and have known each other for the better part of our lives. Hes been living with B for a little over a year and has since been really busy with the relationship to hangout most days with the exception of saturday nights when his gf wants to go out too so i started going out more too, so i could spend some time with my friend. \n\n**so today** he texted me saying he wasnt sure he was gonna come out this saturday cause B had a bad hangover last week and she may wanna take a night off. I said; no prob, i figured you may wanna take the night off cause next weeks my bday and i wanted everyone to come out. he says \"ok maybe well just celebrate valentines day this weekend\". i know him, i know her; i already feel him cancelling plans on me. this is after last weekend they decided to have a couples night after i told him i had plans with my fam friday night and id be good saturday.\n\nnow i realize im paying for stress in advance here but am i the asshole if i get upset if he says he cant make it out on saturday? im gonna sit at home and do nothing if this happens. \n\ni know this seems kinda childish, theyre in a relationship and i dont expect them to drop everything because of me, but im really offended at how little someone who is my friend cares about how their actions effect me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So me (27F) and my (37M) boyfriend talking on the phone about what we want to do for New Year's Eve, I was saying that I miss having house parties and asked why no one ever seems to have parties anymore and he said it was because I'm getting old.\nSo that made fell shit as I'm quiet self conscious about hitting my late 20s and he knows it. Also he's 10 years older than me so who's the old here really!?\nAnyway I list off some NYE events that I was interesting in going to (we live in a big city, so there's a lot of stuff going on) to each one I suggest he says no to. So I ask what he would like to do (bear in mind that we both like going out and dancing) and he suggests this club/bar with a live funk/soul band playing.\nSounds ok huh, but thing is this band play every week at the same bar club and he goes and sees them every other week with his friend (I'll call) Jim. An I go along maybe every couple of months and have a nice time. Buttttt I don't want to go there for New Year's Eve! I can go to that exact night every Thursday if I wanted! I want to do something different for NYE!\nSo I kind of ummm and errrr about that suggestion, and he says his friend Jim is going there. Now I get on fine with Jim but he's not my friend and also he doesn't dance! It's really difficult to dance when a member of your party wants to stay sat down the whole evening. It just makes you feel awkward, so I would have to sit at the table bobbing my head watching everyone else dance and have a good time.\nMy BF doesn't get the lack of enthusiasm in my voice but goes on to suggest this disco event at a pub, which sounds fun! I say I think that sounds like a good idea. So he suggests we go to the first place with Jim until he goes home then we go to this other event afterwards.\nI kind of a agree because I don't like bring disagreeable.\nAfter the conversation ends though I get kinda annoyed at his reaction. He goes to this exact same night with his friend Jim every other week, and I want to do something different because it's New Year's Eve! It happens once a year c'mon. I'm his girl friend, do I not mean anything? We didn't have Xmas together or anything..\nI would understand if he didn't see this friend often or he hadn't been to this bar much. Or if it was a large group of people, but I find I feel like a third wheel when I go out with just him and Jim!\nSo i told him today that I'm going to do my own thing tonight until he's finished with Jim, and he was just like 'that's ok, go ahead'. I was hoping he might acknowledge that I was little upset with the arrangements but he doesn't care because he got what he wanted.\nSo am I the asshole??\n\n\n",

I didn't interact much with others, I hated those idiots. I also avoided family meetings because I always got a headache from all the simultaneous talking. As a result I'm rather weird. Sometimes I say inappropriate things, sometimes I'm honest when I should lie, sometimes I just don't know how to react to something. \n\nIt's gotten better since I entered college, somehow I was able to make friends that pull me along (which I'm happy about because I probably still wouldn't leave my room if they hadn't asked me to come to the lectures as well). A girl from that friend group even asked me out last summer, so she knew how I am. I do try my best to act normal and not embarras her, because she does mean a lot to me. \n\nLately she has started dragging me along to all kind of gatherings (parties, clubs, festivals). Those are very mentally taxing for me (basically instant headache for the rest of the day and I get tired very quickly), so I told her I didn't like it, and about the headache obviously. She told me I needed more practice (so to speak). I doubt that would help, I've had this for too many times and it doesn't get better unless I take painkillers every time, but that's not a very good solution. After a short discussion where she insisted on dragging me along, I got mad and told her to leave me alone and that she could just go with her friends, she knew the risks when she started dating me.

It started off early and I got hammered so I went home earlier.\n\nThing is, after I left the party, my ex SO (we dated briefly, she wasn't into me, but I was super into her and since things didn't work I´ve been ignoring her to create distance and try and move one) arrived at the party. She was drunk and danced and \"nearly\" made out with one of my closest friends who was also at the party. I know this because first thing in the morning my friend chatted me up and confessed to doing these things. He says he was blacked out drunk so he doesn't remember if he did it or not. But he wanted to say he was sorry about it anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I get angry with both my friend and her? He knew I had dated her not that long ago. He also knew that I fell for her and was actively trying to move on.\n\n She should  have known that doing this with one of my closest friends might have hurt my feelings (with actually did, because im feeling right now a mixture of angriness, sadness and disappointment).\n\nI don't want to know what to do next, I only want to know If I have the right to be angry at them, and if it´s the respectable thing to do if I want to respect myself first. Or if it would be a dick move and I would be an aasshole.\n\nTL;DR: A close friend of mine \"nearly\" made out with a girl im still moving on from. They both should've known not to do that in my opinion. Should I be angry, would I be the asshole if I tell them both to go fuck themselves?\n\nThank you and much help appreciated.",

Ur just gunna let him talk to me like that!!” But the teacher doesnt hear her over everyone laughing. And all of a sudden she just starts balling her eyes out and she walked out of class. idk if it was about the embarrassment or not, but i felt good for a minute or two but then i took it into consideration “what if she bullies other people, because shes insecure? What if she thinks if she gets to other people before they get to her that she’ll be safe?” I didn’t realize whether or not i made her even more insecure or not? AITA?\n\n\nTL:DR I called a conceited class bully “ugly” in front of everybody  because she does the same to everyone else and she started balling her eyes out.",

      "description": "I’ve had this friend for almost a decade. Very good friend, we always have fun when we’re together. We live in Cali.\n\nShe went to a tour of Europe in January and had plans to return in November. She invited me and said I would go but I only wanted to go to Paris and she said she’d be down to meet me there.\n\nShe’s persistent, keeps telling me to go, eventually I cave. August, I book tickets to Paris, give her the dates, tell her to call me so we can figure out hotels and stuff.\n\nShe doesn’t call for a while. Plane tickets are 99.99% of the time, non-refundable. I go ahead and book the cheapest hotel I can find (in bumfuck outskirts of Paris).\n\nEventually she calls and tells me someone scammed her out of 6k on Craigslist as she was trying to make side money for the trip. Starts asking me “what am I going to do? How am I going to pay for gas?” I felt like she wanted me to say “I’ll give you money” but I gave her advice and kept it short.\n\nI start asking again for details on the trip and if she’ll meet me and all she replies is “did you help me when I was having my crisis?” and I say “is that a yes or no?” And she leaves it at that. I end up going to Paris, another girl luckily is able to come too.\n\nSaid friend texts me, while I’m in Paris, on my birthday, saying happy birthday and she wishes I could be there. (And I’m pretty sure she was in Ireland at the time of the text).\n\nI didn’t reply. Didn’t say anything. I like to think I’m not the asshole for anything here but I’m more wondering if I should text her back or just let the friendship die?",

      "description": "   I had this one friend, and we did almost everything together. Our friendship had always been really special to me, because he had always been there for me. He supported me through all of my downs, and I tried my best to do the same for him. He was even my wingman when I had a huge crush on one girl in our friend group. (No, that didn't work out but the fact he tried to help still means everything to me) He had always been there for me whenever I was feeling under-confident, upset, or whenever I just felt like I had no one to talk to. I always kind of looked up to him as a better version of myself because I felt like he was better at not letting his emotions control him. Meanwhile, I've always been the sensitive one who tends to get upset over the little things. Hell, I cried once because I saw a dead bird on my way to school. And that was in 9th grade by the way. \n\n   I was there for him too because he had problems and struggles of his own. And I feel like us constantly working to help each other, added to the quality of our friendship because we understood each other's issues. We cared about each other more than we cared about ourselves. I felt us growing really close, and I enjoyed every second of it. He yelled at any of our mutual friends whenever they were giving me a hard time.He reminded all of my friends that it was my birthday when all of them had forgotten. And I would do the same for him, but there was one problem. I'm incredibly insecure, my biggest fear is that one day all of my friends might just see me as boring, or annoying, or that they secretly hate me, and that they'll just walk out of my life. I've told him this before too, that I was afraid of being seen as annoying, and that I had abandonment issues. That I sometimes felt jealous or left out, but I also hated myself for feeling that way because I felt like I was ruining everything for everyone by being an attention whore. He said that is was fine, that he didn’t mind it and that he'd always be there. \n\n   But, he had a tendency of giving the green stop sign. I'd ask him if he wanted to hang out, play video games, or do whatever and he'd say “yes.” Only to not do whatever we made plans to do. I always dismissed it thinking that sometimes stuff comes up, and that he does have more important things to do. But this kept happening, over and over again. Even on my birthday when we made plans to play video games and he just didn’t go through with it. He said he felt bad and I believed him but, I was just kind of annoyed. We actually hung out more, and then out of the fucking blue he raged at me to leave him alone. After we mutually made plans to hang out??? I ended up leaving and then the longest 2 hours of my life passed before I did the stupidest thing I've ever done. I questioned if he cared about me, and if I was just a burden to him. He immediately apologized and I believe his apology to be genuine but, it just kind of went over my head. I dismissed his apology because at the time, I was just tired of being lied to, having promises broken, and being sent mixed signals. And me being quick to not accept his apology made him angry and then we had a very mundane argument that lasted for a few seconds before he just ended it with “We'll talk later”.  I later came forward and apologized for everything because even now, I blame myself for this whole mess. \n\n   I thought we made up for it and I thought that we could just put this behind us. The next day I asked him if we were still cool and he said “yes”. This was 3 days after my birthday and we didn’t really talk much that day, or the next day, or the next day, or the next week, and before I know it. He ghosted me for 3 weeks. And during those 3 weeks some of our mutual friends kind of got us to hang out. But it didn't really work. While I was in my self-loathing state, he was shit talking me to all of our friends. Including once to another one of my friends, right in front of me. Saying things that confirmed all of my deepest insecurities. And I had no one to blame for this but myself. I think it's safe to say he over reacted a bit, but so did I and I still feel like I could have prevented all of this. A lot of our mutual friends stayed passive but some of our friends, after hearing both sides of the story, immediately took my side. And at first it felt nice, but even some of his friends his friends that didn’t know me took my side and that made me feel bad because, literally no one took his side. And I didn’t want him to lose friends over this. We had one mutual friend who took my side and even said he wanted to ghost my friend, but I was the one to talk him out of it. The thing is, now my friend that ghosted me has basically replaced me with my friend who was going to ghost him, as his new best friend. \n\n   I'm posting this here because I don't know what to believe. Everyone's been telling me that I'm not at fault, but I still blame myself for it. And lately I guess I've kind of begun to blame my friend more. I often swing back and forth between feeling like it's all my fault, and feeling like my friend was a liar. I still get mixed messages from him like: He said he didn’t say “no” to me because he'd have felt bad about it. But why would he feel bad saying “no” and not feel bad ghosting me. That's why I want to know from you guys because I feel like I'm too emotionally unstable to decide myself. \n\n   \n\n   ",

      "description": "I love my sister-in-law and her children. Their family lives  18 hours away so we see them 2 or 3 times a year (if we are luck). Recently my sister-in-law has been struggling with stress and anxiety. She has good reason for it and she is trying to get help. My in-laws thought it would be a nice treat for her to get away and come stay with us (my in-laws live in the same neighborhood as us). I had already taken off two days of work to do some spring cleaning and it just happened that my sister-in-law would come during that time. She is aware of my plans to be productive during this time and wanted to help. We also have a 20 month old that she would like to spend time with so I thought we could not send her to daycare for one day. Flight Tickets were purchased for a Friday to Wednesday stay.\n\nFlash forward to yesterday - her youngest (3 yo) breaks her leg on a trampoline. I for sure thought the trip would be cancelled and I was somewhat was relieved as I was wondering if my two days off would really be as productive as I had hoped with her coming.WRONG- instead she now wants to bring her daughter (who has to wear a leg cast for 6 weeks) down too. The mom in me understands that she wants to be with her child but I just don’t know why you would put your kid through all that travel. 1)This is not a required trip (reschedule please!). 2) the point of this trip was rest and relaxation - not going to get that now. 3) all of our bedrooms are on the second floor - not convenient 4) i am definitely not going to be productive with an immobilized 3 yo needing entertainment. Sure my sister-in-law will be around. However her parents use their children (my husband included) as pawns in their marriage. And they are all talk and little action. I have been reassured that the 3 yo will be passed off to this person and this person and how she really won’t be staying  with us. It will be a miserable trip for all parties.\n\nMy husband thinks I am being an asshole - I can’t tell. Help!\n\n",

      "description": "So I have 2 little brothers, one is 13 and the other is 11. 2 summers ago I was lucky enough to win a Nintendo Switch in a crane game at an amusement park, so I took it home and set it up in my room (I’m 17 at this point). However, we only had 2 games for the system: Mario Odyssey and BoTW, I finished Odyssey fairly quickly and didn’t play much of BoTW, so I didn’t use it that often. My little brothers often wanted to use the system, so I’d let them use it whenever I wasn’t (which was most of the time). Fortnite was ported to the switch early the next year, and my youngest brother began to play it almost everyday with his friends. Anyway; that next summer I head off to college, but decide to leave my switch at hike because I sill didn’t have many games for it and my brothers loved playing it so much I didn’t want to take that away from them if I wasn’t going to use it. They continued to use it throughout my first semester of college but by the end of it I had bought Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash bros for the system, and decided to take it back with me to college at the end of the holiday break. When I came home at the beginning of that break, I had found out that my brothers had messed up the joysticks on both joycons, so it no longer worked as well as it used to (and pressing them it down didn’t do anything at all). I was annoyed but I was still able to play, it was just more difficult to do certain things, so I brushed it off. However my brothers got a new switch for Christmas from my parents, and that switch included joycons without broken joysticks. So the day I went back to college I switched those joycons with the ones on my switch and left. My brothers soon found out and were not happy, and are demanding I give them back. However, since they were the ones to break the controllers, I think they should have to experience be consequences (as this wouldn’t have happened if I hadn’t let them use my switch for a whole semester). As stated above, the joycons are still usable, they just take longer or require a certain amount of pressure to respond. Thoughts? ",

      "description": "This happened about 2 weeks ago, and my Discord is pretty split on the matter. There was this guy (M) who was pretty annoying, but he was secretly cyber-bullying my friend (B). No one would listen to her, even though she told us about it. We thought it was just M being M. We were talking one day and B joins the Discord sniffling, and saying she is probably going to go offline for a bit. When I asked why, she said it was to get away from M. I asked her why she would go completely offline  because of M, she just started bawling. She told me about the insults he sent her daily, how he would join her games just to troll her, stuff like that. It was pretty mild on a bullying front, but I got into a fit of rage, both at M for doing it and myself for not listening to her. I then didn't get his info and didn't release it on a DOXing site. I heard from another person he has been getting spam emails, junk mail, and phone calls for a completely unrelated reason.  \n\n\nI feel like I over-reacted a little bit. Even B said she is over it and I didn't have to react that harshly. Some people say I didn't have to ban him, but only B and 2 other people know that I definitely didn't DOX him. Like I said, my Discord is pretty split on it and I just want to see what everyone else thinks.",

This 1 girl that was sitting right by me in class looked to her right, where I was sitting, and asked \"Who wants to be in my group?\" and the girl in front of me was like \"sure!\" and then the original girl looked at me and asked if i wanted to join her group, so I was like \"sure!\" Because I like her and didn't want to be rude.\n\nHowever, I was thinking of asking another girl in class that I've been getting close to. Yesterday this girl asked if I wanted to work with her on the project, and I told her that I already had a group. I felt bad because I wanted to work with her more than the girls I'm currently with. And I really want to work with her on group projects in the future. But, I feel like I'd look like an asshole if I told my current group members that I'm switching groups.

He has done it more often then I have, and is usually the one prompting the idea.  So he disappeared today, and I, being the only one who 'accidentally' left their swim suit at home, was sent on the hunt. \n\nThe manhunt began, so I walked across the campus  searching all of his regular spots. The locker room turned up empty and the coaches were growing anxious. I called him and he declined, so I knew he had his phone. My newly discovered detective skills told me it would be a good idea to mess with him and once I found him, I would snapchat him a picture of his new hiding place. \n\nThe search continued into it's 13th minute and I was nearing a conclusion. There was a pool of water around his bag indicating he had been there earlier. The tracks curved to the door headed into the lounge. Alas, I thought I had him. But even the lounge managers were unaware of any suspicious swimmer kid leaving early, I was wrong.\nugh\n\nok so I was heading to the locker room for one last check, I heard voices. It was him and another kid in the family locker room. These doors lock from the inside, but I wanted the element of surprise. Right before I could leave and return the news of some absent swimmers who didn't deserve any punishment, a coach walked over. She asked if I found them. I fumbled. \nHere's the conversation as far as I can remember.\ncoach- \" Have you seen them?\"\n\n\"haven't seen them\"\nbut I fumbled too hard. and I said too much\n\"but I have heard them.\"\n\nSo remember when I said I was going to spoil his hiding space over Snapchat?\n\njust a minute earlier I had sent him a picture of the door with the caption \"gotcha bitch\"\n\nThe coaches got both of the and suspended them from swim.\n\nI was threatened with a face punch if I talked to him\n\nwhen heading back to the locker room to recover my absent sweatshirt I heard him vaguely say to the other skipper\n\n\"I'm going to punch his face in, why did he do that!\"\n\nI hate myself for it, they were my two lane mates. I've lost two good friends for good now. I'd like you to decide if the snitching and my behavior was assholey. J has Reddit, I'm sorry man, pretty sure I'm a dick.",

He has always been a close friend, and we were even a couple for one and a half year over 4 years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the four years where I have been single, he's had 3 other girlfriends, all which ended when he got broken up with. Currently, he found a new girlfriend on Tinder that lives 3 hours away (we're quite rural), and he's been dating her for 3 months now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblem is, my friend has been depressed ever since he finished primary school because of bullying and isolation, and therefore is a package of problems. I have no problem with him being depressed, I was one of the people that actually helped him get proper care one year ago once he got to his lowest (almost suicide, told his mom behind his back) which got him what he needed. But I feel he should wait with the dating until he starts feeling better and is more capable of taking care of himself. While his depression doesn't physically manifest anymore (tired, lazy, no motivation), he is still very mentally and emotionally broken. All those girlfriends I mentioned dumped him because he became too needy, and while their lives moved on and had other stuff happening his only things were gaming and the relationship. He started demanding more company, but the problem with his company is that he mostly uses it to get the attention and love he needs and pays romantic attention to you only when he remembers that he's supposed to. I know this very well because I was the first that had to put up with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't said anything about it yet, but I have told him while he was single that he should wait in getting a new relationship until he's happy with himself and able to create his own happiness instead of just relying on romance.

      "description": "I live in city A, am from city B (where my parents and girlfriend live), and my brother live in city C.\n\nMy mom is very sick, and lately had the need to go to C, as the hospitals there are better than in B. On the last visit, she had a convulsion, and was internet at the ICU. She has been getting exams done. The moment i knew what happened, i drove to be with my mom. Now that she is out of the ICU, she's been getting visits in her hospital room.\n\nMy relationship has had some rocky patches, but i know i want to spend my life with her. We come from different backgrounds (specially money wise, me being sort of well off), and it has always been a point of contention for her, who at times could feel very out of place. My parents love her. My brothers love her. My whole family loves her. She doesn't see it, but we have been able to work things out.\n\nShe wanted to visit my mom, but didn't have the money, and at the moment, me neither. I told her an uncle would be driving by B, to visit my mom, and that he could give her a lift. Well, my uncle did stop by B, but it was very early, while i was sleeping. I couldn't tell her in time, and she wasn't able to visit my mom. I admit this and apologize.\n\nThe last couple of days i had to come back to A, i say to my GF that we're going to C (i'll drive alone , and i i'll buy her ticket). She starts going on about how hospital rooms cant' be crowded , and that i should ask if she is allowed to visit my mom (she is, no asking needed). I get a little mad and ask her if she's mad that she didn't visit my mom.\n\nShe says \"no\" and i proceed to say that she can always feel welcome with my family. We have a long (very tiring) back and forth  and i say \"everyone would be happy with your visit, you can always feel welcome with my family\"\n\nShe says \"doubt it\". Well, this got me angry. The only people who could stop her from going are my mom and dad, or me. My mom who's in the hospital, my dad who's living in a couch beside her, or me who's paying for her travel.\n\nI say \"you shouldn't say that, it doesn't help and hurts a lot\"\n\nI remind her that my brother's girlfriend (who my father hates) was welcome into the room, and spent a whole afternoon doing crosswords with my mom, and no one said a word about her visit, before or after it.\n\nShe starts typing. While she is typing, i type \"sorry they didn't roll the red carpet from the hospital to your house\".\n\nAs i send it, she sends \"i just don't want to be a hassle\". Some seconds after she said that, she texts \"wow, ok\". She hasn't texted me since.\n\nI know i was wrong, i apologized a lot. She doesn't even read those messages. I know i acted on an impulse but also feel that she should just come visit my mom without voicing doubt that she's welcome, or at least not throw shade my/my family's way.\n\nTLDR; Girlfriend doubts my family wants her to visit my mom in the hospital, and accuses them of not liking/welcoming her. I get mad and say something stupid. She hasn't talked to me since.",

      "description": "I live with my 2 roommates and my girlfriend in a northern city. We live in a big old house that was built in the 1930s, so it tends to get a bit drafty. As such, it's safe to assume the temperature is about 5 degrees colder than what the thermostat says it is at a given time. Also safe to assume lots of the heat energy from the furnace gets wasted because drafty house. Cue my dilemma...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a 20-something with no money (and as someone who grew up in the snow), I see trying to keep this house any warmer than 65 as a losing battle, especially considering how old and drafty it is.  I'd much rather layer up and focus on warming myself up rather than the whole house. I hate to sound like a dad, but I just don't want to pay money to heat the neighborhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy roommates, however, feel much different. They often crank it way up, even past what I consider to be necessary to make the house comfortable (I'll admit 65 on the thermostat isn't the warmest and I'm fine with it being left at 68). But this is ridiculous. I came home one night last week and basically started sweating as soon as I walked in; when I checked the thermostat it was set to **85 degrees!** When I turned it back down to 68, my roommate stared at me and claimed it was freezing in here. (Remember I just walked in from the outside and was burning up so no, it wasn't). I didn't even know how to respond so I just stared at him for a sec before going up to my room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell we got our first utility bill since winter started last week, and lo and behold it was about twice as much as it was the month prior. We've always split these bills evenly between the four of us and it was never an issue, but I feel like this circumstance is different. I don't want to be forced into paying evenly for the heat and I specifically told them at the beginning of winter how I felt about the thermostat. I wouldn't ask them to split the water bill evenly if I took a 2 hour shower each and every day, so why should I have to subsidize their choice? Especially when the majority of the heat was probably wasted, being an old house with shitty insulation and all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd just so you know, this isn't only about the cost of keeping a drafty house warm. I sleep much better in cooler temperatures. (Maybe TMI) I sweat very easily if I'm too warm at night, and when I do, I always wake up and have to reorient my blankets and stuff so I can get back to sleep. So not do I feel forced into paying for heat I don't want, I also have been sleeping poorly whenever one of them turns it too high and leaves it (which has happened a bunch over the past month or so) and its becoming a real problem. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should state that my wonderful girlfriend has been sympathetic to my issue and offered to pay a portion of my part herself (she too prefers it warm, but much more reasonably so). But I don't want to do that because it's totally unfair for her alone to pick up my slack - if I do end up paying less, I'd want the remainder to be split evenly between the other 3.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdk Reddit, you tell me: would I be an asshole if I refused to split this utility evenly? Should I just bite the bullet, pay this and future bills, and find some thicker-skinned roommates next time?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Am a frugal hoe who loves the cold, roommates turn heat up too high and I don't want to pay for it. Am I an asshole if I give them less than what they're asking for?",

      "description": "This guy at work has been trying to talk to me on and off. He's very nice, there are no red flags at this point. We've had a few nice chats. We are talking about movies a few days ago- I said I wanted to go see this one movie, but I kept putting it off and wasn't sure if it was still in theaters. It was within context of the conversation. He comes to me yesterday, he has found out that it's still playing at this one theater in town, and asks me to go with him this weekend. I agreed. However after sleeping on it, I didn't feel right. You see, recently I've been asked out by a couple of other guys at work, and others have expressed interest. (Very few women where I work) I've pretty much either turned them down or put them off. (Seperate issue) People in my life have been telling me to loosen up and just have fun. So I said yes pretty much to prove to myself that I could. Then today it felt wrong and dishonest, so I told him I couldn't go. There's nothing the matter with him. He's perfectly nice. He's made an effort to get to know me in our weird work environment. He seems genuine. I just couldn't bring myself to go through with it. Now I feel better that I canceled, but now also a little guilty because I think I might be the asshole. Idk. You tell me.",

      "description": "I've been working at a fast food place to save up for college. I usually work nights, so it'll be me and one other person in the store for a couple of hours. \n\nIn the fall, I worked with this one girl a lot, and we became friends.  Not close or anything, but we enjoyed each other's company. \n\nThen, one day, she just stopped acknowledging my existence. She'd be fairly normal with my other coworkers, but she acted like I didn't exist for like three months. I was hurt and confused, and me being me, I was also too afraid to really confront her about it. I asked if I had done something wrong, but she didn't say anything.\n\nSo fast forward to a few weeks ago, she starts talking to me a bit again. And bit by bit, she's kind of returned to the way it was before.\n\nI finally worked up the courage to ask what had been up, and she said that she had been depressed. And I believe her, she's definitely been depressed (reasons we don't need to get into), but what confuses me is that she hasn't acted weird with anyone but me.\n\nAnd now, whenever I have to work with her, I stress over whether or not she's going to treat me like I exist or not, because it really just seems to depend on her mood. I find that I don't even really want to try to rebuild our friendship because it's so exhausting.\n\nAITA?",

TL;DR at the end.  \n\n\nSo my mate posts a picture to a group chat of him using a filter to look like some K-Pop star or something. Neither of us like K-Pop (I moderate an Anti K-Pop sub because I really hate it.) and we do stuff like that all the time to take the piss. Someone in the chat really likes K-Pop. I didn't think about that before replying \"Literally Disgusting\". Oh boy did I make a mistake. It really kicked off in the group chat with this person's friend having a go at me for \"making fun of something x is really passionate about.\" I get told repeatedly to back off, but I didn't. Now I wasn't being stubborn just to be a jerk. Person x is the kind of person who will make fun of people 24/7 but can't take it themself. I'd had enough of them not having anything in the way of kickback for their shitty attitude and decided that if they were going to swing at me, I'd swing back. So anyway, after an hour or so of arguing and half a dozen people who weren't in the group chat messaging me about how person x was \"really pissed off\" it eventually dies down. Now I'm getting the cold shoulder from everyone in the chat bar my mate who just thinks its hilarious. I'm pissed off that person x is seen as a saint even though they just take the piss 24/7 without any kickback whatsoever, but when I decide to have a go at them I'm suddenly a terrible person. Oh and also I'm getting the whole snapchat story of \"why do I bother\". Does this make me the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I didn't back down from an argument because the other person can't take someone taking the piss out of them but does it to everyone else.",

      "description": "Okay, so we have a small garden at our house, which I take care of but this time It had grown too much and I lacked the proper tools.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother knew a man who could take care of that. He was not a gardener, but a jack-of-all-trades sort of guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe had already come to our home to do some specific repairs I couldn't do myself, so I was confident he could take care of it. I'm a bit biased towards him because of his political opinions, which I don't share in the least, but he has always been nice to me, so I try to do the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, we call him and we fix a date for him to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe doesn't show up and texts me an hour later telling me he couldn't make it. We agree that he'll come the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe actually comes two and a half hours late with his son and rushes through the work because he doesn't want to spend the whole morning on it. He takes three and a half hours but doesn't trim one of the bigger bushes. I can do that one myself without problems, so I do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found out this guy asked her 120€ for the job. I don't know about you, but, for me, it is way too expensive. It is over 17€ per hour and person when they are not professionals and hadn't done the full job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I don't want to ever hear about this guy again. He has clearly overstepped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday comes, and he texts me asking if I would be at home because he wants to come to fumigate (I don't know if it's the actual world) our lemon tree. I ask my mother if she knows anything about this (I work at home and she doesn't work Monday morning) and she says he offered to do it for free. I don't know if he is feeling guilty but I don't care. My house is my sanctuary and I don't want him inside. I tell my mom that he doesn't have to bother and I'll do it myself. We have the equipment and chemicals, so it is okay. I swear I heard her clearly agree. So I told her to sort it out and don't bother responding to him myself. I don't want to have to do anything with this man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext day, at around 10, he texts me informing me that he is coming over to do the job. No hello. No asking. Just informing me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am really pissed. I had my best friend coming over who I hadn't been able to see in over two months, and I didn't want to deal with that man with my friend here. I proceed to text back the man politely, saying that he doesn't need to come and I'll do it myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my friend arrives and we catch up with a nice chat. A bit later, my mother arrives, and boy, SHE IS MAD and we get into a big fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says I am acting childish and immature, and that I only rejected that man's help because of politics. I argue that it was because of his abusive price and him not finishing the work but she won't have any of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother keeps telling me I was unreasonable and clearly in the wrong. I think I was too kind with that guy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

No one was happy and we decided to break it off and see where things goes. Fast forward to about a months ago we start to reconnect slowly and realize our flaws in the relationship. We still have feelings for each other so we decided to try things out again, but from a different perspective since we knew each others faults and decided to work on it so nothing gets to that bad point again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know and fully understand that what she or I did in those months apart shouldn't reflect what happens now, and I don't think or feel anything within that period should be used against one another. \n\nI know one of her friends had a crush on her for a while, and after we broke up they started to hang out more and more. I'm not sure if they did anything together or if nothing went that far, but I know when we started getting back together to see if we could make it work, he was her picture on her phone, and always texted each other. It was a bit weird, because the photo was of them two laying together on what seemed to be a bed? Not entirely sure, it was a face shot. \n\nThere was an incident a week ago where the friend started to show interest in another girl, and she was stressing and told me that she doesn't know if he likes her, or likes this other girl, but wouldn't fully explain why it mattered. \n\nShe told me a few times that I shouldn't worry about it because nothing is gonna happen between the two of them.  But I am not fully sure as there are things that point towards there being feelings. Such as what I stated above, and how she would go out at night for an hour to go to his break, or when they go and hang out they would just drive around or talk in their car for hours before she would come back to hang out with me, or going on a small road trip for an entire day to another state together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't enjoy feeling like this, or even having the thought of telling her that she can't or can do something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting her to hang out with him? Should I just let it go and continue trying to build this relationship back up with her? Or should I just move on from her? ",

      "description": "Sorry for much a long read, thanks in advance.\n\n\nSo a little background I’m a 21 F and have been friends with let’s call them Maria (20F) and Paige (19F) since HS. I have been friends w Paige a little longer I’d say my 10th grade and her 9th grade and we met Maria 12th grade. \n\nAfter graduation we all went our separate ways due to college and we tried hard to keep in touch but with the distance came lots of distance. I went to all their birthday parties even when we lived more than 4hrs away I always made sure to go and ALWAYS gave gifts to make their day a bit special. But in 2018 for my birthday neither one of them gifted me anything of planned anything nor even saw me. Granite I did have a party in Vegas and neither had the funds to do so and I was completely understanding but we could have planned something when I got back as this was my 21st and I never celebrated a birthday with them when I attended everyone of theirs. \n\nLast year on Marias birthday they came and visited as Maria lives a little closer to me and me being in the next closest city to her, Paige came to my apartment for the first time even though it was my 2 year living there. We threw Maria a surprise birthday party for which she was very ungrateful for but we shook it off.\n  \nThroughout the year Paige would insist I visit her apartment as it was her first one and as I always I went and visited her on a 4 hr drive multiple times.\nA year later on Maria’s birthday, Paige is Coming to visit her and this upset me to the point of crying just because I felt neglected. I work the whole weekend and wouldn’t of been able to head to Maria’s city even though it’s an hour away they refuse to visit me because they wanna plan to do things there. I felt not included and told them how I felt as Paige never once came to visit me but only comes here when it’s Maria’s birthday. I told them I had plans Sunday to attend a coworkers presentation and they said I should just cancel and hang with them. I thought it was selfish as I find myself always giving and always being there for the friendship. I told them I could no longer be there friends and Maria says I’m making everything about me when this is honestly just so much pined up angry exploding.",

      "description": "Last year my friend had a very bad day. I didn't know what was going on, we had been messaging in a lighthearted way about other things when my partner messaged me. She was hanging out with my friends housemate at their house. My partner used the tap in the bathroom to wash her hands and it came off and started pouring water everywhere. It had already been repaired a few days before but not repaired properly. It was an accident and no one (except my friend) thinks its my partners fault. My partner called me asking for advice on how to fix it because she and the housemate were at a lose. I made a joke to my friend, in the same tone our conversation had been so far that day.   \n\nShe expressed how bad her day was going and I was immediately apologetic. We didn't talk for months. \n\nWe went for a hike with some people on the weekend and she made a passing joke about her being mad at me last year. Being cut off by my friends is a massive fear of mine, and giving my friend the space she wanted last year was not easy for me. I respect her process, but the way she was making light of it cut me deep. \n\nSo I messaged her to let her know why I walked off on my own on the weekend, just to explain my behavior and let her know where I was at. I was hit with one hell of a wall of text. \n\nI know shes going through a lot of stuff. I'm not trying to demand more time from her, just explain how I'm feeling and why I'm reacting in certain ways. \n\nI feel like my input doesn't justify the responses I'm getting? \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/871ra3C?fbclid=IwAR34sLITosvhRl0JFVqpciFKfIgQkjoX1diutvpvjH0XSyQv22wzlXpeTFg\n\nPretty sure the messages uploaded out of order sorry.

I never ignore her and will reply ASAP to her calls. I do not like to talk much when I am doing my assignments or revising and will tell her that I am busy doing stuff.When I feel tired or stressed , according to her ,I become ignorant and cold and will not find her first.(which I always be stressed during final period or working on my assignment). She admit that I will listen to her and try to calm her when she is depressed or stressed, but she still thinks that I am ignoring her because I never give the chance to her to comfort me( which alcohol and cigs did a much better job). Last night, I tried to tell her that I am worrying about stuff after graduation( she forced me decide to either go back and not taking any post-graduate, or she is going to break up with me, which I gave in), she just go silence and go viral on why I never tell her that I am down, or how she don\\`t think we are working anymore because I always ignore her and never tells her how I feel, or how she is turned off by me because I sucks in choosing what cloths to wear, or how shitty I am as a boyfriend in general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I don\\`t feel like exposing my life to others. I feel like an asshole right now because I am not qualified as what she want.I tried to compromise and react to her phone call when it was 4 in the midnight in my place because she wants to wake me up for i forgot what reason it is.I let her do whatever she want and never question about her suspicious friendship with other male, listen to her ran even when I am having a hard time, barely let her handle any of my stress or sadness.

      "description": "I attended a hockey game of the local minor hockey team this past weekend and something happened that made we want to post here to see if I really am an ahole. I am the type of person that is always early for anything that I go to and this was no exception. I arrived at the game and got my ticket, which turned out to be in the cheap seats. I was seated in seat 1 of row 17 in the section. It was the next to last row at the very top of the arena. When I got there the arena was very empty and I thought that it was going to be an emtpy game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm sitting watching the game and by the end of the first period of the game almost all of the seats in the arena were now filled. I was actually very surprised based on the crowd size at the beginning of the game. The more surprising thing is that my row had no one else in it. I was the only person sitting in my row. Also, you should know that there were 18 rows in a section. As the game goes on, a guy comes strolling down my row and asks if he can get by. I don't think too much of it and stand up so the guy can squeeze by. In about another five minutes, a different guy comes down the row and asks if he can get by so again not thinking too much about it I just stand and let him get by as well. And yep, you got it - in about another five minutes another guy is standing next to me asking to get by. At this point, I'm a bit annoyed that people are using my row to go between sections. Being that my row was empty except me they were using it in order to go from one section to the next without having to go all the way to the bottom of the section and then having to come back up. This time I was a bit annoyed but once again I stood up and let the guy get by.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm annoyed but trying to not let it get to me so I continue to watch the game. And before I know it, maybe 10 or 15 minutes later, the second guy that came through is now standing on the other side of me wanting to get through again. This time instead of standing up, I look up at him and ask \"Are you going to keep doing this? Going back and forth?\" He didn't say a word but I could tell from the look on his face that he knew he had annoyed me. To his credit, he did find a solution and stepped up to the row behind me (there were a few empty seats on the end of that row) and he then stepped over the seats and stepped down into my row without making me have to once again get up. He must have obviously told his friends, because I did notice a few times throughout the rest of the game that guys were coming through but they never asked me to let them by rather they just stepped over the seats as well into the row above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfterwards, I did wonder if maybe I had overreacted and thought what would it have hurt to just stand a moment to let the guy through and it made me wonder AITA?",

      "description": "So my cousin and I have been best buddies for a long time (since we were babies). We always had fights like siblings and cousins do but recently I think it has escalated another level. So I'm talking to my cousin on Discord. And I see him getting confused with Wi-Fi and Frames: like a lot of people do. This isn't even his first time; more like his 5th. I've told him the difference over and over again but he seems to not get it. He gets mad over me after I ask him if I can post it on Reddit mockingly because it was funny to me.\n\n\nThe conversation goes like this:\n\nMe: Hi\nCousin: Why don't you use computer Discord anymore?\nMe: Because Computer Discord lags my laptop when I'm playing games\nCousin: Nah. I can run Spotify, Discord and Google all on my crappy Mac at the same time. Which means you can too.\nMe: It also lags my internet for some reason and I forget to close it a lot.\nCousin: Noob, I can do Subnautica, Update Fortnut and...\nMe: Does Subnautica have multiplayer? I can't remember.\nCousin: ... Discord call at the same time\n\n**I assume he is talking about a multiplayer feature in Subnautica that I have not heard about because everything he's listed is internet related and not computer related but then he goes on to say this:**\n\nCousin: Subnautica is damn laggy. It takes up huge WiFi cos it has a lot of stuff in it when I get underwater, the frames rip.\n\n**At this point I realise he still hasn't figured out what the difference is between WiFi and Computer Graphics so I tease him a little**\n\nMe: Would you mind if I post this screenshot on Reddit? It's comedy gold.\nCousin: No, I mind.\nMe: **Posts screenshot**\nCousin: What's so funny? \nMe: This is comedy gold... Subnautica is an offline game xddd\nCousin: Omfg you haven't seen the frames have you?\nMe: What?\nCousin: I give up\nMe: I'm confused... What? Your laptop is responsible for outputting your frames... Not your WiFi?\nCousin: K post it. Idc anymore.\nMe: Nah if you don't want me to, I won't. I asked for permission.\nCousin: It's not fun talking to you anymore. \n\n**At this point I realise I messed up cause I love my cousin (no homo) and I went a step too far. I should've probably been more patient with him. I also realise I'm extremely bad at texting and socializing.**\n\nTL;DR: I asked my cousin if he would mind if I posted some screenshots on Reddit of him mixing up Ping and FPS. He gets mad and says he doesn't like talking to me anymore.\n\nSo... tell me... Am I the asshole?\n\nThis is my first post on r/AmITheAsshole so please be nice to me",

      "description": "Okay, I have a female friend who has some anxiety issues (as do I) and takes some anti-anxiety medications.\n\nTo preface, she wanted to smoke weed with me (she rarely does, and we hadn’t smoked together) so we had both smoked a bit. She got extremely anxious all of a sudden and got super quiet before talking about how scared she was. \nShe ended up getting in my bed and trying to lay down, but she was saying that she was worried she would do something bad. I sat next to her and went through coping mechanisms and breathing techniques I use for my anxiety.\n\nAt this point I remembered that I have some hydroxezine, which is a use as needed anti-histamine (like Benadryl) that temporarily causes drowsiness and reduces the physical symptoms of anxiety. \n\nI offered her some, saying it would calm her down. She asked if I was trying to poison her, and I told her that no, it would just calm her down, and that I take it every long once-in-awhile when I need it because I’m super anxious. I offered to show her the label of it if she wanted to make sure, but she said no.\n\nI ask if she wants any and she sort of mutters yes, so I go upstairs and get her some water and hydroxezine. \n\nThat was yesterday, \n\ntoday she texted me asking what I gave her because she was worried she was having a bad reaction. She said it doesn’t work with an anti anxiety med she was on, however I told her it does, as I am prescribed of them by my psychiatrist. Like any medication, combining it with other things can produce different reactions, however hydroxezine does not have any life-threatening reactions with medications. \n\nShe was worried it was the medication I gave her (I seriously don’t think it is, I or course have no way of knowing but her anxiety commonly makes her feel in poor physical health and I am on the same medication she is)\n\nHowever I realized that I potentially gave her a drug while she couldn’t consent, and even if my intentions were 100% to make her feel better or what ever is causing her to feel shitty, I think that might count as cunty behavior.

      "description": "AITA for not paying my friend’s parking ticket when I borrowed his car?\n \nThis happened about 3 years ago. One of my friends got drunk and hurt himself, so I decided to take him to urgent care to get patched up. I didn’t have a car, so I borrowed my other friend’s car to drive him. I took him to urgent care where his brother was waiting for him (we called him earlier), so I just dropped him off and drove back to campus.\n\nI drove back to the exact lot where the car was originally parked. I pulled into a spot and the spot ahead of me was vacant too, so I decided to pull through. I gave the keys back to my buddy and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nA couple of days later, my friend texted me saying he got a parking ticket and he expected me to pay it (full ticket was $70). I asked him how I got a ticket when I parked it in the same lot. Apparently his car only has a back license plate and no front one, so when the parking police came by to scan his car, there was no license plate to scan since I had pulled through.\nI asked him if he knew that he couldn’t pull through to the next spot, and he said that he had gotten a warning from the parking police earlier. He also told me that I should have checked if there was a front license plate when I parked and shouldn’t have pulled through a spot. I responded back saying that there is not a single person who checks license plates when they park, and everyone pulls through to the next spot if it’s open.\n\nSince I borrowed the car and parked it, I was clearly partially at fault. But I also told him that if he knew he has special parking requirements, he should have told me. I offered to pay half of the ticket ($35) but he demanded that I pay the full ticket myself ($70). At this point I kind of wanted to tell him to go screw himself and pay the whole thing himself.\n\nUltimately, after a ton of arguing, he realized I wasn’t going to pay the whole thing and I ended up paying him for half the ticket. However, the whole thing soured our friendship and we never really hung out any more after that.\n\nSo tell me Reddit, AITA?\n ",

      "description": "So this story is very long I’m sorry for that but it all comes together at least for me. So my aunt let’s call her A. So back in October we are informed she is going to marry a man from Nigeria. Someone we’ve never met, spoken to or heard of once. And she is going to his country to marry him. All of those just a month after her divorce and with two small kids ages nine and six. We get in contact with this guy let’s call him K. So we talk to K and it’s very suspicious to us, they met on Facebook, he lives in a dangerous part of the country and has never cared for a child before. We of course asked if he is ready to care for two children who have their own baggage and be responsible for them if he is going to be their dad. His response was “don’t worry Iv held a baby before.” This was our first interaction and over the next two months we tried to convince her not to get married and not to take our grandparents with her to this country as it is not safe and is listed as being dangerous by the state department.\n\nWhen she goes over she shouldn’t mention she was married before or that she has kids to his family or his community. This was as he put it “they might look down on me for this or think there is something wrong with her as a woman” but when we looked into this online and asked  two acquaintances who lived in the country for some years they said this was not true.\n\nWe offered to help him to reach a place closer to the US where we could all meet him and it would be safe. But he gave us multiple excuses including “they don’t like brown people there”! However eventually she agrees not to marry him the one week she is going to meet him for the first time and she won’t bring our grandparents. \n\nShe got back three weeks ago or so and she has an engagement ring and she seems excited. We’ve asked how he intends to get to the US with the immigration restrictions and she says once their married it will be a lot easier for him.  \n\nThe kids seem excited but I know the younger one doesn’t understand the impact of this and I think the older one can understand but not fully. \n\nShe plans now to go back and get married in early May. Iv talked to him over the phone and he seems nice. The kids like him. His background checks out and he seems excited to get married to her and vice versa. But it hasn’t even been a full year since she got divorced and I’m unhappy with how she choose to leave her kids to go marry a man she had only known a month. But I can’t help but feel I should be more supportive since they do seem to love each other. Am I the asshole? ",

I don't despise children, for what it's worth, I'd just rather not hang out with them.\n\nAs of yesterday, my sister has now given birth to her second kid a healthy baby boy and brother to a now two year old girl. My sister, her husband, and the rest of my family are all so happy and excited and I just couldn't care less. I feel no love for these kids. I don't hate them, I just don't care about them in the slightest.\n\nI didn't visit my sister in the hospital after she gave birth the first time, nor do I intend to now. She's at least two hours of driving away and it's just not worth it to me. She and I aren't exactly close. For the majority of my life she's been absent or actively dismissive so I don't really feel bad about this apathy.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So basically I (F22) have known this guy, lets say Bob for about 8 years now, and I have been best friends with him for about 5 years. Bob and this other guy were best friends until I came along. Basically the other guy manipulated me and used me and threatened me back when we were in high school...the whole package. For awhile Bob wasn't friends with this other guy because of what was going on between me and the other guy. Bob knows everything about this guy and the severity to which it has impacted my life (it has completely changed it). \n\nNow this guy came back into my life after some time when we were both in college, and he seems like he has actually changed for the better. He admitted to his incredibly shitty behavior and tried to talk through things with me. After all of us trying to be friends for over a year, I wasn't able to make the friendship work with the other guy. Sure, I no longer thought he was going to hit me or rape me, but I still had a hard time dealing with the other issues of our old friendship. I felt a lot of pressure though from Bob and other mutual friends for that matter; Bob's a really simple guy and for the past year he's seen the other guy be a really good friend/decent person to me, so Bob was having a hard time understanding why It's taking me so long to let everything go.\n\nWell things with the other guy weren't getting better, so for a lot of reasons I decided to stop being his friend. I also decided that it would cruel of me to ask Bob to stop being his friend, but I couldn't stand the thought that they would be talking about me behind my back...and honestly I couldn't stand the thought that maybe Bob would end up liking him more as a friend. It was really getting to me, so I told Bob everything and tried to explain to him why I felt it was necessary that I end my friendships with both of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths later I decided that I really missed Bob and even though I'm no longer the other guys friend I'm still suffering from it so there really was no point to me ending my friendships. Bob was always there for me and even though I really need to get this other guy out of my life maybe I could just ignore their friendship. \n\nIt turns out during those months while I was gone Bob felt as if I abandoned him. The other guy hated me because he also says I abandoned Bob, which hurt tremendously. Bob got ghosted by a girl he really liked and he says it was the hardest moment in his life.... but apparently he got another girlfriend and they are really happy together and his life is much better than the first part of those months when we weren't talking. After talking he said he finally understood my reasoning and no longer feels as if I abandoned him; he's still hurt, but he forgives me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been three months since we reconnected and I still cannot stand the fact that he's friends with the guy. I feel like knowing everything the guy did to me, he shouldn't want to be his friend, even if the guys a better person and if I kinda arranged for them to talk again when he came back into my life......But I can't stand it. It's causing me misery. On the other hand Bob got dumped by his gf and also lost his job very recently.....I don't want to hurt Bob, has he has always had my back, but I also want to try to keep improving my mental health...so WIBTA if I told Bob that instead of making the choice and just dropping him, he has to choose between me or that guy?",

      "description": "(my spelling is horrible, sorry for that) \n\nFuck, i gotta go back a lot,for context, like all the way back to middle schools first year \n(im now in the second year of vacational school).\n\nIn middle school i had few good friends that soon turned into kinda bullies we were all very toxic towards each other and i don't think it made any of us feel good but never talked to those people about it so no way of knowing for sure.\n\nThen at one point of the year home economics class mixes ours and neighboring class to like do home ec together. In my group theres a quiet kid from the neighboring we quickly \"click\" because of memes, games, anime and all that. We become friends play games together etc.\n\nAgain this changes into like a weird toxic friendship thing but it isn't as bad as the other ones maybe due to common interest, i don't really know why but we just clicked.\n\nNext two years we get to choose classes both me and my new friend take computer class so although in neighbouring classes so we actually chat a lot. We make other friends over the internet and play games with them\n\n(Sorry i feel like i got lost kn thoughs and started ranting ill try to pick it up)\n\nAnyway years go on we have good and bad times, i found out he tried to commit suicide multiple times before but i like to think that he got better when we started to hang out. Can't actually recall him saying it outloud but we we're there for eachother during bad times. Like onetime he just broke down at school about his depression and how therapy or meds dont help him at all. \n\nSo highschool starts we go to different schools, still talk and play games with out little group. Everything goes fine for a year.\n\nBut this autumn we're just chatting and playing games as usual with me him and one other friend from the online friend group. I can't remember what triggered him (if anything in particular) but he started to yell about \"wanting to break something\" in our native language so the other friend didn't understand, he thought it was a joke. Meanwhile im here and hear him start swearing and crying \"where's my box cutter\" he then proceeds to let out these awfull noices and saying something like \"ah fuck my wrist, thats a lot of blood\" followed by swears and crying. \n\nAt this point our foreign friend has realised this isnt a joke and has gone silent, i sit there frozen for s while until crabbing my phone and asking my friend \"do i need to call someone\" he just cries, i threaten him with \"calling 112\" i type in the number but can't actually bring myself to actually start the call (i don't know why i couldnt call, i think im just a coward). So i just ask \"are your parent home?\" he says they are, and i just let it be as he leaves his desk and probably goes to his parents. Me and the foreign friend just sat there stunned in silence some time after he came back and pretend to be totally fine. The next day we noticed he has blocked all of us, we we're worried but thought we couldn't really do anything.\n\nI felt bad because i failed him i thought all this time i had been helping him get better by being there for him but when it counted i just sat there like dumb ass doing nothing and assuming hed be fine. After that i was angry i felt like he betrayed me by blocking all communication like the bond we had meant nothign to him after all.\n\nAnd now, like a week a go he just randomly messages me and explains himself with \"he felt anxious and stressed about maintaining friendships.\" At the time i thought it was unfair against me, but now i while going through a depressive episode myself i totally get what he meant. (ironic right?)\n\nBut the point is, he tried to reconnect since cutting us of had just made him feel worse, he said he understood if we were angry and didn't wanna hear from him again. I told him i didn't hate him but didnt feel like talking to him.\n\nFirst i didn't know why, i thought i was just mad at him and he betrayed me. But in honesty i think it's because im a coward, too scared to be there for him, too scared to be responsible for him. I know it isn't my fucking job to look after someone, but i can't help but to feel guilty and like I've failed him again.\n\n(my spelling is ass and if this didn't make sense im sorry, i just felt like i needed to share this, sorry if this is the wrong place) \n\n\nTL:DR\nBest friend harms himself over a discord call while talking to me and then blocks me.\nMonths later tries to rekindle friendship but im too scared and refuse.

      "description": "I’ve had a lot of bad relationships and I’m still trying to figure out what healthy looks like. I’ve been single for a few years and recently started a relationship with a new guy. He’s been wonderful in so many ways. He has introduced me to his friends and coworkers, even his head boss, and is always happy to have me around. He cooks for me all the time and he’s really good at it! He says it’s something he enjoys doing and he loves to share it with me. We go out on dates and we can spend days cuddled up at home doing nothing special. He’s the first guy I’ve dated that has been truly invested in MY sexual satisfaction. He is a good guy with a huge heart. \n\n\nI try to show home my affection and appreciation by making him a priority in my life and doing things for him that I either don’t enjoy or are out of my way and inconvenient because I want to be there for him. If he’s sick I’ll offer, almost insist, on bringing him food or meds to help him feel better. We live about 45 minutes away from each other but I don’t even question the time or distance because I want to help him. I almost always drive to his place when we get together and he’s only stayed at mine a few times. He’s allergic to cats, and I have a long hair, so I understand. I always go the extra mile to clean the house, change the bedding, provide allergy meds, and even give the cat a bath before he comes over to reduce the allergens. I usually concede to watching what he wants on tv and going places he would enjoy when we go out. These are just a few examples. It’s because I care about his happiness and enjoyment. The sacrifice I make in my own happiness and enjoyment is lessened by seeing his. \n\n\nHe often says “you’re too good to me” and I love spoiling him as much as I can but when he asks if I feel the same way I can’t agree. We’ve talked about it briefly but I don’t think I adequately expressed how I feel because I didn’t want to be a nag or try to make him change who he is. \n\n\nI don’t feel like he goes out of his way for me. He doesn’t come to see me near my home, or pick me up for dates. He won’t usually spend time with me on work days. When deciding where to eat he won’t choose my favorite places.\n\n\nI’m sick right now, with the same symptoms he had last week when he was sick, and all I want is for him to bring me food and a Gatorade. Really, I just want home to OFFER to do this without me having to ask. It wouldn’t even be a question for me to do the same for him. Instead he took the opportunity to make plans to go out and drink with some friends. I’m upset because I want/expect hike to put in the same effort for me as I do for him. \n\n\n\nTL;DR I feel like I go out of my way for my boyfriend, who is genuinely a good guy, quite frequently but I don’t see him doing the same for me. I want him to show similar effort without me having to ask him to do it. ",

      "description": "Heres a little bit of background:\n\nFriend A is the roommate of my best friend, Friend B\n\nI am close with Friend A, but am slightly closer to Friend B.  \n\nFriend A is incredibly annoying at times. She can be demanding (ex. demanding that we go to lunch with her when we are trying to study for an upcoming exam)\n\nFriend B disliked having Friend A as a roommate and wanted her to move out. She wanted her to move out for good reasons though (not just because Friend A didn't want to deal with her extreme messiness), and wanted me to come up with a way. I don't think she would say it, but I think she wanted me to tell her to move out for her. \n\nThere is also a Friend C (who again, I'm closer to than Friend A) who very much so dislikes Friend A. She was openly saying a lot that she wanted Friend A to move out. \n\nI never wanted Friend A to move out, personally. More times than not, she was a great friend. \n\nSo with that said, here's what happened:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriend A had nearly flunked the previous semester, only getting through via the laborious process of a medical leave. Coming into this next semester, she was suddenly aware that she struggled as a barely full-time student last semester, so there was no way she was going to make it though this semester unless she got disability paper work (which she easily could have gotten). I work a lot with stuff like this through my work study job, so I was helping Friend A pretty much through all of her paperwork and finding the right people to talk to. \n\nHowever, after about a week, she hadn't done the things she needed to do in order to take less than the mandatory credit limit, and she would be kicked out soon if she didn't figure something out. I asked her about it, and she revealed that she had an exam coming up for a job. She has a job as a type of technician, and she needed to take a sort of \"final exam\" which would let her make a comfortable salary instead of her standard hourly wage. On the other hand, the degree she is pursuing at the college is really her passion. Even though she loves her job, and is good at it, her degree is where she wants to end up. \n\nShe ends up taking me to dinner so we can talk about all of this, and during dinner she's texting one of her friends asking him what to do. \n\nI'm going to level with you. I don't know in this moment what my motive was. I don't know whether I wanted to help Friend A figure out her life, help Friend B get rid of her annoying roommate, help Friend C, or help me not be annoyed. I don't know. I really want to say that I genuinely wanted to help her figure out her life, since she's my friend and I care about her, but I think it's pretty human to have other motives. \n\nAnyway, in that moment, I told her that maybe she should consider dropping out for the semester (and therefore the summer), figure out if she wanted to continue in her degree, and then decide in the fall if she wanted to continue. I mean, she was texting other friends so clearly she won't just take my word for it and-\n\nShe does. She responds \"Yeah...I think you're right.\" She sits back, looks really content with that answer. Like genuinely happy. The next day...she moved out. \n\nMy mistake was that I tend to overestimate her tenacity. \n\nI know that when she's here with us, I have to convince her just to wake up and go to class, so it just now occurred to me that she probably won't be back since she might just settle into her new salaried job, and never build up the courage or energy to reapply. I feel terrible, especially since my response might have been influenced by several bad motives. I think mainly I was trying to help her out, but I spoke thinking that she would ask her other friends too instead of just taking my word. \n\nI wish I could just take it back, but I also feel like her response showed that she needed/wanted to hear what I said. \n\ntldr; Several of my friends dislike Friend A for a variety of reasons, and I have my issues with her. I knew these reasons, so when Friend A revealed that she was considering leaving college. I encouraged her to drop out for the semester, but it may have been influenced by aforementioned reasons. She seemed happy with the idea. She took my advice and dropped out, but I don't think she'll be coming back. I might have inadvertently convinced her to drop out of school altogether instead of just for the semester, and I feel guilty about it. ",

      "description": "So, my long distance girlfriend came to the state to visit me and after a few days in the city, we drove out to visit my parents. Here, my dad told us that mum was at the doctor's right now for bloodwork, which I thought was odd as she just had some done and when I asked if she was okay, he sort of immediately caved, telling me that my mom had been diagnosed with stage 2 thyroid cancer and that my mother was planning on waiting to tell me until after my girlfriend left.\n\nMy mom comes home and bursts through the door telling us she wasn't going to tell us (my girlfriend and I) and spoil our time to which we both assured her that was ridiculous. We both assumed my mom, who by all accounts is a private person, was dealing with the emotional labor of this illness and having to tell her loved ones. As we sat down for dinner though, it quickly became apparent that not only did the family know, but most of our family friends and even the neighbors (who my parents treat as a joke) knew. \n\nA little more backstory, this is not the first time my family has dealt with major illness. Through most of 2016 we successfully beat my dad's stage 4 thyroid cancer into remission. ",

I have severe MH issues so signed off and he hasn't been able to get a job in over a year.\n\nHe does manage to get a few days cash in hand a monthv, which has always gone to Food and household bills.\n\nThis month I put my foot down on everything. We drew up a budget of the benefits money, I did a big online shop so that we have food and ensure all the necessary bills are paid for.\n\nSo bf had a days work yesterday and is with family atm doing 2 more days work.\n\nA few days ago he showed me a set of wing mirrors on FB. I said we didn't have the money for it now. He agreed and I thought that was the end of it until I got a message from him earlier saying he'd bought them.\n\nNow the MAF sensor is dead and needs replacing, that's about £50. The wing mirrors are purely cosmetic. Although one has lost the cover and has a sharp bit which is technically illegal however it can temporarily be fixed with some ductape. But both mirrors are perfectly usable.\n\nPersonally I think the MAF sensor is the better spend but I'm no car expert.\n\nHis justification for spending the money is that he earnt it and its not part of our monthly budget.\n\nThere are also so many other things that we've dropped off the budget because they are 'luxuries'.\n\nAm I the asshole for being so upset that he went behind my back? We live together so shouldnt money be a joint decision even if he did earn it?",

      "title": "AITA for being annoyed by having to train my new coworker?",
      "description": "I work at a very large engineering company writing and testing software.  There are some big projects with very high visibility among management that I have been working on for about two years, and these projects admittedly have a very high learning curve, so it takes about 6 months before someone that is new really knows what they are doing.\n\nWhen I was brand new on my first big project, management paired me with a few senior engineers so I would have all the help I needed, and I was given multiple small tasks to work on so I could familiarize myself with the system and software architecture.  By the time I started on the second project (this current one), I'm much more proficient and many higher-ups are the ones asking me questions.\n\nThat being said, my project is terribly understaffed and I am doing basically all the software development for this project (which is why I have had to learn quickly).  In an effort to alleviate my workload, management brought in a new college hire James about a month ago.  He has been with the company for about a year and this is his first big project, so he was still essentially brand new.\n\nMy project manager just kind of dumped James on me and said \"find things for him to do\".  I understand that I am probably a good person to train a new hire because I was just new myself and I know how overwhelming it can be, so I let him shadow me and see the procedures I go through on a daily basis as well as gave him some very small tasks and vague stuff like reading through the code and trying to understand it.\n\nI quickly noticed that he is extremely, extremely softspoken and painfully shy, so even when he does talk it is so quiet I can't understand what he's saying. I need him to repeat at least three times.  Because of that, he doesn't ask many questions and spends our sessions just like \"ok .... ok .... ok\".  Even when he does have a question it shows that he's not really listening because it doesn't quite make sense.  An analogy is that I could be explaining how the toaster is broken and he might say \"Does it have anything to do with the oven?\" and I'm like \"what? no\".\n\nThen I assign him a task and he just sits next to me watching me, despite having a new task.  It really feels like he is not taking the initiative to learn or try to complete his tasks, but at the same time I think he might just be confused and unprepared if I unknowingly suck at training.\n\nOur work lets us make our own hours (9/80 schedule) so I get to our software lab at about 7am and work until lunch.  He gets there around 10:30am every day (which is fine as long as he stays later). Whenever I finish my work and get up to leave, whether it is at 10:31am or noon, he leaves with me, so I don't think he works when I'm not there.  It's annoyingly clingy.\n\nWe have weekly status meetings and when it's his turn just to give a quick blurb of what he's been doing, he always just says \"I'm still shadowing eggdunk\".  Then our managers kind of come down on me like \"come on you need to give him better things to do, he must be so bored\" and I don't want to just sell him out because I did give him things to do, he just doesn't do them and continues to watch me every day even though it doesn't help.\n\nI send daily status emails to the project manager on my work, and also include a line of \"Today I assigned James to [do task]\".  When the manager asks him how it is going, he goes \"yeah I'm still working on it\".\n\nThe other day he actually asked me for more work and I reiterated the list of things I already asked him to do.\n\nIt's been about two months now, but he basically still acts the same as he did on the first day.  The daily routine is simply that he arrives at 10:30, watches me, leaves when I leave, and then I work in a different area so I don't see him in the afternoon, but I can't imagine that he's doing work.\n\nIt's slowing me down a bit because it's distracting and when he does complete a task I need to double check it, and also his ever-shadowing presence just annoys me.\n\nMy mentors were very patient with me and answered any questions I had and helped fix things that I broke, but I felt like I put in a lot of effort, and James is not.",

      "description": " I've worked at this same factory for just under 30 years, which gives you an idea as to why I feel confused as well as how old I am.  \n\n\nI was hired to be a security guard of sorts. As far as I knew, my job was to make sure shipments were being transported out of the facility, that nothing left the premise without thoroughly being processed by all necessary departments, and that nothing got in the building that could potentially cause issues, though the last part isn't a job solely done by me.  \n\n\nWithin the past year or so I've been having very large packages show up at my end of the building, though this is not in my job description to handle. At first I enjoyed the feel as well as the extra work it gave me, but recently it's been happening all too regularly, which halts and creates issues for the jobs I NEED to get done. It's painful processing these packages when there's so much I need to export daily.  \n\n\nI tried speaking to the department that takes in all our merchandise/materials, and he said he's being delivered the same packages, but doesn't mind as it's basically what he was hired to do.  \n\n\nI brought this up to the head of the company, which was apparently a big mistake for a couple of reasons. The first being that communication is somewhat indirect. The second reason was that the head of the department feels that this is an enjoyable new experience for the company, and though it might create issues for me, the head guy really loves what improvements it has made. Needless to say, this has caused some major conflict with me and the boss.   \n\n\nAITA for refusing to do extra work that is not in my job description solely for my manager's benefit? ",

      "description": "So this happened a while back.. me and 4 other friends have a group chat. Two of the people in the group chat used to be friends but stopped being friends after he got roasted in the group chat. Let’s call them friend 1 and friend 2. \n\nSo some background friend 1 has a tendency to joke around with us not taking too much seriously and friend 2 takes things very seriously to a point that we can’t joke around with him that much without him getting triggered. The 2 other friends and I decided that we were not gonna make any jokes at his expense but friend 1 decided not to do that. \n\nHe knows that friend 2 gets triggered very easily so he goes in on a tirade of making jokes at his expense. Tbh the jokes were pretty dumb but as we predicted friend 2 got really triggered to the point of leaving the group chat and blocking friend 1 on every social media. \n\nSo a couple of weeks go by and me and friend 1 are sitting at a fast food place eating. I get up to go to the bathroom and leave my phone on the table. Friend 1 decides to grab my phone and call friend 2 to try to mess with him some more. (Me and friend 2 are still friends at this point.) I come back from the bathroom and friend 1 tells me what he did. I start to get a parade of texts from friend 2 insulting me and calling me irresponsible and that I have not respect for myself by letting friend 1 use my phone. I tell him that It wasn’t my fault I was in the bathroom but at this point friend 2 was really triggered. He told me that he had enough and that I needed to do something about friend 1. At this point I was also pretty angry with both friend 1 and friend 2 for trying to involve me in their dumb beef. So I told the I’m not picking any sides and both of them needed to deal with their own problems. Friend 1 was fine with that but friend 2 was not. He continued insulting me on text so I decided to just block him for the day.\n\nSo AITA here? There’s a lot of history and detail with both of the friend’s beef that would make this post really long... it honestly gets pretty awkward sometimes so I never take either of their sides.\n\n",

      "description": "(16M) \nI love my mum, she's raised me all by herself since my parents divorced 10 years ago. She has provided everything for me and I will always be grateful for that. However she is also extremely stubborn about heaps of things, and video games is one of them.\n\nGrowing up I was never allowed to touch video games whatsoever, because in her mind playing them is equivalent to injecting heroin. I'm obviously annoyed by this however I don't blame her: one of our relatives kids (8 years older than me) was SEVERELY addicted to them and she's always used him as an argument to why they're bad. Growing up I've only been able to play games over at friends' places without her knowing.\n\nAfter I started working a part time job, I started to save up money and about six months ago I bought myself a PS4 and a small monitor screen to hide in my bedroom with the money I had saved. This was all behind her back because I knew she wouldn't have allowed it. I've been playing games on it frequently in my spare time and it has never impacted me negatively because I would only use it after ALL my studying/housework (she cares A LOT about my grades) has been done. Playing games is something I would only do in my free time.\n\nLast week she found out about it while looking for something in my room while I was at school. She confiscated it straight away. When I found out I knew that I was in the wrong (I went behind her back) but I still wanted the PS4 back. I tried explaining to her that her concerns about video games ruining my life were wrong because since I bought the PS4 I've always done my chores when asked and my grades have only improved, I am ranked in the top 10 in all my subjects at school, which she's happy about (my grades improving was of course was due to me studying harder as I actually want to get into a good university, not due to the PS4). I feel like I've proven to her that I do have self control and she could stop worrying. Plus her never even noticing just proves the point that it hasn't effected me.\n\nHowever she has set her mind about confiscating it and said that she would not give it back until I finish highschool. She provided no other argument apart from mentioning that relative of ours again... Because of this I've been angry at her all week as I feel that it's unfair for her to take something that I have bought with my own money.\n\nI know that she provides for me and everything - I don't pay rent or for groceries because she doesn't need it. Also every single cent of my money was earned from working as she doesn't believe in Christmas/birthday gifts. I admit that I did lose my temper and yell after trying to have a logical discussion which she dismissed with pretty much \"I said so\". \n\nso AITA for being mad at my mum?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "For the past 3 years I have been trying to plan a trip to Ireland. It is a place that I have always wanted to go and now just seems like the right time in our life to do it. We can financially afford it, we both have jobs that are very easy to work with when it comes to time off, and we don't have kids. We are about as free as we can be.\n\nBut every time I try and plan it she is very noncommittal, and if I set hard dates she ends up cancelling them, and it just never seems to work out. Over these 3 years we have still been able to travel, we have done a trip to Mexico, Florida, and Hawaii, as well as other small weekend getaways. But she can never seem to make this trip work, even though she knows it is the #1 place I want to visit. It has gotten to the point where it seems like she has zero intentions on going and is just dragging me along instead of just telling me she doesn't want to go.\n\nSo over the weekend I gave her an ultimatum. I told her that on February 1st I was going to buy 2 tickets for April 11th to the 18th. I told her if she agreed to go by that date the second ticket would obviously go to her and we would go have a great time. If she didn't then I was still going to buy the tickets but the second ticket would be for my friend Sarah (My oldest and on of my closest friends. Not related to the story but something I still find entertaining, she wore a full suit and was a groomsman at my wedding).\n\nI need to stress that this isn't some jealousy tactic by having another women be my backup person. My wife has never been jealous of her and we will usually go to the mountains to snowboard a few times a year. And since my wife HATES the cold it will just be the 2 of us sharing a room for the weekend and my wife has never had an issue with this. Plus I technically owe Sarah a trip to Ireland from a high school bet that stated the first one to get married had to take the other to Ireland. (A bet that my wife knew about but nobody really took seriously).\n\nSo to me this it is simple. It is somewhere I have always wanted to go, I would love it if you went with me. But you backing out won't stop me from going anymore.",

      "description": "Background that I think is relevant (It may seem out there but please bear with me): A few years back I made a friend online in a MMORPG who has become one of my best friends. I'm the first to admit that both of us are odd and insecure and the relationship is not always the healthiest. It's been all but explicitly said that he's in love with me and he knows these feelings are not reciprocated. He still wants us to meet and I have no intention of doing so. We communicate mainly through texting and in-game chat because I don't like talking on the phone (that's another story). We talk about our daily lives and know details about each other's families so we are good friends at this point and I do care about him as a friend. Just to give an idea of the relationship. \n\nThis friend is often a bit needy and sometimes gets upset if we don't do anything together online on a given day. But our schedules don't always overlap and I'm getting frustrated that he complains without trying harder. I get online more in the morning because of health problems and typically cannot get on at night because my parents come home and I lose the tv. However he deals with insomnia and is often up very late into the night and sleeps past noon or sometimes even later or doesn't fall asleep until 8 am. His sleep schedule is very erratic and I usually have an idea of how his night went by how long ago he signed out since he often plays when he can't sleep. \n\nHonestly if he wants to sleep late, power to him and I'm okay with that. But then he complains that we didn't get to do much or anything together when I'm not feeling well and log out at 1 or 2 pm. I've suggested he set alarms for himself to get up earlier if he's so bothered but these suggestions just seem to not register with him and he doesn't comment on it at all. I admit I don't have a ton of experience with insomnia. I sometimes have issues falling asleep and am up kind of late, but nothing that compares to him. About once a year I'm inexplicably up all night and I know those are not my best moments (I get kind of weepy like \"I just wanna sleeeeeeep why can't I sleeeeeep\") so I understand that sleep deprived is not the most reasonable state to be and I'm trying super hard not to pass any judgement or be unreasonable with him.\n\nSo AITA for wanting him to set alarms for himself (or something, just TRY something) or stop complaining? I feel like he has more control over this than he thinks and I'm getting frustrated at the passive aggressive comments when our play time doesn't overlap.",

      "description": "Long story short, my mom is a good woman who cares about others, but has made some poor decisions in her life, affecting herself and her children. She had a childhood of sexual abuse and neglect, no real family, and my dad cheated on her multiple times. She eventually left him, taking me and my siblings with her. A few years later, she is introduced to drugs and became addicted. Ultimately, we were seriously neglected for four years of our childhood. She went to prison. \n\nShe got out when I was a teenager, was sober and held down a respectable, yet low paying job, for 10 years or so. She met a man who was an alcoholic an bipolar, and he killed himself a year after they married. Since then, which was about 4 years ago or so, she inherited a sizable amount of money, but has no financial management skills, and that money was quickly spent. Although, she did buy me a car when I graduated and did other charitable things with it. \n\nFast forward to the last year, she has become a full-fledged alcoholic, lost her stable job due to drinking at work, and has spiraled downward. She planned on committing suicide (had an active plan) and was committed to the psychiatric hospital. Since she got out a year ago, I have been emotionally invested and supportive. I have helped her search for jobs, helped her financially (small amounts), and have encouraged her. Well a month ago, she was fired from yet another job for drinking, was arrested for public intoxication at this job, and has become suicidal again. She’s currently in the psyc hospital, and had a heart attack while in there. Also, she has lost her car to a title loan and has been evicted from her apartment. \n\nShe has a sister she is still close with, and a half sister who has recently came into her life. Otherwise, I am the only real support she has. My siblings aren’t as close with her, and receive updates through me, generally. Her sister said she wants me to call her, but I’m just spent. I feel like I have grieved her death in the last month. \n\nAITA if I completely cut off contact with her? I can’t watch her die slowly like this, it is affecting my well being. However, I’m afraid I need to be there for her, and that I will regret cutting her out of my life when she does actually die. She can’t live with me, I can’t support her financially, she isn’t always compliant with her medications, and doesn’t seek out the free. medical and psychological care I have sought out for her. Any suggestions on the least assholeish way that I can balance my own mental health with hers? \n\nAlso, please do not insult her or needlessly put her down. She truly is a good person, but has trauma she’s never dealt with and is mentally ill. You would love her if you met her, maybe less so if you were her actual child, so please be respectful. \n\nThanks. ",

      "description": "About three years ago me, my mum and my brother escaped a toxic relationship my mum had with her boyfriend (let's call him Scrooge). I was seventeen at the time and in my last year of high school.\n\nThe first problem started with the moving. I wasn't told that mum and Scrooge had problems. All the sudden one night I'm told that next week we'd start packing and the moving started right away.\n\n This was only slightly before my high school finals and I was in shock about it. The new house turned out to need a lot of work (and fixing is still going on) but I was told I would get a bigger room, so I didn't mind. I was just trying to not be a burden. Everyone's irritation with the moving process was pointed at eachother including me, while I didn't do anything but study and keep quite. \n\nThe second disappointment was that the room I was promised wouldn't come. Mum wanted to turn it into her therapy room and I was told to accept this, since she had gone through a lot. I was ok with it, she needed it for her side business, but the lack of agency I had in anything pained me. The room I have now is so small I can touch the walls standing in the middle without moving.\n\nThen there were the dogs we had to leave at Scrooge, while he can't even take care of a pet rock. Three lovely Caucasian shepards. It hurts me deeply still and the German shepard we could keep is too big for this house. He's suffering from it. \n\nThat year felt wrong, but I hoped that after the moving was done, things would be better.  I also blame the moving for me failing my finals that year and having to redo it, but I'm not sure if that is fair.\n\nThe next year, I'm eightteen. My brother changed,  barking commands at me and my mother, being grumpy all the time and being let in on financial struggles while I'm kept in the dark about everything, I'm not comfortable with this change in my brother, he wasn't like that and I hate that he has taken on the behaviour I hated in Scrooge and my dad. \n\nMy mum meanwhile has changed too, being grumpy and complaining, shouting and grunting when angry at anything, slamming with doors while making passive-agressive comments about how hard she has it whenever I mentioned I struggled with something. Nowadays I won't even open up to things to her anymore. \n\nCurrently it's two days before my nineteenth birthday and I'm in my first year of law school. I cannot speak my mind to my mother or share details about my classes, my brother gets pissed off and yells about it.  I straight up don't feel like this is my home. It never was and I long to go back to three years ago. Even if it includes Scrooge. But I feel selfish for wanting that. Yet I feel angry for feeling selfish. I never asked for this, I was dragged in against my will and it worstened our homelife and the relationship between us three. \n\nAITA for wanting my old home life back, if my mother tried so desperately to escape that?

      "description": "Last night, I (f17) was hanging out with some of my best friends (let's call them guy A, B, and C). The four of us were driving around the neighborhood while jamming to music, which was really chill. Afterward, we decided to call it a night, so we were heading to my apt since I wanted to be dropped off first. When we were in front of my apt, I asked them if they wanted to come in and watch something together. It got quiet for a moment, and B said he was tired, so he would rather get dropped off right after. A was the one driving, so he agreed to leave with B. However, C was down to hang for a little, so C and I went into the apt...just the 2 of us. After we got in, I turned on the TV, watched a little bit of Netflix, and realized that it was getting quite awkward, at least for me. (Nothing happened, both of us were just watching TV). I told C that I needed to charge my phone and I went into my room, stayed there for about 10-20 min. The entire time I was trying to figure out if I was overreacting or this was really inappropriate (I have a boyfriend). All of them are really close friends with me and my boyfriend, but I just wasn't used to hanging out with someone other than my bf alone for a long time. Am I making it a big deal and it's not?

      "description": "Sorry, long post on mobile please be kind\n\n\nSo I had a year of awful luck where I made poor financial decisions and ran out of money right after 19. I didn't want to move back in with my parents but my grandparents, G &amp; D, were getting older and offered me housing for keeping up with chores around the house\n\nG &amp; D were already disabled when I moved in but over time their health has degraded dirasticly. G has had to retire because of his fatigue and pain while D can no longer walk safely without any assistance. Both need full time nursing care but refuse to admit it\n\nBecause both are bored they've gotten nitpicky and unpleasant. G calls my cat rude names, D hovers over my chores to make sure I'm doing them right\n\nAfter about 5 trips to the hospital and 8ish surgeries in 2 years Im tired. I've had a weekend away from the house maybe 7 or 8 times since moving in\n\nAfter a lot of tears and arguing we came to and agreement on the chores that needed to be done for me to stay. This was because they said I was too mopey and unhappy to stay there. G also screamed a full day at me for \"implying\" he was older because I didn't think he should change light fixtures himself (this was also right after I started going to school again, &amp; quit my job because of my own health problems). So I fought to stay there hoping I could finish my degree before getting the hell out of there\n\nWell last week D asked if I can clean the kitchen on my off day, she'll give me $40. I said I felt bad but sure, &amp; got to work. When I was finished I got my bf's take out from the dinner we missed the night before &amp; drove over to give it too him\n\n10 minutes after I get there D blows up my phone. She starts accusing me of sneaking out (Even though I told G where I was going) That I was stupid and an idiot for not mopping the floor of the kitchen. I didn't want to start anything so I left quickly to go home\n\nWhen I got home I was accused of throwing out a cheese grater, &amp; when I tried to get into the kitchen to clean D starts screaming at me. Mostly about how I need to do what I'm told &amp; how I didn't clean the range well enough for her liking\n\nI am sorry to say that I lost it. I told her to 'f off, she dosent have to pay me, I'm going upstairs\n\nD starts screaming about how I will come back and finish cleaning her kitchen. Then tells me to have bf come pick me up because I'm no longer welcome in their house\n\nSo right now I'm sleeping on a different relatives couch while I finish up school. After talking it over with my parents and other grandmother everyone agrees that I need to apologize for my language towards D. And that D &amp; G are afraid the family will break up because of this\n\nI don't want to apologize, I don't want to be the bigger person, I never want to talk to them again. I've already started to process of moving out but I openly ignore D and G everytime I go back for more stuff. So am I the asshole here?",

They were singing \"praise God, praise God\" at the top of their lungs to whatever tune the guy was playing on the piano. For some reason, as I walked by, I became irrationally angry at this. I kept thinking \"get your praise God BS out of this secular university hospital!!\" I'm annoyed again just thinking about it.

      "description": "TL;DR: I've had a chair in my room for 3 years that I own 33% of, my sister owns another 33% of the chair and wants it in her room. I refused.\n\nI want to start this off by acknowledging that this is petty. Accept it and move one.\n\nSo, when we were young, my brother sister and I shared a computer, with a desk and chair to use with it. Over time, the computer broke and us siblings bought our own laptops/computers/tablets/whatever, so the desk and chair went unused for just over a year. I have had the chair for 3 years in my room, and I constantly use it with my own desk.\n\nMy sister recently took the old desk into her room and wants to take the chair with it. I made an offer that she takes it today (the 17th) and on Saturday (the 19th) we go to a local thrift store and buy a new chair. I can't go buy a chair myself because I can't drive, my sister does. She isn't available to go buy one on my Saturday schedule, so I offered to give her the money and go get one herself. She refused because she isn't available at all during the store hours (I call bullshit but can't prove it). She will not go get a new chair on Saturday, so I told her that I wouldn't give her the chair in my room and she stormed off all upset. \n\nThere's two sides to this.\n\nI have had the chair for 3 years, the previous year it was unused by anyone. So within the last 4 years, I've been the only one to use the chair. My sister's only argument for why she should get the chair is that it's not mine, I replied by telling that it's not hers either. I made a fair offer to give her the chair for a few days until we get a new one. I don't want to wait till the next Saturday (the next day we're both able to go to the store) because she probably won't be able to go then either (just a hunch, but I am very busy on Saturdays, I could only go in the morning). I also fear that if I give an inch, she takes a mile, she says it'll be for a while, but if I give her the chair, I'll never see it again. She's not reliable on promises like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe chair isn't technically mine, I'm just the only one using it and the only one who needed it until now. She technically has 33% claim on the chair. The chair was bought originally to go with the desk that's now in her room. She might have better use of the chair (I use it for gaming mostly), so she might be doing something with the chair/desk that's important, like work or something.\n\nIt's not exactly mine, but it's not exactly mine, so who's in the right here? Who should get the chair?",

      "description": "So, last night to celebrate new years me and my wife decided to go to a fairly fancy restaurant nearby. The place was packed and you needed to make reservations to just get in. When we got in we were seated and things were going well, until another family was sat next to us. It was a mother, father, and 3 children. Immediately we both knew there was going to be an issue. While the restaurant was busy and a little noisy it was nowhere near the level the three children were at. \n\nOne of the children was obviously special needs and was having outburst every few minutes while the other two were making quite a bit of noise. At first I decided to put up with it, but eventually I lost my cool when the special needs child started to scream and threw crayons they brought with them around (one of them landed on our table). \n\nI got up and asked (I though I asked kindly, but my wife says I came off a bit harsh) for them to get control of their children and to conciser the people around them. They apologized for everything and began trying to get everything under control. \n\nThis is where the second problem comes in, to keep their children entertained they pulled out a tablet and began playing videos on it, at full volume with no headphones. I got up again and told them to \"turn the damn thing off\" or get them headphones. I could tell they were both embarrassed and they apologized again but said that they could not get headphones due to their special needs son (they specifically called him this so I know I was not just guessing) being uncomfortable with it but said they wouldn't be able to turn it off.\n\nAt this point I stormed off to get the manager. When I got there I demanded a new table away from the other family. The restaurant was packed so this wasn't an option so the manager brought me with him and asked the other family to leave. The mother looked like she was about to cry and the father grabbed his kids and stormed off. \n\nMy wife would not talk to me the rest of the night and at home told me that I was wrong for how I acted. Honestly though I don't feel bad at all. The restaurant is pretty expensive and we only go there once or twice a year so I believe that I was within my right to want to enjoy a meal I play for without hearing kids screaming or a tabled blaring. Am I wrong?",

      "description": "Bit of background. I've known this girl for 10+ years now and she is married to my cousin. We were friends at school even though she is a shitty person to be around. I'll call her B from here forward. \n\nOk so last year my gran passed away. She was just old and sickly. It happens. I'm just glad she's not miserable anymore. \nI wasn't all that close with her or any of that side of the family because they're pretty much all choosing beggars and entitled pricks. But she was still my gran so. \nAnyway B posted details of my grans funeral on social media HOURS after she'd passed away. This was before my dad even knew properly what had happened. I saw it and was pretty livid. \nShe then proceeded to mail me the next morning to ask if I knew my gran had died. Well if I hadn't, your post would certainly have informed me darling. She then complained that she hadn't been the first to find out about it. I stopped replying to her at this point.\n\nFast forward a few days and B messages again. This time asking if I knew details of the funeral. I hadn't actually been told officially because her original post was premature and there were several versions of events I'd heard about. \nI said no. I didn't definately know anything. \nB \" Oh WE weren't told until yesterday either\"\nLies\nSo she goes on to relay the details to me and goes on to moan about how she isn't allowed in the main car for the funeral and has to make her own way there. (My cousin drives so I don't see the issue)\nAt this point I am making an ugly face at the screen. \nI tell her that it's only fair that only my dad and his 3 siblings get the main car and once she realised I wasn't on her side, she didn't reply.\n\nDay of the funeral and she shows up halfway through the ceremony dressed like a whore. She needed her own entrance clearly.\n\nSorry it's taken a while to get to my main point but it was relevant.\n\nOnce my grans house was getting cleared out the handing out of possessions began (she didn't have a will or anything ) \nThis utter ",

      "description": "First of all, any mistakes in English - sorry, not my primary language.\n\nSo I'm dating a guy for 4 months now, we went to his friend birthday party (pub, table reserved). For the fking whole party, he was talking to his friends (doesn't seen them at all through 2 months, studies, work, etc.). They met me twice, they like me I guess. But they have their own topics to discuss, so there were little groups on this party, everyone was enjoying it. Not me, I felt badly alone. But it's ok, I hope my bf enjoys it. There is one guy, I know him, he is very sweet, very lovely if I can say so? You know, type of guy that avoid fights, arguments. He got drunk. Everyone likes him, let's call him Crush.\n\nThere was a couple, I don't even know them but I know that they are studying together with my boyfriends friends group. Let's call the male aggressor. So Crush, drunk, sits next to friends talking about sth. Then suddenly, aggressor gets up, approached Crush and punch in the face! I became alerted, felt very very uncomfortable. Blood on the floor, blood on his shirt. I ran to bartender for ice, quickly ran into Crush gave him the ice, tried to take care of him. AFAIK, aggressors girlfriend told him, that Crush touched her thigh while talking to her. In my country, it's a common thing, you just touch somebody sometimes, especially when you are drunk, and it is quite ok, and while Crush is doing it, you just know that he is trying to be nice, and that's all. Everyone knows that Crush is just being very nice and talkative. So all the drama started. I went out for a cigarette, then heard aggressors talk with friends, like: \"She said he touched her! It was like this, wasn't it honey?\" The girl was just sitting, with her hood on, face hidden in jacket and said nothing. I was standing there, tried to listen to some drama (mind you, I like dramas), and then other girl approached aggressor and told him: \"Oh, you know. I would not blame Crush. It's the guy in colored t-shirt who is an idiot, he told someone that your girl is a whore and destroyed a party because of this.\" So aggressor takes away and try to get another fight. Then I reacted. With serious threat, that if he is going to touch anyone, I am going to make his life a lovely nightmare. Then went to my boyfriend, and told him about all of this. He said: Why, why did you ever react? I mean, no one cares about it, this just sometimes happen and that's all? Don't try to involve yourself into this, they are friends.\n\nI thought, ok these are not actually my friends. But I felt really, really uncomfortable and badly, I really don't like situations like this, I just said: \n\n\\- Do you really thing it is normal?\n\n\\- Yeah, shit happens. Why you even care? I mean, look: no one cares about it, stop overreacting. \n\nAnd that was enough. Seriously people? You are all like 24-26 yo and behave like.. this?\n\n\\- Well because I'm here with you.. Baby, I wanna go home, I am not angry at you (these are his friends, not mine, so feel free to spend time with them, but don't make me stay here), if you want to, you can stay, but I'm leaving right now. I don't feel well, I don't feel uncomfortable, I don't feel good in mental way, I don't like those kind of situations on parties.\n\n\\- Yeah go on, do whatever you want. Just go home, it's ok. (said that with mean tone)\n\nI got Uber, and went back home. Come to think of it, maybe I should not involve myself in this, threatening to aggressor, but I just could not resist of seeing an aggressor, talking shits without even asking Crush if that situation had happened and why etc. , and trying to get into another fight. And it was the first time I have ever witnessed this kind of situation - my friends prefers, cafe, restaurants and quiet places with no alcohol..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: Me and my boyfriend are both gays, so don't laugh at me threatening aggressor. Ppl usually get scared. :D",

      "description": "**Obligatory apology for formatting.**\nNow I’ve never said anything to her face as i try to be respectful as she is my sister, but my family says that i take and hold grudges too seriously. Time for some back story;\n\n   Ever since i learned about politics (around age 6) i always wanted to keep up, i also love debates as you get to see opposing views and hear opposing arguments. Now ever since i was young, i was always more of a republican/ conservative while the rest of my family is profoundly liberal.Now i am always respectful with my debates and my inclusion of opinion during political settings, i never try and push a belief, or an opinion, but base most of my debates off fact.\n\n **Now onto the juicy bits: (keep in mind this is the best example but she has resorted to this quite often)**\n\nMy oldest sister is well, least to say, stubborn. She can never accept when she is wrong, or when facts that can be backed by evidence back an opposition. These are the type people i dislike, About a couple months ago she brought up the topic of the “pink tax” and how it was sexist, and she wanted our views on it. I said plainly that it doesn’t exist, and she was livid.\n\n          She tried to say that why should a Gillette razor for women be more expensive, just because its pink and more feminine. My retort “Well, buy the mens razor then? Surely if they are the same product you dont need the pink feminine razor.” This upset her and i tried to end the conversation, but she kept at it, so I defended my view, which made her progressively angrier. Apparently she couldnt grasp the concept that companies will charge more for certain aesthetically pleasing things, as they will make more of a profit\n\nWell in the end when the others discussing the topics agreed with me she got really defensive, and went for an attack on credibility.\n\nShe vigorously and snidely announced: “**My Name** YOUR A TEENAGER, ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS ARGUE AND DISAGREE, YOU PROBABLY DONT EVEN HAVE EXPERIENCE BUYING HALF OF THESE PRODUCTS.” \n\nTLDR: AITA if I am open with the fact that i dislike my sister as she is never willing to have a civilized discussion with me, without resulting to insults, or insulting my credibility on the subject. Even if i still respect her, and am never intentionally mean to her. Now i am still quite mad about the mentioned incident as it happened during a big family dinner. \n\n\n\n\n",

We also seem seem to always be the ones having to move out of the way, often times walking in the street or grass because people walking the other way walk so spread out and just don’t acknowledge the fact that they aren’t the only people in the world and don’t respect other people’s personal space. \n\nWe experience this everywhere, from the streets to the metro stations, including when people stand on both sides of the escalators when it’s just a social norm to move to the right to let people walk up if they choose.\n\nSo I’ve decided to refuse to move out of everyone else’s way and start shoulder checking people that walk to close and just expect me to move for them. \n\nWhy should I constantly be the one going out of my way to be considerate to those that choose not to acknowledge themselves being, what I feel, is inconsiderate and disrespectful to other people and their personal space?",

A major thing we’ve bonded over has been our shared love of dark jokes and typically throughout the day we are whispering funny things we think of to each other. The other day while going clothes shopping, she showed me a picture of her and her dog and I made a comment about how this looks very similar to the beginning of my favorite porn video. She responded by jokingly saying that a dog and a person engaging in coitus is messed up and I said the fact that they killed the dog too was even more messed up. We riffed back and forth for a little until I implied that because the dog and person were the same gender, it really crossed a moral line. At this point my gal got really mad at me saying that I shouldn’t joke about something that serious especially considering that her sister is gay. I immediately apologized very sincerely explaining that I had no intention of offending her and that all I wanted to do was see her smile again but that came to no avail. We’re still sleeping next to each other tonight so I can’t imagine she’s terribly angry but AITA?\nA couple things to note:\n-Her sister and I are good friends who often spend alone time together\n-My gal knows I’ve been a long time supporter of gay rights\n-We’ve joked about homosexuality in the past with no problems\n",

      "description": "My baby is only three weeks old and hasnt been baptized yet and her shots are not complete yet so I havent allowed anyone to visit her aside from family and SO, of course. But my family didnt even touch my baby, just peeked at her crib and went on to have dinner.\n\nMy FIL and SO's stepmom, and their son are too demanding. Especially stepmom. She always want to visit unannounced during weekends, always want to carry my baby, and always asks when SO is visiting so she could come. Which irritates SO because he isnt really in good terms with them. And since we arent living together yet (the house we'll be moving in will be available on Feb) SO only gets to visit once or twice a week because he works far from home and he stays in his grandma's house which is near his work.\n\nOne time, his Dad contracted chicken pox and even though it was dangerous. Stepmom thought it was a good idea to visit the baby and carry her. Even though she isnt the one with the disease, she also had the colds when she visited and I thought it was too risky and it was the final straw for me.\n\nIve been avoiding her messages lately and I disabled my sim card so she wont be able to call. I last sent her photos of the baby but stop replying whenever she asks to visit or when is my SO visiting. SO also thinks its a good idea to cut contact up until the baby gets her shots next month and can be brought out in public. I feel like an asshole for cutting them off but theyve been really invasive and my baby's safety comes first. AITA?",

      "description": "Background: In my college there is very popular Lan-party and I work there as Console Supervisor. I basically make sure consoles work with no problems and if someone has questions or problems with any of consoles, I am the guy who has to go to help there.\n\nMy friend group is usually take part on Lan-party and there is around 7 people in that group (me including). Because the group is kinda big we usually get one row of 6 seats. But couple of my friends bring their brother, little sister (underage) and boyfriend to the Lan-party. More people the merrier, right? At the Lan-party there is always pre-made seating positions to everyone but you can switch around with your friends.\n\nWeek before even registering for the Lan-party my friend Sam (name changed) posted message to our chat: \"let sit this way at the lan-party: I want to sit next to my sister and boyfriend so seating should go like this: me, my sister, John (Sam's bf), Jen, Jen's brother and someone. Because there is so many of us for one row the rest can be somewhere close like: someone (most likely Disco (me)) , Paul and Jeff (Paul's bf). Be cause me and Jen has overwatch sessions anyway so I want to sit to close her too xD\"\n\nSandy awnser \"sounds good to me, If possible I want to have the hallway seat because I can have more room :) \"\nPaul \"me and my bf don't care where we sit\"\nI didn't awnser at the time because I wanted to make sure that I even got PC place from the party.\nOthers like Jen didn't answer too.\n\nThe day of registration:\nRegistration opens and I get my reservation to pc place. \nI messaged: \"Registered! Oh, I forgot mention that I need the hallway seat because the I work there and I need to constantly get up from my place and the space between desks are tiny, so I don't want to constantly walk back and forth and push peoples seats accidentally and bother them. Other wise I don't care where I sit.\"\nSandy \"I thought we already agreeded on this position  *tagged Sam's message*. Because you work there you can ask yourself own hallway seat, because group is gonna get splitted up anyway, so we have changes to get to seats\"\nMe: \"Yes, a chance, that doesn't mean we must have two hallway seats. I just thought that I just wanted to make it easier and more comfortable to everyone so I don't have to walk\nBack forth behind people, you guys know how annoying it is right? \".\nSandy \"I just think the Sam's suggestion is the most practical!\". \nMe: \"also in the end it really doesn't matter who is next to you because everyone is focused to gaming and we are talking in discord anyway\"\nSandy: \"just suggest that they will give you a other hallway seat\"\nMe: \"I did that already, but usually hallway seats are for people who work there or needs them, and I aren't only one who needs hallwayseat\"\nSandy: \" YOU could have said earlier about this!\"\nMe: \"hey Sandy, calm down. Don't snort peas to your nose about this please.\"\nSam: \"our row is already over booked, and you aren't in it xD. But you work there you can just go and edit the seating plan\"\nMe: \"but, I just can't go and edit the plan. I don't have right to do so\"\nThomas (he is by stander in this): \"everyone is anyway in close to each other in tiny space so it doesn't matter who is sitting next to you\"\nSandy: \"I don't care\"\nSam: \"funny how you bring this up now, disco. You didn't say anything for my seating plan. I used my time to think about it, so we are gonna go with that xD\" \nMe: \"I thought you guys know that I work there. Like in past 5 times I have\" \n\nAt this moment I am getting pretty pissed about my friends passive-aggressive words, I know I could have bring this up earlier but my assuming got best of me.\n\nMe: \"Also you said\" Someone\" in the post so I thought it didn't automatically mean Sandy\"\nSam: \"Well, We did kinda mean Sandy with\"\nMe: \"Also I wasn't only one who didn't say anything\" \nSam: \"You should have better luck next time XD\" \nMe: \"Do you know what, if you don't even want to sit in same row or even do this one tiny favor. I ask the head supervisor so move me elsewhere.\"\nMe: \"also how about you get married with your retarded plan if you love it so much. I am done. Goodbye. \"\n\nAnd I left the message group. My last message was childish and rude, I know that. Reason I left the group was because I got panic attack (anxiety is a bitch) and I can say very bad things and escalate things to worse. \n\nThomas called me later and calmed me down. And explained his point of view of situation. He told me Sandy and Sam had total meltdown in group after I left and said how I am ungrateful of all of Sam work she put for our friend group and I should apologize of my actions.\n\nI can apologize of my last rude comments, but I just wanted that everyone is comfortable in the Lan-party. I just don't understand why everyone instantly started being so aggressive towards me and I should apologize being ungrateful? Even tho I said you guys can sit how ever you like but I kinda need the fucking hallway seat because of work. I wouldn't ask it otherwise.\n\n Am I really the biggest asshole here? ",

She and the felon regularly threaten to disappear with the kids is anyone reports him for abusing her or possible outstanding warrants. I know people grieve in different ways, I fully expected her to move on but damn.

      "description": "[This is the cancelation policy](https://www.edreams.com/blog/edreams-cancellation-policy/). It's not very clearly written but it seems like i probably can't get a refund since I had purchased discount tickets but decided I didn't need them at the last minute.\n\nBackground: i purchased a flight ticket to fly on Air China on edreams.net instead of the Air China website. And I later decided for reasons too complex to explain that I didn't need it anymore and it's 100% my own fault. \n\nStill, I thought it probably won't hurt to try and the worst they could do is say \"no\". And I learned the lesson the hard way that there could be worse outcomes than \"no\".\n\nSo i waited 10 minutes for a rep when i called edreams and he told me to call Air China. It took forever to reach a rep at Air China like an hour after waiting and trying multiple times, not to mention being dropped while waiting for 20 minutes at first. Finally when I reached a rep, she told me to call edreams. I told her that edreams sent me here but she said that there was nothing she could do, not even provide a definite answer.\n\nSo i called edreams again and reached a rep in 5-10 minutes. He told me to call Air China but this time I kinda lost it after having been on hold for a total of over an hour and being told by Air China to call edreams, and it was clear i was being given the runaround. After being put on hold and arguing for another 20 minutes, the rep finally made it clear: they (edreams) cannot refund this ticket but Air China might but they have no control over whether Air China will or not.\n\nSo at this point i put 2 and 2 together and got my answer: i can't get a refund for my ticket. I didn't have a problem with not getting a refund but I was extremely pissed at how difficult it was to even get a rep to tell me \"no\" and having to give me the runaround.",

      "description": "To start, my girlfriend has Borderline Personality Disorder. Based on what she tells me about her own experiences and my own research, her BPD causes her to think in black and white about situations and with people. For example, if I do something that upsets her, she might “split”, meaning she’ll flip to not caring about me or even hating me instead of caring for and loving me like she normally would. In that state she’s either very cold, or gets very angry and can say some pretty hurtful things. \n\nDespite her splitting, I still believe she is a good person. She’s very loving and kind when she’s not in that state. She has deep empathy for other people, even the people she despises. She has a baby sister who she loves and cares for greatly, and would sacrifice anything for. She even spends her free time knitting hats for babies for charity! \n\nHowever, she still hates herself immensely. She believes there’s absolutely no good in her and that she is abusive to me in our relationship. She self harms to punish herself for what she has done wrong. \n\nI love her, and I want her to love herself the same that I do. I tell her on a consistent basis that she is a good person, that she deserves recovery, and does not deserve to suffer for what she has done wrong. I tell her that she has said and done hurtful things, but she deserves forgiveness because she always apologizes and tries to do the right thing afterwards. I tell her that the way she thinks about herself is unhealthy, unjustified, and is caused by her BPD and other mental health problems. I tell her that her black and white thinking applies to herself like it does to anything else. \n\nShe has now told me to stop saying these things. She believes that I am lying to her and/or just wrong. She tells me that me trying to push for her to recover is creepy and not any of my business. She said that saying these things makes her very uncomfortable, and by telling her such things I am crossing a boundary. She said that if I continued to be “nice” to her she would stop contacting me. \n\nI refused to do so. I believe that validating her abusive thoughts by staying silent is wrong and neglectful. I don’t think it’s creepy to want her to recover, as I love and care for her and want to see her thrive. I wouldn’t want to be in a relationship with her if i thought she was a bad person or if I didn’t love her. \n\nBecause of this, she’s blocked me on all platforms I have contact with her on. I am in a LDR with her, so I have no other way to reach her. I’m not sure if we’ve broken up yet, as she has blocked me in the past and has unblocked me later on.\n\nAITA for not respecting that boundary and for continuing to do something that made her uncomfortable?",

I really enjoy my time there and when 7:30 comes, he is nowhere to be seen. Turns out he isn't coming to pick me up because \"I didnt say I wanted him to\". Granted I didnt specifically say this, and I have taken lifts from other friends before when it's been confirmed I cant be picked up, but I though it would be a given to pick up your own child from an place on time. I ended up getting driven home by the friend in question. \n\nWhen I saw him when I got home I didnt say very nice things,  but nothing I consider ott (asshole etc.)\nSo who is the asshole here?",

      "description": "TLDR; Ex smashed my phone so I held his xbox hostage. \n\nSo while we were together, my ex had lent me his Xbox so I could play games. We were together for a long time and had lived together when I was home for college. Both of our our phones were in my name and the xbox was the last gift his dead mother had given him. We broke up because he was cheating on me. I wasn't bitter (yet) so I tried to give him back his xbox, engagement ring,  and his mother's earrings. He told me to keep all of it. Time passes. I start to move on. He turns violent, assaults me. Were under a 3 year contract so we go no contact but he pays half of the really high phone bill so he keeps his phone. But then he starts to be late. We get into a fight. And I dont hear from him for months. I find out when I go to get my phone from him that he doesnt have it, so I have to pay out of pocket. I find out from a mutual friend that he intentionally broke it and bragged. I dont play when it comes to money,  now im bitter af. Later I find the Xbox, the last gift his mother gave him. I message him under a fake Facebook, that I will sell him his Xbox back for the amount that it cost me to replace the phone. He freaks out demands it back, because its his. Im like \"no you gave it to me. I'll sell it on ebay\" he never seen the xbox again, but everyone says that im the asshole. AITA",

      "description": "Alright, this may come off as kiddish, but i still want conformation. It's more of a childish fight, so let's start at the beginning, shall we?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, I made a meme that I was going to put up on my school bathroom walls, found [here](https://imgur.com/a/vk3aIk3). Now, my friend loved this idea, so we went around at lunch displaying them and putting up in the bathrooms in the boys bathrooms and on the door. I borrowed some tape from my tech theater teacher, and had to give it back after lunch. He took the papers to his next class, and told me he had them. I knew he would probably give them back, because, why not right? He texted me the next class period and said that the teacher took them and that he could probably get them back after class. I didn't care much, as I could easily print more out at home if she decided she was going to keep them. It turns out, she did, but thats not the point. he told me about this, and we laughed, and went home, as it was more of a meme than anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward to today, and I see on his SC story that he's displaying the posters I MADE and saying that he made them. I ask him to give me credit, and he doesn't. I'm kinda pissed off at him, but he have 2nd period together so I think I can get everything sorted out there.  the VERY NEXY THING on his story is a [meme](https://imgur.com/a/s5OQWMw) that looks almost exactly like mine, with a caption that reads \"round 2 baby\" or something along those lines. I recreated it as best I could in the link above. Now a couple things about this image. The \"Danny Bee-Vito\" thing I asked on my [memepage](https://www.instagram.com/ymypphard.exe/) if someone could make it, as I found it funny. One of them did, and I thanked her profusely for it. Other ideas of mine, like jesus, the fire, and the vaping, were put into that. Now, this makes me mad. Not quite to the point where I wan't to delete it, but mad. I start working on the \"actual round 2\" in 1st period, and meet him in 2nd. I ask him if he could give me credit on the first one that I made, and he says no, because \"he's the one that turned it into a meme\" and not me. Now, I consider myself a hardcore memer, so I take offense to that I do a lot of crazy stuff for memes including buying an [inflatable dinosaur costume to be put on my school weekly show](https://vimeo.com/299912676)(skip to 12:09 to see the segment). But now, thats not the point. He shows off the one he made, claiming that he made it, which, technically, he did, but it upsets me even more because it's almost an exact copy of mine. He closes his computer and walks off to do something else, so I decide to dot the deed. The school has this login that you can use if you are not connected to the internet, so that you can still get schoolwork done. \"Luckily\", he logged in with that, so I do as well, and there is his prized possession. He made it on google docs, so it's not that hard to move it to trash, and finally delete it forever. He comes back and sees what I did, takes my phone, and throws it in the trash. The teacher is out, and we're all working on a project, as nobody really notices. He goes into the back room and sits there until almost the end of the period, until he is called to come out. In the span that he's been in there, I have made a duplicate version of his meme, because I felt bad, and didn't want to lose my friend. He says \"I don't want it, I want mine.\" \"to which I respond \"it's an exact copy\" He says \"No it's not\", to which I reply \"what can I change\". He hasn't responded, so IDK if thats a good or bad sign. Later, as we're about to leave, I tell him I made a 24 hour loop of Lebron James saying \"wanna sprite cranberry\", and usually, he'll laugh at whatever I make, but he didn't this time. I don't want to lose my friend, I just want to know, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Made a meme I was going to post around school, friend took credit for it, made another one almost exactly like it, and I deleted it.",

      "description": "I work as a forklift operator at a warehouse, and sometimes part of my job is replenishing pick locations with full pallets for the pickers that are working on mixed orders. Picking requires some basic math, since the picks are based on quantities in the system. Sometimes a picker might need close to a whole pallet, so it's easier for everyone if I drop the pallet off in a place they can get it, and they just put whatever they don't need back in the location. Obviously it takes some math to figure out how much you need to put back, basic subtraction.\n\nThis one co-worker has a tendency to be slow and asks a lot of questions that he should really know the answer to, considering that he's been there at least a few months. By the end of the first week you should at least know the basics. I go to put the pallet in the location, since he didn't specify that he needed the whole pallet, so he stops me and seems confused, but says he might need the whole thing. He asks me how much comes in the pallet, and I tell him. He then seems more confused, so I ask him how much he needs. He needs most of the pallet, so I say I'll just drop it right there for him. Then he seems confused about how much he needs to put back. I tell him to subtract what he needs from what comes in a pallet, and to put the difference back. He just keeps asking me roundabout questions, seems more confused. That's when I started to get frustrated.\n\nI started to get pretty short with him, since I already had a bunch of people yelling at me over the radio wondering where their pallets were, and I try to explain it to him again, and he just says,\"Sorry, I'm not good at math,\" and I said,\"Well it's part of your job, and you have a calculator.\" I tell him exactly what to punch in the calculator, even though most people could very easily do this math mentally, and he punches it in. What he ends up with is some crazy number, and he mumbled something about multiplying it. So I take the calculator from him, do the calculation, show him what I did, and just took off. I was not very nice in the way I responded. I honestly considered telling my lead to get the Quality Control guy to check some of his orders, as I was not confident in his ability to do things properly. \n\n",

      "description": "So today is my cousins kids birthday.  My cousin and aunt invited me over to celebrate and they said they'd really like it if I could come. I have abolutely no problem with my cousin or any thing, but my aunt and I had a falling out a few months back.  \n\nBasically, I had this trip to New York coming up and I was excited about it but she decided to go off on me on Facebook about how I would 'hate it' and how I shouldn't go, etc. Well, my mother in law then jumped in to defend me, saying that it's my life and I should be free to travel and live out my dreams. Well this ended in my aunt calling my mother in law trash amongst other things. My aunt then private messaged me saying how I always trash talk my parents on Facebook and that I'm all the time making stuff up about them (which is completely false, and she refuses to believe that I was emotionally abused.. Probably because she was emotionally abusive as well). She said I fake problems I don't have (talking about my anxiety that I will soon be getting treated for) and how I'm basically a horrible person who just lies about everything and how my in laws are somehow trying to brainwash and lead me in the wrong direction. I told her that I didn't want to deal the drama and that she was acting childish. \n\nSo I cut off contact with her for a while. Didn't even go see her or any of that side of the family for Christmas except my parents. She then messaged me not long after that and apologized for what she had said. I said it was fine but honestly all she does is cause drama. I can't tell you the number of times her and my dad got angry at one another and cut off contact. It would be the same thing every few months. \n\nNow my aunt is trying to say she loves me and my husband and that she wants us to come to this birthday party. I told her we would try to.. But the day is here and both her and my cousin have messaged me but I have just ignored them. I don't blame my cousin or her kids but I just don't want to be around my aunt so... Am I the Asshole? ",

      "description": "So I went to the gym last week after work. \nAfter parking my car, I made my way to the entrance where the two swinging doors usually allow traffic to flow both ways. \nPoole here typically hold the doors for each other, and today was no exception. As I walked up, a group was leaving while a mother held the opposite door open for her child. \nThe kid was obviously very young and could barely walk, but there was plenty of space for me to walk between the two groups.\nAs I stepped into the lobby, I was surprised by the mother as she said in a low angry voice, “Hey that’s my baby you’re about to run over”. I smiled and replied, “I saw her, thanks”. \nI didn’t think much of it until she complained to one of the gym employees (who I know well and spoke to while there). \nI don’t want my friend at the gym have to deal with this, but at the same time I don’t think what I did was wrong. There was no chance of me bumping into anyone in that doorway, and I would never hurt a child. \n\nI feel as though I should apologize in person if I get the chance, and would probably have apologized on the spot if I hadn’t been so surprised by the hostility in her voice.\nAm I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "Okay so this has been weighing on me even after having discussed it with my immediate family so there is some background to this and I am ready for the truth Reddit. I have 2 cousins whom are both pregnant and both giving birth in the spring. One is pregnant with her 2nd child and the other is having her 1st. My cousin who is having her 1st child, I have always been closer to since we were little since we were only a year apart. The other had a really tough childhood where alcohol and absent parents were involved. Since childhood however, I have not kept contact with the majority of my family except for agreeing to go to at least one family gathering a year (Christmas, thanksgiving, a birthday or something similar). I have a large extended family and do not like large gatherings so this is always stressful but still important to me that I go to at least one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my 1st cousin had her first baby, of course there was a lot of excitement and attention given as well as gifts and for a person who didn't have that kind of thing when they were younger, I understand how much it meant to her. This pregnancy however, I had heard inklings that she was requesting my 2nd cousin to share her baby shower with her but wasn't sure so I ignored it because my extended family are also gossipers and I should know better at this point. Then I get an invitation on the book of faces for my first cousins 2nd baby shower. I of course put off responding because I was irritated that she would ask for more gifts after the amount our family had given her the 1st time around and felt she was being greedy. I let my aunt who was hosting the 2nd shower know that I would not be attending. She said that was fine and would let the 1st cousin known. I then get a text from the 1st cousin asking if I was going. I apologized, stated that I wasn't able to attend but sent my love and hoped to see her soon. She then replies that she wishes she could see me more and that she doesn't even want gifts, just the opportunity to see me more. (keep in mind that we have nothing in common and little to no relationship). I explained that I am busy with work and school and that I was sorry she was upset that I couldn't attend (I knew in my head where this was going). She then rebuts that with 'I'm in school full time with one baby and another on the way... are you going to 2nd cousin's baby shower?' I just stopped the conversation after that saying that I am not going to fight with her and that I had to go to bed as it was about 10pm at this point and I have to leave for work at about 6:30am. She sent another text later that night saying that she was sorry that she didn't have any siblings and was pregnant and hormonal and wanted to reach out. I have not responded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not giving in and going? I feel as though she was trying to guilt trip and manipulate by bringing up my other cousin and trying to put me in between a rock and a hard place with asking that. ",

      "description": "I’m currently in a relationship with a guy for a year. In cultural context, we don’t date for longer periods of time and move it to marriage. However recent events have made me started thinking about it. \n\nMarrying him means moving into a joint family system where you have to live with the in laws. His father is a very rude person and his mother is extremely controlling. Also their house is in remote area where facilities are limited. We talked about moving but he says he wouldn’t leave his parents alone. I had issues with it but I decided to let it go. I love him very much and I thought if he’s there, i’ll manage. \n\nMy family is against this relationship and I’ve been trying to persuade them for months. This has left me very ugly on my family side too as I’m the youngest. I was okay. I do love him. \n\nLast night he told me he’s suffering from TB again. He was diagnosed three years ago too. And I felt gutted. I’m so worried about him. But a very tiny part of my heart feels sad. We were going to go for MS this year together but he can’t go. He is insisting me to go but I do not want to without him. I don’t want to leave him behind. \n\nAnd amidst all this, I feel like I’m losing too much of myself. Am i the asshole here for rethinking about this relationship? It’s a fleeting feeling but it keeps coming back. I wanted to have a private life with my partner and settle in Europe away from my home country. And this sometimes keep coming back that I’m changing too much of what I wanted for someone. But part of me says it’s okay to change for someone you love. I don’t know what to feel, it’s a mess. ",

      "description": "At school, my friend was annoying me at lunch. I told her to stop annoying to me, since I was trying to get some peace and quiet, and said I would kick her if she wouldn’t (in a playful way, not actually hurting her). She didn’t, and I shoved her into the wall with my foot. After, she just kind of left. After school, she told me her phone broke, and blamed me. On the walk home, she kept telling me to be mad at myself for breaking it (on accident). One of my other friends even told her stop, she was being an asshole, and that I already understood my mistake.\n\nI always told her I was willing to pay. She said she wouldn’t accept it, since SHE would feel guilty about it. A few weeks later, I still gave her the money. No thanks, but she gave me half the money back. \n\nLater, I asked her if the phone breaking still bothered her. She says a little. I start trying to compromise with her, offering to pay her, and asking what else I could do. She doesn’t even contribute to a compromise. Eventually, we settled on me doing a very important favor for her someday. She still hasn’t asked me for a favor yet.\n\nShe also told everyone else, making sure to tell them that I broke her phone. Now, I keep getting “you broke her phone right?” and “aren’t you the guy who broke her phone?” When she hears people saying this, she doesn’t say that I offered to help and just agrees with them, and not standing up for me.\n\nWith that in mind, AITA?\n\nYou are also not allowed to have your phone on campus, and that the school won’t pay for any damages. I didn’t intend to hurt my friend or damage her property. ",

Well we met here in CO when she was just getting out of a bad marriage like really bad and I lost my fiancee back in 2016 to a car accident and we comforted each other and when she finally left her abusive husband we started dating and soon after she got pregnant so when I left for the military and to Afghanistan she moved to TX to be with her mom dad and sister while I was away her ex made her leave texas in 24hrs last time to move to CO and she wasnt allowed to say goodbye. Now we always talked about moving back to the Rockies either CO or Montana. I love the mountains just the area is my dream home I've never been more active in my life and I've met a lot of lifelong friends. Our plan was at first to stay in Texas while I get financially situated and we save enough to buy a house in the Rockies. Originally we agreed to spend 2-3 years but then she told me she wants to stay and keep our son close to her family which is fair but I hate Texas I've been there before and i dont like the nature and i just dont fit in I've expressed my dislike of the lone star state before and while we dated so now its moved to stay there for 5 years but she wants to stay indefinitely I've tried to say we could take vacations to see her parents or be willing to do anything to compromise but I dont want to hurt her. She says just give it a chance and I'll try but I've lived in the south almost my whole life and hated it pretty much the whole time. When I moved to the Rockies it was like I found my home I even had a nice house and good job in Hawaii and i just couldn't be happy unless i was in my snowy mountains. ",

      "description": "So I recently got back in town from a long hospitalization process and a friend of mine (I’ll refer to her as M) reached out to me and we decided to hang out at her house to catch up.  I feel like we got a lot closer as the night went on and she ended up being my first kiss.\n\nWhen I got home that night she texted me that she didn’t want anyone to find out about what happened and I told her I understood and I would keep it on the DL.\n\nTwo nights later I went to my school’s theatre production that she was performing in.  During the second act this other girl I knew (we were just acquaintances), asked if she could talk to me outside about something.  Apparently while I had been gone for the past three months, she had attempted suicide.  Because she knew about my whole thing with MDD, she decided she needed some support from me (because I’ve recovered for the most part from suicidal tendencies).  \n\nAnyways we talked outside for about 2 HOURS and I felt really bad for her during the whole thing.  We talked about so many things and I don’t really remember how, but I ended up telling her that the reason for me coming to the play was to see that girl.  Then she asked me if I had my first kiss and I said yes. I told her it was two nights ago.  Because  she was basically pouring her heart out to me, I told her it was with “M” and the context of it.   \n\nBecause of the serious and personal nature of most of our conversation, I just assumed that what we talked about would be kept between us. I was wrong.  She ended up telling people, and the next day tons of people knew about M and I.\n\nM has completely shut me out and won’t respond to any of my messages.  She did say she just needs space so I’ve been waiting it out.  It’s been 5 days now.  I don’t want her to think that I just blabbed her secret to the whole school (even though I pretty much did), but mostly I just don’t want our friendship to die.\n\nAITA\n\n",

They said it was either gonna be friday or saturday. That was all info given to us at the time.\n\nSince I didn't hear more of it I assumed it would be on saturday (bad planning on my part I know) and so I was gonna spend the friday after work at my gf. On wednesday I get told I can end work at 1 pm on friday (this never happens) so I tell the gf I can come over at 2 instead.\n\nLast night when me, Kodo and Mr T were in discord Kodo suddenly says we're going out on friday at 3 pm (that means somehow he and Solo's gf forgot I always end work at 4 pm) and that Mr T apparently hadn't been invited. Also we're going bowling at 8 pm. I get pissed at Kodo for not telling us sooner and forgetting to invite Boba Fett's oldest friend, meaning I gotta tell gf I'll come over at 9 pm instead. Mr T get's pissed aswell having not been invited.\n\nLater that night Boba Fett joins the call and he hadn't been told anything until then. He get's  really confused that he hadn't been told before and that Mr T hadn't been invited.\n\nSo now Mr T is invited to eat but since they've already booked the bowling, he can't join on that. Leaving me, Mr T and my gf pissed (she since I get there much later).\n\nSo am I the asshole for being pissed at Kodo and Solo's gf for doing some shit-tier planning?",

      "description": "TL;DR - One friend likes to tell a 6 year story about another friend of mine that ends up making the latter sound unreasonable/entitled, and I'm wondering if I can ask her to stop.\n\nBackstory: I got married 6 years ago, had five bridesmaids, and there were a few things the MOH did that two of the other bridesmaids took particular exception to (never heard what the remaining two thought). At one point one of the bothered bridesmaids (this is going to be our Story Telling Friend later on, so I'll call her STF) called me up and asked me to straighten the MOH out about a particular request she had made for the bachelorette party. Unfortunately for her I essentially responded with \"Her request doesn't bother me, y'all are adults, figure it out\" (I used more diplomatic words at the time). I'm friends with them from different places, so they haven't interacted since.\n\nThe problem now is that STF has been telling the story of the bachelorette party all over the place for the last 6 years, the central point being \"Guess what this one crazy MOH did...\". And by \"all over the place\" I'm including 3 separate podcasts-- one was writing in \"for advice\" (4 years after the wedding), one was as a guest on another podcast last summer, and one was on her own podcast talking about how she had talked about it on the other 2 podcasts. People typically agree with STF that my MOH was being ridiculous, and the validation STF gets is like catnip to her. And who knows, maybe my MOH really WAS wrong at the time, and I was wrong for not backing STF. I'm willing to be wrong, and I'm certainly willing to let her continue believing she was right. I have zero expectation that she'll change her mind.\n\nI'm just sick of hearing about it, especially if the people responding are super harsh on MOH. On one of the podcasts someone called her a \"fucking bitch\", and STF just laughed. I got reallll pissed about that (and to be clear, if the tables were reversed and MOH kept dragging STF in public, I'd feel the same way).\n\nThat said, and this is the dilemma... those feelings don't necessarily mean I have the right to stop STF from talking about something that happened to her. It's not \"my story\" to control. It is hers. And I mean I get it, she has a interesting story, she comes out looking like a martyr, who wouldn't cash in on that? Plus she doesn't use names, and she doesn't technically lie when she tells it. Slants it, sure, but it's not like she's slandering or trying to ruin MOH's life. Just thinks it's funny and likes the reaction she gets from it.\n\nNevertheless, it's at the expense of a very dear friend.\n\nSo, what do you think? Do I get to tell STF to STFU, or do I have to just plug my ears and keep my head down?",

      "description": "So, I met this guy, let’s call him JOHN in college.\n\nMiddle of my freshman year, I broke up with my hs boyfriend from home. The breakup was mutual and amicable at first, but took a turn once my ex heard I had started seeing other people after we broke up. So, JOHN, being a nice friend, moved a third mattress into his and his roommate’s  (ADAM) room for a week so I could be w my friends. \n\nShortly after, I made out with ADAM, but clarified I didn’t want a relationship, and we only just kissed a few times. ADAM was livid because he told me he had strong feelings for me, and we didn’t end on good terms. I had set boundaries before that I didn’t want a relationship, but ended up hurting ADAM anyway. So, JOHN, took my defense and said ADAM was being a jerk about the whole thing. JOHN suggests I should’ve made out w him instead of ADAM, avoiding the drama I was currently in. He then tried to kiss me, and I dodged it, but we laughed it off, and I told him it would never happen. Totally fine and our friendship grew.\n\nmiddle of my soph year, my new boyfriend (Carl), and I just broke up. My heart was broken, seriously. But JOHN, being the guy that he is, was there every second I needed. Took me shopping, for ice cream, invited me over to watch movies, ETC. I guess we “flirted” by doing stuff alone like watching movies and holding hands, but I never had romantic feelings and felt like I made it clear when he tried to kiss me previously. Over that winter break, JOHN and I talked almost everyday on FaceTime and texted all the time. He was all around a great friend, and I appreciated having him around, but he would casually say he loved me and kissed me a lot. On New Years, JOHN texted me a very long message saying that he was totally in love with me, that I’m the person he thinks about before he falls asleep and as soon as he wakes up, that I’m the most amazing person and girl he’s ever met, etc,. I responded thanking him, but that I wasn’t interested in something like that, and he accepted it, and we stayed friends.\n\nafter winter break, I got back together with Carl. Since JOHN had been there with me through all the BS, I thought it would be better for JOHN to hear from me that Carl and I are back together, so I told him. He told me that he needed space, blocked me on Instagram, completely ignored me anytime he saw me, and still does today, over a year later. I recently texted him to apologize for how things went down (although I feel as if I didn’t do much wrong), and he basically just said thanks. We had a great friendship, and it completely ended when I told him Carl and I were getting back together. We don’t even look at each other when we see each other, wave, say hi, nothing. \n\nSo...AITA for the way I handled things with John? Or Adam? Ps, Carl and I broke up for good right after all of this.",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nI am going to start this by saying since my dad died she \"forgets\" stuff all the time. My dad has been gone 6 years now. I've begged for her to go to see her Dr but she refuses.\n\nI live an hour from my mum and I think because of this there is a lot of out of sight out of mind. \n\nIn the weeks leading up to my Daughter's birthday everytime we spoke I would remind her that it was M's birthday on the 27th. She'd tell me she knew as it was on her calendar, that she wouldn't forget.\n\nOn her birthday nothing comes through the post. Mum actually called me on the evening. I figured she'd called to wish M happy birthday but she had called to rant about how my sister had lied to her. (my younger sister is going through a very hard time as her 8yr old daughter has incurable cancer but she still managed to wish my daughter a happy  birthday!). I eventually managed to say \"that M has had a good day today and we've just got back from tea\" which is responded with \"oh, that's nice.. I have to go now\" and before I had chance to say about her birthday, she hung up. \n\nAnyway, I get a phone call the next day saying she's going to post M's cards out so she can get them by the next Tuesday (This was 3 days after her birthday)\nI asked her why she never asked to speak to M when I spoke to her yesterday She then starts telling me it's my fault I never said anything, That I should have put her on the phone. I would have, had I been given the chance. I kept calm and explained why I was disappointed all the while she was screaming at me. Screaming it was my fault, that she can't help being forgetful then she hangs up then refuses to answer the phone. \n\nI send her a message saying I wouldn't apologize for standing up for my children. All she was bothered about is that this whole situation was my fault and to not speak to her ever again because she's my mother and I shouldn't speak to her like that. \n\nTuesday comes and goes and the card arrives. I give M the phone and she calls my mum. She says thank you and has a small conversation with her. When M had finished she asked my mum if she wanted to talk to me and I heard her say no and hung up. \n\nA month goes by and I hear nothing. One day she rings and I answer. She tries brushing the whole thing under the carpet by calling me a liar. She tells me she sent the cards out before my daughter's birthday. I sent her screen grabs of our conversation with the date stamp above showing the day after but she calls me a liar, says that I changed the date on the messages etc. She then tells me I am trying to kill her and that I won't be happy till she's dead. That couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth.\n\nTL;DR : I reminded my mum that it was nearly my daughter's birthday, she forgot. She blames me. Calls me a liar when I show her proof. Tells me I won't be happy till she is dead and in a box. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA? ",

      "description": "I've (guy) been living in my apartment (basement) for 6 months now with my roommate (girl) and have had minimal interactions with our upstairs neighbors. Upon moving in I quickly discovered there are very thin walls in this place. My neighbors often play music very loud, normally in the living room. It's often so loud I can hear it through my headphones. Normally they play music on weekends at typical hours (quiet by midnight). Sometimes they do play on weeknights, but I have let that slide. Today I was taking a nap at noon in my bedroom and was awoken by their music. I decided I was going to say something, so I knocked on their door, but their music was so loud they did not hear me. I left a note asking if they could keep it down. For some reason I also decided to tell my property manager.\n\nMy property manager forwarded me their response \"Hi ___, we understand that it is the basement floor complaining as  they have left us a note. The music is really not that loud and only gets played somewhat loudly on weekends. I’m happy to even talk to the boys myself because they themselves will play music loud or be loud in other ways but we do not complain because we understand that it is an apartment building. We can hear the child from second  floor constantly but don’t mind because it’s not a big deal. Also,  we don’t appreciate that the boys have their girlfriends living there and it gets noisy sometimes and they are also using our laundry  machine and such but we try to be good neighbors and not complain about the little things.\"\n\nFirst off, it is only my roommate (girl) and I (boy) who live here, and we are both single. Their music was loud since it woke me up. They do play music on weeknights occasionally. I don't know what we do that is noisy since we both use headphones for everything and rarely have people over.  They are right that someone comes over and uses the laundry machine, but that's my roommates friend who gives her a ride to the grocery store in exchange. I found it rude that they insinuated I'm a bad neighbor because I complained. \n\nSo I asked for their phone numbers and wrote them a text asking if we could talk this over. One of them said she'll meet with me on Monday, but I better be ok with \"music and laughter\" that night since it's NYE. \n\nTldr, AITA for wanting my neighbors to be a little more quiet?",

      "description": "My sister and I have a large age gap. She is 20 years older than I am. She met her husband when they were both in service and have been together since I was 5 years old. I just can’t stand him because he has such a condescending personality towards my family and belittling to others not like him. \n\nShe has always bragged about her husband being really smart and being a physician who makes a lot of money and is able to provide a lavish lifestyle for their family compared to what we grew up with in our low income family. Her advice to me was to always find an intelligent man that was able to provide for me. I was always like yeah okay sure 🤷🏽‍♀️.... \n\n\nI never really understood the beef between our family and her husband until recent years where they moved closer by to the rest of our family. From when I was younger I just knew he was a smart individual who was going to school to become a physician. He is now a surgeon. Has switched locations multiple times anytime he doesn’t like where he works. When I was younger I thought that was normal. Now older I’ve learned he has continuously jumped from jobs every 6 months and the longest he’s stayed anywhere was less than a 1.5yr because he won’t work with anyone he doesn’t get along with. \n\nOur mother is the only person out of our parents to have contact with their children because my sister and dad don’t get along. However, every time my mom tries to feed the kids, change their diapers, or carry them my brother in law would helicopter my mom on how to do it or in one case actually pushed her away because he didn’t want her to do it. My mom has discussed it many times with them that she has raised 6 children and was feeling offended. Also, anytime my mom would offer remedies to help with colds or sleep deprivation with the children he would tell her he’s a surgeon in a first world country and her advice is toxic. I was quite taken a back because all my mom offered was maybe giving the babies massages or giving them steam baths to allow them to relax and stop crying while sick. \n\nAround tax time last year. My sister was telling me about how much she dreads doing it. I am a graduate in finance and tax, so I offered my help. Our brother is also a tax preparer and also offered as well. We follow up with our sister and she says no her husband doesn’t feel comfortable with us performing the complexity of their income information, so they will be going to a professional. At that point my brother and I were like okay, that wasn’t slightly offensive I guess. We later find out they decided to go to H&amp;R Block. My sister calls me upset because they’ve been there the entire day and the person doesn’t seem to know what they’re doing. I told her no shit it’s H&amp;R Block, they’re not CPAs..... \n\nI also at one point after college had to live with my sister and her family right after graduation because I had no where else to live and was unemployed. She offered me a place to stay with her husband’s consent as well. While, I stayed there I was babysitting their kids cleaning the common areas of the house. Constantly my sister would complain to me about her husband not helping around and spending frivolous amounts of money. \n\nThe parts that bothered me the most were anytime that my sister would openly ask her husband and I for opinions on furthering her career, he would tell my sister she was being stupid or selfish and then downplay anything I had to say because how could I give advice if I needed to have my sister save me from homelessness. I got really upset and said he was completely out of line on that. The kids also felt uncomfortable with expressing the things they liked because of their dad shooting them down. I’ve also seen him lose his cool and yell at their 2-yr old son because he wouldn’t eat his food, so he just took the food and threw it all away. I had to walk in and intervene asking if he needed to step aside or needed some space because I could watch the baby. He said he knew what he was doing, the baby was just making him late for errands and just got briefly upset.\n\nI got into an argument with him over me saying IHOP lying about changing their name to IHOB and he said I should stop spreading inaccurate information because they did in fact do it if I bothered reading the news properly. So I was just stuck at wait what 🤦🏽‍♀️🙃... \n\nI lived day in and day out with them for 2 months and I personally just felt it was so toxic and exhausting just to be there. I ended up leaving the moment I had found a job and secure place to live. Before I left I got into an argument with my sister and her ultimately telling me that she agrees with her husband that I and the rest of our family just use her and take her for her money and her sincerity. I was just like where the hell did this come from and I told her thanks for everything, but I hope you realize there’s better things out there and get a divorce if it just weren’t for the kids.\n\nTL;DR \nMy sister’s husband acts like a condescending prick to everyone and I told her I wish she would just get a divorce even though they have kids.

      "description": "So I play FIFA pro clubs with a few friends every night or so. You basically make your own player and control that player for the entire game.\n\nWe’ve done well over a couple hundred games and are in a top division, our usual tactic is for me to make a giant who gets crossed the ball for me to head it in easily.\n\nI recently decided I didn’t really enjoy it too much, I mean it’s okay but I’d like to be challenged more and enjoy the game more, rather than exploiting the gameplay for easy goals. I got bored of how repetitive it was.\n\nSo I decided to remake my pro to look exactly like me, with my name, my height and most importantly my position - RB (my real life football position) \n\nWe drew the first two games and lost the 3rd. Throughout all three games my teammate, M, would make passive aggressive comments pressuring me to go back to our usual tactic (me up front as a giant heading balls in). \n\nEvery time I lost the ball, slipped up, was slightly out of position or made even a minor mistake - he’d call it out. \n\nAnytime he or anyone else made an error, I’d say nothing - because it’s a game, we’re here to have fun, not play competitively. \n\nAnyways, before the third game ended he quit the game and switched over to Fortnite, citing my position change as the reason we weren’t winning anymore. I refused to move back, saying I didn’t enjoy playing up front anymore and he said “we don’t enjoy losing all the time”.\n\nAm I the asshole for resisting my friends’ call to change back? My other friends agree with M and the 3 of them all want me to change back to striker.. but for me this is a game, and I’d rather lose having fun than win but feel like I’m only there out of obligation.

      "description": "So a while back, I was getting pretty serious with a girl late into highschool (who now hates me and I am 100% sure her friends do too over this). The summer of the year before I went to college, I came back from camp, and she was distant. Lost her mind on me when I went to hang out with friends as well. A week later, she went to her churches camp, and dumped me while there. She talked about how we don't communicate, all of these issues she had with me, and how I didn't care. None of this came up before now. She made all of these promises with me how we would talk about this stuff.\n\nA week later, she is dating my best friend, after she said she couldn't date anyone after a decently long relationship. Needless to say, I was in no way shape or form in a good place. And knowing him well, he would want sex from her. I know damn well she would say no. She called me a liar, and talked about how sweet he was, etc.\n\n3 weeks into their relationship, he starts sending her suggestive photos to say the least.\n\nShe comes back crying to me, confused as to why he did that. This is my first AITA. I straight up told her, \"I told you he would do this, I told you why. *I told you so.*\"\n\nYea. She did not take it well, but came back regardless. And, to my later ire, I accepted. She even reinstituted our 'anniversary' as if that everything that did happen just didn't exist at all.\n\nFast forward to me moving to college. 6 months later. I arrive at college, and we talked incessantly. (In hindsight, I really should not have taken her back.) She would talk about going to a party *in which the host had a crush on her for years*. I asked her not to go. She went. I asked her how it went later and she denied ever sending the text. She would sometimes dissappear for days on end.\n\nI was getting tired of it, months of it, and I met a girl who made me realize that, not all girls are that way, and, I could get someone who really cared about me and my oppinions. She became my confidant, and I ended up really liking her. Like a lot. BUT I DID NOT ENTER A RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS GIRL OTHER THAN FRIENDSHIP. Hardly ever alone together aside from the occasional lunch together. Mostly hung out in classes and studied together in groups.\n\n(Second judgement time) Two days before the 'anniversary', I sent my GF a text that we were through. I couldnt take it any longer. I also felt that pushing it beyond the anniversary would just make it worse, and make me feel worse.\n\nIt took her, IIRC, three days to even respond to that. She called me sobbing, begging pleading, asking what she did wrong, even though I made it known to her.\n\nWinter break she tried to try again, and after repeated begging, I gave her a chance after she promised me it would be better. Three weeks in back at college, I was so busy, I barely texted or called anyone. Got a breakup text from her (after telling her I would be swamped). Didn't much care at that point. I felt it was going to happen anyways.\n\nSo, AITA x2?",

      "description": "Sorry if the formatting sucks, I'm on mobile.\n\nNight before last, my daughter (7) was up at 4am with stomach pain and vomiting, but it seemed to calm down and she was fine all day, until about 6pm when she started saying it was hurting again, which progressed to full-blown sobbing her heart out and writing.\n\nI told my partner to take her straight to the Walk-In Centre, which she did (we have a 1-year-old, so I had to stay home). It usually takes about 2-3 hours, we both assumed she'd be home by like 9-10pm. She didn't take her phone as it wasn't charged and she didn't see the point.\n\nHer mum ran her up, and she texted me around 9pm to say they were sending her to the hospital for more tests, which meant a lengthy A&amp;E wait. This was fine, I'd just have to stay up until she was home, since she ALWAYS forgets her keys.\n\nMidnight comes and still no word, then 1am, 2am etc and I'm worrying about what's happening, my palms are itching, I'm chain-smoking, I feel sick to my stomach etc - but SURELY if she was admitted she'd find a way to contact me? I've memorised her number for this exact reason, and I've had the same number for the duration of our relationship.\n\nFast-forward to 6am, I still haven't slept, no word of what's happening, and I bite the bullet and ring the hospital. They let me know she was admitted last night and they were both fast asleep in her room. \n\nI'm trying to be chill and think of how stressed my fiancée must have been, but I'm fuming. Why hasn't she got my number memorised for literal medical emergencies like our daughter being admitted to hospital? Her mum must have gone home, why would she not ask her to let me know what's happened? Why didn't she take her phone and charger on the off-chance she was admitted?\n\nI've been awake all night, itching and worrying to the point of near vomiting. It's 7am now, I can hear the baby babbling away and I've gotta get her up, changed, fed and play with her on over 24 hours without sleep. I'm terrified of falling asleep sat-up while I'm the only one in the house and her hurting herself.\n\nI've left my number with the ward and they're gonna get her to call me when she's up and I feel like I'm gonna be a huge asshole for being upset that I've been left out of the loop about my own daughter being admitted, and that maybe I should just bottle it up like I don't care.",

      "description": "So awhile ago I (18M)  went on like three dates with this girl (19) and I guess I should say from the start I wasn’t looking for anything as serious as she was. I live in Washington and admittedly I smoke a lot of weed (not just recreationally, I have an eating disorder+sleep problems) and she knew that and I think that’s why she liked to talk a lot about smoking weed which is fine although annoying at times. She talks of big game so she said she wanted to smoke with me and I won’t sugar coat it when I say I can handle my fair share of THC. Dabs, or oil, is the oils that come from the bud of the plant and it is a lot stronger than just your average weed. In the past I’ve had people dab around me for their first time and they got very sick so when she was telling me she wanted to try dabs I was very hesitant but she was very persistent and talked about how much she smokes so I said alright and gave her a really really small dab (definitely the size of a dab that wouldn’t even phase someone who smoked as much as she claimed). We sat on my couch for about a half hour in silence and she just sat on her phone. Eventually she leaned forward and was shaking really badly so I told her she might wanna go to the bathroom if she’s feeling sick and she did. She was in there for about an hour before she crawled out on her hands and knees (not making this up), on the phone with her mom who was yelling at her to talk to me. Great. She I call her mom down tell her it’s only weed she just needs to sleep. Her mom says her dad is on the way to pick her up. Again, great. I get her on my couch and she is fading in and out of consciousness and I’m telling her to keep checking her phone cause her dads on his way and then she tells me he’s gonna come get her from my room. She instantly I start getting crazy anxiety that this strange man I’ve never met before is gonna come get his daughter from my room while she’s high as fuck. After maybe ten minutes of contemplating what I should do and hiding my rigs and bongs, I deceived to get her to the front door if I had to carry her up. I told her that and she stands up just fine and walks to my living room couch. Her dad gets there she seems like she’s just fine and just leaves. About a half hour later I pick up my friend and we go back to my house. I open my bathroom door for the first time since I’ve been back and there is literally chunks and chunks of puke all over the floor. Not only did she not try to clean it up she didn’t even tell me about it. It’s been a couple weeks and she went on a trip to Hawaii and we were gonna hang out when she got back, but honestly I’ve been kind of weirded out by the whole situation and I’ve more or less ghosted her. Am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for asking my bf to slow down his drinking?",
      "description": "So a bit of backstory-I come from a substance abusing family.Ive never done drugs or anything of the sort myself but most of my relatives are composed of functioning alcoholics, drug addicts or a mix of the two.He has never had a problem with my fears until now.\n\nTonight he drank more than usual.Which isnt a problem for me.But he was crashing into things, dropping his phone etc &amp; just causing me to worry in general.The last straw was when he went to sit down &amp; tipped in his chair nearly smashing his head against the desk.I told him he was scaring me &amp; that I wanted him to slow down until dinner was ready(about 20 minutes at that point).He said “I’m fine”. Mind you I dont doubt that hes okay physically I’m just concerned.I know I would have been overreacting to ask him to stop drinking all together which is why I opted to ask him to slow down until he had some food in his system.I didnt think this was asking much for all of 20 minutes.But this blew up.He kept repeating I’m fine over &amp; over until I finally said “well Im not Im scared!”He said “I know my limitations,I can f*cking get up for work tomorrow,I can handle myself,you dont need to worry,Im fine”. This time much angrier.\n\nThis went back &amp; forth until he pointed out he hadnt drank since he sat down.Which is true.But from my perspective it was because we were too busy arguing not because he was choosing not to.I asked him if it was planned which he insisted “Im fine” should have conveyed &amp; it was my problem for interpreting it wrong.I told him I took it how anyone else would in the situation.If you angrily say “Im fine!” That doesn’t convey “okay Ill slow down”. I even gave him an example / if you go to a bar &amp; tell a guy hes drank too much &amp;he says “Im fine,I know my limits” that tells you he doesnt think he needs to stop.He then accused me of getting mad over the phrasing. Once again back &amp; forth where(I admit I went into a scolding tone w it unintentionally) I resorted to telling him the difference.While “okay” &amp; “fine” are interchangeable &amp; either by itself are words of confirmation, saying “Im” in front of it turns it from agreement to description. \n\nHe refuses to admit that he wasnt conveying his words, saying its my fault for not understanding.I told him that if he had been conveying it perfectly like he claims I wouldve understood right away.All he had to say was “okay” or anything to that effect -rather than defend his limits.He then ignored me at every attempt to speak insisting he had to eat &amp; to sleep going as far as to push me out of the way(not roughly I’m not claiming physical abuse &amp;he has never been physical with me).He insisted I only wanted to hear that I was right &amp; he was wrong. I admit I didn’t do well with the situation but in the end..am I the ass? Did I just really not understand what he was saying?Honest feed back please\n\nTL;DR Asked Bf to slow down on alcohol for 20 minutes until dinner, turned into an argument about his limits and our communication.Am I the ass?",

      "description": "AITA? I recently downloaded an app that pays you based off how many steps you take. It requires a Fitbit to be connected to it. Unfortunately my Fitbit is 7 years old and no longer works how it's supposed to. My dad received a Fitbit as a gift, but has stopped using it, and it's been sitting in a drawer for months. I asked my dad if I could use it and he said sure- at first. Then my mom jumped in.\n\nMom: \"You want a Fitbit? You have to earn it. A week of cleaning the bathroom.\" Me: \"I wanted the fitbit to earn money from excersizing. What's the point of paying $200 for a new fitbit to earn back less than that on an app? Besides, I wasn't asking for a new one. I just wanted to borrow dad's. It's just been sitting there for 3 months.\" Mom: \"No. It's his. You want a Fitbit, you have to earn it. Two weeks of cleaning the bathroom.\" Me: \"You JUST said one week.. a new Fitbit is $200, why cant I just use one we already own? He doesn't even use it, it's been collecting dust..\" Mom: \"200?! I'm not paying $200 for a Fitbit, too bad, you're not getting one.\" Me: \"Why are you even getting involved? I came in here asking DAD if I could borrow HIS Fitbit to earn money and hopefully be motivated to excersize more because of it. This doesn't make any sense. You're being ridiculous.\" Mom: \"No YOU'RE being ridiculous! You can't use it. You're going to break it or something.\" For the record, I've never shown any record of returning broken objects to them. I believe she just wanted an excuse..\n\nSo after a screaming match of how I'm not incompetent enough to just flat out break a fucking Fitbit, now, here I am on reddit, asking if I'm asking too much. Be honest. Am I being an asshole for requesting to borrow my dad's fitbit for this purpose (to earn money on the app) or is my mom overreacting to this whole thing?",

      "title": "AITA for kissing my best friend in front of an old friend who “likes” him",
      "description": "A little back ground; my best friend (T) is a guy and has been my best friend for about four or five years now. In high school we had a third mutual friend (M), who was actually one of my best friends. She likes drama and has a strong knack for making up stories to sound more interesting than she is. This is the main reason we actually chose to cut her off a little while back. She also has been “in love” (no I don’t believe it’s that serious) with my best friend since they were freshmen in high school. \nAs of very recently me and T started fooling around. There are feelings but neither of us want anything serious so that’s all it is. But we decided that we should reach back out to M and try mending bridges. \n\nThis is where we might have been assholes. \nShe apologized to me recently for lying like she had, and we wanted to see if she’d actually changed that, and if she really wanted to be friends again. To test this, we planned on seeing how she handled us being a thing, because as I said, she’s “in love” with him, because honestly if the roles between myself and M were reversed, I’d have been okay with it and happy for her. So, we planned on meeting up at her place, drinking, smoking, and having a good time. Things she also agreed to and said she’d take equal part in. To be safe, we had her bring over her best friend as well. Just Incase we couldn’t hold ourselves and got too touchy with one another. \nWell lo and behold, we didn’t hold ourselves well and ended up just making out for a little bit. This probably wouldn’t have been too bad, had M’s best friend not bailed to be with her new boyfriend, and had M had more than two shots for the whole night like she said she would. She had been almost completely sober while the rest of us were heavily inebriated. When we go to call it a night, she refuses to sleep in her room, with us like planned (I was going to be on the floor, not with T) and texts our group chat asking her best friend to come back because she’s upset and she includes a gif of someone crying. T and I see this, say f-it, and cuddled up together on a large bean bag M had in her room. \nThe next morning T and I apologized for being so touchy and she accepts it, but obviously shies away from the topic, and according to T, when I was away from them, she was very very interested in where I spent the night. He didn’t lie to her about it. \n\nHere’s where I think she turned into the asshole. We spent the morning talking about random things (to note T and I had been awake for hours before her and had gotten high again) and all seemed well until she realized just how high we were. Lies started coming left and right, and I caught much more of them than T did. But almost all of them fell in line with the same ideas that she didn’t like people who dated T because she loved T first. Some notable ones where me and her joking about her taste in men (the opposite of T) and saying “yeah well I like T” to which I countered “so do I. Talk dark and handsome, win win win”. Another one was a story about T’s younger sister asking M what she thought about one of his ex’s while we were in high school still. This story didn’t happen, T’s sister wouldn’t have talked to M and didn’t care about T or his girlfriend at the time, but she ended it by looking at me and saying “I told her I don’t know but I don’t like anyone who gets with T so it doesn’t matter to me”. Another one was her talking about pretending to fight over T and her comments again seemed directed at me; “I knew him first”, “I’ve liked him longer”, “we kissed first” (story to that, she swindled him into kissing her once when he was very very drunk and he has done nothing but regret it since). She also took time to dig at some of his ex’s (yes most were horrible but she chose to dig on the ones that were not at all), specifically in s way that seemed to make it very clear anyone who “took” T from her was wrong. I wish T and I had left and that was as bad as it got. But no. \nWe ended up st the mall walking around later, and T and I are still high, so I step out to get a drink for me and him (I offered to get her one and she said no. I’m not a dick, maybe) and while I was waiting for them, he came over to me and told me that she had wrapped her arms around him and was leaning all over him in the store. So he pulled away and left to wait with me. For the rest of the afternoon, she continued like this, he’d want to wait for my by the bathroom, she’d say “it’s not far just stay here” and get weird about him waiting for me. I pointed out some shirts that would’ve suited T, she seemed to want to make it into a competition about what suited him. He sat next to me in the car and she actually whined about it. Like literally said “no T you have to sit next to me instead” absolutely nothing about me sitting near her. \nFinally her “thing that’s not until 4” suddenly became a “thing I need to leave for ASAP at 2pm” so we said bye and left. \n\n\nTLDR; Me and my best friend got intoxicated and made out in front of a mutual ex best friend who’s a notorious liar and “loves” my best friend. After apologizing for being inappropriate, she spent the day making it clear, through made up stories and lies, that anyone who “takes” him from her is bad for him and wrong. ",

I am not in a position to file for refugee status so I can leave (City). Is (same country, different city) cheaper living?\" so I look on his page first, and see he lists he's BORN in my country, I live in Canada... I interrupted it as he wanted to be a refugee to get income support even though he lists he is Canadian born, so I posted the definition of a refugee, nothing else.\n\n A girl asks me \"what degree are you completing\" I say \"Lmao? You're asking me what degree I'm completing even though someone wants to file to be a REFUGEE because they cant find a job?\" then they go on to assume this person is not born in Canada and that they want \"resettlement assistance\" to move somewhere less expensive, and says my ignorance overpowers my insensitivity... so I simply replied \"Sorry, but I'm not going to assume someone who lists they're born in (Canadian City) is not Canadian born.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was not POSTING the definition of a refugee, to invalidate him if he is truly from a different country and has migrated here, I am not anti-refugee, and was insulted because I thought this person was basically trying to escape a developed country, just because its expensive, because that's what the post made it sound like.

      "description": "Several years ago, when I was playing baseball in college, we took a road trip down to play a team in our conference. Being in Division II sports, we were never put up in the nicest of hotels, and in this case we stayed at Ramada off the highway. This trip was probably the 4th or 5th time we stayed here. We slept four to a room, and after we checked in, every single room in the hotel was occupied for the night.\n\nWhen we arrived at our hotel room, the window facing outside was **covered** in moths. I'm not exaggerating when I say an entire nest of moths occupied the air conditioner inside. Probably 50-75 of those suckers made that room their home. It must have been weeks since anyone else had stayed the night there. So, my roommates precede to swat the crap out of them for fun in order to rid of the mess. I, on the other hand, thought that even if we were paying $45 a night or less, this was completely unacceptable.\n\nI immediately went to the front desk and demanded we get moved. They told me this was not possible, as, like I mentioned, the hotel was completely booked. So, instead, they begrudgingly handed me a broom and a trash bin to clean up the mess of dead moths. I was furious! Am I the asshole for subsequently yelling at person at the front desk for some sort of compensation even though I was a college student who didn't technically pay for the room anyways?\n\nWe did end up staying two nights in that room, moth guts and all.",

This user(T we’ll call him) has had issues with mental health but tries his best to be a good person to be around. A and T started having conflict when T wasn’t in a good mood. A provoked T, which caused him to leave. T returned shortly and said he was sorry, but A didn’t. A, trying to be edgy (I think? I have no idea) left only to return not an hour later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe’s used the NSFW channel way too much. It got so bad that C(He’s important for the main reason I’m writing this) gave him a role that bans him from seeing the NSFW channel. The ban lasted a day. A begged C to give him the channel back, even though it was only for a day. He used it much more the next day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to the main point. C and his girlfriend recently broke up. C is really, really, really sad about this. Poor guy wrote some really sad shit. Anyway, A decided to go on a little rant about how lonely he is and how he won’t have any kids. This pissed off C. A lot of other users are DMing us mods and admins about the issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, Would I Be the Asshole for banning him? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "First post about a topic in general and I need feedback.\n\nI’m a sophomore in high school and I went on a trip to Disney last week as part of being in the school’s music program.\n\nI was randomly assigned to a room with 3 other roommates, one of them being a friend of mine that I got to know better over the course of the trip. On the second day of the trip, he met this girl in my grade and decided to hang out with her friend group. My friend asked if I wanted to tag along with them and I said yes. The friend group originally only consisted of girls, so the only guys would just be my friend and myself.\n\nWhen I was out with the group however, I just either said nothing when other people were talking (mostly I was either thinking about some of the attractions I saw at the areas or I guess I was just shy and would never have anything to say) and at some points, I would always drift away from the group but then come back right after. At one point, in excruciating heat, I was at a line for a food stand that I wasn’t going to even pay, so I found a spot for myself outside of the line and sat down. My friend came over to me and asked if I was okay and I told him yes. When the other friends in the group came to where I was, I said that I found a spot for us to sit down and they didn’t really say anything.\n\nI clarified with my friend that I wasn’t purposefully distancing myself from the group because I didn’t like them. He said it was fine and all that, yet I didn’t talk about this with the other girls in the group. I’m probably overthinking this, but I think that I made them believe that I don’t like them or something.\n\nAITA for doing this type of stuff? ",

      "description": "Little background I lived with my mom two sisters and my asshole step father....Dick. Anyway we owned 4 cats 3 Siamese Simba, Timba, Kimba and our Russian Blue Houdini. We had them for years Simba for 18. Over time my sisters and I left the house.  Our abusive step-dad DICK and... long story short, he hurt my mom and now going through a really really ugly divorce. But due to some kind bullshit legal reasons he cannot enter hes house....for now (he owns it completely).\n\nMy mom lost her job due to her own bullshit so she has no money, and she can not stay at that home forever sense it is hes home. We realized this is getting to the point she is begging people to take the cats and save them. No one we know and family likes cats except me (but I can't take them sense I live with grandpa who hates them) so I decided to put this into my own hands.\n\nI made contact with a kind rescue I worked with in the past, I even made sure they will take them by donating a 1000 dollars to them (these people take care of their cats). Mom was not having it. I understand she is going through a emotional roller coaster. But she can't keep the cats. If she leaves them he will kill them I mean that. So shes calling me awful for getting rid of her cats saying she loves them and does everything for them.....even thou Simba had rotting teeth and was skinny because she never taken them to the vet......btw I had to get them all updated with shots and examines that cost a total another 1000 dollars plus 3 giant bags of cat food to sweeten the deal with the rescue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know alot of you are thinking \"They're other options\"...I'm sorry but there wasn't... I tried everything even begging my circle of friends to take them....\n\nAnyway I explained to her in detail they will be safe and the Siamese will stay together...Houdini is a lone wolf. STILL thinks I'm a asshole and going to send them into kennels where they will put them down. I keep trying to tell her they don't do that, but my Mother goes on these fantasies shes going to get a job and a apartment...which wouldn't happen sad to say (In her state and the fact shes drinking like a horse isn't really proving anything to me). She has even gone as far as to fuck my relationship with these people over just so they wouldn't go. The only place that is willing to save them and she is going to ruin it. I had a enough. So I made the arrangements. I got all the cats and gave me them up. Tears were shed....But I know my Mom hates me for this but I didn't feel had any other choice for them. I even made sure I get updates from them so she knows they're safe. They all have new homes and are loved but I can tell shes still unhappy with it.   Shes in that house for only so long before she is forced out and then what? Have her actually leave them there or give them up to a kill shelter (SHE EVEN SAID TO ME SHE RATHER PUT THEM DOWN THEN LOOK) So reddit.....AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR I forced my mom to give up her cats so she can leave my step dads house without fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Mom is doing well shes leaving my Step-dads home and trying to quit drinking. She understanding with the cats and seems happy they're ok.",

      "description": "Hi all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the summer, me and my (now current) girlfriend went on a break during this past summer. We both saw other people and came to the conclusion that what we have is awesome. Long story short, we're back together now and doing well! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrior to our breakup, we had two years of history together. We were each other's first everything. During that break at the beginning of summer, we both decided we weren't happy with were we were due to immature 'young love' circumstances. I initiated the breakup and she immediately rebounded with some guy she didn't know, let's call him jake, that her friend kept pushing for. THIS isn't what I'm upset about -- I understand that we weren't exclusive so everyone was fair game. However, her friend that introduced her to him, let's call her Britney, was outspoken against everything I did and did not approve, threw me shade, etc. Even before this, her friend would be SUPER emotional, irrational, and treat her like shit which I didn't like -- and I think her friend caught onto that which is why she didn't like me, who knows. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward to tonight: we're out to dinner having some pizza when she tells me that she's inviting this friend to her party -- the same friend that pushed her to start dating Jake. She's the only mutual friend here, so I 100% associate her with that experience and as a place of weakness and bad memories for me. Honestly, not only do I not like this person because of her shittiness to my girlfriend, but she also symbolizes a time in my life where she was having relations with another guy which doesn't leave me with a good feeling in my stomach (I know, fair game but it still hurts me because I love her so much). I expressed my insecurities toward her at dinner and she got upset with me for being an asshole about it not letting go of the past. The thing is, every time I see Britney I'm still so reminded of it... ESPECIALLY given that she's the only mutual friend connected with Jake (and they sometimes see each other when hanging out on occasion).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being insecure about this? I wish it were easier to deal with but man... ",

I left home at 18 (am 23 now living with my bf of 6 years). She helps us a ton, she's a great person I just wish she wasn't so impulsive so she wouldn't be in this situation right now.\n\nShe's not paying rent but the house owner is an old lady we all thought was sweet before (offered mom a place to live to get back on her feet and never said she expected anything back for it, just that she be there so she wasn't lonely). Turns out she's a bitch to put it lightly and whenever my mom leaves, unless it's to go to work or run this lady's errands, she complains a lot to anyone that will listen and then give my mom attitude. So mom can't visit her bf that lives a couple hours away on the weekends without the lady flipping out, so mom started asking me to stay at her house during the weekends so she would shut up about \"always being alone\" (which is false she has family and *some* friends that visit everyday and live a few blocks away). I don't like doing this but mom helps me out and so I do.\n\nYesterday was this lady's birthday and she had a few people there. I went in, said \"hi I'm staying the night with bf here in case you need anything, have a good night!\" and she was nice enough but the moment I entered my mom's side of the house (they're connected) I heard her say that I'm basically a useless crybaby because I called my boyfriend ONCE to come pick me up because there was a huge frog in the room (it's a tiny 2 room house) and I couldn't stand it. Her friends said she was being harsh and that I seemed lovely but she said \"no she's not that great, she'll just leave me alone and what if something happens to meeee\". This isn't the first time she's talked shit about me.\n\nThis isn't fair because we live 3km away and have gone to stay the night whenever my mom asks for like a year now even with rain, or in the cold, and even if we have to take a 20 minute detour because when it rains our bridge gets flooded... We always go and pretend we like her, talk to her and tell her to call us if she needs anything. We even offer to run her errands and stuff so why is she complaining just because one time I got freaked out and left?\n\nI figured \"no one's paying me to babysit an ungreatful old hag\" and so texted my mom that yesterday would be the last time I stayed there and she could figure something out herself for getting herself in that situation even though everyone told her not to.\n\nI already do my mom favors like take her cat to the vet each week even though it's 3km away from my house and just a few blocks away from hers', and my bf and I groom her dog for free in the summer, and we will fetch her stuff if she's feeling lazy to go out herself. I do anything I can for her so I feel like we're even and I shouldn't have to put up with this bs anymore.",

As I am parking my car i scraped my friends car pretty badly causing some damage to the side. \n\nOne of our other friends family member works in a garage so we sent him pictures to get a rough estimate of what it would be to get it fixed. I straight away bank transferred him the money and that was that, no problem. \n\nIt is worth noting that this friend is almost always broke and borrowing money from people, as he has a pretty bad drug habit and is basically spending every penny he gets going out and getting wasted.  \n\nBefore I type the next paragraph I am fully aware that I owed him the money regardless for causing the damage, that's not my issue, basically he took the money and didn't get his car fixed and instead went on a night out that night (100% with the money I transferred him) and when the friend who got him the repair quote asked him if he wanted to take it to his family members garage he said he didn't really care about the damage. \n\nHis car is pretty old and beat up and I understand that it does not matter whether its brand new or 20 years old but I just feel a bit pissed off that he didn't get the car repaired with the money.\n\nWhat are your guys thoughts?",

      "description": "My SO does not drive. They have been practicing and have gotten close to getting their license, but I have the been the driver our entire relationship. I feel as though this issue is partially my fault as I have a tendency to say yes when someone asks for a favour even if it inconveniences me. I worry that I may have spoiled my SO by agreeing to give them rides whenever they ask.\n\nA couple of days ago they asked if they could get a ride to a friends place at around 6. That’s around when I start to wind down after I clean up the house and shower but whatever a 25 minute ride isn’t the end of the world, so of course I say yes. At about 5 they asked if they could get a ride later that night. I hesitated to respond as it was obviously not the first thing I wanted to do in the middle of the night on a work night, but I said “sure.”\n\nSO - “Well nevermind you seem really upset about it.”\n\n“I’m not upset, I said I’ll give you the ride.”\n\nSO- “I just wouldn’t ask you for this if I wasn’t feeling so shitty the past few days.”\n\n“I know, I’ll give you a ride.”\n\nSO-“Well you don’t really seem up to it.  I’m just going to bus home if you’re going to make me feel guilty about it. I just figured you’d be up anyways because you don’t ever go to bed that early.”\n\n“Ok. Well now I’m upset because I’m going to feel guilty no matter what decision I make at this point.”\n\nSO- “I’m just upset because you said yes but you clearly were pissed off about it.”\n\nYes. It was painfully obvious that I was not thrilled about it. She should have expected at least the tinsiest bit of hesitation when she asked, which is really all that happened. I hesitated to say yes, and in my opinion I feel I had every right to be at least a TINY bit upset about doing it, but I still feel like an ass hole for not wanting to do it because she is feeling a bit under the weather and shouldn’t be doomed to an hour and a half long bus ride.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hi, so kind of a long post sorry ahead of time. I am a dad of a four year old and a one year old. I have been getting up at 5am Tuesday and Thursday to go workout and do martial arts for 2 hours. I get home about 8:30 but have to get ready and go to work so these are two mornings my wife does the kids solo, getting the older one ready for school and dropping him off a few blocks away at his preschool (usually my responsibility). On Saturday afternoon I do the kids solo for 5 hours while she writes. She is trying to monetize it (she is a stay at home mom) but it is her passion and she really enjoys doing it. On my end I don't care what she does those hours or if she ever makes a cent, it is nice for her to have a break and a little time alone. The problem that has arisen is that my early mornings have started to be disruptive to sleep for my 4 year old a little. The one year old we take turns sleeping with and the other person sleeps with the four year old. I sleep with the 4 year old before my workouts and he has started to wake up early and then wakes everyone up. He wakes up at some point after I have left the room and becomes scared. The one year old wakes up any time between 5-7 so it doesn't matter for her but it can be tough when she would like to sleep in but he wakes everyone up. My wife has said I should stop doing the early mornings and do stuff in the evening instead. I don't like that idea as I really want to be there for bed time (I used to travel a lot for work and missed a bunch first few years of older kids life) so it feels extra important to me to be there when I can. I have kind of a draining job so that also makes it difficult to go work out in the evening as I typically feel pretty worn out. I also don't really have any friends and I don't have other things I do outside the house (putter in garage shop when I can) so these two early mornings are literally the only times I am going and socializing and doing things outside of work stuff. Occasional work meetings for breakfast (I am a field employee and the three of us in the area sometimes meet with our manager) but I basically never go out and do stuff. These early mornings feel important to me as I like the people I work out with and it is a time that works for me. I would like to try and make these early mornings work, which I think we can do, but my wife wants me to stop and go work out in the evening instead which feels hard for me to do. The essence of the question I think is, is it fair to prioritize myself for these two mornings and argue we should try to make it work? I feel it is as we prioritize her every Saturday afternoon but it is impossible to be objective here. Thanks for any input and I will try to keep an eye on this post to answer any questions.",

      "description": "First time posting, if I do anything wrong, please tell me.\n\nSo here's the story: I'm currently on exchange in a foreign country and speak that language just a little. Currently I am taking classes to become more fluent. \n\nI met this guy two weeks ago after we matched on Bumble and I met him once. After that it's been mainly texting since I'm usually busy with the workload of studying and he works in an office. \n\nWe spoke about movies and I joked about Netflix and chill. I'm not fluent but sending laughing emojis repeatedly should be enough of an indication I was joking I think. He said he's at a friend's house which is nearby the neighborhood I live in (he only knows the neighborhood I live in, not exactly where I live). And since we talked about Netflix and Chill, he asked me if I wanted to \"watch a movie\" at my place and I laughed it off. \n\nSome time later he said he's in the neighborhood and he's waiting for me at a cafe. I started panicking and ignored his text. I don't have a lot of sexual experience, and the topic of sex makes me a bit anxious. Though I knew I should have said \"no, I don't want to\", I ended up coming up with an excuse that my mom called me because I was too much of a wussface to tell the truth. \n\nHe still waited. He waited for an hour. Eventually I said my mom was upset and I couldn't come and he said that he was upset that he couldn't drop by. I told him I understood and apologised and that's been that.\n\nAITA for doing this?",

      "description": "So I had a Redbox rental disc that was returning to the Redbox location. this location was in a Vons right inside the door opening and had two adjacent boxes. I was kind of in a hurry as I had to drive for an hour to make it to an engagement celebration. I went in but there was an older man with a cart fumbling around in a black bag. He was blocking one box(nearest to the door), and his cart was blocking the other. I normally would have gone to the box furthest from the door if the closer one had been occupied but I didnt think he was going to be using Redbox as he had no discs out to return and had been standing there for a fair amount of time without using the box. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM-Me ..............OM-older man\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM:Excuse me, I need to use the box (holding up Redbox disc) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhe looked so damn taken back and offended, it took all I had not to roll my eyes to the back of my head. he moved, albeit grudgingly and I was able to use the box. I began the return process when he very snidely says to me \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOM: So I should be expected to move and not you huh? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM:excuse me? I didnt think moving a few steps would be so hard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nat this point he finally took out his Redbox disc and begins his own return process. he said some other things I don't quite remember as this happened about two weeks ago, but his general annoyance was that he had to move when he was planning on using Redbox. in my defense I didn't know he was going to use it, and he was blocking both boxes, and I asked him politely to move. he started raising his voice, going on about my entitlement. I was done with my business, it was a relativity few short minutes and just moved away from him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM:i don't need to talk to you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd promptly left. Should I have been more understanding, apologized, or asked him to move his cart from the second box so I could use it? He literally took 2/3 steps to his right so I could use Redbox. I feel like it was such a simple request and he was making a big deal out of  it. If age matters, Im 24 and he looked to be around 50/60? I was also wearing a very flashy and colorful Indian dress (salwar chemise) if that makes any difference and he was wearing everyday clothes. so reddit, AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nshort version. asked an older man to move so I could use Redbox, he got pissy cause I asked him to move. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hello r/AmItheAsshole\\-rs,\n\nIhope this is the right place for my story. I don't want to reveal too many details because I'm certain friends, family and involved parties will recognize this situation. However, I am willing to answer any questions that I can if required.\n\nNow on to the story: there has been a huge blow-up in my life with respect to my family in the last 9 months. I feel my (32F) stepsister (28F) betrayed me, but my stepsister feels I am solely to blame for her actions, the blow-up and resultant falling-out. I agree to some of her accusations, but know that she is just as much if not more to blame for this situation. I know I haven't been the best person 100% of the time to my stepsister, and I am completely willing to apologize for any of my missteps and misdeeds, but the same needs to come from her if we are to ever settle this.\n\nNow, my stepsister has a history of being hot-headed, irrational and a bully. I know this, all of my friends know this, and even my family knows this too. My dad and stepmother want us to reconnect, make up and get along again so that we can have our usual family functions with everyone present. They've made this known and have made various attempts to get us to be friends with no success. My dad and stepmother are planning a holiday party that will be happening in the coming week with a bunch of friends and family coming together - some even coming from other countries. You all probably see where this is going. They want us to hurry up and reconcile and are putting pressure on us both to do this so that we will both be in attendance at this party and behave. I completely understand their desire here, but I feel they are not acting appropriately by trying to force us to make up like children.\n\nNow, I am willing to make some concessions, to apologize and to try to take the steps necessary to repair our relationship, but I absolutely need any apology that comes from her to be because she sees what she did was wrong and hurtful and actually wants apologize. I do not want her to do this because a) she wants to go to a big fun party, and/or b) because her stepmother pressured her into it and/or she just wants to keep the peace as well. I need to to understand that what she did was unacceptable. I lost all of my trust with my her, and I feel that an apology due to either of the reasons would be insincere, and I would not trust her again as a result. I mean, I could pretend to make things right without actually trusting her, but I don't want to act the rest of my life as though I do. I don't want to live a lie, because I know that might eventually come back to bite me in the ass. The family members are asking me to take whatever I can get and if I don't get an apology, that I should just apologize to her and and give her a pass (basically validate her terrible behavior) in order to keep the peace.\n\nSo, this brings me to my questions:\n\n1) WIBTA if I politely ask my dad and stepmother to kindly stay out of this and let us sort it out on our own in private and on our own terms?\n\n2) WIBTA if I refuse to cave in just to keep the peace?",

None of this is ever unprovoked. I always warn people first and make sure that they hear me. I only do this when I know it's going to cause me lots of distress, and will only do this if people are doing something antagonistic (like, loud noises hurt my ears, but I'd never threaten to hit someone if they don't quiet down). Am I being childish? I don't think so, because I've asked them nicely and want to teach them that they can't just walk all over me. Also, I never go past what I threaten; I never do the thing multiple times, and I only do what I say I'm going to do, and I don't do this to kids, who wouldn't know better. Am I the asshole, or are the people who fuck with me? Do they have a right to complain that I did this?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my friends to stop talking to my ex?",
      "description": "For context, my ex and I go to brother-sister schools and he is a year level above me. Our schools are only somewhat familiar with each other.\n\nWhen we were dating, my friend added us to a group chat with some people from both my and my ex's schools that I knew. My ex didn't know my schoolmates. We all got along well. I got closer with my schoolmates.\n\nMy ex is popular and friendly, so he ended up getting DMs from everyone in the group chat. I was slightly jealous that he was getting all of that attention and I didn't get much in general, and that my friends were having more and better conversations with him than I was.\n\nIn his defence, I do know quite a lot of his friends, who I met before we started dating. I stopped talking to a lot of his friends while we were dating because I didn't want him to be jealous or anything. We started talking again after he and I broke up.\n\nLater, I got super busy for a week, and kind of abandoned my social media without telling anyone. When I went back on my social media, I have two notifications: a DM from a classmate about homework, and the group chat I mentioned earlier. I read the messages through the group chat, as you do, and I see my ex had been active in it. But he hadn't bothered to check up on why I had gone for a week.\n\nI asked him later, in person, if he still liked me romantically. He said no, so we broke up. I still liked him a lot. After the breakup, I left our group chat out of anger. While that group chat is dead (I asked about it later), my ex and my friends are still pretty close. Closer than I am with them.\n\nMy friend was in that group chat and shared some classes with me. She is a chatterbox, and often talks about how she hates her ex, who also lost romantic interest in her. She told me she doesn't know he still has friends, because to her he's literal garbage. She will describe in great detail how she wants to beat him up (she's a black belt in some martial art) and how \"he's dead if he ever visits (our school)\".\n\nShe also talks about how she's still great friends with my ex. Apparently, they made a new group chat, with more of my friends, and not me. I asked her if I could be invited to it. She said \"Sorry, we have a 'no exes' rule because we don't want drama.\"\n\nI wanted to join this new group chat because 1. I still want to be friends with my ex, 2. I don't have any social interaction beyond the old group chat, and 3. I don't want my ex to get with any of my friends, because I would get insanely jealous of them.\n\nIt drives me nuts that my friends have this great new friend, who I still like, and exclude me from their social interactions now because of him. I haven't made an effort to try to get back into our social circle, because I really don't have the energy to be positive and happy now that my ex broke up with me.\n\nWIBTA if I asked my friends to stop talking to him?",

      "description": " \n\nSo, I'm currently in highschool and last Friday, I threatened a kid that if he were to ever talk to me, or any of my friends again, I would kick his ass. \n\nBut in order to get the full story, I need to go back two years.\n\nBack in early 2017/late 2016, one of my friends, let's call her Carter, came to me in tears. Carter claimed that some guy in our grade had sexually harassed her online. I was confused at first until she showed me text messages between her and said, guy. We'll call him Aiden for this story. Now at first, the text messages between the two were pretty mild; ranging from small talk to minor discussions, however the further I went down, the more I realized that Aiden was becoming more gross. Keep in mind that we're barely 13 at the time.At one point this creep had sent her a text describing how he would have sex with her. Immediately I told her to go to the principle, but it seems like they'd never done anything.  \n\n\nAt that point, I had no idea who Aiden was, and coincidentally, I would become friends with him next year. I felt quite bad for the dude. He has high functioning autism and ADHD, and I knew that he was having a hard time making friends. The dude talked ALOT. I felt bad. I saw how other kids would treat him unfairly. So when he would come over and talk to me, I would listen.\n\nNow, Aiden liked my friend, Leo. At one point, he asked Leo out. Now, Leo declined. Unfortunately Aiden wouldn't take no for an answer.  \n\n\nHe would constantly ask Leo out and flirt with him, despite Leo stating no and that it was making him uncomfortable. Eventually, Aiden would use me to try to get with Leo, asking me for his email address and number for school projects. Eventually, one afternoon, Leo talked to me about all the stuff Aiden did to him. And I was livid.  \n\n\nImmediately I told Aiden to leave Leo alone and don't try to talk to him again. I also made sure to let him know that I was pissed at him. Regardless, though, I would still talk to him. However, I stopped talking to him altogether when he betrayed my trust again by telling the girl I was currently into, my best friend, that I liked her.\n\nAnd that leads me up to the present.\n\nCarter came up to me once again and asked me If I had remembered the whole text messaging debacle. When I replied yes, she showed me how Aiden started texting her, and just like last time, the texts were sensual. This time, however, my friend blocked him immediately as it started to do so. However, similar to Leo, Aiden wouldn't take no for an answer. He started to make excess social media accounts to talk to her and begged her to date him.  \n\n\nThe following day when he showed up to class, I told him not to talk to me or any of my friends ever again or I would beat his ass. He started crying that he was sorry, but I refused to listen.  \n\n\nNow I notice he's getting picked on more often, but I refuse to rescue him.\n\nAnyways, AITA? ",

Also, I don’t want to paint my friend in a bad way, so I’ll try not to make it seem like she’s not the bad guy.\n\nMy friend and I were in class today sitting next to each other and taking an English test that she didn’t study for. I notice she’s visibly shaking out of the corner of my eye and that she’s stressed, so I think that maybe she needs some comfort or something. I try to give her one of my Mentos to assure her it’ll be all right and she glares at me and slaps it out of my hand. Now, we’re in a small classroom, so the sound of the Mentos hitting the ground almost echos and I get glares (I’m the only one who brings food to the classroom, so if food spills or drops, I probably did it). I return to my test and try to ignore the situation but I still feel sort of guilty for what happened. \n\nA few minutes later, the test is over and my friend seems relaxed for some reason, probably knowing that since the test is over she can finally relax. The teacher starts a lecture about what we’re studying (Love’s Labour’s Lost, Since we’re studying Shakespeare) and everything is fine. Until...\n\nFriend (to me): Aren’t you going to pick up your damn M&amp;M or whatever?\n\nMe: Hm?\n\nFriend: Your M&amp;M, pick it up.\n\nI’m shaking a bit since I’m kind of scared of my friend (I’m fairly short and she’s tall to me, she’s roughhoused with me on several occasions) and don’t know what’ll happen if I don’t obey. I decide to stand my ground though.\n\nMe: Can you say please next time?\n\nFriend: Um... no? It’s your M&amp;M, not mine, pick it up.\n\nMe: Please say please... you sound a bit rude.\n\nFriend: Pick. It. Up.\n\nShe was showing signs of anger at this point, and I didn’t want to piss her off. So I do as I’m told and continue the rest of class.\n\nI feel like I’m an asshole for this but I don’t know. Should I apologize for trying to make her say please?\n",

      "description": "My 31st birthday was Saturday. My family stopped celebrating birthdays when I was in elementary school; we would receive a gift and be told happy birthday but there was no party or cake or anything like that. So I have tried to work on my birthday every year since I turned 14.\nI have been married for 7 years and my husband and his family celebrate birthdays like normal people. I have never asked to do anything for my birthday or even ask for a gift but they always get me gifts and usually want to go for dinner if we can. This year I asked to go to lunch and the movies with my husband. I also worked up the courage to finally ask for a couple things that I've been wanting. My husband decided we were going to celebrate our anniversary on my birthday (he had to work on our anniversary weekend). I decided it wasn't that big of a deal and went with it. My birthday started nice but the further the day went the more depressed I got. My mom wished me a happy birthday when I  called her the day before my birthday so she wouldn't have to call me on my birthday. One of my sisters posted a video of her kids saying happy birthday on Facebook but didn't call or text me. My oldest sister never contacted me and the rest of my family didn't either (even though my cousin liked my sister's Facebook post). I asked my husband if he got me anything and he responded \"you said you didn't want anything\" (I specifically asked him for a couple things). When we got home my MIL gave my an envelope. I started getting a little excited but when I opened it it was just a couple pictures for my son to color. \nI cried myself to sleep the past 2 nights and I have felt so depressed. I started getting angry and lashing out at my husband. I feel like my birth is nothing to celebrate.\nI told him today that I don't want to celebrate mother's day, I  don't want any gifts on Christmas, valentine's day, or our anniversary,  and I don't ever want anybody to acknowledge my birthday ever again. I can't be disappointed if I know I'm not getting anything and I don't celebrate. He seems mad at me and now I feel like I'm overreacting but I still want to cry whenever I think about it. AITA here?",

      "description": "I’m sure these types of problems are common so I’ll try to keep it short. A few months ago I proposed, and my Fiancée and her mother both wanted a specific family member who is in the clergy of our shared religion to perform the ceremony. I was ambivalent about the idea but kept that to myself and said that’s great. We contact him and let him know are date and he says no, that doesn’t work, in fact that whole month doesn’t work try December (the following month). We pick a date in December and confirm with him. Great!  Two weeks later, her mom lets us know he can’t do that date either, but can do the following week. Ok, we can do that, getting a little close to Christmas but that’s fine. Two months later we get another call from her mom, he can’t do our second date but can do ____ date in November. She says she’s already talked to the church and venue and we just have to say yes. I don’t get a chance to talk to my Fiancée without her mom on speakerphone before it is agreed that we will move to the November date. It’s moved, venue is confirmed as is the church, and we are getting quotes from vendors as I type this (no deposits yet).\n\nHere’s the twist. After moving the date my Fiancée informed me we are 1 week after my old roommates wedding. Very close friend from college with a guest list overlap of ~15 people. Roommate won’t be able to come if we do this new date, some of our out of state guests will for sure not come (as in have already told us). I feel like we’re hurting our wedding with this new date to accommodate an officiant I have never met and will probably never see again after this wedding. \n\nI talked to my Fiancée and we agreed that despite wanting her relative to perform the ceremony it was coming at too great an expense to ourselves and other guests, so we called her mom and said “let’s look at moving the date to the original planned date.” Mom is upset but says “ok I’ll talk to venues.”\n\nLater that night I get a text from my Fiancée saying her parents decided it was too important to them for him to be the officiant so we cannot move the date. They are providing a significant (read majority) contribution to the wedding and (reasonably IMO) feel they can make this call, though they did not explicitly mention it.\n\nI’m very upset by this. My close friend is guaranteed to miss my wedding and if we like we are being rude to them by bumping against their date. Additionally having somebody else tell me when my wedding is going to be 4 times without any agency is frustrating. \n\nAITA for being upset? WIBTA if I press the issue? Would it be worth it to push back hard against my future in laws?",

      "description": "I'd like to preface this with our relationship - we've been together 3 years, two of which we've been living together. We're pretty serious about marriage but not about the when.\n\nOkay so I had decided to finally quit my job and start a company, but the law required a minimum of two partners to do that. Honestly I was experiencing a rush that my dream is finally going to be true... I asked my SO if he'd like to join my as the second partner, and he agreed.\n\nNow my so and I have very different skills, and he's not very good at making sound financial decisions or saving up. I had not realized that beforehand. Also halfway into the process I realized he really did not have anything to bring to the table when it came to running a business, and he would essentially have been a placeholder instead of someone who can function as a business partner.\n\nA week of contemplation later I decided that I was going to choose my college mate that I'm close friends with and he has experience in the industry as well. But when I told my so the reasons I'm having second thoughts he flipped.\n\nWe had an argument where he blamed me for not trusting him, that I raised his expectations by asking him, and denied that he makes bad financial decisions. Then proceeded to pitch me the ways in which he would've been helpful (they were not convincing or anything that would *add* to my work instead of replacing me)\n\nThings cooled down a bit this morning but now he's acting colder. Although I still stand by my point and I have the right to reconsider.\n\nTL;DR - asked my boyfriend to by my business partner, then changed my mind because he wouldn't be able to contribute. ",

I hate hearing my roommate constantly talking, or any person for that matter. I stick to myself for the most part, I have headphones in all day long. \n\nI already asked him to stop bringing over his girlfriend everyday. I told him it would be fine to have her over once in a while, but even if she is a great person, which she is (and I expressed that), I have no interest in overhearing a constant conversation all the time. \n\nMy current dilemma is him talking with his friends over Xbox chat. He does not know how to talk quietly. He is constantly screaming/ talking way too loudly for me to enjoy. \n\nMy question for you all is- Am I an asshole for asking my roommate to stop loudly talking/screaming over his Xbox chat? Am I depriving him of having fun? \n\nPlease let me know, thank you guys so much. This community is awesome! I love the idea of it. ",

      "description": "Hey guys, this is my first time using this thread, so here goes nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis past Friday night, my suitemates (college suite), a few friends and I were having a great time drinking and playing a bunch of different card games.  It was overall a pretty good night.  Then the friend I'm the closest to just gets up and leaves randomly.  I don't think anything of it, and then my two other friends got up and followed her to her room.  I just sit there, continuing to play cards and talk with two others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe three of them come back and I notice the girl next to me is crying, but she brushes it off and won't tell me what happened.  So, being intoxicated and not wanting to push, I obliged and left the situation alone.  Then my close friend, from across the room, in her intoxicated state starts giggling super oddly, then I start laughing along with her.  That's when she smiles stupidly big at me, and just flipped her arm over to show me she had cut herself.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd been very reserved in my history with a lot of my suitemates and people I've met at college, because, I don't see me continuing a friendship with any after graduation.  We just live together.  But, I do have a history where someone has killed themselves with my name in the suicide note and a history that involved abusive ex's cutting themselves and screaming it was my fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my intoxicated state, I was about to blow up at her.  She means the world to me, and she's really the only one I care about in the whole suite, but I couldn't say what my brain was going to right then and there, it would have been detrimental. So, I got up and left for maybe 5 minutes, just out into the lobby to air out my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen  I came back, she had barricaded herself in her room and was talking to one of our friends, so I didn't get a chance to talk to her.  But everyone else took this as their chance to tag-team me and do an intervention on me saying how they're \"always there if I need someone,\" which is just not a conversation I take kindly to, even when sober.  This situation was about my friend, not me, and yet here they were saying I've got a flawed personality and too much of a \"fight or flight\" personality and I'm also very defensive in conversations.    They drilled me for almost an hour trying to get me to open up, the entire time I'm intoxicated and realistically just trying to not cry.  \n\n\nLong story short, I ended up doing my best in an intoxicated state to tell the people intervening me that they wouldn't be able to do anything, and if I haven't opened up to them in these past 6 months, chances were I wasn't going to at all.  I learned the type of people to trust, and I know they talk shit behind people's backs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ENTIRE next day, everyone in my suite refused to say a word to me.  Okay, cool. We're playing that game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSunday, I bit the bullet and messaged one of my suitemates, basically telling her, \"I've asked for help from you before, and you fucked it up because you told me it was my fault I got sexually assaulted. I learned to not talk to you about my issues.\"  This in turn, got my other suitemate to message me, after I apologized for not being there for her, stating that I'm selfish and caught up in my own way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologized to her, saying I realistically needed to air my head before I said something regrettable, since people cutting themselves and flaunting it to me does not stir a positive \"you're gorgeous why are you doing that?\" reaction; I get hostile.  She blatantly told me, \"I don't need an explanation, I've helped you a shit ton and when I needed you, you literally ran away.\"  Even when I told her I was ready to talk when I came back in.  \n\n\nWe are now on the morning of day 3 of no one talking to me because I'm apparently the bad egg in the suite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole in the situation?",

      "description": "This happened a couple of nights ago but my anxiety is making me fixate on it. I was driving home from work at night and it was pretty foggy out so I turned on my fog lights. (Side note: I've probably only used them twice since getting my car, and I did see other vehicle also using theirs.) Eventually, while driving down some poorly lit back roads I catch up to a car going about 15 mph on 35 mph roads. I end up coasting behind them and using my brakes often, but I still maintained at least one car's distance between us. Also, they had been going that slow before I even got behind them. It was frustrating being stuck going slower than I wanted, but I figured they were just driving the speed they felt comfortable with considering the dense fog.\n\nAfter driving behind them for about 3 blocks they throw on their hazards. Now I'm thinking maybe something is wrong with their car? Except they turn them back off again after a few seconds. Finally, we both arrive at a light and wait to turn left onto a wider  road. \n\nAfter turning into the inner lane of this wider road I wait about 10 seconds for them to move into the slower lane because they are still only going about 20 (this new road is 55). They didn't move so I gave up, signalled, and went around them.\n\nAs I am getting up to the speed limit, they start accelerating to match my speed. The passenger then sticks his arm out the the window and flips me off. I ignored them figuring they were just dumb teenagers, but after I passed them they got behind me and turned their high beams on nearly the whole way to my turn off.\n\nIt wasn't until later that night that I wondered if they thought my fog lights were my high beams.\n\nSo AITA for not turning my fog lights off around another car? Or did they have irrational road rage?\n",

      "description": "This might be a bit of a long post but I need to give some backstory. So sorry ahead of time! \nIm currently a senior in college, this is my last semester actually. I also live in Vermont, which has recently been hit with snow, accompanied by minor flooding.\n\nI walk everywhere, so this has not been fun. In fact, it's been down right miserable. So when it started snowing today I was like 'oh no'. And it was snowing pretty hard, so I called into work (I work at my school's library). No big deal, they put my shifts up for grabs and I got to stay home.\nThen I remembered I have homework due tomorrow.\n\nNow the homework for this class is kinda weird. The professor puts these books on reserve at the library, and we have to read them in the library and send her an email with 1-2 sentences about each one of them. They're picture books, so it's usually okay. \n\nSo I sent my professor this email\n\n\"Hi Professor,\n\nI'm sorry to say that I couldn't do the readings for Monday. There was some snow today and since I have to walk everywhere it quickly became hazardous. I'll have them done asap, but I understand that I won't get credit for them\n\n\nThanks,\"\n\nI got this response:\n\n\"Hi _____, the class isn't until 11 and the library is open in the evening, so I'm not sure why the snow is bothering you more than your peers. I hope you do have a chance to look at them before class tomorrow because we will be discussing them. \"\n\nAnd I'm like...really angry about the whole thing. Why did she need to write an email like that? It just feels like she's judging me without knowing about my situation\n\nI'm tempted to write \"thank you for being understanding\" and leaving it at that. \nAm I overreacting? AITA?\n",

      "description": "I currently live with my parents.\n\nMy mom as an aggressive dog, Bella. We've had Bella for a few years, and she has become very territorial of my mom. She barks any time she hears any noise when my mom is sleeping, growls if anyone gets near her any time of day, and she bites people. She bites children, she bites animals, she bites family. My mom does not care. We have told her on multiple occasions that she needs to train the dog or get rid of it, and she has ignored us for years. \n\nAbout two or three months ago Bella bit my dad and drew blood. My dad lost his shit and told my mom that she either needed to train the dog or put it down. She agreed to train it (she has made no effort to train the dog, but that's for later). My dad said \"if she bites *anyone else* she's gone. I don't care what you have to say\". \n\nFast forward to today, I was taking my girlfriend's service dog, Pants, outside to go potty. Pants is a [5 month old samoyed](https://imgur.com/r6k3pr3), extremely well behaved, loves everything and everyone. He wants pets from people he meets and to play with any animals he meets. We walk past my mom to go outside, and Bella attacks Pants. This is the second time she's done so this week. At a family Christmas party, she bit Pants AND ME, but I didn't make a fuss because it was Christmas and I knew my mom wouldn't listen, all I would accomplish was ruining the mood. This time, my mom, my dad, and my girlfriend all saw it and heard Pants yelp. \n\nI tell my mom that Bella needs to go *now*. I'm angry, upset, pissed. She starts arguing with me and refuses to listen. She even claims her dog isn't dangerous, despite literally watching her dog attack mine 5 seconds ago. After yelling at her for 5 minutes and realizing i'm yelling at a brick wall, i go to my dad in the next room and ask him about the ultimatum he gave a few months ago. He says \"i'm staying out of it\" and some other stuff to the effect of me being disrespectful. Sure, i probably was, but her dog attacked mine and she didn't give a fuck. I feel like i had a right to be angry. Especially since Pants is a service animal, and we absolutely CANNOT have him developing aggressive tendencies, or being scared of other dogs.\n\nI argued with my dad for 5 minutes or so, me focusing on the fact that Bella bit my dog and she needs to go, and my dad bringing up all this random shit about me being disrespectful, raising my voice, the huge burden we've been on the family (they own the house, we have a room downstairs. We buy our own food, keep the downstairs clean, don't make a ton of noise, etc. I asked them if it was okay if my girlfriend moved in and they were thrilled at the prospect. I asked them before we bought Pants and they said they were okay with it.), even including the time i asked him if he could turn down the thermostat when it was 78 downstairs. \n\nI told my dad it is against the law to own a dangerous animal. He said he didn't care. Bella was here before Pants. Like ignoring the fact that i've been here 20 years and she's bitten me too, the law doesn't give a fuck how long Bella has been here. I asked him if the house rules superseded the law. He said yes. I said he couldn't be reasoned with and walked away to take Pants outside to pee. He followed me out and said I have til the end of the week to get out of his house. He does this any time I disagree with him, and both my mom, sister, and girlfriend noticed the pattern. This isn't even the first time he's threatened to kick me out in the past 6 months. Last time it was over dish towels (half of which I BOUGHT). He's been doing this since I was like 12. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? I feel like I'm going crazy because they're *adamant* that I'm the one in the wrong. It seems cut and dry to me. Her dog bit me and my dog. Even without my dad's ultimatum, she should have been gone ages ago when she bit a neighborhood kid. They're lucky I didn't call the cops the moment she bit my dog and have animal control take her away. But they're acting like I'm the bad guy and nothing the dog does matters because I raised my voice and was pissed that my dog was hurt.",

      "description": "First, let me set the scene: I am now a senior in high school, however, I had to move with my family to a new school in a new town starting my senior year. Coming into this year, I knew I didn't want it to be something I just got out of the way before heading to college, i wanted it to be a year I cherished. \nI did quickly find a group of people to hang out with so I never had the \"sitting alone in the lunchroom\" experience and this group was never disgruntled or mad about me tagging along. \nOne last bit of necessary information was that our calculus teacher awarded extra points for those who got together for calculus study groups outside of class and after seeing the master sheet for the 2nd Trimester, which had a record of everyone's study groups, I saw that my space was completely blank while my friends had at least 5 sessions. I then learned that they had a group chat for the \"Honors Squad\" where they shared notes and stuff like that. No big deal, just add me in.\nHowever, I'm an android user. Citing the fact that they wouldn't be able to keep the name of their iMessage group, they didn't add me and just told me to text them if I felt I needed notes. \nBeing a new student, I'm a bit paranoid. So when I'm not in this group chat, I don't know what I'm missing out on. \nI mull over this situation by myself and with my parents and we figure out that I could use one of our old iPads as a texting device so that my friends can keep using iMessage groups. I just got added to the group today, but I voiced my frustrations to my friends about having to go through the trouble of getting an Apple device just so that I could communicate with them. Their response \"Ah well, deal with it.\" \nThat attitude made me feel really insulted. I was getting left out of stuff (or maybe not, I don't know, because I'm not being communicated with) just because they can't name their group chat. They refused to use third-party messaging software and left it up to me earn my way into their group chat. \nIn my discussion with them earlier today, they straight up told me to \"just buy an iPhone\" or \"If you were a better friend, we'd add you.\" These comments are probably jokes, but one thing that wasn't a joke was that they were unwilling to add me until I owned an Apple device. \nThree things to add just for fairness sake: \n\n* There are a couple more android users in our grade (it's a small grade) and they are also getting left out, so it doesn't seem like personal thing\n\n* I have no idea what kind of stuff I'm missing out on. It could just be nothing. This frustration is mostly fueled by lack of communication and paranoia especially regarding those calculus study groups I mentioned earlier.\n\n* I have still been invited to things. I got invited to participate in their Secret Santa, I got invited to a Superbowl party, and I got invited to a birthday party. So it's not like I'm being left out of everything.",

      "description": "Sorry for any formatting, I’m on mobile and this is my first time posting here, please bare with me.\n\nSo like two months ago, my (F,21) close friend/roommate (F,21) got out of a 5 year relationship that was really abusive. This was a relationship that had started as a rebound after another abusive relationship. They had been together since high school and to be quite honest, our friend group had never really liked the guy (M,21-22). There was a lot of pain and emotional nights where our tight group of friends would be up talking with my roommate and helping her through all of the emotions she has been experiencing. She spent weeks sobbing on the couch and just working through the pain she had been experiencing. \n\nWhen my roommate started to pick herself up and was able to start doing more normal things, she agreed with another close friend (F,21) of ours that she would spend time one herself; she would focus on discovering herself and her life without an SO in the picture. \n\nThen like a week after this discussion, a couple of not so close friends (both F,21) had helped my roommate create a tinder account. We had all previously agreed that it would not be best to encourage any rebounding and that it wouldn’t end well for her to start dating so soon because she was not in a fully stable place and had not fully processed her 5 year relationship. Anyway she got in contact with some random guy (M,22? Not quite sure) and they started seeing one another.\n\nI started noticing that I didn’t see her as often as she was out and about with this guy. If we wanted to make plans she had to ask this new guy, who she had been only dating for a few weeks. I began to recognize that she was falling back into a pattern. I voiced all these problems to our friend group and we decided to confront her.\n\nI began the conversation after discussing her birthday plans, and she stated that she felt as though it was strictly casual and then my other friend started to chime in and agree with me. We told her that we recognized that she is an adult that can make her own decisions, we just were recognizing similarities between this new guy and her ex. We don’t want her to fall back into another abusive relationship. My roommate promptly left. My roommate sent us all a text stating that she felt really attacked and needed space.\n\nThen on her birthday, my roommate decided to invite boy, the people who didn’t say anything at our meeting, and the people who helped make her tinder. My friend and I were really hurt as we found this out through one of the friends that was going.\n\nWe’ve given her space, have heard various things through the people that are still talking to both “parties”, but now even those people aren’t talk to us anymore.\n\nWe recognize that my roommate is a grown adult who can make her own decisions, we just want to get her the right help because we’ve worked so hard to build her back up. AITA for bringing this up?",

      "description": "This thought spawned in my head after a conversation with some of my friends. I'm a first year English Education major with a decently heavy courseload that involves research and a pretty hefty amount of reading assignments (at least, hefty for a first year student). Even so, I dislike seeing other people struggle through shit unnecessarily, especially when I feel that I could be of help and *especially* especially when college can be so expensive and taxing on students. So, whenever a friend is troubled by a writing assignment which they find difficult, I offer my help. Whether they need someone to bounce ideas off of or just someone to give it a look over for editing and citation issues, I always offer and I never ask for a cent, since it's not like I'm writing these people's essays for them. I don't feel special for doing so, I just always felt like I should and that I gain a sense of enjoyment from being useful.\n\nWhen my friends heard about this, they were legitimately shocked. Not towards my enjoyment of English or my Messiah complex (which I will admit to having slightly), but moreso towards the fact that I'm not charging these people, my friends, to edit for them. In return, that shocked me. I didn't think that I would be made out to be a pushover or anything just for editing some five-page papers. It was fairly easy work to me, after all. I'd legitimately feel like a jerk to ask these people for money since they support me in other ways that aren't as tangible as a dollar and are not exactly flush with cash themselves. What do you guys think? I'm definitely putting in more time than I have to for people other than myself, but would it really be moral to sell my skills to fellow students and friends who are also struggling with the high tuition of college? I would fear that my reputation would take a hit for doing so and that I would be viewed as selfish.",

My older sisters boyfriend is a camper, and is going away for Valentines/Family Day weekend. My boyfriend and I live with my In Laws, who are also away this weekend. I had planned to surprise bf by cooking dinner this weekend after work, wear some lingerie, and just hangout with him for the Valentine’s portion of the weekend. Without checking with me first, Sister basically says that she’s going to come stay with us for the whole weekend, as her bf is away. I thought she was kidding. Nope, apparently BF told her it was fine. Now, I know this could be partially my fault because I didn’t tell BF my plan, but it would’ve been nice to be asked as opposed to sister just imposing on me. The other thing to note, is BF and I live less than 5 minutes away from sister. Why she couldn’t come over during the day while I am working and then leave in the evenings is beyond me. I’m feeling very conflicted because I don’t want to make sister feel bad, but I also wanted to wear some cute lingerie and have fun sexy times with BF in our empty home. \n\nAITA, Reddit? ",

      "description": "A bit of background: My Mom is 100% Navajo and a hardcore neo-liberal Democrat. I am liberal Democrat which means we don't see eye to eye politically as she endorses socialism and I do not for obvious reasons. She pretends to be a liberal (or is just to militantly ignorant to know the difference) and speaks like she represents every liberal in the world even though she espouses zero liberal values. Example: I am bisexual and she says she is accepting of it but I was never allowed to bring a boyfriend home. She also says she hates Trump because he is racist but has stated that she wants all white people to die because they are all racist and I was forbidden from dating white people even though I have very pale skin because my Dad is Jewish (long story behind that). Basically she is a racist bigot who thinks that everyone who doesn't hate Trump is a racist bigot.\n\nLast night she had invited several of her liberal friends from the tribe over for dinner and my wife and I were there and someone brought up politics and the conversation went to the national emergency and border wall funding and my mom quickly went into \"Trump is a Nazi\" mode. It was obvious that they were starting to agree with her on stuff that she was straight making up with info pulled directly from her ass so every time she or anyone would say an example of why Trump is racist I or my wife would pull out proof that those examples were either lies or words taken out of context. As the conversation went on I could see that the dinner guests were believing the truth over my mom's rambling nonsense and my mom became enraged and screamed at me, \"Maybe if you cared about your own people more than having sex with men you would see that Trump and his followers are the problem and that you are supporting the white devils!!!\" The guests gave an audible gasp and politely excused themselves pretty quickly and she blamed me for ruining everything. I asked if I should be sorry for telling the truth and she said, \"Damn right you should! If we have to lie to save ourselves from white people then you lie your ass off and NEVER disrespect me in the process!\". She almost slapped me and my wife made me leave before I got angry.\n\nAITA for exposing her as a lying racist bigot to her liberal friends who she was trying to brainwash with easily proven lies or did I do the right thing by defending white people from democratic racism and lgbtq people from democratic bigotry?",

      "description": "So first thing, this is my first post on reddit, made the account specifically to get this advice\nSecond, this is a kinda long story i guess, so bare with me please.\nOkay so me (18F) and my bf (18M) have been together for over 2 months approximately, but we've known eachother since 2015-2016, worth to mention, it was a cyberfriendship, and we haven't met in person yet, we've planned it but unfortunately we haven't been able to make it. So here's the thing, our relationship hasn't been the best, when I met him (Dec 2015) he had long time relationship with his ex-gf, as well as me, i was in a 4 month relationship with an ex-gf, and when she dumped me, i became in love with him, because he always was so nice to me and was there for me always; he was too nice to the point where his \"niceness\" could be interpreted as flirting, so he kinda led me on. Time passes, his relationship with his ex-gf is terrible, I advise he breaks up with her (the situation was getting really toxic) but he doesn't, he says he'll give her another chance, and that broke my heart, but i still told him that of he was happy with his decision, so was I. Then we distanced a bit, we didnt talk as often, barely even spoke. This became a cycle, we talked, his relationship peaked, i advised, he wouldnt do it, we distanced, and so on. Fast forward to 2018, they have already broken up, finally. I was totally over him, i was just starting college, the only thing i felt for him was friendship, we started talking again, he told me about his break up, i consoled him, we became friends again. Until one day, we had a discussion over a very serious topic for me (he was making fun of a suicide victim) and I said it wasnt okay, i also said some other stuff that i think kinda \"hurt\" him, but they were things like \"you don't know what you're saying, is very harmful, not everyone is as privileged as you and depression and mental disorders are not conditional (he said that only people that suffer of hunger, poverty, etc can be depressed) and i just couldn't take it, we fought, he said he was sorry, and that he was really sensitive bc of his breakup, but i couldnt take it, i dont really remember if i said anything harmful but i dont think so, i stopped talking to him. 2 months or more pass, i find out that he's streaming on his yt channel, decide to join in, and of course he's mad, hes super edgy towards me but i decide to apologise, he accepts, we're friends again. About a month passes, we've become very close and felt \"things\" for eachother, but here's the thing, i was not in love with him. I felt a lot of love and appreciation for him, but i wasnt in love. We entered in a relationship, a \"serious\" one, he has sent me gifts and all, and over all this time, ive had very weird and mixed feelings. Sometimes i feel like i love him very deeply, sometimes i feel that i dont even wanna be with him. I feel so bad all the time, and this stresses me so freaking much. The fact that i have anxiety doesnt help at all either, i feel very unstable all the time, and if i dont answer texts I really feel pressured and makes me feel like im ignoring him or that i dont want to talk to him, and thats the thing, sometimes i just dont want to, but i dont want to hurt his feelings. Yesterday we had a fight, and i told him about how i felt; he started by rambling about a fight he had with his best friends, and then shifting the rant towards me, and how i preferred to do something else than talk to him",

      "description": "I hate riding the bus to schools. It started last year when this kid sat next to me on the bus. He brought a Nintendo DS and I noticed that he was playing Mega man on it. So I asked him about it and we had a small conversation about the game.  Ever since then, he started to sit by me every time on the bus. But he has no sense of personal space.I always try to be the first one on the bus because I hate having to search for a seat. And if he does get on before me, I feel obligated to sit by him because in afraid to hurt his feelings. I sit on the window side, and when he gets on, I'm literally squished between him and the window. I have no leg room because he puts his backpack between his legs and his elbows are always jaggibg into my sides. I should also point out that he has PLENTY of room bacause there's always a good foot of seat left after he sits down. But he seems to insist on squishing me.\n\nHeres the part where I feel like I might be an asshole. Its clear that he doesnt have many friends and is socially awkward. I feel like it may be his parents fault he says that he's not allowed out of the house other than to go to school. I often pretend to take a nap during the ride to school just to avoid conversation with him. He also only talks about video games. Nothing else. I'm a big gamer myself, but its like thats the only thing he knows. (He still tries to talk to me even though I'm \"asleep\") he doesnt seem to read any social cues.\n\nOn the ride home from school, I feel forced to talk to him because its not logical to be tired at the end of the day. But I just cant relate to him at all. He always tries to get my attention by repeating phrases like \"oh boy\" or \"I can't believe this\" then keepa turning his phone towards me to show me. (Again. Always something to do with his video games)  and I've always been short with him by only really responding with one word answers.\n\nHe's also got no boundaries when it comes to other peiples privacy. Hes always looking over my\n\nI can't tell him now that I don't want to be friends with him any more. Its my fault for not  Its been over a year. I dont know why he hasn't gotten the hint that I'm not interested in the things that he is interested in. But I've been dreading every bus ride that I take. Am I the Asshole for not socializing with him? I might be his only \"friend\" that he has.",

      "description": "Firstly, I did make an anonymous account for this. No real reason, I just have mild trust issues and I'm not sure I want this on my standard account.\n\nProbably the most important piece of information here is that I'm in love with my best friend and have been for year. (I'm a dude, she's a girl, not that it matters) \n\nShe's wonderful. She never ked me on or made me think something was there when it wasn't, and she made it very clear that she didn't want anything more than what we have. She is, however, very amorous. Before our AP Euro test, she got super nervous while we were studying at her house, long story short, we ended up cuddling for upwards of an hour. We've held hands, she almost kissed me one time, and we enjoy platonic flirting. Again, we both agreed that none of that means anything, but I still think it justifies my feelings.\n\nFor the longest time I was content because I just wanted her to be happy. And she is. We make each other calmer and happier, but earlier this year, she spent a month in a mental hospital, for reasons I'm not disclosing. When she came back, her brain was all sorts of fucked up, and I needed to stay with her for months before she finally recovered and was able to handle herself. The problem is, I'm not happy anymore. I want more and she doesn't. (Yes, I did ask her out once and got rejected) \n\nWe got in a big argument a couple weeks ago for unrelated reasons and I needed some time alone, but I saw her crying today, and it turns out she was rejected from her college of choice. I walked into class ready to end a friendship that's excruciating because I want more, but she's already devastated because of college. I don't know if I can do that to her, but I also don't know if I can hold on for the last few months before we're off to college.\n\nTL;DR I love my best friend, she doesn't want anything more. I was about to end our friendship because I couldn't handle it anymore, but she got rejected from her first choice for college. I don't know if I can do it anymore",

      "description": "My boyfriend and his mom don't get along to well, and for exclusivity sake, we'll just say there was some neglect, misuse of funds, and verbal abuse. \n\nThey don't talk because he refuses to, and at least I think, for good reason. Whenever she visits, he hides away, clearly displaying his discomfort and mild hatred for her.\n\nHowever, after his sister birthday, he was asked if he would go with his mother and sister to the mall. Originally he said he was going to decline, but then said that he was going to go so he could have her buy e-liquid.\n\nThis is where I get angry, because I used to do the same thing with my mom after she did some things, but quickly realized my mistake as I matured. Anyway, I told him that it was wrong to use his mother like that, taking into consideration that they never talk, by his choice, and when they do, he wants to get something out of it. I can't support something that I feel is wrong, or incompromiseable. After I confronted him about it, our usually lengthy phone call was cut short, which made me feel like an asshole. \n\nAnyway, am I the asshole for doing this?\n\n",

      "description": "So my boyfriend [m24] and I [m25] had a snag in our 9 year relationship. There is a lot of background stuff going on with this but I will try my best to explain it.\n\nMy boyfriend didn't have a job at the time so he would take commissions to write fictional stories for internet people. All of them were porn stories of some degree. He did this off and on depending on demand which I really didn't mind at all honestly. He was doing something he liked and made a few extra bucks where his income was 0.\n\nThis all changed when my boyfriend got a weird request. I mean, weirder than usual. This guy, I call him \"creepy guy\" wanted the same kind of story, that being an explicit story but very much fiction. It was fine so far. But then I found out that \"creepy guy\" wanted to watch my boyfriend write the story. I thought maybe it had to do with this \"creepy guy\" being snubbed by spending money and not getting a story.\n\nI was wrong in that regard. He wanted to watch my boyfriend write a story because \"creepy guy's\" kink was watching any author actually write the story for him. Very creepy already but later I found out that he was masterbating while watching my boyfriend writing the story \"creepy guy\" commissioned from my boyfriend. He would request my boyfriend to write the story for him until he finished his session of getting off.\n\nMy boyfriend wasn't really fine with it but went along anyways because he needed the money. And it makes me feel really awkward whenever my boyfriend writes for that guy because he isn't jerking it to the story, but to my boyfriend who is writing the story. It made me pretty depressed because I feel like my boyfriend is getting paid to get someone off. \n\nMy boyfriend never really asked my opinion about the situation, he just kind of decided that money was money.\n\nNow fast forward to recently, my boyfriend got a job and gets decent money compared to the 0 he got before. So my thought was he was going to stop writing for \"creepy guy\" because he won't need the money. I was wrong because he just kept writing for \"creepy guy\".\n\nI told him how it makes me feel and he wasn't happy about not having the extra money(even though we don't need it) but ultimately he agreed to stop because he doesn't want me feeling terrible about it.\n\nI felt much better after that but lately I feel like I am an asshole for feeling the way I did. He loves writing for people for money and I feel maybe I was being petty. I do respect my boyfriend a lot, give him privacy, and trust him wholly. So that's why I really feel like an asshole. By denying him money by providing a story, when he loves writing. Am I being an asshole?\n\nSorry for the long post. Just needed to put some background so it's all on the table. \n\nTL;DR: boyfriend writes porn stories for a creepy guy who jerks it watching my bf write the story. Talked to him how I felt and he reluctantly stopped, but now I feel like an asshole for making him stop what he liked doing. ",

      "description": "Ok so full story is that me and this girl, lets call her Sarah, are friends. Sarah was a senior in undergrad at the time and I was a freshmen. She was also my carpool home when I went back home every couple months. So basically we started hanging out alone, ya know like doing homework together or smoking some trees so I got to know her but she never told me about her bf. I heard about him through mutual friends but i never asked Sarah about him cause I just didn't really care honestly. \n\nFast forward couple months and she invites me to her Xmas party in December and my friends and all go to her house and it was a fun time. In the middle she comes to me (blackout drunk) and asks me where her car keys are (I used her car to drop a friend back home cause she was not feeling well) and I told her that when I got back I gave them to her. By the way I should mention that this night I did not drink much (couple beers after I got back from dropping my friend off), not sure why, but I was basically sober the entire night. Anyways so I tell her that she has them and then she takes my hand and brings me to her room where she's like \"I can't find them!\".. I tell her I mean i don't know where you put them and then she just makes the first move and pushes me against the wall and gets really close to me. Me being a freshmen and seeing this happening with a senior whose pretty attractive I obviously don't back away and I let it happen.. Before we could do anything else someone opened her bedroom door and saw us. After her friends came in and saw us I left and went back to the living room where everyone else was.\n\nThe next morning I told her what happened and she did not believe me as she didn't remember. She asked her roommates and they told her that they saw us on her bed which is true and people did see us. She then tells me not to tell anymore people and I never talked to her again. I tried following up the next day but she had blocked me on every social media platform and I never talked to her again till this day. I have seen her at tailgates or day drinks a couple times since but now she is in Grad school.\n\nAnother detail is that she was dating this guy (Alumni) who was the founder for this fraternity at my university and i knew every brother in that fraternity and went to their parties as 99% of my friends all went there almost every weekend. Turns out I later got banned from their partys and events partially because of this.. Not a big deal but it kind of sucks cause i am friends with the same ppl (not the brothers though) and they sometimes go out without me leaving me with nothing to do some weekends. AITA\n\nTL;DR: I was sober and consciously madeout with a girl who made all the moves on me but I did know she was dating someone which led to me being banned from a fraternity.. AITA",

Then out of the blue, the door bell does off and I ignore it as it’s usually just UPS dropping off a package from Amazon or something along the lines of that. The doorbell rings a second time and this time my dad goes to answer the door. It turns out it’s this older neighbor that lives a block away. I initially didn’t say hello as I was in the middle of a problem, but eventually I did say hello after I wrapped up my problem. The older lady and my parents talked about something briefly, and then turned to leave. After she left, my parents said to me I was being disrespectful for ignoring the guest and then proceeded to go on about how it “reflects poorly about them”. \n\nWhat do you guys think? AITA?",

      "description": "Below is a list of the evidence that my in-laws favour their daughter (23) over their son (29):\n\n1. When he left for school, they immediately turned his bedroom into a study for his sister. \n2. They sent her to a private high school and him to a public high school. \n3. They have many pictures of her up around the house including one professional family photo of only her and the parents. He was not even at the photo shoot. \n4. They always tell her information about family health and forget to tell us. \n5. She knows all of the family financial information and account passwords, etc. He knows nothing. \n6. They paid for most of her wedding and gave us the money to pay for ingredients for the cake. \n7. One Christmas I asked them to split the cost of an iPad 3 ways with his parents, my parents, and me. They did. They did not get him an additional gift. They bought her an iPad and a trip out West for a week (by plane). \n8. They take her on vacations with them and have never even invited us. \n9. He had to work through high school and college and pay his way but she gets all kinds of help and barely works. \n\nShe is bright. She’s going to work in the medical field and he is too. He has a degree in psych and works with people with mental illness and addictions. His parents just treat her differently for some reason and it’s not right. My husband says I should just let it go to keep the peace and he doesn’t feel it will help anything, but I am just so angry about it and have come to resent them. ",

      "description": "Hello everyone sorry in advance for bad English it’s not my native language. I am 15 years old and I come from a poor background. \n\nMy mother works very hard to support me and my education, so she decided to surprise me by telling me that I would no longer be going to public school and instead I will go to a private one. \n\nAt first I was excited and looking very forward to it. Fast forward to now, it’s miserable for me, a lot of students make fun of me for being poor, I have the same uniform but my backpack plus cellphone, it’s an iPhone 6, are things people have been making jokes and mean insults about.\n\nI don’t have many friends since I don’t have things that people find in common with me. I try very hard to just focus on my school and block it out but it has me feeling very sad and upset about my situation.\n\nMy nickname is Oliver Twist, one guy coined the phrase “please give me so more” whenever I eat my home lunch. I guess because they think my food isn’t as good as theirs.\n\nI am very grateful for the opportunity for private school and am eternally thankful to my mother for her hard work to get me here, but I’m not sure if I can continue this schooling. I think about it all day after school as well, so I’ve been unhappier as a whole.\n\nI brought it up to my mother and she was very upset and considered the bullying not that bad. She said she worked many extra hours to get me into this school and I should be grateful and think ahead.\n\nI understand that this will make me look better in the future as well, but I was so much happier in public school with straight A’s and friends. I also don’t want to be an asshole to my mother who has done so much.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

We had sex that night and continued to talk to each other and whatnot.  I was hesitant to begin a relationship because my previous one had severely damaged me(just now getting over it lol) but for 4 months this girl said things to me like, \"it scares me how much i like you\" \"i really can't wait til we're official\".  Anyhow when I finally asked her out, she shut down emotionally and even started just screaming at me just for my personality.  She said I was too nice and it made me look like a girl.\n\nSo when I dumped her she left my things on the stairs outside of her duplex unit.  I only had one thing to return, a drawing of Ledger Joker and Bale Batman she did for my bday.  It wasn't like epic quality but it was a really awesome gift.  She was upset that I left it on her stairs.  My reasoning was that I didn't want a constant reminder of the energy I used to decide that I wanted a relationship with someone who treated me like trash.",

      "description": "I see a lot of memes about \"depression and anxiety\" on basically every sub. So much, it just feels unnatural, like, it's hard to belive that there are really dozens or even hundreds of thousands of people with depression and anxiety on a \\~250k users sub for problems that affect about 5-10% the world population (unless when it's on a sub specifically about this subject). It feels even more suspicious after seeing people who though they were depressed/anxious, but turned out normal after a diagnosis. When I see these posts, I often have to question myself stuff like \"Is this person *actually* mentally unhealthy or are they pretending to be so they can post this kind of stuff for easy internet points?\" or \"does this person *really* have depression or did they feel justifiably sad for ten minutes *once* and assumed that's how it works?\". Because healthy people pretending to be depressed for karma feels like a dick move. Of course, really long texts talking about how miserable they're feeling and begging for help and advice  or constant posts talking about their issue are really hard not to belive, but someone going \"I have depression lol xd\" and moving on pretty normally after getting a certain ammount of upvotes still sounds fishy to me, and I think karma-whoring fucking **mental illnesses** just doesn't sound right.",

      "description": "Tl,dr: bought a horse. Agreement was to pay half upon the decision that I wanted him and signed and sent the sales contract (which included she retained to free live foal guarantee breedings to him), and half when I picked him up. The way we talked about it was insinuating that he'd be bred in the future after he was trained, and was one of the reasons she chose me (within the state) over other people across country or over seas. she bred him to two of her mares before I picked him up..\n\nI just picked him up a couple days ago. This has been a long ~5 month process. \n\nShe bought him with the intent to train and breed him, but never got around to it. \n\nWhen I went to view him it was more like an interview for me and her deciding if I was worthy of her horse. She has been himing and hawing over selling him for about 3 years. Which is fair since she loved him and wants a good life for him, but this was by far the most in depth *interview* I've ever had, especially for a horse she had for 5 years and couldn't get close enough to touch.\n\nWe kept contact over this time. A few updates on both of our parts. \n\nWhen I got there to pick him up she handed me the folder with his registration papers. She kind of stopped and said \"look, I have to be straightforward with you. I've kept copies of his papers and have had two of my mares pastured and exposed to him to breed\". \n\nI get that her contract, which I read and signed, states that she would keep _**two**_ live foal guaranteed breedings to this horse. But she never told me she was doing this during the time we were emailing and updating each other. And how she prefaced it sounded like she was on the fence about even telling me.\n\nI was polite and said how it would be exciting to see foals of his, because I'm sure they'd be gorgeous.\n\nBut I feel like I should say something. \n\nI feel a little blind sided.\n\nI don't know what her intentions were? I don't know if she just figured \"we'll probably have a hard time meeting up in person to breed in the future and I have him here now, so why not!?\" Or if she was trying to breach the contract (which only she has a copy with my signature, I don't have a copy or her signature)\n\nIt's too soon to tell if they're pregnant. And even if they are and they lose the foal ineutero(not part of contract if it dies after birth) then she could still breed back.\n\nI want to say something but I don't know what? WIBTA if I count these as her two breedings (if all goes well) and turn her away in the future if she quotes the contract..?\n\nI want to say something(but I don't know what). My mother tells me since she told me before we left that I shouldn't and I'd be an ass if I did, although she agrees it wasn't the best move on her part.",

      "description": "I’ve been with my girlfriend 14 months. My birthday was the end of last year (December) and she said she’d organise a holiday away for us for a couple of days. \n\nI was super up for this and told her this. She then didn’t want to discuss dates about going away. I asked her a couple of times if she wasn’t keen to go but she keeps insisting that she is still keen. \n\nShe then gets me a “birthday present” because she was feeling “guilty for leaving it so long” and also because we haven’t booked somewhere to go away yet.  But still refuses to even look at places with me. The shirt she got me cost £15. She then told me (about a week later) that she had just got her female friend her birthday present too. It was a ring valued at £30. \n\nInitially I didn’t think much of it but then I thought it was a bit strange how she spent double on her friend what she did on me. I’ve bought her expensive perfumes in the past and when it comes to gifts, I tend to spend a bit more on her than she does on me. \n\nI feel as if maybe I am the asshole here but it kind of hurts that she was so late with the present, changed from what she initially said she would get me (even when I said I didn’t mind if she didn’t get me one, but she insisted she would and planted the idea in my head) and then didn’t seem to put much thought into it. \n\nWhat are everyone’s thoughts?",

She said she wasn’t very comfortable with me living so far away at this point, and I said I was doing my best and it was out of my control. Luckily, I moved back into her city and we were together steadily throughout this time. Jenny and I both share a mutual friend, who we will call Christianne. Christianne is a nice friend, and we /used/ to get along well. Christianne met my girlfriend through me in middle school, before we even dated. They weren’t really close until about high school though, actually, they weren’t really close until we got together, even. \n\nNow. Our relationship was rocky because of two things, we both have an interest in role playing, and we used to do it together all the time, and suddenly she just wouldn’t want to do it with me anymore, and only with Christianne. This upset me because I have borderline personality disorder, and this triggered my fight or flight response. It made me feel bad about myself, but I can’t really explain why. And two. She was INCREDIBLY close with Christianne. She was always at her house, always hung out and were always together. It’s still like that now. In fact, Christianne and Jenny live together and Jenny’s dad is Christiannes legal guardian now because of CSA troubles. Jenny encouraged her dad to adopt Christianne so they could be together. That made me feel horrible. \nAnyway, their friendship was obsessive. They were always near, always talking to eachother and always making inside jokes which they wouldn’t want me to be included in. (I.E, I asked them to explain one and Jenny quickly said “no don’t tell her!) \n\n We broke up for good in October, a few months ago. She wasn’t talking to me and her only response was “I have nothing to talk about.” She wouldn’t talk to me for days at a time, and I was already tired of having a relationship where I felt like I was giving and not receiving. \n\nNow, Christianne and Jenny live together, they talk all the time, include eachother in everything, always have to be together and cuddle eachother “as friends.” Christianne even made a post on her “secret” account that she had feelings for Jenny, which I assumed, but she didn’t want to act on them because she didn’t want to ruin her relationship with Jenny. I still feel like a dick for breaking up with her, but at the same time I feel mistreated. She would treat Christianne more like a girlfriend than me. \n\nTLDR; I broke up with my girlfriend because she was too close to my friend and it made me jealous. AITA?",

      "description": "So I’ve been with my gf for a bit over a month and this is my first actual relationship. Tonight she told me about something that happened and wanted me to come over to her dorm. Once we got to talking she laid some baggage on me that she hadn’t really talked that much about. I’ve had bad experiences with girls in the past who’ve had some issues in their lives, and I was hoping to kind of escape that with this relationship. \nShe wanted me to spend the night, but I felt like I needed to think all of this over on my own since I can only really process my thoughts when I’m alone, so  I went home. \nOn the one hand I want to stay with her and support her through this and I’d feel bad for ditching her, but on the other hand I feel like I’m poorly equipped to do it and it’ll just end up being unhealthy and taxing for me.  \nSo, am I the asshole?

      "description": "It's -20 C (-4 for my American friends) in Calgary. I pulled into a parking lot at school, and noticed that the car next to me had their lights on. This could mean absolute disaster, as cars already have a hard time starting in weather like this. So after quickly checking around for the owner, I checked if their doors were unlocked and if I could turn the light off. Lucky for me, the doors were unlocked. I go into the car, turn the lights off, look for their key (to make sure I wasn't locking them out) and then locked the doors behind me. I park kind of far away from the school, and there have been several known thefts so I didn't want them to get robbed. This is where the question comes in though: my friend yelled at me and told me that I shouldn't have done that because maybe they would be right back or maybe they left the lights on for a reason, and that now they might be locked out of their car. So, AITA for turning off their lights and locking the doors?",

I started telling people and people have been mostly optimistic and happy for me... except for one person- My best friend of almost ten years. She was so pissed off at me that she said she didn't want me to be in the wedding (after I asked her to be a bridesmaid). Keep in mind we didn't even tell everyone in our families.... so it's not like we were keeping certain people outside of our lives specifically, we just felt like it was no one's business in general.

He’s known for being troublesome so I got a bit worried but I didn’t think much of it.\n\nFive minutes later, guess what? My friend’s friend (let’s call her spaghetti) was in that “I’m sad and I want attention but if you ask me what’s wrong I’ll say no until you insist” mode. My friend said “Spaghetti, are you okay? and she was like “I’m FINE.” and this went on for quite a bit. \n\nFinally she went outside for some air and the 6th grader I was talking about told us about how we’re such horrible friends for not inviting her places and such. Spaghetti told us it was a private convo and we weren’t supposed to know, but he’s just that type. I went and said to Spaghetti something along the lines of “Going out to the movies (which is what she was upset about!) was a private event between the three of us and I’m sorry you didn’t come but you’ve never invited me anywhere. Why should I?” \n\nKeep in mind that she HATES me and we literally never talk. I barely even know her.\n\nShe then said “Am I not one of your best friends?”\n\nI was dumbfounded. What???\n\n“Are you?” is what I said after she said that.\n\nShe then starting BAWLING and ran away.\n\nMy other friends looked at me with a totally shocked expression. \n\nI don’t know where this came from.

He works midnight shift at fast food but I see him on his days off. He says he is stressed out by his job and has rly odd sleep schedules and will stay up all night sometimes because he doesn't feel like he has time to himself. We both work 40 hours a week though. And he tells me I can come over the days I do. \n\nHe says he wants to see me and doesnt see why him sleeping while me trying to cuddle him isnt the best quality time for me. I feel bad when he asks me if I feel like I'm wasting my time because I complain of commute. I tried to explain that I feel lonely and bored because he isn't conscious. AITA? Should I be happy just to be able to see him and cuddle with him while he sleeps?\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend takes 2 hour naps when we hang out despite limited time (5 hour) we have together.

      "description": "Okay, I hope I managed to sum this up well. I made an account just to post this... here we go.\n\nMy (only) brother [20M] recently moved out of my family's house (which now only consists of me, my mother, and my father) for good because he is going to automotive school and has his own apartment now. Last week, he called me [15F] and I didn't pick up.\n\nI didn't pick up because I *do not* like him. At all. Throughout my entire childhood, he was a massive prick and basically harassed me non-stop to the point I had clinical depression at about age 8. Our relationship has gotten sort of better, but it really can't undo the years of abuse he put me through. I'm in therapy working through it now, so I think \"traumatic\" is a good adjective to describe what happened.\n\nIt's more amicable now and not abusive but I'm still not comfortable around him. I basically have 0 plans to speak to him unless he physically comes over, in which I don't really have a choice. But otherwise, I don't want to. My parents are aware of what a shitshow our relationship is; my mother in particular seems dead-set on having us be all buddy-buddy again, but I refuse. [We'll get more into detail about that.]\n\nThe first time he called and I didn't pick up, my father told me he called. I said I knew, and just made up some lie of \"I'll get back to him at some point.\" My mother also confronted me about it and said that we **had** to have a relationship at some point. I said the same thing I said to my dad.\n\nNaturally, I never called back. He tried calling again two days ago, and I didn't pick up again. Last night my dad said I should get back to him, but nothing more. My mother, however, confronted me again and said that I ***NEEDED*** to call him back and repair our relationship but I refused and said that I'm not speaking to him. She chewed me out and said I was acting like a bitch, and didn't really let me defend myself before she stormed off.\n\nSo I guess that's my question. *Am* I acting like a bitch [asshole], or am I justified here?\n\n**TDLR: Am I being an asshole because I don't want to speak to my brother, who has a track record of being an asshole?**",

      "title": "WIBTA if I quit a job peer mentoring low-income and Hispanic students?",
      "description": "Hi everyone. I am a member of an [HSI-STEM program](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/hsistem/index.html) wherein I mentor Hispanic and low income college students as a college student myself. The persons picked to be mentors are successful college students who are doing well in classes and extracurriculars who are either Hispanic or low income. I am of the low income type.\n\n\nIt is best to meet with them in person to gauge what they're going through. If they're feeling depressed I can see it, so I can ask about it and see what the problem is. When I find out what the issue is, I can direct them to specialized help, like one-on-one tutoring (which is 100% free for them, btw), mental health persons or whatever else they may go through. If it's by email or text, I don't get that human interaction.\n\n\nA majority of the students I am mentoring simply don't care for being in the program, though. When I ask to meet them in person, they just don't respond to my messages. I have to nag them constantly by email and by text. I saw one of the mentees (person being mentored) in person and I asked if he got my email. He said, \"I got it, I'll try to reply soon.\" My performance is gauged upon the frequency of my meetings since I'm paid a salary. If I don't meet frequently enough, I can be fired, so hence I'm forced to give in and do an email check in. To add salt to the wound, some of the mentees don't even reply with full sentences and write their messages as fragments and sometimes miss some of my questions.\n\n\nAt a previous meeting with the school staff managing this program, one of the mentors expressed that he couldn't get in touch with his students. The staff member was very rude to him and tried to ostracize him for not doing his job. It's out of his power to force the other students to reply to him so I can't see how he could be put at fault.\n\nWhile some of the students do reply and keep in touch with me, most of them don't. I just feel like I'm wasting my time and I find the whole thing stressful. However, if I quit, I will be forcing these students to be handed off to other mentors. The others are managing around 5, I am managing 7. I believe there are about 6 mentors, so each of them would get an extra person with one getting two extra. These mentors have expressed they have too many students to work with. I feel like I am jeopardizing a new program that just started last semester but at the same time I hate the work I'm doing and I just feel worthless with this job. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I resigned? \n\nAlso, I'm thinking of just saying I don't have the time to work due to school and my other job (in a polite and professional manner), which is partly true, though the main reason I'd like to quit is because I do not like this job. Would I be the asshole if I wasn't too open on the reason why I quit?",

      "title": "AITA for cutting off contact with long term friends?",
      "description": "This is a long one.\n\nAll through middle and high school there was a group of 6 of us, we were really close and spent a lot of time together. Eventually we parted ways when we went to college. After freshman year I was planning a trip to where one of them (let's call her Anna) was studying and I figured that I could meet up with her so I started talking to her about dates and places I could stay and stuff. \n\nNow, some background. These friends (Anna included) are pretty flaky. They had a bad habit of always cancelling plans at the last minute, which is a pet peeve of mine. We had previously planned a cross country road trip. I specifically told them (having been cancelled on last minute several times before) not to get started with this trip unless they seriously intended on coming. Of course, they cancelled and I got pretty annoyed (I did not confront them or do anything other than leave the chat group I was in with them). Now after this things went back to normal (or so I thought) but recently I found out from another friend that they thought I was being a bitch (which they did not communicate to me in any way). \n\nSo back to Anna. I had asked her if I we could maybe stay in a room together while I was there and to give me her dates. I kept asking her for a few days but eventually she stopped replying. I got pissed (having been in this situation before) and just planned my trip without her involved.\n\nA few months later she let us know that her uncle had died. I expressed my condolences. However, a few days later I found out via snapchat story that she had actually come into town (across the country from where she was studying), met up with 3/6 girls in our group and gone back to college without even telling me or my other friend Barbara (also part of the group) that she was even in town. I was extremely shocked and upset by this. I knew maybe I shouldn't have ghosted her about the trip but to come all the way into town and not even seen me (or my other friend)? Furthermore, a few weeks later she came back again to attend some event, once again didn't contact me or my other friend and left without telling us that she was even in town. Since then I haven't spoken to her or the other girls in the group she met with who apparently didn't think it was worthwhile to let us know that she had come back. She had given no indication that she was upset or angry with me in any way. \n\nI should add that we had already been growing apart for a while (the 4 of them vs me and my friend Barbara). I don't know why she would suddenly stop talking to me. Is it my fault for being annoyed that they flaked on the road trip I was planning? If they had explained to me that they were hurt by what I had done at the time I would have apologised but they made no mention of it to me (one of them told Barbara, who recently told me). So AITA? Should I apologize and try to patch up?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster. \nForgive the formatting as I am on mobile.  \nI tried to be as detailed as possible to remain un-biased to whomever these reviews go to but I was also limited on characters (5000).\n\nSM = Service manager \nSA = Service Advisor \nCA = Cashier  \n    \n    This is what happened to me recently, and I am not sure if I am the asshole or not, but this is a copy/paste of the review I filled out. (A form they sent me in an email, as they do after all service visits.)\n\n     It should also be known that SMs emotions may have been involved because as I was initially going back and forth with SM, SA received a phone call that her mother had passed. She did say they were not close, nor have they been for years, and that it was a long time coming but she was very emotional, but did not leave work nor plan to see her. This is also the main reason SM decided to tall to me on the phone, I believe however I did offer to wait until SA had a chance to take everything in and do what she needed to do. SA was not involved after her receiving the phone call. \n\n     Also, that said, SM was already dead set on me paying for the alignment before SA got the terrible news. \n\n\n     I would like to start off by emphasizing that the service advisor SA, who took my car in and helped me throughout the process, was phenomenal. SA was very courteous and upfront with me regarding my vehicle (including teaching me about a feature on my vehicle that i did not even know about!) So first and foremost, I would like to thank SA!\n\n     I believe it is worth noting that if it weren't for SA, I would be leaving a 1 star review. If I had the option to review SA on her service alone, as well as the cashier CA, I would be leaving them both 5 stars. \n\n     However, my experience overall was not pleasant due to the SM's actions. SM was not only very unprofessional, but also unnecessarily confrontational with me. He was also unreasonable, and did not allow me to explain myself fully, without cutting me off to speak over me repeatedly while I was trying to voice my concerns and reasoning. \n\n     On Thursday evening , I dropped my vehicle off at the service department, due to an impact with an object or pothole in the road early that same day. SA took my car in to have 4 new rims and tires installed on the vehicle, including necessary labor (mount and balance of tires, R&amp;R TPMS sensors from old rims to new, and an alignment.) I was clear upfront that the reasoning for my visit was because of this impact, and to let me know if anything I was unaware of needed to be replaced/worked on as a result. \n\n     The requested work was completed on Friday, and I was informed that the drivers side front strut and steering knuckle needed replacement (I was not asked if I would like to go ahead and have this done before the alignment, which in my experience is common practice as to avoid charging the customer for 2 alignments for essentially one job.) I was also informed that it was obvious that these parts needed replacement as you could visually see the drivers side front tire now had a heavy negative camber (think drift car, where the tires tilt extremely inward.) At this point, I was disappointed on having to spend another $1,000 or so (as quoted) on this visit, but I understand life happens and fully expected to have these parts replaced at my cost. However, I also assumed I would not be paying for an alignment at this time due to the \"damaged\" suspension components that would require another alignment after replacement should I have gone that route. I was unable to pick the vehicle up the same day, due to working late so I let them know I would be coming in Saturday morning to settle payment, and reschedule having the damaged suspension components replaced. \n\n     Continuing on to the morning of Saturday, I arrive to pick up my vehicle and am immediately put off by the fact that the full cost of the alignment is still on my bill. The alignment print out was also not attached to my paperwork (I believe this to be common practice.) After speaking with the front end technician, SA, and SM, I'm told that I cannot take possession of my vehicle without paying for the full price of the alignment. However, after I myself begin asking why I am paying for 2 alignments, SM agrees with me that he will not charge me for the 2nd alignment, if I bring my vehicle back the following week to have the remaining suspension work completed. He states that he will just remove the previous techs pay and apply it to the next when he performs the work. As I am disappointedly waiting in line to pay for the services, I realize that it is not right for me to pay for an alignment when my car has not actually been aligned properly. So, I asked CA if i could please speak with SM again. She could not find him, and so she calls him on her personal cellphone. He then requests to speak to me over the phone rather than allowing me to wait for him to be available to speak in person. To summarize the conversation between SM and I, I would repeatedly attempt to relay my concern and reasoning to him while he would repeatedly cut me off and speak over me not allowing me to finish my sentence or how I would like to go about the situation. I did manage to ask him to politely allow me to speak and finish my thoughts, which was that I agreed that his technician deserved to be paid for the work he did, but not for the complete alignment that was not performed. SM also admitted to me that his tech did not do anything more than an alignment check, and did not even pick up a wrench to attempt an alignment. I told him I would like to pay for half of the alignment cost, as he did half of a job. He agreed and I gladly paid the fair cost. \n\n\n     At this point I take possession of my vehicle only to realize myself that my frame has been compromised, therefore the suspension parts were not the true cause of not being able to align and would have been an unnecessary cost to me. I then decide to go though my insurance who verifies (at the time of writing this) the suspension work was actually not required and appears to be in perfect working order. \n\n\n     So, AITA for wanting this guy to be reprimanded within his company?\n",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my wife to help me learn Spanish?",
      "description": "She grew up in the Caribbean, Spanish as a first language, but learning English growing up.  She's lived in the States for about 15 years now and is fluent in both languages.  We, obviously, speak English at home, but she has family local and stays in touch with family back home, so she speaks Spanish pretty much daily.  Just not to me.\n\nOk, when we first started dating, I told her I was trying to learn Spanish.  Where I live and with the job  I do, speaking Spanish is very useful.  But, yes, I also was trying to score a few points early in the relationship.  I specifically remember her saying something to the effect of \"yeah, that's cool, but if you ask for my help, don't flake out on me\".  Ok, fair enough.\n\nIn the last couple of years, I've made some progress, using the phone apps, audio lessons, workbooks, etc.  I honestly feel like I've kept up my end of the \"don't flake out on me\" deal.  But getting her to help me has been very frustrating.  I've pulled out the books right in front of her and started working on lessons or whatever and gotten no reaction at all.  Directly asking for help isn't much better...at best, I get an unenthusiastic correction on my pronunciation or whatever...at worst, I feel actively discouraged.  \n\nFor example, something happened today which kinda prompted this post...I sent her a text message asking, in Spanish, what a particular word meant in English.  Her response was \"what are you trying to say\".  Ok, so autocorrect did kinda jack it up, but I clarified it.  The response was \"I have no idea what you're trying to say.\"  So I went back....checked my work...sounded it all out...no, I felt like I got it pretty darn close, if not 100% accurate.  When I said so, she said she meant that she didn't know the word that I was asking about.  Ok, so why not just say that instead of making it seem like everything I said was so wrong that you couldn't decipher it?  This is characteristic of the \"help\" that she has provided over the time that I've been asking for it.  I'll practice something, try to make sure I have it right or really close...and then when I ask her about it or try to say something to her, all my effort is thrown out on account of a minor mistake or mispronunciation here or there....which is kinda the point, since I'm trying to learn...\n\nSo here's the part where I feel like I might be the asshole...this gets frustrating.  She expresses a desire to help, but the help she provides is not...helpful.  I get it...just because someone speaks a language doesn't a) mean they are proficient at teaching it or b) obligated to help someone else learn, regardless of their relationship.  So she says she wants to help, but her actions don't really match that.  Am I the asshole for pushing the issue?\n\nNot sure if this matters...but there is one more layer or two to this which makes it a little more frustrating for me.  One, she is in school...and frequently asks for my help with papers, projects, studying, etc.  I want to see her be successful, so I happily agree.  To then get sub-optimal support in return kinda sucks.  Also, and more serious, I think...we spend quite a bit of time with her family, both stateside and when we travel back to her home.  Some of them speak English, but very often, pretty much the entirety of the conversation  during these visits will be in Spanish.  I'm stuck there, sitting next to her, barely able to understand what everyone is talking about (although that has gotten better with my own self study).  When I expressed frustration with that circumstance, I get the same old story of wanting to help, but then nothing ever coming of it, as usual.  \n\nSo...am I the asshole for trying to get the help from my wife who is obviously not really into helping me?  Or do I have a case that she could step up her game a little bit?",

      "description": "I suppose just feeling the need to put down context is pushing the needle in a certain direction. This doesn't bode well...:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened almost exactly 1 year ago, it was the week of Valentines 2018. I had a gf for about 7 years, off-on for the last 3. She was my first kiss and everything, we were both from different states, and different lives, we met in a New England boarding school... I was fortunate to have a mother that saw where things were going in my family and area (older brother caught a felony for bank robbery, younger didnt finish HS) and pushed me to enroll in programs that assisted low-income children in finding private secondary education. I got a full-ride, so did she, thats kinda how we bonded in a school filled with millionaire kids. I thought I loved her, we spent every moment together, as kids do. By senior year, I was pretty sick of it, and was looking forward to separating as we were going to different schools. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were off and on for the first 3 years after HS, at one point I had an apartment with her, which ended catastrophically imo. We got in a fight, she got drunk, went out and cheated halfway through the lease. We ended our exclusive relationship and rode the rest of the lease out as friends with benefits essentially... when I left she dated my 'good' friend for the next 3 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was pretty sad we barely talked after I left, after sharing so much. At a certain point I started doing meth. Not too much, but yeah, I was functioning; bills, apartment, job, etc. She heard through the grapevine what I was up to and paid me a surprise visit while I was sleeping off some days. By literally getting my landlord to let her in the building to bang on my door as I was essentially comatose. When she saw that it wasn't just cannabis I was smoking, she told my parents despite promising not to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got pretty upset about her squealing, and so she extended an olive branch, to visit her where she just got a new job, and a nice apartment.  I understood the sentiment, but she was inviting me to stay with her over the week of Valentines Day.  She was still seeing that 'good' friend at the time, but as I understood it, they were long distance and open while they were apart. She also spent her bday with him 1 day before my visit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats the context lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI flew out, and took a bus to visit her. I arrive, and its quickly apparent to me I'm there to be her romantic preoccupation for the week. I wasn't entirely surprised, but the sex was intensely disappointing. However, when she was at work, her roommate and I would hang out. We tried not to, but after we discussed how my ex was with her current bf just 1 day before I arrived, we soon became intimate. I don't think I'll ever experience that type of passion ever again. We were planning on telling the ex before I left, we just were unsure of how to broach the topic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn one occasion,  4 days before my plane was going back home, she came home early from work. She walked in on us, and blew up. Hysterical. It was funny one of the first things out of her mouth was, 'and you're sober!?\" I reminded her we broke up three years ago and she had a current bf. She called everyone we knew and told them, airing our dirty laundry to every single contact we shared, pretty sure the teachers at my HS heard about it even. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithin 2 hours, I was packed and on a bus to Chicago. My plane wasn't for a few days, and my mind, heart, and soul were in complete tumult. I didn't even care about the ex, all I could think about was the roommate and the destroyed look in her eyes as I waved goodbye. I could have gotten a room for 4 days, I was riding off some pretty generous crypto gains at the time, but I in a pretty weird emotional state and wasn't thinking clearly. So I had myself a little adventure, if you care to keep on with this rambling: [https://www.wattpad.com/567699124-a-winter%27s-walk-peeking-through-plywood](https://www.wattpad.com/567699124-a-winter%27s-walk-peeking-through-plywood)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso am the i asshole. or is she. I could have played it better, for sure. But she didn't have to kick me out is all I'm saying, she invited me there to 'help me get away from bad influences' and then proceeds to kick me out to Chicago. And the roommate were definitely going to tell her, we were just waiting for a smooth opportunity. \n\n/end\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Okay, I lived with these people for a semester. They didn’t clean the shared bathroom, broke quiet hours rules and generally irritated me for a semester with loud music and obnoxious noises. They also left a wad of long, black hair in the drain. That was the final straw, plus I was going home for winter the next day so, I typed up a note in anger and slid it under the door. I insulted their music, loud noises and shedding problem. I feel slightly bad about how angry I was, but the semester wore on me and I had finals right before the hair wad and needed to shower before they took it for a solid hour. They also were up at all hours chattering. 10pm-10am is the usual quiet hours in my dorm. Finals week it was 24 hours. They repeatedly refused to shut up when I tried to study in the evenings. They refused to communicate. So, am I the asshole?",

I primarily do the laundry which means collecting dirty clothes, sorting them, washing + drying and bringing them upstairs. \n\nThe one thing I don't do is folding. An important factor here is that my mom and dad want their laundry folded while the other kids and I do not mind if our laundry is folded or not. \n\nWhen this is brought up my dad claims it would be better for me to not do the laundry at all if I'm not going to fold it at the end since it builds up on the couch. \n\nMy logic is as follows. Me doing the laundry aids the family better then not doing it at all even if I do not fold it at then end.\n\nAITA? \n\n(Note this is all in good fun. I'm probably still going to do the laundry, my dad will still ask for me to fold it all, I'll do it because he works constantly and deserves it. I just want to know who others agree with.( \n\n\n\n\n",

We've always been real close, I've helped him through family issues, he helped me through some rough times, the usual sappy friend stuff. We also had a pretty common ground on what video games we liked and this was our primary way of hanging out.\n\nUp until recently that is. Due to a mix of circumstances he has far more free time than I do, and we've barely done anything together in a while. He's always got a new game he's really into, and by the time I get around to getting said game for myself, the coversation usually goes \n\nMe: \"Hey dude I got that game wanna play?\"\n\nHim: \"I don't know man I'm pretty far in, you can't really do the same content I can/you won't do any damage/ etc etc\"\n\nThis has happened with quite a few things. Monster Hunter, Destiny, most recently War Thunder. Is it petty that I feel like I'm getting left behind? I want to go back to being able to game with my best bud but finding something we can both play on the same level has been a struggle lately.\n\nSorry if this got dangerously close to /r/RelationshipAdvice territory lol.",

I was willing to switch games right then. \n\nShe goes back to what she was doing on her phone so I continue playing. \n\nAfter I'm bored of the game, I turn off the console and she confronts me;\n\n‘You're done?’\n‘Mhm. That's about it for now’\n‘I asked to play Minecraft two hours ago.’\n\nI explained to her that I fully acknowledged her asking earlier and even offered to stop my game immediately. I further explained that after she expressed concern with interrupting a mission, I insisted that I wasn't doing anything important and could stop immediately. That she was the one who essentially decided not to play, not me. \n\nShe got upset with me after that. Nothing serious, but it was noticeable she was bothered. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not switching over to play Minecraft after insisting that it was an okay time and she didn't tell me when she wanted to play?\n",

About a year ago, I reached out to my friend to tell him that she was cheating on him, and should do something about it. He felt conflicted because the only proof I had at the time was just some of the first hand accounts where she’s dancing with other guys or she’s being flirty when he’s not around. They are long distance, and when we go out to bars, I constantly find her in situations where she’s dancing with other dudes. Fast forward, they’re still together, and now I have some more proof where i have personally heard her say she’s made out with other dudes/ wants to fuck one of her co-workers. \n\nThe reason I haven’t told him lately is because I’m afraid he won’t do anything, plus she is best friends with my gf as well and I am afraid of effecting their relationship.

So I went there told her what we wanted and what day we wanted to have it done. She said it would be no problem and said which artist it would be. So then I ended up just hanging out for close to three hours just chatting with everyone. So when I went to leave I asked if it was all good and she said yeah. So I thought everything was set. The  next day I sent her a text and asked if I needed to text the artist what we wanted and stuff and she tells me that isn’t how it works. I need to set up an appointment and put a deposit down. Well at that point I got pretty pissed because it was the whole reason I was at the shop to begin with. So I asked her why we didn’t do it the day before and she just laughed and said she didn’t know. So I text my friend about it and his friend suggests another shop so I went by there and instantly the guy set everything up and we showed up at our scheduled time and got our work done and we were both happy with it and had a great time. Well I saw her and a bunch of people from the shop tonight and she asked about it and asked where I got it done and I told her and everyone got mad at me for it.  So AITA for going somewhere else?",

      "description": "4 years ago when I was 21, I tracked my dad down after he left before I was born. He was sorry, we bonded we have a great relationship. Now go to my mom.\n\nBecause the relationship with my dad and I went so well, I asked my moms permission to find her dad because she had never met him\n\nShe said yes, I could look for him if I knew the name, but she doubted her abusive mother would give us the full name after all these years. Much to our surprised my grand mother gave me first name last and city. It was a city in Greece. It was difficult to find at first because he's an older guy and his language uses different characters. That night I ended up finding someone with a similar last name from the same city. I reached out to her that night. I sent her some info who I was and who I was looking for.\n\nA week later she told me that she was related to who I was looking for. Although she hasn't seen him in 20 years, she could help. She lived in a city a few hours away. But was returning to city for the first time in a few years.\n\n2.5 weeks into the process I found my grand father(updating my mom every step). Video chatted. got my mom video chatting shortly after. He had a picture of my mom as a kid framed in his house, he never had another family. \n\nMy abusive grand mother was psycho, a year after my mom was born my grand mother left from Greece and went to the United States. My grand father was looking for them and following for some time. Eventually couldn't keep up. When my grand father would some how find a phone number and call. My grand mother would answer and tell my grand father that my mom didn't want to talk to him(she never knew). The last time he looked for my mom was like 2 or 3 years ago\n\nMy mom doesn't know how to feel with it. My grand father is old and sick and I know if she doesn't go to Greece to see him, she will regret it. She doesn't know how a 47yo woman needs a relationship with a 70yo man. I keep telling her she doesn't have time but she doesnt think shes ready, I found him 5 months ago. Besides saying she doesn't know how she'd feel. She feels she's betraying her step father, who although wasn't much better than her mom, but was still her dad. I've got my step grand fathers phone number and I want to call him and ask him if he would feel betrayed. Would I be an asshole to ask him that and possibly take away one of the obstacles my mom keeps trying to put up?\n\nTldr: found my long lost grand father, mom gave me permission to find him, but now she doesn't want to meet him. Thinks shes betraying her step father, I want to ask him directly what he thinks. ",

      "title": "AITA for not feeling sad that my grandfather is dying?",
      "description": "Just writing the title made me feel awful.\n\nBasically, my grandfather is once again in the hospital but now it's really bad. He's most likely going to die soon.\n\nI have a few fond memories of him and of course I want him to live, but here's the thing. I haven't talked to him or my grandmother since I was 10. That was 15 years ago.\n\nMy dad, my sister and I don't have any kind of relationship with them. Even when we were on speaking terms with them, our relationship was... complicated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy grandmother is probably the worst human being I had the misfortune to ever met. To give you guys an example, one time several people from her street gathered signatures to make her leave the neighborhood. That's how bad she was with people, and that was with strangers. With us it was even worse. The four of us had to live with my grandparents when I was little and it was awful. My grandmother hated my mother and the fact that I was born before my parents got married, so she did everything she could to terrorize the both of us. She would go to my room at night and tell me the devil was going to take me away in my sleep. She would hide the kitchen supplies so my mom wouldn't be able to cook. There's more, but that's stuff for another subreddit. When my dad discovered all of this, he took us away and cut ties with them. My grandfather didn't do anything, but that's exactly the problem. He didn't do anything. As I said, I have a couple of happy memories of him, but that's what I remember the most.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom tried to keep the contact but by then I was old enough to decide so I told her I didn't want to see them anymore. They never made any effort to fix the relationship, so that was the end of it. Until now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople have always asked me how I would feel when they die and I never had an answer, simply because I don't have any feelings towards them. As harsh as it sounds, for me they just don't exist. Now that is happening, I feel the same way. Only sad that my dad is going through this, sad that he's feeling so conflicted about his own father's death. Maybe I'm in denial and the grieve will strike later. I want to return to my hometown to be there for my dad, but I don't want to go to the funeral and I don't want to see my grandmother ever again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend told me that maybe I'll regret not seeing my grandfather before he dies. That maybe there's something I want to say to him, even if it's just goodbye. I know he's not judging me and understands where I'm coming from. But I can't help to feel ashamed of myself for feeling this way. To be honest, I feel like a monster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have anything to say to him now. I've said goodbye to both of them long ago and as long as I know, neither of them have asked for my sister and I to be there. Am I the asshole for not going now? Am I the asshole for feeling so indifferent about his death? Am I the asshole for not wanting to make the effort to be there for them?",

      "description": "So my sister has two sons under 10 who I love with all my heart and love hanging out with.\n\nHowever, I feel at times that whatever opportunity my sister finds me without plans, she asks me to babysit them for her (she's a single mum so doesn't get a lot of time to herself). I do of course babysit most of the time but there are many occasions that I pretend to make plans or passively show her she's asking me too much.\n\nMost conversations go like this:\n\nHer: \"So what are your work shifts like this week?\"\nMe: \"I'm off Tuesday and Wednesday.\"\nHer: \"That's cool. Would you be able to babysit on Tuesday evening?\"\n\nI feel like there is no longer any genuine interest in my life and these questions are more to know when she can have some free time for herself. When this happens, I feel much more resentment towards babysitting and end up making excuses.\n\nI understand it's difficult to work and have kids by yourself- no denying that. I just don't like the feeling of basically being a nanny rather than a sister.\n\nI do kind of feel like an asshole but I always try and justify my actions so I need an objective opinion.",

      "description": "So I'd met up with this guy once before, it had gone pretty great and we both expressed that we would like to meet again, and soon as he's only in town for the week. Today around 6pm he messages me telling me he'll hit me up later, I don't hear from him for a few hours until 11:30pm when he texts me, I ask him when he'll be free, and he answers that he's in bed, which I interpret as him telling me to come over. I text back that I'm on my way if he's cool with it and don't get a response. \nI make the 30 minute walk to his place, at this point it's 12:30. We both have plans early in the morning that we've communicated, but I figured it would be worth it. I get to his room's window (the place I last met him at) and he's asleep, lights are on and he's holding his phone. At this point I face a massive dilemma, either turn back or try to wake him up. I think about it, text a friend, friend says that I've come too far to turn around, and I figure that if I fell asleep after making a plan I'd feel bad for just wasting someone's time. So I knock. He doesn't wake up, knock a few more times and I'm about to give up and go home when he wakes up.\nHe looks around, opens the blinds more glares at me, shakes his head then closes the blinds and turns the lights off. I take this as my cue to go home, having wasted an hour of my time and feeling like an asshole. He also then blocks me on the app where we met, and I assume also blocks my number, but I haven't tried to hit him up since. \nSo, AITA? \n",

But loud and fun on backroads.\n\nAnyways, I went to the mall today to get a hair cut and as I was looking for a parking spot I see this kid, probably like 7 or 8 and he is looking at my car as I'm driving by (it's been snowing lately where I live so traction has been a problem) I'm doing my best to not get stuck on level ground but the lot hasn't been plowed and its deep for my lowered car. So I'm slipping and trying to manage whatever traction I have. back to this kid, he waves at me! And he had a FXR jacket on so I'm thinking \"cool kid like cars and stuff\" so I drop the clutch and rip forwards a bit, I know fwd shouldn't do burnout and we cant drift but a roudy inline 5 sounds good.. the kid is jumping up and down and visibly pleased with what I have done so all good right?? WRONG!!!! this woman who i can only assume to be his mother comes running and starts yelling at me that I should have my license taken away and I could have killed someone or wreaked a car....\n\nPosting here because she actually called me an asshole... just curious if she was right or not. \n\nJudge away redditors ",

Accused me of scamming.\n\nConnected the dots and figured that was probably the case, so I just took the soonest bus home with all the chocolate and money.

My only concern is that I have become pretty close to a few of the people and would feel incredibly guilty for potentially doing this, but the feelings of annoyance and reluctance to hang out have been overpowering recently. It's hard to explain but we just aren't clicking right and I have kind of dug myself into a hole by faking my feelings the past month or so. The reason I am having a hard time is because one person in particular really became attached to me, which is fine, but this person does not have a lot of other friends and I would feel like a jerk if I ended up removing myself. This person has a lot going on in their personal life and I feel bad but im just not sure how much longer I can bring myself to \"fake\" being friendly when I can't help but get annoyed whenever I am around them.

He has an extremely controlling mother at home, who gives him extremely high expectations and no rewards when he actually reaches them.\n\nAnd not just that, our form teacher is a pretty unreasonable person, she's screamed at our class, including the two of us a good number of times. He hates her, and I wouldn't say I'm fond of her either.\n\nSo he's pretty sad about it. He's attempted to avoid thinking about it by sharing jokes and memes, as well as having the two of us roast each other, but today was different.\n\nDuring class, he made a mistake answering one of our teacher's questions. It was an answer the teacher just explained about earlier, so I told him, \"That's what you get for not listening in class!\"\n\nHe screamed \"SHUT UP! \" at me. The whole class went silent. They all heard it.\n\nI went over to him after class. I gave him an apology, but he ignored me. This went on for a while, until I got irritated and told him that by ignoring me he was only pushing his friends away. I told him he was only pushing away the very people trying to help him by ignoring me. He told me that \"sorry\" wasn't what he wanted from me at the moment.\n\nThen here comes the assholeness. I started half-assing my apologies, saying \"sorry lah! \". I would say this was because that was his usual form of apology, whether to me, or to friends, or to his own family members. I was mad, so I asked him when was the last time he sincerely apologized to me, the last time he cared for me. He told me he doesn't care about people who don't care about him, something I would say I don't agree with. I had stayed back in class to ask him about his condition, and comforted him before. \n\nNow I tried to apologize to him in the most sincere way possible. He only replied that \"sometimes, a hurt person doesn't want to hear the word 'sorry '. I grabbed his bag as he was walking out the classroom, shouting that I couldn't end it here because he might kill himself on his way out. I was genuinely worried for him. But he told me to \"fuck off\". Now I'm unsure of what to do.\n\nAm I the asshole here? And how do I help him? ",

      "description": "Hi all,\n\nI'd like to know if WIBTA if I leave the note below in my neighbors letterbox. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went by my mom's place yesterday to help out with some stuff, and I about hit the roof when I saw that my grandma's truck had been cited. I've written the letter as my mom and was planning on sending it to her for approval before I do anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor context, the truck is a small pickup. My mom lives on a quiet suburban street with plenty of parking and a nature area that runs behind the houses on one side of the street. We parked the truck 3 houses down from her front door on the side of the street where there are no houses, just the nature area. There are houses on the opposite side of the street, but there was space for probably 12 more cars where my grandma was parked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*NOTE\\*\\***\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dear Neighbor,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We recently received a citation from the city on one of our vehicles parked on this street. We had another vehicle parked directly in front of our house for over 72 hours, so we can only assume that one of our neighbors called the city specifically about our truck.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We’d like to respectfully request that you refrain from doing this in the future. This truck has not been abandoned or left for free parking by someone outside the neighborhood; it belongs to my elderly mother who has recently had to move into our house. (You may have noticed the handicapped plates when you were calling the city) She’s currently recovering from a hip replacement surgery and isn’t able to drive, but she’d like to keep her truck for when she is feeling better. We chose to park it down on this end of the street in hope that it’s presence wouldn’t bother anyone. I wrongly assumed that if it wasn’t parked directly in front of anyone’s house and blocking parking for the houses on the street, it wouldn’t be a problem.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have lived her for nearly 20 years, and are well aware that people often leave their trailers and RVs in this spot, which I’m sure is a nuisance. I apologize for any inconvenience my mother’s truck may have caused. However, it is within 200 feet of our front door, so moving it is not a problem if it is in your way. With your permission, we would like to continue to park the truck here without needing to move it every 72 hours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If you have any questions about this or would like to discuss further please give me a call at (XXX)XXX-XXXX or drop by the house.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Courteously,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Your neighbors at XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX XXXX\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Side note before reading: I am pretty good at pretending (I'm in the theatre club at my old school) and have some decent manipulating skills, which I usually don't use for anything bad.\n\nBackstory:\n\nOver a year ago I became really depressed.\nHowever I continued to pretend I was okay and for quite some time no one, except one friend (lets call him Tim) noticed. \nAt the time, I wasn't close to him, which soon changed, because he started helping me and we tried talking to my parents about it (My parents are lovely people, who provide really well for me, but they are incredibly busy with work and our bond isn't that strong). \n\nEventually, after having a breakdown, I started seeing a therapist. During that time, I learned a lot about showing others how I feel and started telling my best friends about my depression, though I never told them exactly what's going on. I didn't talk to anyone about my feelings except Tim, so everyone else just knew I was depressiv, but they didn't know anything else. \nWhen I tried to talk to my best friends about it, they usually ignored me or didn't take my problems with family etc serious, probably because they just didn't know any better (they were 16 at the time). \n\nNonetheless, I was fairly honest about how I felt.\n\nNow:\n\nI came out as trans a few months ago and it went really well. I told everyone how great I am doing. However for some weeks I've been feeling incredibly depressiv. I kinda told Tim, but I made it seem a lot less serious than it is. \nI am pretending as if I am perfectly fine and usually it's not an issue, since my friends are busy with school and work, so I don't get asked, how I'm doing that much. \nAlso I apologized to my best friends for lying and promised I'd change and tell the truth from now on.\n\nNow one of my best friends texted me about her crush and stuff like that and I told her how I was suprised, she'd still trust me after how much I lied to her. She said, she had forgiven me and gives me a chance and how she's proud, that I'm trying so hard to change. \n\nBut I haven't changed a bit. I'm still lying and I can't change. They had to go through so much, because of me. I was a real asshole while I was depressiv and they always Tim always had to care for me, I just really don't want to become this asshole again, I want to protect them from my depression, but now I feel shitty for lying and feel like an asshole anyway and since they don't ask about it, I feel like they don't really want to know.\n\nDo you think I am doing the wrong thing? Or are my friends and family in the wrong for not caring a lot? ",

      "description": "Sorry for the lengthy post but some backstory is required..\n\nI’m 32 years old and Friend #1 and I have been best friends since 8th grade. Over the years we’ve had ups and downs but we consider ourselves brothers at this point. While I’ve had a moderately successful adulthood, he’s been a mess. Discharged from the military, had issues with his baby mama and other exes, and has been in and out of court for custody battles and minor drug issues (weed. No big deal since it’s legal in his home state, but he was caught with it in a state where it’s illegal). He’s burned a lot of bridges with the friends that I have made as an adult, so not many of my adult friends like being around him anymore. He’s also very hot headed and tends to be kind of jealous of the friends I’ve made in my later years. To top it all off, he’s had a rough patch lately, so much so that during a alcohol induced meltdown he threatened to take his life a few weeks back. He’s getting some help and is doing a lot better, but after years of his life being a mess I’m starting to feel drained having to always be his emotional support. He lives in a different state, but we made plans for him to drive out to see me so that we could watch Avengers Endgame together. \n\nFriend #2 and I met about 7 years ago and I consider him one of my best friends today. We have a lot in common, he’s very successful, and overall he has his life together. Before he moved out of state for a promotion we made it a habit to watch every Marvel movie in theaters together. Our very first being Avengers. I was lucky enough to go on a business trip to his city last year when Infinity War was released, so that helped keep the tradition alive. I wasn’t in a position to fly out on my own dime to see him for Endgame this year, so I was accepting of the fact that we wouldn’t be able to watch Endgame together. Hence the plans I made with Friend #1 from above. \n\nBeing as successful as he is, Friend #2 offered to pay for my airfare to fly to his city so we could finish the tradition by watching Endgame together. So now I’m in a pickle.. No matter what I choose I feel like either way I’m letting someone down. \n\nWIBTA if I ditch my best friend and go watch Avengers Endgame with my close friend instead??  \n",

      "description": "TL;DR: Can’t really fully tell the situation without this long post, but basically because of the ways our personalities are, I did not put as much effort as my friend did. Some of my bad social habits were amplified for my friend as we are together 24/7 as college roommates and this combination caused them to eventually develop actual severe anxiety and painful panic/anxiety attacks. I don’t know if anybody is at fault, and just feel like an ignorant piece of shit in general.\n\nJust want to clarify beforehand that I don’t think anybody in this situation is an actual “asshole”, but that I just don’t know if I should be feeling as guilty as I do and just need some advice. If this situation fits better in some other subreddit or community please let me know.\n\nStory starts two semesters ago. My friend (lets call them Sam) and I both went to the same school together and mainly knew each from other high school before going to university. We were probably one of each other’s closest friends. We both had applied to transfer to the same university in the Spring 2018 semester. We both got in and decided to room together We knew about people who roomed with close friends from before and how it led to drama and broken friendships. We thought we were close enough to the point where we could talk about anything, and the alternative of having to room with someone completely random was worse (for me especially, at least, because I’m a bit of a germaphobe and kinda felt like I needed to be with someone tidy). \n\nIn the Spring 2018 semester, we became good friends with few other people. Since we were in the same friend group, we saw each other almost 24/7. However, between end of Spring 2018 and early Fall 2018, we started noticing issues. To help preface this, I’ll quickly tell a bit about myself in high school. Early high school I didn’t like life and, even though I didn’t have any severe anxiety or anything of the sort, I still was always anxious and very low self-confidence. Later on I started hanging out with different people who made me a lot less nervous about being social. I became much more confident in myself, but I also lost some self-awareness. Even though I didn’t realize it at the time, I grew a small tendency to circlejerk around past events, inside jokes, and memes with people even when in the big group, which understandably can be awkward for those who do not know about it and could cause FOMO. It wasn’t a very significant issue at the time though, because we would only really see friends at school and had a lot of time outside of school with family and other friends to clear our minds. \n\nEven though I am somewhat outgoing now, I still need a lot of alone time to be happy. Sam, however, is pretty different in that they are a very high-energy person and put a lot of effort in their friendships. In the big picture sense, my idea of a close friendship is a lot different than Sam’s, and even though we both love each other equally, Sam naturally put in a lot more effort and attention that I did, and I was not able to reciprocate. This caused Sam to, over time and understandably, feel hurt and feelings of “why do I even try” because they would notice things about the energy I put in, big and small. This, combined with the FOMO and feeling of being left out from my circlejerk-y and sometimes inconsiderate tendencies made their mental state very bad. Sam talked to me about it. We eventually decided it was best if we stay really close and help each other through this, and that I work on my bad social habits and be more considerate. I am getting better with the habits, but the anxiety is now physically hurting Sam as they have actually somewhat severe panic/anxiety attacks sometimes. \n\nThe attacks happen fewer and farther in between now, but I am scared that the anxiety will never leave Sam, and that it developed into something that will stay with them forever. I am helping them a lot as we figure it out, being cautious when I’m with Sam in social situations so as to not trigger bad memories from before and helping them calm down during an attack. We are totally on good terms and are working hard as two good friends to get through this, but the fact still remains that seeing me in social situations and small things I do trigger their anxiety. I did not expect to get into the type of close relationship that Sam expected early in college and I was just being the close friend in the way that I knew, but at same time so were they. Even though I was unaware of my bad social habits, I feel like they were never extremely severe, but the combination of the habits with being 24/7 with Sam, the energy/effort difference between us, and general stress from leaving home to college made it a lot worse from Sam’s perspective. I don’t know what to do, and I feel like I fucked over my friend’s completely happy and confident mental state because of my ignorance. I am starting to feel like how I felt beginning of high school, and dread social situations because I don’t want to hurt anyone or myself anymore. I know we are on good terms and will eventually find some kind of balance and work things out together, but I still feel like I caused this and don’t what to feel about myself, Sam, or anything for that matter.",

      "description": "Over the holidays last year I spent time with my husbands family. My MIL didnt attend the wedding so she wanted photos of my husband and I in our wedding clothes. Fair enough, we agreed. The only day before the photographer left for the holidays was the day our plane landed, and I was fairly grumpy. Long flight, no sleep, and I was 9 weeks pregnant at the time so I was just sick and cramping. The photographer and his assistant knew all of this. I was bloated, and my wedding dress didnt fit me properly, so it was unzipped in the back and I had a wrap on to hide that fact so I was feeling pretty shitty about myself. After couples photos, the photographer wanted individual shots of my husband and I. I get into a pretty generic photo pose, and smiled. They ask me to move my arm a certain way, tilt my head, whatever. I guess I wasnt doing it right, because the assistant came around and started grabbing my arms, tilting my head, kind of shifting me around for the position. I'm really irritated at this point, and I huff while shes positioning me around. Then she says \"Come on, dont you want to look thin and pretty?.\" Which set me off. I dont like being touched by strangers, I dont like taking photos, and I've always been self concious about my weight and pregnancy wasnt helping that, on top of a long flight and no sleep, so I snapped. I told her \"I don't need to look thin and fucking pretty. I'm not a fucking barbie doll, so keep your hands off me. I'm fucking done with this bullshit.\" and I stormed upstairs to the guest room (we were at my MIL's house) I was crying, my husband talked to his mom for a second then came upstairs to comfort me. I changed into comfy clothes that actually fit and after a little while I went back downstairs and apologised. We finished taking photos with everyone in comfortable clothing instead of their Sunday best, and no individual shots of me. The assistant was a bit colder towards me than she had been earlier, but she was still polite. I still feel like a huge dick about the fit I threw. So, I come to you and await your judgement. Was I the asshole?",

      "description": "I work at a newspaper, and like all newspapers, layoffs are happening. I'm new-ish, only working there for a few months. Recently, layoffs hit most of the visual content makers, and they let go of our head photographer, who I will call Rick. I didn't know Rick well, but we were cordial and he was nice to me. When he was laid off I was sad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little over a week after the layoffs, a reporter asked me if I was willing to take pictures (since we no longer had a photographer) at this lodge she was doing a story at. She said I didn't have to, she could just take them on her phone if needed, but she knew I was into photography. I figured this would be a good way to expand my skillset for when I inevitably would be laid off too, as well as a chance to make a move to some dayside jobs ( I currently work till midnight to move the next day's paper, so I never get to see my friends) so I took it. The boss seemed to really like my photography, and we Instagramed out one of the pics. That was yesterday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTonight,  Rick texted me, telling me I \"wasn't helping anything\" by taking that picture, and that I was \"just filling in holes with pictures readers have already seen,\" and that he was sure he had already taken pictures of that place previously that I should have used instead. He obviously saw the Insta post and was upset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? Should I have considered how he would feel seeing someone else taking a picture a week after he was laid off? Truth be told, I do want to get more into the photography side of the business, and this did seem like an opening to that. I figured, since the photos would be taken whether I went or not, no harm no foull, and this would be a convenient way to transfer into a better shift. But clearly it hurt him, and I wonder if I should have taken this guy more into account. I honestly didn't think he'd give two shits who is taking photos at a paper that laid him off, but I concede if that was an asshole move on my part. What do you think?",

      "description": "So I made a Facebook post about Chicago’s new Mayor, Lori Loghtfoot.  I thought the status was pretty agreeable and harmless, and some guy who I had a class with about 4 years ago, and haven’t talked to since, commented a bunch of stuff on it that I thought was rude. Instead of trying to explain, I figure I’ll just paste the conversation below, word for word. I’ll call him Bill, obviously not his real name. \nTo add some context, I’m a white male, he is a male POC. \n\nMy status: Gay, black, woman mayor. Way to go, Chicago! \n\nBill’s comment: You should really look into Lightfoot more... just saying \n\nMe: I don’t know why you’re assuming that I haven’t looked into her, but all I’m saying is that I’m proud of Chicago for electing a gay woman of color. \n\nBill: As a QPOC i can bluntly say that Lightfoot is not present for LGBTQ+ people and I am disappointed in Chicago for not seeing that she had a lot of problematic and non poignant things to say at the AAMF I attended. \n\nMe: I’m sure that’s true. I’m not even saying I voted for her. Just remarking on the fact that Chicago is willing to elect such a person, which is not something the city has done before. \n\nBill: more like Chicago is willing to look past that and use Lightfoot’s identity as a mask to advance the true agenda #NoCopAcademy\n\nMe: Again, not trying to say she’s perfect, merely remarking on the fact that we’ve never had a gay, black, woman mayor. I don’t know why you feel the need to start an argument about that. There’s no one here to argue with. \n\nBill: Not starting a fight, but I guess whenever a person of color starts to voice their opinion its considered fighting words. I don’t have to explain why im angry and disappointed. I just chose to voice my disdain for this status. Do with it what you will. \n\nAnd that was it, word for word, down to the punctuation. I didn’t respond after that. I can honestly say I tried very hard to be respectful and not argue, but he seems to think I’m missing something, and it’s been bothering me all day. I just wanted to congratulate Chicago on what I thought was a step forward, and now I feel like I’m being attacked by a person who is part of the very communities I was trying to ally with. He would probably tell you I’m a straight white male, and I don’t understand, which could be true, but I’d really like to understand. \nAm I the asshole? ",

She also bought me over fifty dollars worth of gifts this Christmas, which I know isn’t that weird but we’ve only been friends for like barely a month. And I liked the gifts, don’t get me wrong, but in my mind that just seemed like way too much to get a new friend.\nApparently she has a record of doing this stuff to people and one of my other friends dropped her for the same reasons, but she didn’t learn from that which is the most annoying part to me. It’s ok that she wants to stick with her own personality but I would think if she wants to keep friends or get new ones she might need to know some of her problems and learn from them. \nShe had dropped me as a friend like 4 times which really also got on my nerves so I just let her know that.\nSo she kept on arguing with me and denying hat she did this stuff and trying to defend it but she’s trying to make me feel guilty when I was just letting her know this stuff creeps people out, so that she could possibly learn from her experiences.\nSo am I the asshole here?",

It felt like i got led on honestly..\nWell a day or two later she called me at midnight crying confessing how her boyfriend treats her and (i wont go in to too much detail cause the story is already long) but she lives with him and his mom and she told me about how they emotionally abuse her daily \nSome of the things she said they said was just fucked up in my opinion \n\nAnd she was asking for advice\nAnd it may seem like i could be biased here but i swear when she called me crying i didnt think about how i liked her or anything that would be biased\n\nAnd i told her how it was not a healthy relationship and i thought she should move back in with her parents cause it could only get worse\n\nBut i had a hard time thinking of what to say best i could do was sit there and talk till she calmed down because i was trying my best not to sound biased.\nWell after that we kept talking as friends but slowly declined and now she doesnt message me at all or nothing i dont bug her or want to \n\nAnyway thanks for those who stayed till the end\nAnd what do you think am i a asshole here?

She had a little breakdown, we told her that we werent purposly trying to 3rd wheel her and we were fine.\n\nL drove home and it was quiet. Up until I met L again. What about S? We planned to tell it kind of casually, but oh god. She shouted at me that I didn't told her asap ( it was LITERALLY the day L got his traintickets). But oh well, I apologized.This weekend L and I got together.\n\nShortly after she told me that SHE loved ME. I felt bad for her and yes I kinda understoot why she was so sad the day we met and was so mad when I told her that I was going to meet L again.\n\nNobody knew about my relationship with L. There war this party and I decided to take L with me. I told S beforehand that L will be attending this party, and she was mad again.\n\nPartyday!  Short: She was really heartbroken but we all apologized and it was fine again.\n\nTHEN A found out about what has happened though S. And started harrassing me whatever I did. She wrote in the groupchat things like \"Do you know the feeling when you're so mad at a friends friend that you wanna just hit them?\" Obviously talking about me. I was hurt. So I begged S to not talk to her about me since she's so agrassive. She agreed. Our friendship went downhill fast. We were fighting ALL the time. One day S was like \"Omg guys I love you all\" and me being a mad girl on her FUCKING period answered with the ironic \"Oh sure you do\" and things started to get out of hand since A, S and another girl were attacking me really bad and I left the group.\n\nI was just tired. She sweared that after I left she tried to calm the other two agressive girls down and that she really didn't knew what she was doing. WELL shocker ,L had acces to all the conversations AFTER I left. He send me screeshots. The only thing she FUCKING did was a little \"stooop itt\" after I left. I ended the friendship. She sent me a last SMS where she said that she is the victim since I broke her heart and I as her best friend didn't told her about my relationship and that she things I'm rediculous for ending the friendship because of A.\n\nThe next two months she wasn't going to school. And if the was there she always left before we had a sharing class. And tbh since she were never a good student I think she won't pass this year and I feel shitty because it's my fault.\n\nAm I the asshole here for leaving her espescially after she told me her feelings towards me?",

      "description": "(Long story I’m sorry)\nSo, way back like 10 years ago, I had this friend (let’s name her Amber) who, unbeknownst to me was a back-stabbing rumour-making bitch. She had made up countless rumours about me, including saying that I drank water from the toilet and that I was homeless. She basically made my life hell and is part of the reason I have anxiety. Now, fast forward a few years to when I met this new person (let’s call them Eli) who seemed very nice, we had a lot in common, and we became friends. Everything was going smoothly for about 3 years, until I found out that Amber was going to be transferred to Eli’s class. Now the thing is, Eli didn’t really know the extent of which amber bullied me, she only really knew that I didn’t like her because she was an asshole to me. Anyways, I decided to warn Eli about Amber, telling them that Amber was bad news and to stay away, only to be met with Eli saying, \n“Oh, she’s actually really nice, I’m sure it’s a different Amber.” \nSo, I let it go, and lo and behold, just a few weeks later, Eli came to me saying that Amber back-stabbed her. Although I wanted to tell her that I told her so, I was a good friend and comforted her and let her rant about how much she hated Amber. After that mishap, Eli and I’s friendship was going great, we heard nothing from Amber, and I actually thought that Amber was done fucking my life up. BUT BOY WAS I WRONG! Fast forwarding about 10 months later I found out that Eli was starting to talk to Amber, re-kindling their past friendship, and I was not happy to say the least. I decided to talk to Eli and remind her of what Amber had done, only for her to say,\n“People change, she’s a lot nicer now”\nAnd that was the sentence that started the rapid fall of our friendship. Eli has decided that Amber was now the superior friend, and I was nothing. This continued for a few months, our friendship still deteriorating, until I had enough. I texted Eli asking her what happened between us, hoping to start a CIVIL conversation between the two of us, hoping that I would get my best friend back. Spoiler-alert: that didn’t happen. What, instead, happened was a 500 word text message talking about how I was too controlling and I couldn’t choose who she was friends with and that her bad mental-health state was all my fault and that I just made it worse. At this point, I was feeling really bad and her indirect (but kinda obviously directed at me) Snapchat rants and Instagram posts was too much. I blocked her on everything, I deleted pictures of us, I deleted her number, I deleted every trace of our friendship. I thought that was the end, until Eli MAKES a twitter account only to message me and tell me that I’m an asshole for blocking her and how I’m a horrible person. So now I’m kinda thinking... AM I the asshole here?",

      "description": "It all started when I gave her the password to my second Minecraft account. I showed her my favorite server and the game I always played and she became obsessed, and I mean literally obsessed. Every time she sleeps over my house or I go to hers, she wants to play Minecraft with me. Every day after school she wants to play Minecraft with me. All weekend she wants to play Minecraft with me. I’m busy very often, and often it’s something I didn’t know about until I get home from school, so sometimes I tell her no, I can’t play even though earlier in the day I told her I could. She then starts arguing with me about how I was lying and how I didn’t truly want to play with her and she accuses me of other things that aren’t even related to the argument. I’ve been playing with her so much recently that I’ve been getting bored of it. Even when we do play, she argues with me about something. It’s gotten to the point where I pretend to be busy so I don’t have to text her or interact with her outside of school. Even in school she starts arguments with me over and over again. She accuses me of acting like I’m perfect and always having to be the one that’s correct, even though all the time when I’m wrong I say something like “oops I’m wrong haha” or “oops that was a mistake sorry.” She also hates my other best friend, so she makes tons of passive aggressive comments about when I hang out with that other best friend. It drives me crazy, and even though we were such great best friends before this all started, I’m starting to wonder if we aren’t meant to be friends. AITA for not wanting to be her friend anymore just because of all the arguing that surrounds Minecraft? ",

      "description": "Bit of a backstory, my boyfriend and I began dating three years ago and I met his family and everything was fine.\n\nThing is, his family appeared to be really nice to me but then I found out they talked behind by back and insinuated that because I'm a good match (I'm in law school at 21) [Their opinion, not mine] he shouldn't ever let me go but they still constantly berate me. \n\nHis father and stepmother constantly scrutinize what I wear, the price of what I wear, etc so I mainly don't meet with his family often, at all really. I just feel uncomfortable being around them because of this but my boyfriend supports me, he's great.\n\nPoint of the story is, his mother is the same.\nOne time we were having dinner at my MIL house and I asked my boyfriend for some coke (not in a bad way at all, I speak very lovingly to my boyfriend always, he's wonderful). I wasn't comfortable walking up to the fridge and getting anything.\n\nA week later my boyfriend and his mother went to brunch and she explained to him how she thinks our relationship is one sided and gave the example that I asked him for coke as if \"I were a princess\" and I didn't get it myself.\n\nThis other time all three of us went on vacation and I took two bags, my boyfriend took one. \nWalking towards the hotel room, my boyfriend grabbed one of my bags so I wouldn't have to carry two.\n\nWhen I went to the bathroom to change to a bathing suit, I literally heard his mother whispering \"See, this is why I say your relationship is one sided, why couldn't she carry both her bags? She expects you to do everything for her.\" and my boyfriend asking her to \"Just, stop.\"\n\nFast forward to today, my boyfriend and his mother were (yet again) having brunch. A package we were expecting arrived, so I texted him about it then told him a couple of other things about the day. Just telling him my mother wouldn't be in town, etc.\n\nHis mother then got angry and asked to collect the check because he's \"with me everyday, you need to cut off on your obsession to her\". Now, I need to emphasize that we texted for 6 texts total. Nothing drastic, and it was just a specific moment. I had just woken up so I hadn't spoken to him. My boyfriend got so angry he texted me about it, and I got angry back because I'm just tired of the \"one-sided\" drama. I texted my boyfriend back that if he didn't \"fight\" with her about this I didn't want to see him today because he isn't standing up for me and our relationship.\n\nMy boyfriend and I get along wonderfully, we have a very healthy relationship (thank god) and we're always down to do whatever for each other. We're together every single day, for the most part of the day and his mother basically never sees us. So I don't get why she presses on this so much. And it bothers me that my boyfriend doesn't put much of a stop to it, he just stays quiet then comes to me and whines about it. \n\nAITA here?",

      "description": "My wife and I bought our house about 5 years ago and during that time I have always cut the front and backyard. My dad owned a landscaping business when I was younger so I've always enjoyed mowing the lawn and taking care of the outside. About a year ago my MIL had to sell her house and move in with us. She helps out with bills (which have gone up due to a new person living in the house)  and watches our 1 yr old during the day when we work. \n\nShe is extremely image oriented, so if the lawn got a little higher than nessecary she would be on my case. I work 2 jobs and have a 1 year old, so typically I cut the lawn once every week and a half, or every 2 weeks. This isn't often enough. So without consulting me she hired a landscaper to cut ONLY the front lawn. Cutting the entire lawn takes about an hour and a half, (with a non commerical mower) with the front only taking about 15 mins. The backyard is mostly on and incline and is about 2x the size of the front, which is flat. Now my problem isn't that shes paying for the landscaper, my problem is that he is charging her 50 per cut once a week for the front and will do the back for an extra 10, but she refuses to have him cut the back, because it isn't as important and doesn't want the landscaper possibly stepping in dog poop. When I brought up how stupid this is I called ungrateful by my MIL, and my wife just says to ignore her and just do the back. I now only mow the back about once a month. I haven't been able to get a hold of the landscaper to just pay him the extra to do the back as they always come during the day when I'm working. So am I the asshole?",

      "description": "A few months ago my girlfriend (20F) decided to defrost our freezer, while I (20M) was in another part of the country with friends. We had a pretty terrible freezer at the time, which needed defrosting rather often. My girlfriend calls me up late one evening telling me, that our downstairs neighbor came up knocking and saying that their ceiling was all wet and that we've ruined some ceiling posters or something. Puzzled by this my girlfriend lets them into our kitchen, which is where our freezer is and to her shock (and I guess to their delight) there's a bit of leftover water on the floor and I guess this solidified their assumption that my girlfriend is at fault for this. They leave really angry but say nothing. We've never had trouble with our downstairs neighbors before, mainly because we hadn't really interacted with them at all. I come home immediately and we talk about it. I ask her what happened and whether or not she left water on the floor, she denies and we agree that our freezer probably left out water by itself because of the defrosting process. I agree to purchase a new freezer for us, seeing it caused this minor headache and generally didn't work properly.   \n\n\nFast-forward to now, they're suing us if we don't comply to cover the expenses to fix their ceiling. It's not that much, however, we're both studying and don't have that much money. I've had a gap year and worked my ass off, so I have a lot more money than my girlfriend, but I intend to use this money to study abroad and my girlfriends family is loaded - they also bought this apartment for her. She wants me to pay half of the expenses and I've declined to do so, as I was not home, did not defrost the freezer and the fact that I paid for our new freezer. This has sparked a large debate between us - mainly because she believes I should pay, because I'm financially stable, so my question is: Am I the asshole for refusing to pay for this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend left some water on the floor, it most likely caused damage to our downstairs neighbor while I was on vacation. Am I the asshole for refusing to split the bill to fix their ceiling? ",

So small that having one person call out is detrimental to us, having two people gone is basically a death sentence.  \n\nOne of my coworkers has been gone for close to five weeks now due to someone in their family having being hospitalized, so we've been short one person for that long now. He's still employed with us, even though he has done absolutely zero work and nobody really knows what's going on with him. I understand having a family member in the hospital, but being gone for nearly five weeks is what seems really off about this.  \n\nMy other coworker has called out sick multiple times the past few weeks, or has sometimes run very late (nearly 2 hours late) recently without letting anybody know, basically leaving me as the only one here and making me wonder multiple times if he was even going to come in or not.  \n\nBut I don't know if bringing this up to my boss would make me an a-hole. But at this point, having one person just being completely gone and the other being unreliable, it's completely stressing me out because I have to now pick up the work of, at the minimum, one other person, however often times two other people.  \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I'm a recently graduated college student and am taking two gap years to work at a hospital before applying to medical school. My mom and I have a great relationship, but lately she's been hanging out with these friends who have kids younger than me, who are pre-med and applying to colleges soon. These pre-med Nazi helicopter moms use her to finagle information about my GPA, MCAT score, awards, scholarships, research and other academic achievements. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome context: When I was in 6th grade, my mom and I were at her friend's house, and I complained about my mom taking so long to take me home. One of her friend's son heard that, and told his mom, who proceeded to tell my mom's entire friend group that I was calling my mom \"stupid and unintelligent\", which is NOT true. My mom didn't go to college in order to raise me, and has always been a bit insecure about this, making the gossiping even more cruel. The gossiping was so bad that my mom had to cut off all ties with her friends and now its really hard for her to make new ones. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently some of these women have started asking my mom about college advice, since I got into a relatively good school and have some accomplishments that might seem impressive to some. My mom is nice so she tells them, but I hate that she does that. Those women hurt her, and she's still being nice to them and helpful, and they never even say thanks. What's worse is that they make my mom feel bad about not knowing more about my academic achievements, and manipulate her into telling them. They pressure her and don't listen when she speaks, and because she doesn't have too many friends, she goes along with it. They are all also college educated and work full-time so she respects them a lot, even if they have shitty personalities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting my mom to talk to them about me and refusing to tell my mom more about my academic life? That's kind of what these women do, one of them is a college counselor and so the whole friend group revolves about talking about that. I told my mom to talk about colleges and med school in general, but that my academics are personal and private. Is it wrong to want her to keep that info private, when I know she wants to make friends?",

      "description": "So one of my best friends and I have been discussing getting together for dinner. We were texting back and forth about finding a good BBQ spot in our area and threw out Friday as a potential date. Like any thoughtful husband and father of two little kids, I asked my wife if Friday was okay with her for me to be out. \n\nNow for some background: a couple years ago, I was struggling with a drug addiction. This was something I came clean to her about, as I really wanted to be open and honest about. I needed help, and her support. However, since then, I know she doesn't trust me 100%.  Coming clean to her this time around was the 2nd time my addiction was an issue.  The first time, a couple years prior to that, she caught me discussing buying drugs by snooping through my phone.  She had thought I was cheating, but I was just an addict. Apparently I was not ready to quit when she caught me.\n\nHowever, when I came clean to her on my own, I was ready, but she was crushed. She threatened to leave me, and she's been suspicious of me ever since. \n\nI have been really good lately regarding my health. I stopped drinking, I've been watching my weight and am making positive changes.\n\nWhen I asked her about going out for BBQ with my buddy, out of nowhere, she said, \"What are you up to? Are you going on a drug run?! I think you are lying!\"  She was straight-up accusing me of lying to her about a simple dinner out with my friend, suggesting I was making it up so I can go buy drugs somewhere. \n\nMy reaction was:  WTF?!  I was and am so pissed off at her. I can't even look her in the eye, and I don't even want to talk to her. I am hurt.  She apologized, but I am so over not being trusted.  To this day, I absolutely regret ever being honest with her. I should have kept my mouth shut and fixed my drug problem without her.  She doesn't trust me.  I came to her about my addiction two years ago, and she it still holding it against me.  I am so sick of it.  Her distrust actually makes me want to not tell her anything.  I am disgusted with her.  AITA for being so pissed off?  ",

So, I'm getting out to as many events as I can, trying to build that reputation and meet as many people as possible.\n\nLast night, I was at an event, trying to network. I was very much doing hit-and-run conversations where I would say hello to someone, ask how they are, talk a bit about my campaign (and theirs, if they're a candidate), and then excuse myself to talk to someone else.\n\nAt one point, a friend of mine cornered me. I've known this woman for many years, and have nothing but nice things to say about her. \n\nNormally, I wouldn't mind talking to her at all. However, this time, she wanted to get deep into a discussion about zoning along bus lines. Every time I tried to end the conversation, she would continue talking as if I hadn't. At one point, she was actually holding my jacket sleeve to prevent me from walking away. All in all, we wound up talking for about twenty minutes of a two-hour event.\n\nFinally, I was able to wave another friend over and pull a, \"Have you met *person?*\" and then somewhat gracefully excuse myself.\n\nThis morning, my friend who had been bending my ear sent me a text message tell me that it was rude of me to \"hand [her] off\" and \"ditch\" her last night. I feel like it was rude of *her* to monopolize my time at en event where networking and socializing is expected. But, I'd appreciate some outside perspective.",

      "description": "On Valentine’s Day, my GF and I had a great dinner after I got out of work. There she told me how she was gaming with a guy that she had sexual relations with before who also ghosted her after their short NSA relationship. She said how he was doing a livestream, how they played a good game of Overwatch, and how she bugged out on him for ghosting her on his stream after the game for all of his audience to hear. She claimed to deleting him off her PS4 friends after the confrontation. At the time I thought, “whatever, that’s funny” and never thought twice about it.\n\nRecently, I opened a message on her PS4  that was way too friendly of a conversation with the guy that ghosted her dating back to VDay. The dynamic of the convo didn’t match the same energy of the story that she told me on VDay. The last message was from my GF reading “text me I don’t have your number.”\n\nAlso, I remembered she was playing Apex Legends with the same gamertag as this guy the night before I read the message. She didn’t actually delete him.\n\nThat same day I saw on her phone that she was also messaging different guy that she also had a NSA relationship with that same day on IG, and then switched over to a text conversation. I feel that speaking to someone on IG about art is one thing, but switching over to text means there’s something else there.\n\nWhen I confronted her about the 1st situation, she thought she deleted him off PS4, had no idea what his gamertag was, and that the game of Apex she was playing was with another friend. \n\nWhen I confronted her about the 2nd situation the same day, she said they were just talking about art and understands why I would have the suspicions that I do. \n\nShe’s very understanding to my feelings and clearly states “I understand why you would feel all of this, all of your feelings are valid”\n\nBut right when I asked to see her messages, she says that I am being problematic. \n\nIn this confrontation, I mentioned how she has her text notification previews off and her main argument for it was “I don’t want people on the subway reading my messages” which I don’t believe is valid because 1) there’s no cellular service on the subway and 2) once anybody gets a text message, they open it up anyway. \n\nAfter all is said and done, she turns her phone to me and asks “is this better?” showing me her turning on her iMessage previews. \n\nIt’s two weeks after this confrontation, and I notice that her previews are off again. She’s the type to bring her phone everywhere she goes as short of a distance to grab a cup of water from the kitchen or go to the bathroom.\n\nShe can go as far as having sex with these guys and I wouldn’t care because I don’t believe in monogamy. I believe that everyone can do whatever they want to their body. Once those who are in relationship aren’t on the same page mentally, there’s no point into being in said relationship.\n",

      "description": "The title might be a bit misleading, but I am currently in a bind. I work for my university in a different city from my hometown. Throughout the school year, I am worked essentially as an administrative assistant for the faculty and relatively have had a good experience. The staff are friendly, accommodating, and generally very lenient with my hours/schedule/independence. Basically, it is a university student's dream job - however, the work is incredibly boring and I am only working 10 hours max a week. They have invited me to extend my contract into the summer with full time hours, meaning I wouldn't go home and would have to stay and pay rent. This is one setback I am greatly factoring in to my decision. With my hours extended, I worry that I will have even more spare time and drive myself crazy at the lack of work expected of me increasing my hours from 10 to 40 a week. I have never had a job with such little to do that it honestly drives me insane and I dread going to work. I regularly email staff asking if they need help with anything and make a conscious effort to look for work to do. Surprisingly yes, sitting on my laptop for most of the day completing the odd data entry task gets boring fast - another factor. I have applied to numerous government jobs and others related directly to what I am studying in school and field of interest. I have yet to hear back from any (I applied to over 65 jobs), but feel confident I will hear back closer to the end of the school year from some. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day at work when my supervisor asked me if I would like to extend my contract, I asked to have until the end of March to decide, hoping I would get some good news from other places by then and letting her know I was still unsure if I would be able to afford paying rent for the summer. Unfortunately, she told me due to funding, she needed an answer immediately. Now knowing this position is based on funding, I am worried I will burn this bridge with the school if I hopefully receive an offer from a different place and accept it. Already I feel like an asshole, but considering I would be a lot better off financially moving home for the summer as well as working a job more related to my future career path, WIBTA for conditionally accepting an extension of my contract as a backup but knowing I will drop it if something better comes up?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "About two months ago I got the implant birth control for my best friend then boyfriend. We ended up breaking up but remained close friends. Now I've always been your stereotypical PMS bitch but the hormonal implant made that get cranked up from a four to an eleven. Rather than just having a few days a month of pure ultra sensitive insanity, I was having on and off again day or two long months of being just ultra sensitive on top of mood swings and extreme cravings that I couldn't fight that BF would chastise me for. I would feel extreme guilt over the binge eating which made me extremely depressed almost to the point of being suicidal.\n\nI recognize that I get mad over little things and blow up over something that is nothing but it's extremely difficult for me to control hormonal emotional issues like these unless someone is literally telling me \"hey you're PMSing you should take a breather\". Normally not that big of a deal when it's one or two days out of a month but now it was happening two to three days at a time every week and a half.\n\nI'm not justifying my extremely bad outbursts. They're extremely bad and I recognize this. I've been getting better about it since my body has been adjusting to the hormonal birth control. It's been trying to get back into therapy, too, to help manage my emotions and be more understanding of others.\n\nThis particular issue, though. My bestfriend decided that he had finally had enough.\nHe drank a soda I wanted to try with him, without me and for some reason this was The Worst Thing He Could Do and I completely had a meltdown over this and blew up at him. I've told him I can be very irrational when I'm PMSing. I felt it coming on and tried to be rational. I told him once that I was upset with him. He ignored it. Told him a second time. He ignored it again. Now I'm fully enraged and going on about how he's selfish and doesn't care about me. I later apologized for once I calmed down and realized how ridiculous I was being. By that point he had blocked me on snapchat, Instagram, discord, steam, and Skype. He texted me saying that he didn't hate me but the blow ups get old and he was sick of the immaturity and that he was trying to get rid of toxic people in his life and that I needed to go and I needed to grow and mature and be happy without him. He then blocked my number and completely cut off contact. He did it all through text and wouldn't talk to me on the phone about it. It hurts to lose a bestfriend of well over a year like this...\n\n...Am I the asshole here?\n\nTL;DR: Birth control made me a massive 24/7 PMSing bitch and my bestfriend told me they couldn't be friends with me anymore because of it and then blocked me on all socials.",

      "description": "A few weeks ago, the family helper (or rather my in-law’s helper), let’s call her Martha, brought home a bird that she found while heading home from going to the shops. I was not at home when this happened, however, my husband texted me what Martha did. Having said that, her first language isn’t English so I decided to come home quickly and figure out what happened and why they have decided to keep the bird in a small cage. \n\nMartha explained to me that while she was walking home from the shops, she found the bird chirping and playing on the grass. She thought that it looked cute, so she crouched on the floor and called for it to come to her (while waving some bread around) - the bird came to her and she picked it up and held it in her hand to brought it back home. \n\nNow, I’m all for saving animals who are injured or lost - you know, ensure that it’s returned to it’s natural habitat or owner at the end of the day. But I feel like this is just outright kidnapping. \n\nI tried to explain to my husband that, what she did was kidnapping and that we need to let it go. He insisted that it’s someone’s pet and that we need to find out who the owner is to return it. Okay, but how?! You’re locking the bird up and the bird looks absolutely fine. It’s fat and plump and it’s spreading its wings and biting the cage that you put it in. Husband does not believe that it’s a wild bird. \n\nNow, since this is my in-law’s house, I don’t have much say in it. His parents thinks that it’s cute and if it’s a wild animal, the bird wouldn’t come to Martha at all. \n\nI mostly ignored the fact that the bird was living in the house for a long time. I’ve tried so many times to explain to everyone that the bird looks sad and skinny now. No one believes me and thinks that I am just upset because it doesn’t like me (the bird was out of it’s cage one day as Martha was playing with it and it flew at me and bit me). \n\nWould I be the asshole if I let it go? I believe that Martha kidnapped the bird. If it’s someone’s pet, then it must be missing it’s owner and it’s real home. It’s not fair to it’s owner. If it’s a wild animal, then fuck that. I don’t believe in caving up a wild animal at all. It needs to be in it’s natural habitat. ",

      "description": "Not sure if this belongs here or in /r/dating_advice, but I just got done with an interaction on bumble where the woman I was chatting with was pretty adamant that it is never appropriate to talk politics on a dating site, or on a first date.  I think that for me, politics is something that should be talked about up front – I have no interest in dating people with certain political positions. I told her I respected her position as it relates to her, but she just kept saying that politics just shouldn't be discussed, ever.   \n\n\nWhat sparked it off was that we were discussing two cities with the same name, one in my state, one in Virginia.  I commented, \"Virginia is a lot different from \\[my state\\], more blackface scandals.\" I thought it was funny. I hadn't noticed that she went to University of Virginia.  Now, I get that maybe I was an asshole for making an insensitive comment about her state (though I still think it was funny), but I still think you should be allowed to talk politics if it's important to you.

      "description": "I (23 F) own a condo that I currently rent as I have moved in with my boyfriend somewhere else. In May of 2018, I had a friend/old coworker (40 F) who was down on her luck and needed a place to live. So she signed a 6 month lease because she said it was temporary. \n\nEverything has been fine and she had been a good tenant. It started coming to the 6 month mark when my HOA sent out an email asking for a copy of everyone’s leases. As I am a new landlord, I didn’t realize that when a lease expires, it turns into a month-to-month situation so I stupidly made her a new 6 month lease (ending May 2019) to get all the paperwork in order to send to them and she signed it. \n\nMy mom is a realtor and has a really good eye at finding investment properties. She makes about $10k a month on Airbnbs. I’m really interested in getting an investment property that I can Airbnb in as well so I can hopefully start making money like her. A property came up that she wanted to go in on with me but we needed to sell my condo first so I’d have the funds.\n\nTo be considerate, I decided to call and tell my friend that we were considering selling the condo and I wanted to give her a heads up so she wouldn’t be surprised.That way she could decide if she wanted to move somewhere else or have new landlords that she wouldn’t know. I told her that since living there was temporary that maybe she could please think about moving out in the next month or two because it would make it easier for me to sell.\n\nShe flipped out and hung up on me. I was really surprised that she acted this way considering she is twice my age. I sent her a really nice text telling her I’d help her look for a new place to live and I was sorry that she was put in this situation. She left me on read. I called her the next day and she was really cold and responding in hostile one word responses. She even hung up after saying “well I guess I’ll have to since I’ll be homeless soon!” \n\nThis was really surprising as I have been friends with her for 3 years and have never seen her act like this. The investment property with my Mom didn’t work out but I still wanted to sell so I sent her a nice text telling her she could stay until her lease is up in May. \n\nAfter ignoring me for 3 days, she calls me and acts like everything is fine admitting that she needed time to think about the situation. But by this point, I realized that those were her true colors and it made me not want to be friends with her anymore because of the way she acted. I really want nothing to do with her anymore but I have to be nice until she leaves my place. So AITA for not wanting to be friends with her and for asking her to move out? I thought I handled it really nicely but maybe not? \n\nTLDR: I asked my friend/tenant to move out before her lease so I could sell and she reacted badly making me not want to be friends with her anymore.

      "description": "I'm currently in my fourth year of college and getting ready to graduate. My dad wants to invite his entire family to my graduation despite my wishes and has already invited my grandmother without telling me. He says that it's a family tradition to invite everyone in the family to graduations, that's true. Our family was invited to the graduations of all of my cousins on his side of the family. He says that he doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings by not inviting them. However, I feel really strongly about not inviting them. If it was up to me, nobody in my family would come, but I've already agreed to let my parents and brother attend.\n\nIn my defense, I have a couple of pretty big reasons for not wanting to make my graduation into a big thing. For one, my extended family and I are not close at all. Many of the people my dad is insisting on inviting I've seen fewer than a dozen times in my life, since they all live on the other side of the country. Even my grandma, who lives only a few hours away, I see &lt;1 time a year for a day or two. And importantly, I'm fine with not seeing my family. Not only are we not close, but there are many of them I don't particularly like. They are almost all extremely religious, whereas I am an atheist. In addition, several of them, my grandma in particular are hyper critical of everything. I feel like any time spent with them is just listening to them complain about things and half their compliments are passive-aggressive. It's genuinely exhausting. \n\nThis brings me to the second reason I don't want them to attend. I go to a very small, nontraditional, liberal arts college. A very large portion of our student body is visibly gay or gender non-conforming and we have a nontraditional graduation ceremony. It's held outside in 80° to 90° heat and the students are invited to wear whatever they like. Often they'll wear costumes, jeans, or even swimsuits and body paint. I'm afraid that my family will not approve and may even express their disapproval out loud during the ceremony.\n\nI really don't want to do this and I feel like a day that is supposed to be about celebrating my achievements is going to end up being about entertaining a bunch of people I barely know. However, my father doesn't want to alienate his family and I don't want to alienate him, especially since he has provided  financial support I needed to even get my degree. So, AITA?\n\nTLDR; my father is guilting me into inviting people to my graduation who I'm afraid will just complain the whole time",

      "description": "Recently, I was diagnosed with both depression and insomnia. I have always known I had depression, but up until this past semester I kind of ignored it and worked past it. However after getting into the college of my dreams, my grades suffered significantly and I realized I needed to address the issue before it caused more damage. I have taken a semester off, and my parents were kind enough to let me live at home (I am 19). I already feel like an asshole for living at home, so I am doing my best to be as less of a burden as possible (paying for groceries, cooking about 1/3 of the meals, doing the dishes, laundry etc.). I am not, however, paying rent which makes me feel incredibly guilty.   \n\n\nMy parents are immigrants and are incredibly religious, and spend most of their free time engaged in religious activity (they also don't really believe in depression as it isn't recognized in their home country so they assume I am something that loosely translates to \"cursed by spirits\"). They have always worked very hard to provide my sister and I, but their core belief is that religion is what keeps the family stable. They are constantly having me join them and it's starting to take up a significant part of my day (1-2 hrs a day). In addition they want me to come to the temple with them every Sunday, which takes up almost 6 hours and prevents me from getting ready for the work week in a timely fashion. Between working a full time job, spending 4-6 hours on studying or working on my own company and doing basic chores a few hours a day, it's really starting to burden me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know they'll be crushed if I tell them I am not religious, but I am spending far too much time on something that I actively don't care about (and is causing some existential distress if I am being honest). I want my parents to be happy, and I don't want to be an asshole by living on their gratitude and disrespecting them, but I am unsure how I can keep up faking my religiousness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I am not religious, but my parents want me to participate in lengthy religious activities. I am living off of them, so I am unsure if I am an asshole for not respecting their wishes. ",

A weird conversation about how “he knows how much it means to her” and her admitting it “means the world to her. 😉” we talked about it and she admitted she needs to shut him down instead of keeping on with that kind of thing. \nFast forward to today, a couple of days later, and she tells me very vaguely that he brought something up that reminded her of that subject, so she asked him if he’s getting laid. And this led to a long and very personal conversation about their marriage. She was feeling inadequate and sad because he didn’t want her back then and she was a fool. This was leading to insecurities with our relationship. \nI assured her and we talked it through until she felt better. I then expressed my insecurities. I felt that she was giving in and holding on to her ex. Not just in an emotional way, but a sexual way as well. She proceeded to say that my insecurities are bullshit and get angry at me for “ finding the one way to make her conversation with her ex seem bad or make her seem like a liar”.  \nI tried to tell her that it seemed like she was willing and ready to hash things out with her ex, but wasn’t giving me the same patience or respect with me insecurities and this was part of the reason I was insecure. \nWe are now in a huge argument because I was putting my insecurities on her. AITA??",

      "description": "Context:\n\nI’ve been best friends with this guy for a long time, over 10 years. I’m a huge hockey fan, and he also is a big hockey fan. We’re both in first year university, and went to the same high school together.\n\nSo for the past few months, we’ve always talked about how whenever out favourite teams are playing, we’ll go see them. We live in a city we’re tickets are quite expensive, so obviously we can’t go all the time.\n\nNow, I find out today that one of his other close friends is at a hockey game, and I’m surprised because he isn’t really a big hockey fan. So I message my friend and ask him if he’s at the game, and to my surprise he is. Two of his favourite teams are playing, and he tells me he got tickets for his birthday, and because the other guy has only been to one hockey game, he decided to take him. \n\nNow, normally that would be fine, but I know for a fact he has seen a game before. Plus, he didn’t even mention it to me despite him knowing how huge a hockey fan I am, and the fact that I haven’t been to many games either. \n\nOn the one hand I understand that they’re his tickets, and as much as it sucks that he didn’t want to take me, I get it. But the fact that he lied to me about it, and also just decided not to mention it to me at all pisses me off a lot.",

      "description": "So me (19M) and my gf’s (18F) relationship hasn’t been as good as its previously been recently. To set the scene, we both live at home. Me with my parents, her with her mum. She was saying how she doesn’t feel very comfortable in my house (as if she isn’t welcome etc.). To which I replied that I don’t feel comfortable sometimes while at her’s.\n\nThe reason for this is because her and her mum will bicker with each other over meaningless things and I’m just left to awkwardly sit there whilst they squabble with each other. It usually starts off with one of them talking in a snappy tone to the other and both are equally at fault for doing it as the other. This is something that makes me feel extremely uncomfortable but I haven’t brought it up since it’s something between them and I’ve felt it to be rude to bring up.\n\nHowever when I told my gf how I sometimes feel uncomfortable in her house she said “yeah I know because my mum is fucking rude and nasty”. I took this as a signal that she understood the reason I felt uncomfortable however I felt that it wasn’t fair to paint her mum in this light when she’s equally guilty of the same behaviour.\n\nI replied saying that, yes, sometimes her mum can be rude in the way she talks to you but also how uncomfortable their arguing makes me. I also pointed out that most of the time it’s both of them talking to each other in a progressively worse and worse tone.\n\nShe told me how out of order it was for me to comment on her relationship with her mum and that “I don’t understand and never will”. She started saying how could I say such bad things about her mum (I personally feel that, even though it came from her daughter, she’d be more upset to read what she said about her).\n\nI never meant for my comment to have the intention of being a personal attack on her mum or her relationship with her mum. The only reason I said it was because I felt it was unjust for her to blame her mum solely for these arguments and because it created a suitable opportunity for me to bring up how I’ve been feeling about it. It’s something I’ve felt uncomfortable with ever since the relationship began (just under a year ago) but realised it would be inappropriate to bring it up out of context. \n\nI’ve tried to include as many details here so as to not give a bias story so that you can make a fair judgement.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

Now as some of you can imagine it’s a lot of work...like holy shit.\n\nNow anyway often times I get caught off guard with work, and toss in a part time job, I often have to miss family events. Now parents didn’t mind at first (after all it’s for school). But they’ve started to hate it.\n\nI’ve missed....\n-My Grandma’s b-day party\n-multiple Uncle’s b-day party\n-multiple cousin’s b-day party\n-god knows how many dinners out\n-who knows how many days out to shop, eat, etc\n\nMy parents think I’m using this as an excuse not to go out. It didn’t help when arguing about this I yelled “SCHOOL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN FAMILY” and “IF I DIE FROM THE STRESS OH WELL!!!”, I have also lost sleep from school. Thankfully I’m on Spring Break.\n\nSo my question, am in the wrong for picking my homework over family?",

      "description": "I was on the way home on a long 2 lane bridge (think like  10 miles) with a large shoulder for emergency vehicles. There was a projected 40 minute delay from an accident. We were at a crawl basically idling half the bridge. Evey once and a while a policeman would speed past with his lights on. \n\nThen an expedition tries to zoom past in the shoulder which is a common thing for people to try and cut back in later when forced. Often one car leads to others up to dozens at a time trying to drive on the shoulder. The truck in front of me actually pulled half into the shoulder to block him and the expedition merged back in behind me. There was also a truck behind him blocking other people from driving in the shoulder. Then every once in a while the expedtion now behind me would start to merge into the shoulder only to be blocked by me. \n\nAfter 30 minutes of this we get to the accident where he puts his hazard lights on then pulls over next to the accident. I assume to pick up one of the people in the accident.\n\nI see people do this all the time slowing traffic and even slowing down emergency vehicles just to try and \"cut the line\" and save a few minutes. Yes I dont know this guys story or why he is trying to go faster but i think in general people who do this or doing a general disservice to others. I think he should have just followed one of the multiple policeman that drive by. I dont feel bad about it now but should I?",
