      "description": "My father asked me if I could pick my brother up from school and then get picked up by my mother later in the afternoon. I refused because I had to study for a Mock test in three days and I had to post an essay to a college I needed to get in. He said he couldn't do it because he had to discuss something with the water department as 300 rs were being falsely attributed to us (around 3 dollars). \nWe then had an argument over why I should pick him. My father said that I lounge around all day and should pick him and a lot of money would be wasted if he went. I told him you could discuss the money over the weekend and for now, just pick up my brother and be done with it (my father is unemployed). He didn't listen and kept ranting on about the importance of money and said I was a disrespectful little idiot and I didn't know about the importance of money when I asked him why he was losing that much sleep for about 300rs and he could always re-schedule for some other time. I don't have a bike or a car btw we'd go by rickshaw or taxi.\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "They were discussing the mechanics of oral sex at a nearby table easily within earshot. One girl insists that blow jobs look weird visually; her friend insists that \"I'm sure he doesn't care how it looks\" (and she's right), etc.\n\nI wasn't following their conversation but certain topics just grab your attention and after about a minute of this I was sort of laughing. It was a pretty soft laugh- more of a self-aware chuckle. Not my goal to draw attention but it was enough for them to notice. \n\nI should clarify I really wasn't trying to shame them. I'm not a prude and I have no opinion on their choice of conversation topic. I just happened to overhear and I happened to find what I heard amusing. Anyway, after a moment they were both laughing with me, and I made eye contact with both and smiled, and I thought we were all on the same page. I wasn't laughing *at* them; *we* were laughing together. But then they promptly got up, paid, and left, without finishing their food. So obviously they were pretty embarrassed. Cue guilt.\n\nFor context, this happened at a pho spot in the University district near my apartment, and these girls looked like they were probably first or second year students. I'm M/20s if these details matter.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "**Background**\n\n25 Male, Manager at a Restaurant for 8 months. Co-worker is 19 Male, also Manager for the same amount of time as me.\n\n**Scenario**\n\nMy Wife and I have been having problems with our house that we've lived in for 8 months now. Come to found out, there's zero insulation in the attic and all of our heat is escaping. We set up a plan to wake at 9am, get the supplies to amend this; then I can head to work at 5pm (working until close @10pm). We spend awhile getting supplies, head straight home and start the job. Many problems and solutions later, it's 4pm, and I haven't even started blowing the actual insulation. The rental equipment is only free for today, so to save money, the job must be completed today. We also can't have my pregnant wife and toddler son breathing uncleaned fiberglass insulation, so I really want to finish and clean everything all in one go.\n\nI tell my General Manager (GM) that I can't come in, but he refuses my statement and says that I'm not allowed to call off. I attempt to find a replacement, but no other Managers are available. A standard employee can cover, but GM says no. I consult with the Wife, who agrees with my desire to finish today and call in. I tell the GM again that I'm not coming in and that I'll just accept the disciplinary warning. I at least offer to come in when I'm done so nobody else has to complete nightly money/inventory paperwork.\n\nCo-worker texts me saying that he has dinner plans with his family and feels obligated to work a double shift (working my night in addition to his day) if I don't show up. I apologize, tell him that I won't be coming and the conversation ends there. Turns out my co-worker got so stressed out that he had a panic attack, which turned into a seizure; causing him to fall and hit his head and get sent to the Hospital. I didn't discover these events until I finished my task at 9pm and told the GM that I could now come to finish the paperwork. He recounted the story, told me he would do paperwork, not to worry about it and that he'd see me tomorrow to sign a disciplinary sheet. Everything minus the panic-induced seizure was expected.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nCalled off work to finish blowing insulation in an empty attic for pregnant wife and child. Rental was only free for today. Co-worker who covered shift ended up having a seizure and got sent to the Hospital due to the stress of a double shift.",

      "description": "Internet friends. Let me regale you with a recent tale. There's no TLDR at the end, because details are important, although I do apologize for the novel.\n\nPertinent info to the story: I am 27 years old, the youngest of 3 siblings who are both married, have kids, have steady jobs, etc. I am single, an avid traveler, don't like to sit still for very long. I lovingly refer to myself as the family fuck-up, or the black sheep, because I have always been the odd man out in our otherwise-perfect-American-dream family. Recently home from living abroad for a year, my brother (henceforth referred to as B) and his wife (henceforth referred to as SIL) invited me to live with them for a while until I get my feet back under me. I nannied my 1.5-year-old niece for a few months in exchange for free housing before finding a steady job, but am continuing to live with them for as long as I need, until I get some money saved up for a place of my own, paying them a couple hundred bucks in rent each month. \n\nWe live in Colorado, a legal marijuana state. I smoke, but am **very** careful about keeping it in child-proof bags and containers, and keeping it HIGH out of reach from my niece. Sometimes *I* can't even reach it because it's so inaccessible. B, SIL, and I have talked about smoking before. B has never done it, but SIL said she used to smoke a lot in college, and she and I have talked about smoking together.  I've even mentioned my trips to the dispensary before. I never exactly came right out and said I smoke though. \n\nI would never smoke inside someone else's home and would never smoke at a time when I have the chance of interacting with my niece, so I wait until everyone has gone to bed for the night (B and SIL both leave by 5am so are asleep by 8:30pm) and go outside to smoke. Not necessarily trying to hide it, just trying to be respectful and responsible. \n\nA few weeks ago, SIL had family coming into town who would be using my bedroom as the guest room. I had a friend coming into town the same weekend, so friend and I booked a hostel to stay in. I took my weed stash with me. When I returned back to the house after the weekend, I tossed my duffel bag (with stash inside) onto my bed and left for work. While I was gone, SIL opened my door to put my water bottle in my room. We've had issues before with privacy, or lack thereof. When I got home, B and SIL were waiting for me. \n\nThe general track of the conversation was, \"Hey, did you smoke in your room? Or is there weed in there? It reeks in there. I opened your door to put your water bottle in there and smelled it.\"\n\nMe: \"There's weed in there, but no, I would never smoke inside.\"\n\nDirect quote from B: \"Well we don't care if you have it, we just don't want it to smell because we don't want that closet to smell when you move out.\"\n\nMe: \"Totally understood. I don't want my stuff to smell. Sorry about that, I'll buy a smellproof container for it.\"\n\nSIL: \"We would appreciate that. In college, my roommate kept hers in a wooden cigar box, maybe that would work?\"\n\nConversation is over, we all move on. When I went upstairs to my room and opened the door, I didn't detect a single hint of weed smell. Possible that I'm nose blind, possible that she was snooping. Unclear.\n\nUnfortunately, I was broke that week and needed to wait until Friday payday to buy the jar. In the meantime, I triple Ziplocked my stash and made sure it didn't smell. \n\nFriday rolls around. B and SIL take niece to SIL's work holiday party for the evening. It seemed like the perfect time to switch the stash, so I ran out to Target and bought a smellproof jar, went home, went into my room and separated my stash into little baggies dividing up the strains, putting them into the jar, not thinking about the fact that my weed being out would smell. This is 100% my fault, for letting it smell. To be clear, **was not** smoking inside (or outside, for that matter).\n\nB and SIL get home, drunk. B comes upstairs with my niece to put her to bed and says, \"Whoa, it smells like weed up here. What the hell?\" I was like \"Oh shit I'm sorry! I went and bought that smellproof jar and transferred it all over, so it was out.\"\n\nB: \"How long does the smell last?\"\n\nMe: \"Not long at all, should be gone in an hour. I'm sorry. I lit a candle too.\"\n\nB: \"All good, I just don't want it to linger. But it's in the jar now, right? So we're good?\"\n\nMe: \"Yup, all clear.\"\n\nHe was satisfied with this answer and moved along. But then SIL comes upstairs and just starts yelling. \"THAT IS MY LEAST FAVORITE SMELL IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, JESUS, THAT IS HORRIBLE, I FUCKING HATE IT.\"\n\nI was just trying to be a fly on the wall as B explains that it smells because I was putting it into the smell proof jar. They go into their room, but were yelling loudly enough that I could hear every word. General consensus from SIL is that she doesn't want it in her house. Suddenly, she's at my door.\n\n\"I think it would be best if you could find a new place to live.\" She also removed the dogs (their dogs) from my room, dragging them out by the collars, putting off the very obvious message that I'm not even responsible enough to have the dogs in my room. And told me that she had found a new babysitter for the following night (I was supposed to be watching my niece on Saturday night while they went to B's overnight work holiday party). This was a very aggressive conversation, a hair shy of yelling from her end. \n\nI left the house that night, and spent the night driving from parking lot to parking lot. The next morning they called and wanted to apologize. They said wires had been crossed during our last conversation, and that they didn't want it in the house at all. At the risk of showing bias, I truly don't understand how the previous conversation could have been misinterpreted on either their end nor mine, as both of them even gave suggestions as to appropriate containers to keep it in. They also rescinded the comment about me not babysitting, and asked if I could indeed babysit that night, which I willingly did.\n\nI have tried to be extremely civil since this happened last weekend, but SIL continues to be hostile. I overheard a phone conversation with her and her best friend: \"I just don't want someone like that in my house. I don't want her to rub off on \\[niece\\].\" etc. \n\nAt first, I was 100% convinced that this whole thing was no fault of my own. My fault for letting it smell while transferring, yes, but the rest of it, no. But after a week of constantly being made to feel less-than, I am feeling rather crappy about myself. \n\nSo....AITA? Am I the **real** family fuck-up, not just the playful one?",

      "description": "A bit of background is helpful first.\n\nThe mailman for my area frequently misdelivers letters and packages in my neighborhood, including several of my packages in the last couple months. For example, the Christmas present my wife bought me was misdelivered to a neighbor and we never recovered it. I also regularly receive important mail for the household across the street (I would estimate 1-3 times a month) and have to walk it over to her.\n\nWith that in mind... Yesterday I was supposed to receive a package that contained a high-value ($100+) item. The USPS tracking told me that it was delivered at 5:40 pm and left in a parcel locker. However, when I went to retrieve it there was no key in my box to the parcel locker. This lead me to the conclusion it was yet another package misdelivered by USPS.\n\nUpset about this, I printed out the tracking sheet showing the delivery of the item along with a note in the box for my mailman to receive. The note was semi-rude and said something like \\*\"I was supposed to receive a package today and the attached tracking shows it was delivered in parcel locker. There is no note and no key! Is there any chance you left the key in wrong mailbox? Please pay more attention as I constantly receive the wrong mail or have my packages misdelivered!\"\\*\n\nThe next day I ended up retrieving my package.. And I genuinely feel bad about the scolding note and wish I could take it back.",

One of the counselors was known to get very triggered over small things. So me and a friend were joking with one of our genderfluid friends about \"identifying as an attack helicopter\". (For the record I am lgbtq) Everyone was laughing but the counselor heard and told us \"I feel like you're making fun of a very important issue and I need you to stop\"\n\nI sincerely apologised, saying \"I'm very sorry, I did not mean to offend you\" and backed off.\n\nThree days later, two of the camp admins wanted to talk to me alone. They said the counselor submitted a formal complaint for transphobic comments. I fully support, understand, and know a lot of genderfluid/trans people and I am in no way against any human being regardless of gender.\n\nLuckily, the admin was one of my old counselors (I've gone to this camp for years) and understood I would never do that on purpose and let me off the hook. The director still madee talk to someone to describe what happened and he said the person who filled that complaint overreacted.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So, a little background on me. I don't have a good relationship with my family at all. My biological father passed when i was 13, and my adopted father (my grandfather) passed when i was 21, and i don't have much to do with my biological mother or adopted mother. So, the scenario i'm about to describe will never happen on my side of the family.\n\nJanuary of last year, my 70 year old father-in-law (divorced) was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Prognosis on this type of cancer is typically not good (like a year or less). Fast forward 14 months, and he has beat the statistics. He underwent chemo, radiation, and a massive surgery and is been deemed cancer free. All of last year, my wife and i pretty much put our lives on hold to take care of him. Wife has a brother, but he lives in OK, and even if he was closer, he's pretty much useless for anything expect consuming oxygen. We have PoA, so we (and be we, i mean me) handle all his financial affairs. They were a total disaster when we took them over. He had tons of debt, no savings, and was telling my wife and her brother that the 3 cars he owned and his house were all paid off. So, i got all his debt taken care of and got him into a position where he could live off of his SS and small pension check he gets every month. The disability check he gets right now from his employer is just going into savings.\n\nSo, we get him home after the massive surgery, and we took turns staying with him around the clock for over a month while the other took care of our kids (3 are college age, 1 in elementary, and 1 in middle school). Home health came in as well during this time with OT and PT in order to help him build up his strength so that he would be able to do all the things he needs to do to live by himself again. He did the exercises fine while OT and PT where in the house, but once they left he simply laid on the couch or in his bed and never did any of the things they told him he needed to do between visits, but told them he had done them. He has pretty much made zero effort to try and do anything to build his strength to be more independent.\n\nIt's taken a toll on both of us, but has also taken a toll on our marriage. We aren't talking about divorce , but it's definitely had a negative impact. My wife works part time, so it's not a big strain on her from that standpoint. I work full time, and i drive over an hour each way to my job. Between kids extracurricular activities, work, and having to take care of him, there is no time left for me and the wife (or for us as a family unit) to even see each other if we go back to taking care of him full time .\n\nOne last note. I know that this has been extremely difficult for him, as he has been the one fighting cancer. I also know that along with that comes some depression. I get it.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i tell my wife that i can't help with taking care of him full time again and we need to consider putting him in either an assisted living home or a nursing home?",

She’s been drawing for a bit longer than I have, although we’re on just about the same skill level. We both tend to draw a lot in class, especially classes we share together. However, it would always seem teachers would pass by, and they would compliment her and her drawing, suggest art schools, talk about her future and just seem to have a grand old time, but when they see that I’m drawing, I get told to put it away and do my work (although today I had gotten all my work done whilst she didn’t do anything and spent her time drawing and socializing, the teacher said nothing.) \n   I know it probably sounds stupid and petty, but I just feel like I’m being under-appreciated (if that’s what the phrase is idk). I get praise from family when I show them my work, Yeah, but it’s only when I approach them, and it really seems like they’re only doing it because they feel like they need to, to not hurt my feelings.

      "description": "I(30m) was dating a girl (30f) for a couple years. Various issues made us both miserable, one of which was our sporadic / vanilla sex life. We agreed to take some time apart and not be boyfriend / girlfriend but still go on dates, starting over from a clean slate. Since then sex has been great, with us both trying new things. Everything between us as people just dating has been pretty alright... Not amazing, not horrible; also not the point of this post.\n\nWhen we split up and stopped being boyfriend / girlfriend, we had a candid discussion about boundaries for who we would sleep with and not making the other person upset. We agreed not to sleep with each others friends, and not rub it in the others face if we were sleeping with other people. \n\nI completely agree with this and have been adhering to it. I haven't had sex with anyone else yet, but have become closer with some women who have obvious interest. My now-ex Facebook stalked one and insisted that I not sleep with her because the new girl gave her \"a bad feeling\". Another is a girl I've had friend zoned for at least 5 years but suddenly is very interested(we haven't done anything) - my ex had never met her until yesterday at a social gathering and had a 5 minute conversation. The ex is now insisting that I not sleep with this girl because she \"knows her\".\n\nI'm likely to gonna be having sex with both of these girls anyway, even though my ex doesn't want me to. Does that make me the asshole? ",

      "description": "My ex and I dated for a year after being best friends for several, I had a miscarriage and it has been really hard for me (19). And I know it must be hard for him (20) too. He broke up with me less than two weeks after we found out about the miscarriage and  at first would not tell me why. I ended up having to go to the hospital due to ptsd symptoms and when I got out I needed him as my best friend. He won’t even talk to me which is really hard, because I really feel like I need his support as I am going through this. Am I the asshole for wanting the support of the man who, the day he broke up with me told me how much he loved me and said he would support me through all of this?",

      "description": "A few months ago, I got myself out of a toxic friendship. They made me feel insecure, and like I had no one else. They’d accuse me of being a bad friend for every little thing I did “wrong”, such as talking to one of my other friends instead of them when they were in the same room. I also didn’t wave enthusiastically enough apparently, which isn’t true, because I smiled and waved whenever I passed them in the hallway. They also talked crap about all their friends behind their backs, so it was pretty much guaranteed that they did the same to me, and that’s not something I want to have to worry about. But anyway, I basically sent a bitchy text telling them I didn’t want to be friends, and that started a huge fight. And yes, I know that that was a horrible way to deal with it, but I lost half of my friends to them because now apparently I’m a fake, attention-seeking hoe, but AITA for getting out of that relationship? Because lots of people have been making me feel like one",

      "description": "So my (25m) boyfriend (30m) and I both work retail jobs. I'm an assistant department manager and he's a customer service manager.\n\nI knew getting into the relationship with him that he enjoys and takes pride in his hard work. When I met him we were at the same store and he was regularly putting 10+ hour days often 7 days a week into his department to ensure it ran smoothly as he had many call outs and no call/no shows. I do genuinely admire his work ethic and commitment.\n\nNow -- I don't really have an option to change my schedule and since I'm one of the few people willing to work early shifts, four out of seven days of the week I work a 4 am shift, meaning I have to wake up at 3 am. My fifth shift is a closing shift from 11:30 am to 8 pm. And I always have the same two days off a week -- my schedule is very regular and predictable.\n\nMy boyfriend, however, schedules his own department and regularly schedules himself as closing shifts. I've asked him before to please try to schedule himself one midday shift a week and at least every other week have one same day off with me so we can spend more time together. I don't feel like this is an unreasonable request. But even when he does schedule himself a midday shift, he'll inevitably end up staying late (like this week, he scheduled himself until 4 pm for his midday, and stayed until 9 pm).\n\nI try to stay up late on his closing days (usually sometime between 8 PM to 11 PM) to at least spend an hour or two with him before I inevitably pass out from tiredness (between work, tidying the house, cooking dinner). He frequently ribs me on this and says if I just stayed up we could spend more time together and that I missed whatever movie or TV show we were watching because I fell asleep -- but I've been up since 3 am and have difficulty taking naps try as I might. It's impacted our sex life because I'm awake too early for morning sex, he doesn't want to have sex after he gets home from work, and if I've fallen asleep during a movie/show he doesn't want to have sex with me either because he says I'm too tired (even if I've woken back up to go to bed properly).\n\nAITA for wishing he would just put his foot down and come home when he's scheduled on his midday shifts? I've talked to him about this multiple times and feel frustrated. I really love this guy and really enjoy the time we do spend together, but I feel like most of the week I'm left lonely. I just want to make a compromise that works for us because I don't want to break up over a simple schedule mismatch.\n\n(He's an hourly manager, not salary, so it's not like he's really required to stay, no other managers at his store do this. He's just gaining a lot of overtime.)",

      "description": "\nI work at a small cafe downtown where I live, I've been there for almost 2 years now and we've been cruising without a manager / assistant manager for a few months since the last one took another job. \n\nAt the beginning of this week we got a new assistant manager, and it's been a rough few days because of it. Day one of this person working at our cafe, she rearranged our bar, restocked things like cups and lids etc. in different / seemingly random locations. She's marked up our task lists and changed which roles are responsible for which tasks at any given time during the day. For example, she changed the stock closer from being responsible for cleaning the front drains later in the evening to our morning bar person (me most days). So at some point during my morning shift, I now have to get on my hands and knees to clean out the drain under the bar in between making drinks which just seems like a bad idea to me. \n\nAlso, in the three days she's been here, she's picked out some sort of issue she has with every one of my coworkers and has been very rude to them about what she wants them to do about it. I'll use what she confronted me about as an example. Usually in the early mornings we aren't very busy. There are a few regulars that come in early thatI'll chat with while I make their drink, and if they're having a slow morning I'll continue a conversation while I wait for another order to come my way. She saw me talking to a regular and decided I was slacking, walks up to me and asks if I need help reading my task list she made. She's since talked with my coworkers about how I don't do my job and am lazy, somehow thinking I wouldn't hear about it from them.\n\nThen on Wednesday I come in to see that the whole cafe has been inundated with post-its and label maker labels on the registers, my drink order screen behind the bar, on the inside of the doors leading to the back room, everywhere. They all say something along the lines of \"don't forget the thank the customer!\" Or \"smile and greet the customer as soon as they walk in!\", \"Use their name and smile when calling out an order!\", Etc. The usual corporate / customer service stuff. \n\nI wasn't really upset at her putting all of them up, but I thought it was pretty over the top and honestly kind of funny. So this morning I used the label maker to put one up on my order screen that says \"OBEY\". I've been off for a few hours now and one of my friends / coworkers is texting me saying how she saw it and started to cry and complain that we all hate her and are attacking her for trying to do her job. \n\nI wasn't even directing the label I made at her, I just thought it was silly and everyone might have a laugh about it. But even though she's been pretty abrasive her first few days here, I feel bad for making her so upset that she was crying at work over it.\n\nAITA?",

That being said she is also spoiled rotten and very VERY sheltered in many aspects, primarily romantic relationships.\n As of last year she broke up with her ex because she found solid evidence of his infidelity, and has been in the dumps since. In September she began talking with Tee (25M) who is currently working in an engineering field in Florida (we are in Oregon, this is important) and he has a very rigorous schedule that prevents him from being in contact 24/7\n\n She comes to me often enough for relationship advice that I know she has been handling it poorly; throwing tantrums about his schedule, ignoring him when she's mad, the works. From what I've taken in he is truly a kindhearted boy who seems to be smitten with her, flaws and all, so much so that he flew her out, all expenses paid, to spend a week together and see if this could become a relationship.\n\n Long story short, she pulled her princess attitude over there and came back with no boyfriend, however they are still talking to see if it can still work out. So now, here we are, 3 weeks later and she drops it on me: her doctor told her she's pregnant. 3 months pregnant. She fessed up that even though she dumped him and \"knows it's wrong\" she slept with her ex out of spite because Tee was unable to respond for 2 days due to a work emergency. In her mind \"it's not cheating if he hasn't asked me to be his girlfriend\". Quite frankly, I was floored by all of this.\n\nShe wants to keep it. And while I understand that it is her decision, she has confessed she intends to tell Tee and see if he will take responsibility for \"his child\" (yes they had intercourse during her visit) and her.\n\nSo here lies the question. \nAs of right now I am the only person who knows of the pregnancy, and this morning she told me that she already announced it to Tee. \nWould I be the asshole if I contacted him to tell him it's not his?\n\nI know I'm just a bystander and by all means it's none of my damn business, but I wouldn't let anyone do that to any of my friends or family and I don't see why I should let her dump this innocent child( who she admits is NOT his) on an innocent and kind man who knows nothing about the situation.

      "description": "About a month ago, our school student activities board held a small trivia night for teams of six. The prize for the winning team was a set of six free tickets to a local orchestra concert. I was invited to fill in on a team of six really close friends (all of whom I am also friends with) when one of them was sick and couldn't make it to the event. \n\nLo and behold, we end up winning the tickets and the orchestra is tonight. I really want to go but I get the feeling they may want me to offer the ticket to their friend who coudn't make it, as I essentially took his spot. Again, I really want to go, but I didn't really contribute to the success of the team in any meaningful way and I don't want them to dislike me in the future for not giving up the spot. As far as purchasing an extra ticket, we're all college students and none of us can afford one. (Should I maybe split the cost with him?)",

      "description": "Long text. Sorry for spelling\n\nI was sitting in my school lunchroom when I feel something hit my back, it was a plastic spoon. I look behind me and I see some classmates that I never really talked to and to the right of the table was my friend. Immediately in my mind I go \"ohh he's ducking with me\" it seemed like the kind of thing this guy would usually do, and he was looking away which I assumed was because he was trying to pretend he was innocent. I ask him, \"are you throwing shit?\" At first he goes \"what are you talking about? No\" I immediately thought he was lying to me but I wasn't sure. I was certain he threw it when he said \"yeah I'm throwing shit\" which (spoilers) it wasn't him.\n\nAnyways, a while later I get hit with a sad can which has a little soda in it. I look to my friend and he's laughing and looking away. Assuming it was him, I threw it at him. I don't think it's relevant the events between there and about a minute later, but I got slapped.\n\nI didn't cry or rat on him but ngl I was really upset. Opinions among my classmates varies. Friend A thinks that he 100% threw the can and me throwing it at him was justified. Friend B (who sat with the friend that slapped me) says he 100% did not throw the can. He has no reason to lie to me but I mean who else could it have been? I didn't see anyone behind me exempt for my classmates and I didn't see anybody walk by.\n\nWhen he got pissed I apologized (friend B criticized that my apology wasn't genuine because while I  apologized, I immediately asked if he threw the can, which was 100% true) and I worked it out with the other guy but it still bothers me. I didn't throw the can out of anger but because I thought he was messing with me, you know, just friendly teasing.\n\nMy question to you is \n\nWas I the adshole for throwing the can?\n\nWho do you think threw the can?\n\nI'm sorry if I missed any important details. If you want me to clarify something just tell me. Not trying to hide anything.\n\nThis is my defense- I had signs that he threw the can, he was my friend after all, he said he threw it (which he probably just said to mess with me but at the time I didn't think so). I didn't mean to aggrivate him by  throwing it at him. I think he overreacted but I apologized. Looking back I could have apologized better.",

      "description": "So I'm fairly socially inept and I have no issue with anyone based on the color of their skin. I'm white as can be.\n\nThis happened awhile ago, but I was only recently made aware of the fallout of this interaction.\n\nMy SO (now ex), me, and our (at the time) 17mo daughter were invited to dinner with one of his friends and his buddy's wife. The wife is black. We went to their house and had a nice, if slightly awkward, dinner and throughout our visit my daughter was absolutely infatuated with his wife. She made a comment about my daughter being so interested in her and by way of explaining I told her she's the first \"Person of color\" my daughter's ever met. That was the only comment related to her race I made all night, it wasn't a big deal to me, and I didn't think anything of the comment. If it was racially insensitive I wasn't aware and I'd like to apologize. I was informed (about 3 months after the fact) that we were no longer welcome in their house, because his wife thinks I'm racist and that I don't like her because of the color of her skin.\n\nShould I apologize? And if so, how? Im not sure it even matters anymore since I have no relationship with these people outside of my (now defunct) relationship with my ex. I feel like if I made some big social gaffe I should at least try to apologize. I don't like the idea that I made someone feel bad about their race. So AITA? And if I am how do I make it right? ",

      "description": "So this happened earlier in the year at Dragon-Con. I was just chilling on a hotel balcony with my brother drinking, laughing, and talking to nearby cosplayers \n\n\nAt one point, I went up to get a drink and noticed a petite Asian girl wearing a black tank top and sporting a bowl-type haircut with a blue streak through it. I told her I liked her hair and asked if she was Knives Chau from Scott Pilgrim. She immediately got defensive and angry with me saying things along the lines of “so I’m Asian, I have to be an Asian character?” I tried to backpedal a bit (definitely taken off guard by her tone) but I did say that I considered her race when I was trying to guess her costume, but really, it was the hair color/type that sealed the deal. \n\n\nI finally managed to get her to tell me the right costume - Mako Mori from Pacific Rim. An Asian character with very similar hair to Knives. So my first instinct was to kind of laugh at the coincidence and point out the similarities and tell her she seemed to have overreacted. However, I cut my losses, said nice costume and skulked off. \n\n\nSo AITA for assuming her costume in part because of her race, and should she have gotten so angry even though it seemed (to me) a big coincidence and an entirely possible mistake?

I saw her with her amazing black dress and and beautiful purse. Skip 2 hours later the teachers went to the stage to announce that its Romantic Dance time or something and everybody just started dancing with each other, I saw her with her phone so I had the opportunity to ask her. But, unexpectedly  she told me that she was gonna dance with my older brother. I felt something inside that was like anger and sadness mashed together to make a disgusting hybrid emotion, I ran to the bathroom and just stayed there. After maybe 30-45 minutes, I came back and my classmates asked me where I was. \n\nE is me and J is classmate M is my other classmate it's also translated so it wouldn't be accurate\n\nJ: Where were you? You look tired, and sweaty.\nM:He was probably masturbating hahahahaha.\nE: *About to break in tears* I had to wash my hands and I caught something that hit my eye I'm a retard lol.\n\nAfter prom all my classmates where gone and it was just me and her and some other senior students, S is her.\n\nS: Hey E why weren't we talking so much earlier?\nE: Well it's just that I'm bored and sleepy hahahaha (it was 10:30) \nS: Well I had fun tonight and it was nice seeing you!\n\nIt was my first prom and id never thought it'd be the worst.",

      "description": "So, I met my friend (I’ll call her Eli) through one of my classmates who said that we share a lot of interests (Anime, games, music, similar humour etc) and that we could get along well. I’m always up for new friends so I said i’d love to meet her. I meet Eli one day as she was waiting for my classmate outside school, we introduced ourselves but we had to leave shortly after. \n\nSo I manage to find her insta, we chat and have a great time. After probably a week I ask my best friend why Eli’s name sounded so familiar, because I think I heard something about her having an illness. Well it turns out that she had had leukemia for about 2 years (four years now) and that the prognosis wasn’t getting any better. I kinda went ”huh” and kept talking to Eli.\n\nWe kept chatting for about a year and we managed to meet a handful of times, and i slowly get to know more about her. So you might think it’s normal that i don’t feel much for a person i had talked to a few times, which i understand, but i have known her for almost 2 years and i absolutely adore her. I think about her often and the things she says can make me blush and giggle for an hour. She is the funniest person I know and I love her to bits but... even when she gets rushed to the ER because of a fever or when she gers a surprise operation, i feel nothing. I like her so much yet it feels like I would feel indifferent if she died or not, and now even when i consider her to be one of my best friends, when she says that her tumors 20+ are growing way to fast i feel.... empty.\n\nNow these feelings don’t change the way I act around her, I support and reassure her when nobody else can and I treasure her so much. I make her laugh when she is terrified of her next surgery, and calm her down when she enters her depressive state. Even though the dark part of my brain says that I wouldn’t change even if the operation goes south. \n\nSo I need to ask, am I crazy? A bad friend? Or I guess most importantly, AITA?",

Outside of mentioning he was cute and they had talked but she turned him down I didn’t hear much more about him. Fast forward a couple months she’s single again and so am I. I go out with this mutual friend for New Years to drink and all night he’s touching me and hitting on me. We get back to his place and he keeps asking if we can have sex. I’m drunk and keep saying no and then change my mind. He asked if my best friend would care afterwards seeing how they talked. I told her immediately afterwards and apologized and she stopped talking to me but eventually came back and said she decided since I was just freshly single I get a pass but that I was an asshole for it. Since she had turned him down and she had dated other people i honestly didn’t see an issue since she had made it clear she wanted nothing to do with him. Plus me and him had been drinking all night and he initiated it not me. Am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "Hello, first post here\n\nI'm currently a student (1st year going back into public school after being out due to PTSD) and I have severe PTSD. I tell all my teachers about my condition and the things that go with it, no loud noises/yelling, touching me, so on and so forth. I have a medical pass that means I leave all classes 3 minutes early and take a break/go out if i get nervous.\n\nMy ART 1 teacher recommended me into ART 2. I got in surprisingly the next week and things went good for abit. Then one day I asked \"hey Mrs. ------- can I go trim my bowls I made in another class yesterday? Itll only take 5 minutes and they will get too dry if i don't do it soon\". She (visibly annoyed) said \"sure go ahead.\"\n\nI trim my bowls in 3 minutes flat and go back to her classroom. I sit down, then a minute later I go back up and say \"so sorry to bother you but what time do we leave?\" and she yells \"you're not being a very good student right now!\" And other stuff I cant quite remember. I sit back down with an episode coming on and then get back up and say trying to keep my composure \"I have to go I'll be back..\" and she very loudly shouts \"no sit back down!\" I very shakily say \"I have to I have a medical pass\" while she then again shouts \"let me see it then!\" I rip it trying to get it out of my bag and shakily hand it to her, she reads it and says \"fine. Go.\" as I run out of the room.\n\nI run over to my ART 1 teacher's room while sobbing and he visibly concerned asks \"what's wrong?\" And I give the whole story to him sobbing. I go out of the room for a moment to get some water and the ART 2 teacher comes out and says \"you cant just do that while I'm trying to teach. (She was sitting at her desk with a video playing)\" says a bunch of other stuff that I cant quite remember too basically saying it was my fault. I just kept repeating \"that is no excuse to yell at a student with a medical issue\". She eventually begrudgingly says \"im sorry.\" When I get back into the room says that I should write it down and go to my counselor but also to go to her supervisor. I go to my counselor and she calls the supervisor then I go down to her office. I recount it and give her the medical note saying I do indeed have a medical issue. She says she'll talk to the ART 2 teacher. I go back to the ART 1 teacher's room to calm down then eventually go to my next class.\n\n[After classes] I was staying after classes in my ART 1 teacher's room when the supervisor comes in and asks to speak with me. I follow her into a room with my ART 1 teacher, her, and my ART 2 teacher. We talk and the ART 2 teacher basically says it was an accident, that she didnt know about my medical problem and it was my fault. No consequences given. I am upset.\n\nThere is another similar incident that is causing me to switch classes unfortunately.. after talking to a parent about the whole situation he too said it was my fault.",

      "description": "https://m.imgur.com/gallery/C4wSPJt\nI’m a mechanic at an independent shop, and to keep this post from getting really long I’m gonna do my best to sum it up: 2 months ago I did 2 turbos on a 2011 Ford Flex, one of the new ones took a shit ever since, and now Ford is honoring their warranty on the turbo. The problem is, I’m positive this new turbo is going to meet the same fate as the last two (the new turbo from two months ago is linked in this post). I’ve found disintegrated aluminum from the turbo, mixed with engine oil, all throughout the intake piping leading into the engine, and I’m willing to bet the whole engine needs to be replaced because of it. My service writer, who has been ordering all the parts from Ford for me, didn’t mention anything to Ford or the customer about the proven evidence of aluminum contamination being fed into the engine. When Ford called today, my coworker was out to lunch so I spoke with them instead, mentioning the aluminum contamination in the intake and how I have reason to believe the engine and this new turbo will not last, based on my findings. Fast forward to when my coworker gets back from lunch, he lost his mind at me because now he thinks Ford won’t warranty this new turbo, and it’s all my fault. I’m just looking out for my customer, who is already upset with this whole situation, because if this new turbo ends up looking like the last one, everybody is going to be pissed off, Ford won’t warranty anymore turbos for this customer, the customer may need a new engine more than ever, and all of this could have been prevented if my service writer told Ford the truth from the beginning. Instead, he’s just turning a blind eye and hoping for the best, wasting time, money, resources, overall customer satisfaction, and trust, and I can’t get through to him that I believe he’s in the wrong here, not me.",

      "description": "So I am 20 and my 18 yo gf of over a year ended up pregnant. In our defence the condom broke and she was on the pill so we were like no big deal. Oops. About the time she got pregnant we broke up and I never told anyone she was pregnant. It was easy since she wasn't around so no one noticed her growing belly, and we agreed almost immediately that we would not be keeping him. She didn't want an abortion but we knew we weren't ready to take proper care of this baby so we went to an adoption agency. This made it even easier to not tell anyone since our son wouldn't be around anyway. So the months  pass and there are complications resulting in an emergency c section a month early. Our son ends up in the nicu, and his mother spends a few days in the hospital. His new parents are there day of and everything seems like it's going to be ok. But in super stressed and tired of dealing with this alone so after a week or so I let my dad in on what's up. He freaks (understandably) but want a to see him. I drive us both to the hospital and explain that we are having an open adoption, which means we will still have regular contact and even visitation. He gets mad again, and refuses to come in and see him now. I visit him while my dad stays in the car, and then we go home. That night my parents and I have this big argument. They want to adopt him but I don't want them to. He has a family and in signing the last papers in a few days, they can still see him but if I wanted then to raise him I would have just kept him in the first place. They threaten to sue for parental rights under some obscure native American children's act and I have to contact a lawyer and threaten to deny paternity just to get them to stop. Mind you to this point neither of then have seen him. Neither has asked to see pictures. Neither has even asked his name. And now instead of helping me deal with this they are threatening legal action. I beg and plea with them to go see him before we gets out of the hospital but they won't. Finally, after 3 weeks of daily visits alone, he gets out and he's heading home with his family the next day. I make one last trip to say goodbye, begging my dad one last time to come with me, to be part of his life, to know his grandson who will actually be around a few times a year, to support me in maybe the hardest moment of my life, and he won't do it. So I go alone and I sob like a little kid because who wouldn't. It's been a few months and now I told him how much that hurt me and ask him again to maybe be in his life and he goes off on me like it's such a ridiculous request. Am I the asshole or is there blame to go around?",

      "description": "This happened a few weeks ago but i just dont got the courage to post this, so this happened. I have been a saw operator and newly promoted station manager at this plant for 9 months now and soo far (as what the plant supervisors told me) I am their best worker yet. This newly hired guy was put into my station, as a new employee i showed him around and told him how things work in my station, since he was new and inexperienced, i totally understand how he makes mistakes on the first day at work. I showed him, demonstrated him a few times on how it should have done but yet he still makes the same mistakes. I kinda saw myself in him on my first week at this job; making minor mistakes and slow-pace work. The next day, he showed up late and again he isnt improving at all and still makes the same mistakes but as the station manager i have to get production numbers up and he is bringing the whole station down, I helped him that whole day. Third day, still no improvement, same mistakes, same results ended up helping him again the whole day. Fourth day, the plant supervisors came up to me and asked why our production numbers have been low and I told them it's because of the new guy. He keeps making the same mistakes and i see no room of improvement. The last day of the week came and I didnt see him anymore, at the end of the day the plant supervisors told me that they fired him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings around the plant has been kinda off, i hear my coworkers talking behind my back on how i was 'too much' for him and how i didnt give him enough time to improve and i wasn't patient enough, and how my promotion got the best of me. Now i ask you people of Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for about 7 months now and things moved a bit fast. I live in one city and she lived in a town 1 hour and some change away. We saw each other for about a month before deciding mutually that she could come to live with me at my place until she finds a job and a place of her own.\n\nAfter about a month living with me she finally found a job, but lost it after a couple weeks because she would constantly show up late and/or call in sick the day of her shift(which she was told not to do) only to sleep more at home. She spent about 2-3 months unemployed, sleeping in to about 3 pm and doing nothing all day. We would have a few arguments here and there because she wouldn't apply to jobs that often or really take it seriously. My mom also questioned me a few times asking when my girlfriend would move because even though she was okay with her staying for a while until she found a job and a place, it has now been 5 months and nothing has happened. (My mom doesn't have a ton of money so she can't afford to pay for 3 kids and my girlfriend). \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago, she finally started looking and found a job in the matter of a week or so. And as she finally found a job I figured it was time that I suggest that we find her a place together or contact her grandma or a friend to live with since she finally has a steady income. This set her off and it turned into an argument. She thinks that I don't want to be with her and/or am sick of being with her all the time and want her to move out. She also got pretty triggered when I said that I wanted more \"freedom\". (To clarify, I can be an introverted person and always have been. I've spent lots of time alone prior to this relationship and therefore I need even a day or so alone a week for myself and my mental health.) She doesn't seem to understand that I need alone time that I'm clearly not getting. She thinks I'm pushing her to move out so that I can break up with her as soon as she's gone. This is clearly not my intention as I have told her several times, but I do understand that some people have trust issues as she does through a dark past. She's also said she wants to stay so she can pay my mom rent that she thinks she definitely needs. \n\nI love my girlfriend and love being with her, but I also need some space because I'm introverted and value my time alone as well. Whatever I say she seems to make it seem like I'm the bad one because I'm trying to make her leave as I don't want to spend time with her. This is not the case and we'd still see each other almost everyday. ",

      "description": "So to start this I'm going to explain that I'm 23 now but I went to school in a small village in the UK which had an infant, juniors and high school meaning I only went to school with people from my village up until high school when kids from other villages travelled to our school. There was a guy who lived in my village who worked as like a school director and I was actually in the same class as his daughter throughout infants school I think it age like 7 to 10 but I'm pretty stoned and I actually went on a week long school trip with this guy during the last year of being at that school.  Any way I went to school with her all the way through my school career, she went college as far as I'm aware but I'm honestly not sure as she was always quite popular (she actually stamped her foot on my arm in year 4 for no reason once) and I hung out with either the group of nerds, the group of stoners or the 'moshers emos and goths.' I chose to go to a different college to the majority of people in my high school and village to escape all the cliques and bullshit which was the best choice I ever made as I now live in a different city with loads of friends across two cities and I'm following/living my dream career wise.\n\nAnyway, this guy was on the board of the directors for multiple schools (all small children schools) in a small city called Wakefield where the village I lived called home. His name was Chris Powell if you want to Google him he's now in jail. Chris was caught by a 'nonce hunters' style Facebook vigilante group that I think go by the name Predator Exposure (check out their Facebook, they recorded their own song.)\n\nWhen Chris was caught he'd gone to meet what he thought was a young boy and his car boot was full of sex toys so it was quite clear that he was down to fuck. Sadly for Chris it wasn't a young boy it was  a group of rough looking Yorkshire blokes and women  wearing their own brand of pedo hunting merchandise waving Facebook live streaming phones in his face. I don't fully remember as it's a few years back and once again I'm pretty stoned but I think from then it was a classic case of having loads of child porn on his laptop/phone and he'd been contacting and grooming actual kids as well as the fake one created by the hunters.\n\nFast forward to today, one of the only two people I'd call a good friend from school and the only one who had been there throughout every school sent me a print screen of a video on YouTube. The YouTube video is titled 'Top 10 Greatest Nonce Stings' and has 295,444 views at this moment in time. The print screen itself is timed on a still image of the nonce that has managed to make number 9 on this list looking gormless as fuck. Next to the photo of the nonce there is a fat black slab and in big red writing is the nonces name and that name is none other than our good friend CHRIS POWELL.\n\nSo I've been feeling pretty low lately and this kind of really made me laugh because of the name of the video and the fact that my mate sent it to me just made me chuckle. Anyway I was going to post it on Instagram but then thought to myself that I don't have anyone really from school on Instagram whilst on Facebook I have a few old bullies who tried to reconnect and a few people who I just never deleted and never deleted me. I knew I didn't have Chris' daughter on there but may have a couple of her friends possibly on there so thought it'd be much more relevant and cause a bit of a discussion there as I'm bored and stuck at home alone a lot at the moment (hence the daft long Reddit post.)\n\nSo I posted the print screen with the caption 'when someone you went on a school trip with becomes YouTube famous 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩' (not an emoji guy just sarcastic as fuck) and it got a 7 or 8 likes which basically means it banged compared to my usual posts and yeah I was pretty happy with myself and started smoking up and getting my chill on. Next thing you know this guy from school who bullied me before going to Afghanistan and coming back on some fake kindness/overly nice trip comments calling me out saying I shouldn't post it in case Chris' daughter saw, I tried to explain how I didn't have her on Facebook and he continued on about how I might not have her added but her or her family could see. I explained how my posts are set private to my friends but he continued on at me saying I was disrespectful to her and her family. At this point some one randomly chimed in and called him a nonce sympathiser so I get a bit hyped and go in on him about the previous points a little harder and the fact that his name and face should be shared around so people remember him when he's released all whilst repeatedly calling him a 'noble nonce sympathiser.' he other people chimed in and ripped on him and he defended his view by saying 'what if your dad was a pedo would you want people sharing things about him' to which I replied 'if my dad was a pedo and people were sharing things about him it wouldn't matter to me as he'd be dead to me and not my father.' He then started back footing and making out like he didn't mean any of what he said or want an arguement then out of nowhere accused someone of being up my arse before rounding it off by wishing my business well.\n\nTL;DR - nonce was school director, went to school with his daughter, nonce got caught by pedo hunters, I shared print screen later and got called out for being an asshole.\n\nSo yeah, I wanna know if he's right or if I did nothing wrong, I haven't written anything that long since o was at school with Chris' daughter!\n\nThanks Reddit!",

      "description": "This happened a few months ago and fucked me up for a few days if nothing else, but it still sticks around in my mind because although it felt like I did nothing wrong, in hindsight it might have been the wrongest of wrong things. I dunno.\n\nSo background: I volunteer two days of every school week at a local primary (Australian word for elementary) school in a mixed grade 3/4 class. The area is highly made up of aboriginal Australian and north African immigrant families, and the school is owned by the nearest university - one that focuses on equity for students of different abilities, cultures and finances. \n\nOne such student is an 11-year-old Islamic girl from Sudan, who might be the biggest teacher's pet I've met in my time. Often she'll raise her hand just to ask \"Do you like superheroes?\" Or something to that liking. \n\nOne day I start noticing a few interesting questions from her, such as \"Do you wear dresses?\" and \"Do you have a girlfriend?\", and while I wish I could say yes to both, it would be a bit jarring to explain that I am wearing a bra under my shirt and am considered a woman by my self, friends, and family. I'm also bi as fuck, which makes the latter question even more awkward.\n\nObviously she was picking up a few effeminate vibes from me. The questions continue and I avoid those that are too strange for me to explain, but after some time she says - more kindly than most adults do - \"Are you gay?\"\n\nI think about whether or not I should respond, and for my own sake the answer is obviously not to, but because I don't want to make any sort of impression that the topic is such a taboo, and that she obviously knew of the subject, I decide to answer truthfully: \"No, but I'm actually bi.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means liking both men and women.\"\n\nThat was the end of the conversation for then, and I was glad to see that she was so understanding at her age.\n\nThe next day I get a call to meet with the principal. You know where this is going. She explained to me that she had gotten a call from a parent, complaining that \"I had taught their daughter a new word.\" I was told that obviously they would not ask me to leave, for legal reasons if nothing else, but that I needed to learn the \"boundaries\" of a teacher-student relationship, specifically that I have no right to act as a friend in any way to a student and cannot be anything more to them than a teacher. \n\nI agreed for the sake of my career but it would go against everything I believe in to say that I have to hide a basic, g-rated piece of info like it were a criminal record, let alone to forbid myself from acting as a friend in addition to an educator.\n\nMy plans to explain my gender to pupils after I transitioned over the summer were promptly cancelled until they could \"find an appropriate strategy\", and although I did later have to postpone my return for study reasons, they insisted I wait for weeks after school starting so that \"students have time to adjust\".",

      "description": "So I have been the only child for all my life and never had to take care of someone or give up what I love for them because it’s never been a case of ‘someone needs you at home’. Because of this I always make sure I help out in any way I can so I don’t come across as a snobby Ahole. Recently I have had lot of stuff coming up like transitioning to college ( American Junior Year High School ) so I am really trying to concentrate as I want to make sure I get those top grades for university.\n\nMy aunt lost her job and had to go and live back in Brazil however my mum insisted my cousin stay with us for her to have a better life which I have no problem with and totally agree but now I have to give up EVERYTHING. I have had a successful pole vaulting career for 5 YEARS and she expects me to throw it out the window so I can stay home with my cousin (7 years old) while she goes to work till 8. Now I don’t get why I have to throw away everything I get she’s family but she’s not even my sister and I didn’t agree to throwing away all my hard work. I just believe that if your going to invite a child to live with you at least know you will be able to take care of them. I am not a childminder and do not get paid anyway, so all the family went off at me and called me selfish just because I don’t want all that time and money down the drain. The only person backing me was my dad but I’m only moving there for university because he lives way closer to all of them.

      "description": "Little backstory: I married my wife roughly a year ago. We've dated for a couple of years before I proposed. While it was clear to me early on that she's more in love with the idea of having kids than I am, we both came to an agreement that we would wait a year or so after marriage to have our own.\n\nFlash forward to a few months into marriage: I'm in medical school, working my ass off. On certain nights, my wife will start bringing up the topic of kids, asking me if I'm sure that I wanted to wait the year or so before trying to have kids. I stick with my answer and we have a small conversation about why I feel that way.\n\nSome time later: I talk to her about how I'm worried that having a kid can make things harder for me in medical school. As a consequence, I told her that I would feel more comfortable waiting an extra 10 months or so on top of the year that we said we'd be waiting. She took it a little hard and we had an argument, but we agreed at the end of it.\n\nFlash forward to now: every month or so, my wife would bring up the topic of kids again. I feel like she would act clueless and pretend that she didn't know our last agreement. Each time we talk about the topic, she would try to move that date closer and closer. I stick with my answer (1 year, 10 months total) every time, and because I won't budge on that timeline, she'd be mad and we would have a small argument. And every time we have an argument, she would use hypothetical situations to (in my opinion) fear monger me into moving the date closer (e.g. \"what if I'm infertile by then?\"; bear in mind that we're in our mid-20s). \n\nMy reasoning behind waiting is that the extra commitment might be too much for me, considering that I am already physically drained from my workload in medical school. On top of that, I would like to wait until we're more financially secure (i.e. I get close to graduating and finding a job as a physician). Medical school cost \\~$250,000 dollars, and I don't want to fail out because of the extra commitment. My wife doesn't see that though. She wants to have kids before \"it's too late.\"\n\nWho is the asshole in this situation?",

I turned and said in a loud voice so everyone (about 30 people) could hear: \"Like how you cut yourself?\", before going back to my seat (bell had just rung anyway).

      "description": "This one is kind of a doozy, so strap in.\n\nI'm (M19) living in a ~1,000sqft. , 3 bedroom apartment with 5 other friends. We are assigned two to each bedroom, and the shared spaces are the kitchen and the living room.\n\nOne of my housemates (M19) has continually been using the shared spaces as if it was his own. Now, I can't act like I'm perfect either, but this roommate has left countless dishes in the sink (up to multiple days), and refuses to move his plates and utensils out of the drying rack and into the cupboards. When I asked him about said issue, he responded that my roommate clears the drying rack weekly anyways, and that it doesn't bother him at all.\n\nThe worst part isn't the kitchen though; unfortunately, it seems that this housemate considers the living room to be his second walk-in closet. From the first week that we all moved into the apartment, he's left his giant bicycle underneath the bar-styled counter in our living room that faces into the kitchen. He said that he would ride the bike to school (about 3-4 miles away), but that bike hasn't moved an inch for the past 6 months (he commutes by car instead). And a couple months back, he brought a mini-fridge into our already tiny kitchen, explaining that he'd sell the appliance on letgo or ebay (the refridgerator is still here to this day). But the last straw for me was when he brought in a giant foldable table (the ones you'd find at catered parties), and plopped it into the middle of our living room. \n\nWell of course, most of us were quick to express our discontent at the move. The table was an eye-sore, and even though we could use a coffee table-sized... table for our living room (lol), that giant, plastic, unaesthethic monstrosity was just way too much.\n\nI talked to the housemate about this, and asked if he could maybe fold it up and put it away. He then explained that he needed a place to eat his food. I explained that we already had a futon and a smaller table (maybe a foot and a half wide and 5 feet long) where other people ate, but he then said he needed a place to study and do work. I then pointed out that *he had his own desk in his room*, but even that didn't matter, as 'his roommate often used the desk'. He also argued that there was already another desk (for study use) in the living room, and no one would complain about *that* one (which was a desk for the two girls that lived in one of the bedrooms together, but they didn't have space for a desk in their room).\n\nI was kind of done with words. I angrily washed all of the dishes in the sink (which were his), and then proceeded to put away all the dishes from the drying rack into the respective cupboards and drawers (which were also mostly his). I then came back to my room to talk to my roommate about the issue and to write my woes into this post.\n\nThe giant foldable table now sits alongside the wall between our futon and the entrance to the kitchen. It's a fucking eyesore and I wish it would go away. I've been talking to other roommates about possibly getting barstools for the counter or maybe another smaller, manageable coffee table, but to this housemate, as long as the new furniture isn't there, the table stays. Even as I write this right now, he's using it to have a snack and study for school on his laptop.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole that is declining my roommate's needs for a table and extra space to eat and study? Because maybe I'm incorrectly associating his need for a workspace with his poor kitchen management skills. But in general, it seems like he's just taking advantage of the shared spaces of our apartment. What do I do to convince the guy that he should move his shit out of our shared space? ",

I've never spent money on pretty much anything that wasn't food, clothes or books (I don't drink or smoke) in my time here but today I spoke with an old flame of mine and she invited me to spend 3-4 days with her in her country (and sleep at her place), would be a 1-2h flight and the cost is about 30-70euros round-trip depending on timing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked my parents and they said no because they don't want me to lose time and don't want to spend money on something useless (I'm finishing college this summer) but it's mostly because my parents are way way overprotective and are afraid of everything I do (an old problem that I hope I won't have to care about once I get any kind of job), they even told me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnow, I'm not going to try and change their minds, but I'm quite sad and angry about it because for once I had an opportunity to be with a person I feel good with and go outside my house not alone and they refuse it for their egoistic need to feel that I'm safe, it makes me so mad, I respect them but they don't respect me if they don't trust me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know some of you are going to look at me like I'm a spoiled child but I think it's mostly that I'm not driven to do anything with my life that brought me to waste so much time, and this lead to me being almost depressed for a long time, now I'm getting better and I'm almost done with college so I'll be able to dedicate myself to something (anything, I just want to be indipendent).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole for thinking that my parents should pay for this trip?

      "title": "AITA For Absolutely Despising MY Girlfriend’s Only Friend?",
      "description": "Obligatory apology for formatting issues should they exist, posted from mobile. TL;DR at the end.\n\nSo let me start out by saying that I have already accepted everything about my (20M) girlfriend (19F), including having to deal with her best and only friend (18F). \n\nSo, with that said, let it be known that I hate my girlfriend’s best friend, heretofore known as “H”. I loathe her very existence. Her treatment of my girlfriend, who doesn’t have the opportunity to go out and make new friends due to mental illness, is awful. H will invite my girlfriend, heretofore known as “K”, over to hang out, then proceed to invite her boyfriend, or boy toy, I’m not sure at this point, over and completely ignore K. She relies on K for emotional support though she never returns the support when it’s the other way around. She’s a bad influence on K, bringing her to a party I wasn’t able to attend one time where K knew no one and left her alone the entire night save for one interaction, where H tried to get K to cheat on me.\n\nH cheats on every boyfriend she ever gets and then complains whenever her relationships never work out. When they inevitably fail, she makes K feel guilty for having a good relationship with me while H is single, until she finds the next person to attach to. I’ve given up time with K just so she could go and see H for whatever reason. K and I have changed our plans multiple times just to include our accommodate H. \n\nThen there’s just her mannerisms towards me. I find her personality to be irritating, she continually tries to press my buttons, such as calling me “Subnautica” after wearing a Nautica brand shirt, which seems like something small, but after the litany of shit I put up with from H, it makes me want to roundhouse kick her into the Sun. Or, there’s the time when she perverts my name into a brand of feminine hygiene products. (Hint: it’s also a brand of coffee)\n\nJust all in all, I’m sick of it. I’ve never said the first bad word towards H, despite the many irritations she’s caused me and the significant trouble she’s caused K because K has troubles with mental illness that keep her from going out and socializing with many new people, depriving her of the chance to make new friends, as well as her having known H for close to 10 years. I know it hurts K because she had this vision of us all being happy friends and such but I just can’t do it. It causes the occasional fight whenever I start to complain about H to K, though they’re never particularly bad and are avoided as long as I keep my mouth shut. \n\nTL;DR- My girlfriend has troubles with mental illness that ensures that she has only this one friend who happens to be a complete and utter cockbite and I hate her.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for hating my girlfriend’s one and only friend?\n",

      "description": "So I've been hanging out with this girl for a while but we aren't officially dating even though she really wants to. We have a fairly active sex life which is quite enjoyable. Earlier this week we were laying in bed watching some Netflix and I noticed I was a little horny, so I indicated I would like to have sex with her. She declined the free ticket I was offering on the train to pound town, which I respected and we went to bed.\n\nThe next morning after she left I realized I was still a little horny, so I decided to rub one out. Something males all over the world do. It was absolutely not a reflection of her, I was just kinda horny and decided to take of it.\n\nSo fast forward to that night and she wants to have sex so of course I oblige her. We fuck for a while and eventually stop because we are both tired. I didn't cum due to my morning activities, which was no big deal to me as long as she was satisfied. She expressed that she felt bad because she couldn't make me cum. I tried to console her by explaining that it wasn't her fault because I had taken care of myself in the morning. At which point she completely shut down and told me she was pissed. She said I was thinking about other girls which is obviously true because there was porn involved. She is also pretty Christian which could be a contributing factor.\n\nShe abruptly left at 1:30 in the morning.\n\nAITA for wacking it because she didn't want to do it?",

      "title": "AITA for freaking out because my family ate all the doughnuts?",
      "description": "Alright, the title might be a little baity, but just stick with me here. \n\nSo my family and I are all muslims, and because of that we all dry fast from sunrise till sunset during one of the months of the year (ramadan). It's a religous practice to help an individual cast away some of their material attachements and bring them closer to themselves and god. \n\nNow here's a disclaimer: This happened last Ramadan, and my family brings it up to tease me every now and then. \n\nOne day during this month, it happened so that I was the only person fasting. Everyone else blew it off for some reason or the other, but I was the only one who was fasting. Now this was a very stressful time of the month for me as I was going through exam period for a class (Calc 2) I had previously dropped out of. Because of some reason or the other, I had failed both my midterms and discussed with the prof if I could have the exam replace my entire course mark if I did pass the exam BEFORE the bell curve. My prof agreed but he did warn me that the average for his exams are usually 30-40% BEFORE the bell curve. Therefore, a lot rided on this and usually I wouldn't fast through this ordeal, but I found that it really did help me focus when I studied. Now usually, in our house whenever someone fasts, we cook a huge meal, have a nice big family dinner together to break the fast, and I expected no different from today. Before I left for school in the morning I saw my parents buy a lot of food and I saw a Tim Horton's dozen doughnuts box in the fridge as well, filled to the brim with my favourite doughnuts. I went to school and wrote my exam, finished around 7pm and caught the bus back home. \n\nWhen I got home, I couldn't really find anyone except my brother who was in his room. It was approaching sunset and I was looking forward to this big meal with my family. However, my brother told me that everyone had already ate and left to go to someone's house. Now this annoyed me a little bit, but I figured that I would just eat the leftovers and catch up on brooklyn nine nine while I ate. However, when I opened the fridge, I quickly saw that there was literally no leftovers from their dinner. Absolutely nothing. The only thing I could see was the Tim Hortons box. I grab the box and put it out on the table, and when I open it, I found nothing but crumbs. From there, it could've been a mix of hunger and just rage and I flipped out on my brother and yelled about how gluttinous they are and how they didnt fast like me and how they are just completely unempathetic. When everyone came home, they just couldn't believe that I was so mad over doughnuts and that I was being completely unreasonable. \n\nSo I ask, who is in the wrong here, AITA?\n\nP.S. I kicked that exam's butt and finished with a B-",

      "description": "A little bit of backstory: We're both 17, I'm a male and she's a female. I'm fairly considerate, as in I often give my friends stuff (for example cakes my mother makes), and so does she. A couple of times i asked her if she wanted me to bring her cake or whatever to school, and she always declined. One time i talked to her about it, and it concluded with her saying \"i don't want anything from you\" (as in material stuff i hope, anyways it's an awful thing to say). So, i kind of got mad because she never accepted my stuff but i always accepted her's. Also i confessed her love a month ago, which didn't end well because she was flirting with the other guy at the moment, but everything was pretty normal in our relationship since then, not even uncomfortable.\n\nToday we had a fight about it. She brought me a chocolate bar i like, i declined, she kind of begged me to take it (begged is obviously too hard of a word). I didn't accept it in the end, and because she didn't want it back i just left it laying on a table (she saw that). After that she was mad about me not accepting her \"attention\", and saying, and i quote, \"i'll stop with acts of kindness/attention, so you won't have anything to decline, it will be easier on you, do what you want. I don't want to lose any more nerves on you, just know, ever again\". I shrugged at that statement, saying that i have no problem with her decision and that i didn't want to hurt her or anything. Also that i too feel bad about her not recieving my \"attention\". She was just really mad that she had to beg me to take her \"kindness\", because she thinks i humiliated her. I was pretty calm entire time, i told her that i really appriciate her kindness apart from not taking my favorite candy. She didn't really accept that, and is angry.\n\nI hope i didn't give out too one-sided perspective, and i feel bad and dumb about this situation. Didn't really want a fight, and i literally had 0 problems with her, ever. But i really don't want to say sorry. How right am i?\n\n**TL;DR** i got mad at my best friend for saying \"i don't want anything from you\", so i declined her next casual gift. She thinks i humiliated her because i so stubbornly declined, and is now angry at me.",

My mother will spend hours at a time watching videos on some K-Pop band, and listening to my youngest sister practically beg for tickets for one of their upcoming shows even though we can’t afford it. When it comes to my other sister it’s more understandable since she’s going off to college soon. But I just feel like none of them want to hear what I have to say, at all. I’m currently in college (yay being a broke ass college student /s) and I’m set to graduate and move to a better college this semester, but it feels like that’s just... irrelevant now. Last time I brought up how I feel over this, I made my mother cry and I was told I was being a selfish cunt. I don’t want to hurt any of them, but I also want to connect with them and share my passions with them. WIBTA if I told them they way they act towards me makes me feel like they don’t want me?

      "description": "My friend invited a couple of families on a vacation together. We all have kids. Their child is a little difficult, is a bad sleeper and also has allergies. The entire vacation is starting to revolve around their kid.\n\nThe kid must love playgrounds, because they want to go somewhere with a playground every day. And that’s the only activity that they want to do for the day. Our day revolves around the kid’s nap schedule. Due to the allergies, they want to stay at the accommodation during mornings and evenings to cook for their kid. So we all can’t go out to a nice restaurant together. To accommodate them, we get take out. And it seems like they’re expecting us to.\n\nI’ve tried to be empathetic, as I know how hard it is to be a parent, especially to a difficult child. My husband and I like sightseeing and eating out. I feel like ditching them and doing our own thing. I haven’t said anything to the other families yet, not wanting to split up the group and offend anyone. But we all don’t have to do everything together.",

      "description": "For years, I have been going to a small local rock climbing gym.  Because of government regulations based on the size of business, they had no choice but to provide two handicapped parking spaces right by the front door in the small main lot of about 12 cars.  There was also an excess lot for about 40 cars behind the building, which people were occasionally forced to use and walk around to the front because the back entrance was a fire door only.   Please note: this is a **rock climbing gym**, if you aren't at least able-bodied (and don't work behind the register) there really isn't much chance you will have a reason to want to park here.   I knew all the employees and there was no one with a handicapped plate who worked there. \n\nOne day, after about 6 months of never seeing a single person park there, I decided to use the second best of the handicapped spots instead of being forced to use the back lot because we had been getting freezing rain for a few hours and the sun was going down, and I didn't feel like falling on my ass coming down or going up an icy slope because I was saving a spot for someone who is NEVER going to need it.   There was no problem that day.    \n\nThis became a habit.  Any time (rain or shine) that I couldn't park in a free space up front, I'd take the handicapped spot.  Eventually, I started doing it on \"on principle\" because I figured that if I used one of these two spots that always went to waste, that's one less other person who gets stuck driving around to the back if the lot filled up later.\n\nOne day, one of the other climbers found out it was me who'd been doing it and told me I was the worst piece of privileged shit in the world.  (He was a little extra outraged because he had a friend who was recently paralyzed in a climbing accident outdoors.)   I told him I was sorry, that I thought the likelihood of anyone wanting to use the spot legitimately was so remote it was wasted, and pointed out the that best handicapped spot remains open.  He said I was a selfish piece of shit, and I have to admit, former climbers who are now injured wanting to come to the gym was not something I had thought of.  So I stopped parking there.\n\nTL;DR Was certain no one would ever need a government mandated handicapped space and used it.  Got chastised for it even though no one actually ever needed it.   Was my rationalization really that wrong?",

      "title": "AITA for thinking a mentally disabled student is ruining my college games club?",
      "description": "**The neutral explanation**\n\nThere is a games club that I am a member of at my college. Its members consist of about 20 members, both men and women who meet about once a week (usually not all 20 at once) to play various board / table top games. Since my joining the club 2 years ago, I have risen in the ranks to being someone who helps organize the game nights now every third week or so. (The specific game I run will be discussed later). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently (this past semester) a student who is mentally disabled was encouraged to join the club. I was in no way opposed to his joining, because I genuinely enjoy introducing the fun of tabletop games to people. I often see people that think board games only go as far as monopoly, so its great to expand their horizons into thinks like Munchkin, Zombicide, Sycthe, etc etc. The main game that I run is Dungeons and Dragons about once or twice a month (It’s actually a different game system, but everyone knows D&amp;D, so let’s go with that for simplicity)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo describe this student (let’s call him Jim) I’d say he is not completely unable, he’s mostly just slower than the usual person and has a bit of a temper. He is often accompanied by a “buddy” around campus who helps him with stuff. He is easily upset if something doesn’t go his way. He doesn’t throw tantrums exactly, but he gets angry, loud, and very occasionally, will throw something in frustration (small objects. He doesn’t flip tables or anything). So with that explanation, you might see where this is going.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, so to get into the meat of my issue with Jim, I decided to split the explanation up into two versions. A simple, non-nerd version that gets the point across and a full on nerd explanation of the situation. I suggest reading the first one, but I wanted to at least write out the full version somewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Non-Nerd Version**\n\nI’ve been running a longer story with my players (5 people before Jim) for about a year and a half now. Sessions require some prep time on my part, making sure I know the player characters, where the players are planning to go, and trying to think of interesting ways to get everyone involved in the story. About mid-way through this past semester, Jim was invited into the game. We played a few practice games with him that went okay. I genuinely enjoy seeing a new player get invested in their character and come up with interesting ideas on how to progress, but issue started to arise when Jim actually joined the campaign. He wouldn’t allow his character to be hurt or be challenged in any way. This lead to parts of the game being derailed completely because his “I can’t lose” character would just effortlessly win every time because his “buddy” and other sympathetic players would insist that I “just let it slide. We’re all here to have fun and this is fun for him.” This finally boiled over in the last session before winter break where a plot twist a player and myself were building up to was “ruined” because Jim’s character pulled a “I can’t lose” move. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst and foremost, I just want everyone to have fun. I’m not going to flip the table and throw a tantrum just because the players aren’t following the story I wrote. I’ve read and seen those kinds of Dungeon Masters and that kind of behavior is embarrassing and just not fun to be around. I’m not going to just stop running the game, but I’m starting to wish I could.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m not alone in this feeling. Two of the players also feel like the game is lesser now that Jim has joined. (one of them was part of that failed plot twist). We are quiet about it because we are concerned about being labeled as assholes for being upset over a disabled student. I used to look forward to the game sessions over winter break, but now I’m just putting together the prep work as more of a chore now. The player who had his plot twist messed up is even thinking of leaving the game since it leaves him a convenient out now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm mostly just curious if we are being entitled assholes for being upset over our tabletop RPG being run differently as to how we want it to be. As I said, some people are having a lot of fun, but there are others who are considering dropping out of the game entirely because it has changed so much now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou don’t need to read the longer version below, but it does go into more explanation about me and my players specific issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nMentally disabled player doesn’t want to play games by the rules. Makes me and other players not want to be a part of the club anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The (far too long) Nerd Version**\n\nBefore getting into Jim as a player, I’ll explain a few things about how we played our games:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, so as a Dungeon Master I try to get as involved with my players as I can. Each of their character’s backstories are woven into the pre-written campaign through various methods (flashbacks, custom Non Player Characters, etc) . I work with everyone individually as much as they want, through email or in person hang outs to get an idea of where they want their character to go, or even if they want to retire the character to play as a new one. (Characters are retired either through death or other plot stuff. It depends on what the player and I think will work best (This is also done rarely. We don't really allow character retirement until the character has been around awhile or, in extreme cases, the character just doesn't work for the party)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe also used to run our games with a “what happens happens” kind of thing. If a character dies due to a dumb player move, then that character is dead. We try not to “ret-con” events just because a player regrets a previous move. We viewed it like being upset over an early move in chess and wanting to “go back” and undo that move so you don’t lose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let’s get to the issues with Jim as a player:\n\n* Bored with my character – Jim never plays the same character twice. When we first started, I helped him make up a character. I asked what kind of character he wanted to play ( Kind of like “Do you want to me a knight with a sword, a wizard with magic, or a quick-handed thief?”). He had a lot of fun making up a character and a basic backstory for him. I was able to find a way to weave this new character into the existing plot and the first session went… okay. But then. The next session he didn’t want to play his character anymore. He wanted to play as someone else. The more sympathetic players just brushed it off, but it’s frustrating to both me and some other players that a member of the party is constantly switching out. It made everyone not want to interact with that character on a roleplaying level because he was so inconsistent.\n* Everything proof shield – Jim now doesn’t allow his character to be injured in any way. Combats involving Jim’s characters are always a mess. Let’s say a goblin tries to hit him with a spear. It rolls high enough to hit, so Jim should take damage. However, Jim will say “I block it!” and will just repeat this over and over until I give up and just say something along the lines of “you manage to block the spear with your shield at the last second.” The sympathetic players will often congratulate him on his “quick thinking” and such, which again annoys the other players.\n* · Unlimited Cosmic Powers – Okay so the last bullet point might really only affects his character if it stopped there, but of course it doesn’t. Jim’s character also has unlimited ability when it comes to any problem the party faces. This essentially boils down to Jim not wanting to roll dice. He just dictates what he wants his character to do and expects it to just be done. “I climb the wall. I hit him with my sword. I heal him” As a DM I usually let players police their own abilities (We look up the rules if something doesn’t feel right) but with Jim there’s just no boundaries. His character can just do *Anything* he wants without fail. Early on, I tried to play with him like usual (“You try to hit him, but he manages to nimbly doge out of your reach”) however, this lead to him getting angry and sometimes throwing game pieces or just storming off. Often leading to the sympathetic players giving me looks of disapproval and being told I should “just let him do it”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so the stage is now set for what I call\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Final Straw**\n\nI’m not going to bore you with a complete recap of the story of our campaign thus far, but to give the important details: The party was at a natural conclusion for this part of the campaign before winter break (think final episode of a season before a hiatus) and a player and I had something up our sleeve to end the session. He had been secretly planning with me for the last few months on having his character defect against the party. (A reminder, I do this with all my players. They all have backstory and character motivation that the other players don’t know, so it was a treat to have this tidbit of information under my hat for this long)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were both excited to finally drop this twist on the party and had a plan on how to do it in an interesting way. The best way I can think to explain how it was supposed to go is to just put up an outline of what we were planning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurncoat Character (TC)\n\nDungeon Master (DM)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSetting: A camp that party has set up at the base of a mountain several days after defeating the boss of this part of the campaign. Party consists of the 6 players and a NPC. They now have what they think is a very important item with them that is left with the NPC for plot reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTC: “On my turn for night watch I cast silence, targeted on center of camp” (Creates area where no sound it made) “ I make my way to the NPC’s tent and stand over him for several min",

      "description": "This happened quite a long time ago (about 4 (??) months back) but now i'm still troubled with the question of whether i was being an asshole in the situation. Sorry for bad English in advance, not a native.\n\nTl;dr: ghosted a person after they started acting clingy and weird.\n\nSo basically, i know this confession page on Facebook (yes i use facebook) that's pretty popular in my country, the point of this page is for people to make friends and write stories together (kinda like roleplaying but you can say it's more complicated). Now, i was pretty lonely back them, and so i thought it wouldn't hurt to give this a try, so i wrote a confession, introducing myself and stating my preferences, what kind of friends am i looking for,... etc. This wasn't the first time i've ever written a confession on this page, i actually got myself a few friends in the past so i figured this time would go smoothly again.\n\nOhhh was I wrong.\n\nAbout 4 - 5 people replied to my confession, said that they want to give it a try. I pmed all of them, none actually went well, but I'll talk about one person that really stood out, let's call her A.\n\nSo, since it was stranger on stranger communication, i didn't know anything about A, her facebook wall is mostly empty (only avatar updates etc but it's because she got her posts mostly set on Friends only). We talked back and forth, she introduced herself and lo and behold she's the same age as me, has the same hobbies, quite similar mood swings/personalities, so needless to say, we clicked. I thought i've just found myself a new friend and everything was going well, she seemed to have pretty severe anxiety, but at that point i did too, so i told her it's okay and we'll work through it together. Her next message was my first red flag, though.\n\nA said she easily develops a crush, is clingy, needs affection instantly, and by that i mean INSTANTLY. We'll get into details later, but the way she said these things kinda pulled me back a litte bit, but again, we seemed perfect, i didn't have no one, she didn't have no one, and it felt great again having a friend by your side.\n\nNow this is the part where it got really weird.\n\nAt first A and I talked a lot, days and nights for about 3 days, then I had to go back to school because, well, i had school and am still a student. She seemed to have studied in the mornings only while I had a full day (7am - 5pm, top tier school of the city, yes i'm an asian). In the evenings i needed to do homework, dealt with my stress and organized myself, so needless to say, i didn't have the time give her much affection and even if i did, i think couldn't have brought myself to do it due to all the shit i'm going through (depression made me lose interest in everything). A on the other hand was free as hell, and messaged me every. 10. minutes asking what i was doing, could we talk, she missed me,... Keep in mind, I've only KNOWN her for like a week or less, so it was really weird to me. I tried to replied to all her messages saying i got homework to do, i didn't feel like talking, i was busy etc. She was kinda upset, apologized for being \"annoying\" and left me alone, for about an hour before she started doing it again. She said i didn't initiate conversations and that hurt her, so i promised i would start to initiate conversations with her from that point on. This went on for like 2 - 3 days, I was busy, she demanded affection, we only really talked at night and even then, i didn't really felt like talking and that she was taking all of my free time, she needed instant comfort, affection and reassurance so she wouldn't have a breakdown. I was tired dealing with my depression alone, so I was pretty strained by giving everything i had to her yet not having the guts to talk about my personal problems yet (like come on, would you tell a stranger on the internet that you've known for a week about your personal life? no). I went to ask a few friends about this, what should i do, and almost all of them said I should cut A off. I agree with this idea, but I myself hesitated to actually do it because i'm scared she would throw shit on me and breakdown-- It's actually really hard to confront a person with mental illnesses because you feel like their life's hanging over your head and one wrong move, they're dead. This doesn't defend my action though, and if i'm the asshole, i'm still the asshole.\n\nSo that led me to one final decision.\n\nI ghosted her.\n\nAt first she kept on messaging me like usual, asking me where I was, why I didn't talk to her, saying she missed me, she apologized if she did something wrong and wished i would come back. I ignored it all. It stopped for like a week, then there they were, the final messages she sent me were super long, like a 5 page microsoft word essay, talking about her past traumas, people that have left and hurt her, why she is annoying, why she hates herself, all kinds of stuff. I was scared at this point. Like, genuinely scared. So, I left her messages there for about 3 weeks before i finally decided to take out my trusty computer, install an unseen extension and see her messages. She has blocked me, but it still shocked me to the core seeing what she wrote to me, how unnerving and weird it was, i feel like i dodged a bullet, but it still made me questions if i was really an asshole because i feel like i couldn't help her through her hard time, gave her the affection she needed and ghosted her in the end. I feel like she's not at fault because the human mind can be weird sometimes, along with her obvious mental problems.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "So a little background info,  I am 23 and my girlfriend is 21.  We moved in together in September and ever since she has been dead set on getting a dog.  I work full time in IT and she just received her bachelors in nursing and is going back to school for her masters next semester as well as working part time as a nurse.  We live in the city in a small apartment and to be honest I do not feel as if we have the time right now to take care of a puppy, let alone afford one.   When she brings it up, i usually try to point out why its not the greatest idea right now, seeing as she doesn't work full time and already has a hard enough time splitting rent as it is.  Don't get me wrong I love dogs and would love to get one in the future.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main concern is this puppy being cooped up in a small apartment for at least 8 hours a day alone, and on top of that shelling out over 1000 dollars for the \"perfect dog\".  When I offer an opinion on how I feel about the situation, she gets super upset to the point of screaming at me.  It basically leaves me with get a dog, or lose her... and I don't want to lose her we've been dating for 3 years and love each other dearly.  She also wants the dog for therapeutic reasons and makes me feel horrible for thinking we can't handle the responsibility right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting to wait to get a dog until we are both financially stable as well as more able to take care of a puppy?",

      "title": "AITA: For not celebrating my mom's engagement?",
      "description": "My mom and dad recently divorced after 26 years of being married. Their relationship had always been rocky and anybody who was anybody could see it was on a downhill trajectory. I had spent the majority of my teenage and young adult years being the buffer between them and my mom had agreed to hold out on the marriage until my two younger brothers (16 &amp; 17 during the divorce) graduated college. \n\nAt the start of last year I announced my engagement to my long time boyfriend of 9 years and we began planning our wedding. I moved out of my family home and in with my then fiancé just a few minutes away from home. We announced our wedding date for August of 2018. \n\nNovember 2017 comes around and my mom calls me over, I assumed to talk about wedding plans or thanksgiving. Instead she announced her divorce. I was devastated for so many reasons. I was worried for my brothers who were just finishing school. I was hurt that she announced it during a time where I wanted to focus on my future husband and I. So many reasons that would take much more time to talk about. Many of them I consider my own shortcomings and immaturity.\n\nI gave it a few months and put aside my feelings and supported both her and my dad during the divorce. Not many people talk about the conflict of being an adult child of divorcing parents: the emotional pain is there but the logical understanding that this is for the best is there as well. I did my best to tune out their insults of one another, their seething hatred and gossip, and focus on my wedding. I couldn't. My husband and I ended up eloping in August and my parents were a big reason why. \n\nThe start of this year and the divorce was finalized. My mom claimed she wasn't interested in dating for a long while, that she wanted to be independent. My dad starts getting into the dating scene, and almost shortly after my mom starts seeing a guy that she had been friends with for a number of years. My sister and I have our suspicions that he was one of the many factors for her leaving.\n\nI personally do not like this man. He is awkward on a social level (understandable and fine) but something about him straight creeps me out. I have never been able to figure out what it was but I do not think he is good for my mom. He is needy, likes to be told what to do, likes to be coddled, and has a severe temper (to the point he threatened suicide because he was being moved off from coaching a little league team due to his tempers on the field). They have been dating officially since maybe February or March. They split off for about a month after the little league debacle, and in that time my mom attempted online dating and hated it. Her and C ultimately got back together and then, about a month ago, he proposed to her while they were visiting her family for a funeral. I found out this last Saturday. \n\nI have been married for barely 3 months and now my mom is engaged. She called me and I couldn't be happy for her. I tried but I really couldn't. I don't like this man and I don't like how soon it is. I don't know what to tell her because I know how awful it is  not to have people rejoice in your happiness. Am I the asshole for not celebrating her engagement with her? \n\nTL;DR: my mom recently got divorced and is now engaged to a man that I don't like and who I don't think is right for her. AITA for not celebrating with her?\n",

      "description": "\n(im in high school btw)\nSo ive got a friend, call him R. We’ve been friends for about 8 or so months now. He used to be absolutely crazy in love with this girl, and i helped him through the rejection. This was about 3 ish months ago. \n\nJust yesterday, R asked me to go out on a date with him on saturday, to which I agreed. I didn’t really think about my decision, it’s just been a long while since I’ve dated anyone. So I said yes. \n\nHe spent the rest of the day being very up in my personal space, which really didn’t like. Then, later, during our show’s rehearsal (he’s an actor, I’m stage manager) he was acting super unprofessional (which is a weird thing to complain about for a school show but i like to be taken seriously). \n\nHe sent me a text almost confessing that he’s in love with me, and im VERY uncomfortable with that, considering it’s been less than a day. \n\nTo add to all of this, I’ve been having a bit of a sexuality crisis. I used to identify as bisexual but now that I’ve “experienced” dating a guy, I fear I might be just a lesbian. It’s just super confusing and it’s got my head in a million different places. \n\nNow I’ve had some time to mull over thw situation, and I don’t think I want to pursue a relationship with R.

      "description": "So, I only bring this up in limited circumstances. I suffer from psychosis. Basically, psychosis sucks. I wouldn't wish it on someone I hate, including someone who makes fun of psychosis, because a reality where people think it is a lighthearted subject is probably better than one where people are able to understand the full weight of it. That said, some people conflate psychosis with evil. If you don't believe me, picture someone describing a truly evil act and someone in the group going \"now that's just psychotic\". If you have ever observed or said that, you have observed or said that someone who is psychotic is evil. Now this, obviously, isn't the case. When I hear someone say something like this, my first move is usually to gently point someone in the direction that psychosis != evil, describing diagnostic criteria, and how paranoia and delusions aren't inherently evil things. If they continue arguing, I often bring up my own psychosis and how a fear that the world wouldn't accept a psychotic person (mass shooting fears, visceral reaction to the word 'psychotic', etc) and the very word would ruin my life, well, caused me to try to kill myself. I woke up in a mental hospital and it's been a few years since then, but, well... AITA? I mean, I know usually oversharing and bringing up a suicide attempt is usually considered over the top, pandering, or what have you. I understand why I'm the asshole if I bring it up willy nilly. But I really mean, in this circumstance, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Before we got married (4.5 years ago) we agreed to take care of each other’s parents when the time came. Unfortunately we did not discuss grandparents and great-grandparents, and that is what we are running into. \n\nWe had our first kid almost a year ago, and I’ve struggled with some PPD. My husband works full time in a high stress job, and I work part time at an hourly job. \n\nMy MIL watches our son two days a week for five-six hours a day. She does it for free. When she’s not watching our son, she’s taking care of her grandma (93) or helping FIL with his farm (they’re divorced but back together). She does have other seasonal work, though that is done for now. FIL has helped with some projects around the house and has even paid for some smaller projects completely (usually as a Christmas or anniversary gift). Both of FIL’s parents are alive (83 and 85) and are starting to have some problems. \n\nALL of these people love my husband, are (mostly) kind to me, and absolutely adore my son. They do not want bad things for any of us, but none of them have boundaries with each other so that is what they expect of us. I also do not want to cut off ties with any of them- I just want healthy boundaries and some breathing room. \n\nBecause of all the things they have done/do, my MIL and FIL expect and now somewhat rely on my husband to help with their respective parents/grandparent on a regular (though random) basis. This has greatly effected mine and husband’s relationship, which is already going through normal new parent ups and downs. \n\nIf we didn’t have our son, I wouldn’t care as much, but now it’s taken my husband away from us on his days off, eaten up his time in the evening, and even used up some of my husband’s limited sick/vacation days- that I feel should be saved for sick baby days or other things like that. Also, my husband’s physical health has been negatively effected by this. \n\nIf it was once a week or a couple times a month that we could plan around/prepare for, I’d be much less upset about it but his parents are so last minute and don’t communicate well so this is really not an option unless my husband really sticks to his guns about boundaries. To be fair, husband has gotten better from when we first got married, but since we’ve had our son and his grandparents health issues have increased, it’s gotten out of control again (or at least that’s how I feel)\n\nTwo weeks ago, we made a rule together that we will not answer calls/texts from 5:00PM-7:00PM because that’s “family time”. Husband gets home around 4:30 and baby goes to bed around 7:00, and we go to bed around 10:00, so there are plenty of other times to talk to whomever. \n\nAbout every other evening, a family member of his has called in this two-hour time period, and EVERY SINGLE TIME husband asks me if he can answer it. I HATE that I have to tell him no- so I don’t, but I do get mad about it and tell him that it hurts me that he can’t just be “ours” for two hours a day, and that I have to be the bad guy even though we both agreed to this. \n\nSo not only are our evenings CONSTANTLY interrupted, all of his free time is being used up by grandparent appointments, or helping his parents with something or other, or being on the phone with one of them OFTEN (more than daily). There is NOT a day that goes by that is not in some way effected by his family. I am overwhelmed. \n\nThis is just the shortened version of it, so there is more at play here but I’m really trying to stick to facts and be fair. \n\nIt’s driving me crazy and really hurting me for me and my son. I just want to move far away from his family at this point. But I don’t want to be the wedge between my husband and his family in an unhealthy way, so If I’m in the wrong and not being sensitive enough or fair enough, please tell me! AITA??? ",

      "description": "I have had a very strained relationship with my mother my entire life. (I’m 35)\nI was an accident that occurred during the height of her hoe phase in college. \nIt’s only by the grace of God that I’m not severely damaged because she partied and did hard drugs for the first six months of her pregnancy ( in her defense she didn’t know and stopped as soon as she found out.)  \nShe left me to be raised by my great grandparents with the occasional stint at her house, but I was always sent back if it didn’t suit her girlfriend at the time to have a fully formed child around. \nWhen I was 15 she met a woman who I thought was great at first. She turned out to be a (formally diagnosed) narcissist that made my life a living hell from then until I finally went no contact 2 years ago. She threw my very medically frail mother out with nowhere to go. So I took her in trying to help her. She stayed on the phone fighting with her ex so much that she got kicked out of my neighborhood due to neighbor complaints. I helped her get somewhere else to go and not long after that I lost my job and place to stay. \nI ended up having to move in with my ex husband for a while which was pure hell and then I got sick. Uterine cancer.\nShe begged me to come move in with her so she could  “take care of me” and I tried everything in my power to not move in with her, but even though in have a good job, it wasn’t enough for me to live on my own at first because i had to be out of work for 3 surgeries back to back to get the cancer out and be cleared. (I have an all clear from the oncologist, I’m just on surveillance to make sure I stay clear)\nSo I move in with her and shortly afterwards I noticed her and her ex are all friendly on the phone. So I started asking her when they were getting back together. She denied it, but a week before the surgery to remove my lymph nodes she tells me that she’s moving to Texas to be with her ex THE DAY AFTER MY SURGERY. \nI was livid. She said if I needed her after surgery she’s get on a bus and come right back. I told her she made her choice and to stay gone when she left. She left me the day after surgery when I was in so much pain that I felt like I was being ripped apart because they gave me OxyContin and it wasn’t working. I asked for something different and they wouldn’t give me anything else because “OxyContin is the strongest painkiller “ t I also developed pneumonia because I was in too much pain to get up and walk, so I went to the ER and they gave me a cillin drug when it is all over my chart that I’m allergic. \nShe still got up and left.\nShe went to Texas and her own health went to hell, Now she keeps texting me telling me about her having to be on dialysis and tonight she’s in the hospital in terrible shape. Her blood pressure is low in one arm and high in the other her urine is black and smells weird and she can’t walk across the room.\nAfter 35 years of being an afterthought, AITA for maintaining no contact in this situation?",

      "description": "If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I'm a realist. I don't pretend that anything is what it is clearly not, and don't subscribe to any mainstream \"fantasies\". For this reason, Harry Potter p***** me off. Everybody walks around like it's the gospel truth and I'm over here like... are you serious?\n\nSO...\n\nI go to school in a small town so all the grades are in one school. The younger grades always eat lunch first, and the older grades (me) go after them. As usual, the idiots in my class are discussing something related to Harry Potter and it's making me want to plug my ears so fricking hard.\n\nThen, I have an idea. I realize that these people in my grade who still believe in fake stuff at this age only do so because no one ever stopped and told them that they're wrong. It's really not their fault, no matter how much I'd like to blame them for it. \n\nBecause I'm a good person who wants to make humanity a better place, I think about ways to improve society a lot. That is why this next idea came easy for me: I'm going to tell the kids in the grades below me that Harry Potter isn't real.\n\nI know what you're thinking: tell them that Santa Claus isn't real or something that will make it so they don't grow up spoiled blah blah blah. But guess what? Most kids are smarter than you give them credit for, they already know Santa isn't real. Most parents are dumber than you give them credit for, which is why we have generation after generation who think Harry Potter is real, courtesy of Mommy and Daddy story hour.\n\nWith all of this being said, here's where the potential a$$h013 part comes in, according to some people I told about it. I asked to go to the bathroom but I actually went all the way to the lunch room, opened the door, and yelled word for word, \"HARRY POTTER IS NOT REAL, I REPEAT, HARRY POTTER IS NOT REAL. YOU'VE BEEN LIED TO BY JK ROWLAN, YOUR PARENTS, TEACHERS, CLASSMATES, LIBRARIANS, EVERYBODY. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO START THINKING FOR YOURSELF NOW THAT YOU HAVE THIS INFORMATION.\" I wanted to start listing science books that they should read instead but one of the teachers monitoring the lunch room put his hands on my shoulders and walked me into the hallway. He didn't call me an a$$h013 but he might as well have because he called my mom and she was really mad even after I explained to her that I was trying to do a good thing.\n\nPersonally I don't regret my decision at all, but what do you guys think?",

I'm an older teenager, and I honestly think she's like.. 12.\n\nI absolutely remember being 12, I remember how cringey I was and really regret it but what can you do. This girl is very 12... You know, young enough to pretend she's an animal but old enough to have big words to describe it. She growls at people, hisses and like.. does this Batman voice to sound intimidating, and is also a theatre kid so it naturally eccentric.\n\nShe's not a bad kid at all. Just a little... Young and unaware of how awkward she is. But I wouldn't call her a  friend of mine. Just an acquaintance. I gave my phone number to someone in cedar so they could help me with one of the dances. This girl, for times sake, I'll call her M talk to this friend who got my number, and asked that friend for my number. Said friend did not even ask my permission. Said friend just gave it to her. I got a text from M, and it said \n\n'hey I got your phone number from so-and-so, it's M!' \n\nAnd I was a little pissed that so-and-so didn't ask if they could give M my number, but I wasn't about to tell her off. She's not a bad kid by any means.\n\nBut she's one of those kids who is really social, I am not, even texting kind of drains me. But being a gen z kid, of course I have awful anxiety. I can't really do phonecalls outside of family. But this girl constantly asks for phonecalls and stuff at nearly absurd hours of the night. (Usually around 7:30) and I called her twice and have made it clear \"I'm not big into phone calls\". She'll text me for or five times in a row and text me random shit to get my attention until I respond. I think she eventually learned 'i may or may not be at my phone all the time, But even if I am I don't respond immediately I'm sending me many texts at a time isn't going to make that happen faster.' eventually she would wait it out. And bring up topics I wasn't too interested. And I really tried to stay invested. I really did. But we just weren't into the same things and it was hard to tell her that I really just wasn't all that interested in conversation.\n\nShe was usually really good about asking before calling me, but this afternoon is the fourth time in a row she's done it without asking first. I've justified it as 'I can't be considered and emergency contact in any case. There's no way' and things like that, but I got sick and tired of it and just blocked her number...\n\nI feel bad, she's sweet, she's young and naive and insanely talented in theatre don't get me wrong... But I don't feel like I was entirely in the right. I just really want an outside opinion on this...\n\nAITAH for blocking her?",

English is not my first language!\n\nMy best friend [M/18]\nTwo years ago his mother died + he has messed up relationship with his father\n(Important for the story later) \n\nA few months ago my best friend said he thought about adopting a dog from an animal shelter. \nI love dogs. Given the fact that my best friend lives about 5 minutes away from me I was going nuts about the idea and offered him my help with any problems that might occur. \nI was making it clear from the start that this would be his dog and I was only there if he needed help.\nThe dog he wanted to adopt lived in an animal shelter relatively far away. It was an 2 hour drive and given the fact that we both don't have an own car it was a real hassle to visit the dog (Lucky). \n\nWe proceeded to visit the dog over a span of 3 month. Then a few weeks ago he had the opportunity to take the dog home.\nHe got all the things you need for a dog. \nI got time off work and we drove there to get the dog.\n\nThe next day I was planning to do some shopping with a good friend of mine. I was convinced that my friend and Lucky would proceed to get to know each other. \nOr so I thought. My best friend had other plans he left his newly adopted dog ALONE at his apartment to go shopping with us.\n\nThat was my first no go. The second no go came shortly after. At approximately 10 pm he texted me:\n\"I have the feeling I can not handle this situation and I think the dog  probably doesn't like it here as well. And I can't leave him alone that long.”\n\nThe next day he texted me that he wants to bring the dog back to shelter. \nI was furious.\nHe had more than 3 month to think about his decision to adopt a dog. Family and friends were all asking if he can handle it and he always was really self-confident that he can handle everything. \n\nFirst I thought he was joking but he indeed send the dog back to the shelter. \nNow I'm questioning what he expected when he tried to adopt a dog.That he didn't need to invest a lot of time and money into the dog? \nFor me in this situation he was like a brat that wanted a puppy for Christmas and then abandoned it the moment they notice how much work a dog can be. \n\nAfter my text he noticed how angry I was and send me a voice message crying about the situation with his family and he doesn't want our friendship to suffer because of this. \nInstead of thinking about Lucky he immediately started to do damage control so he can proceed with his everyday life. \nAfter two weeks of no contact he then texted me asking if I wanted to go out watch a movie. He just ignored everything that just had happened.  \n\nAITA for not moving on that easily and ignoring his invites to go out? Should I be more understanding and apologize for ignoring him? \nHe is one of my best friends but in the last time I notice more and more things that I can't stand about him. ",

Then she told me that she started talking with a programmer (i'm one too), and coincidentally i had matched with him too, but havent started a conversation. \n\nAnnie was apparently very happy to hear that, she told me that all the time they were talking, she was thinking that he would be a good match for me, then proceed to say that i was perfect for him, that i should talk to him, that he was nice and all.\nAfter hours of her insistence (I did not wanted to talk to him after she and he had talked and done well.) I talked to him, now full of expectations to finally talk to someone nice.\n\n\nThe next day, Annie tells me that she was going out with him, but just as friends. Me and her had booked to meet later, and when I went to meet her, they were making out. Next day she went to sleep in his home and fucked him. She told me that she does not intend to have a relationship with him, since she is already in one (despite having told him that she was single).\nI have no intention of going out with someone my friend has dated, first because i dont feel confortable and i dont wanna to make things strange, and second because she has one very contagious STD.\n\nI was really annoyed that she had created me expectations and then decided to go out with him, without any kind of warning. I had no intention of talking to him, but she pressed me so much that I decided to take a chance, only to later she go to fuck him. I dont understand why she did It, and i dont feel confortable talking about that with her.\nI just wanted to feel happy for her, because she is having fun and feeling beautiful again, after the hard relationship that she is in, but i cant because i'm feeling betrayed, and i'm feeling very bad about that.

He told me he was really busy and that it would help him if I came downstairs to pick it up. I did not want to leave my apartment so I essentially told him “I can come down and get the pizza but I’m not gonna tip/only tip a dollar or you can bring it up and I’ll give you 5$.” \n\nI have a bit of an asshole personality but I was kinda just bantering with the guy and instantly said what popped in my head. The guy decided to walk up and get the extra 4$. I didn’t think much of this exchange til I mentioned to my buddy (who I live with) and his gf. They thought I was an asshole. I’m kinda on the fence, I can see why someone would think I was a dick but I feel like if anything the delivery guy should have never put me in that situation lol. Thoughts?",

      "description": "Posting from a throwaway since the cousin in question here is on reddit. \n\nI'll have to do some backstory but don't worry I will try to keep it short. I had a Great Uncle (grandpa's brother) who was essentially the \"cool\" patriarch of our family. We called him Tio. Everyone in the family adored him since he rode motorcycles, surfed until he died (he was 65) and dated college girls and strippers. But he was also beyond generous with both his time and money. He never had a family of his own but I cannot stress enough that he was the core of the family that everyone loved. \n\nSo he was tragically killed in a motorcycle crash back in the fall. It was literally standing room only at his funeral with his family, military, surfing and motorcycle friends. He was probably closest to my cousin so at the funeral and wake my cousin was telling everyone  he'd like to do a roadside memorial at the spot of my uncle's crash and he'd like to take donations to help him along. I was pretty much like everyone else and I think we all agreed (but it was very much in the heat of the moment of mourning if that makes sense).\n\nSo fast forward to the end of January, my cousin's roadside memorial has morphed into a project that has cost him about $20,000. He's had to get permits from the county which have to be reapplied for every 3 or 4 years because it takes up a bit of the right-of-way. As part of this, my cousin is currently fighting with the DA to get my uncle's motorcycle returned so he can chop it up and make the memorial out of it. He's taken welding classes, rented workshop space and bought crazy amount of materials in addition to trying to get the crashed motorcycle back. In addition to all of this, he wants everyone in the family to commit to one Saturday every other month (meaning someone will show up every Saturday) to clean trash and polish the memorial. \n\n\nI know he was close with my uncle but I think when all of us agreed to this, we were thinking it might be a like a cross or part of Tio's surfboard that was going to be at my cousin's house. Not a $20,000 roadside memorial on one of the busiest highways on the way to the beach. \n\nMy cousin just fired out an angry email basically saying that the 11 of us who outright agreed need to \"pony up immediately\" and the rest of the family who sort of agreed need to search their soul and find the strength to do the right thing to honor Tio. That means my part in this is almost $2000 dollars. I would have to go into credit card debt for it. And there's nothing saying the cost won't keep going up. \n\n\nWhy I might be an asshole: I absolutely agreed to this, as did most everyone in the family. It is on me for not asking for details about how big and elaborate this memorial was going to get. My uncle was a great guy in his life and we as a family should honor his memory. \n\n\nWhy I might not be the asshole: my cousin should have told us what he had in mind as we agreed to help him with the memorial. It's not fair for me to pay for his welding classes and shop space and it's absolutely not fair that the cost of this project keeps going up and up and that I'm expected to commit my time (I guess forever?) to maintain a memorial I had no hand in choosing where it would go, what it would be and how long it would last. \n\n\nSo with this backstory and those two options; am I the asshole?\n",

She works from home.\n\nI have implored through our 10 years together that she needs to get her DL. This is something she hasnt gotten because of fear or dying in a fiery crash ( she has never been in a crash. With me or with her previous partner)\n\nFor the first 6 years of our relationship we could barely afford 1 car much less 2. So i never really pushed for her to have a drivers license , just mentioned it occasionally.\n\nFor the last 2 years ive noticed the increasing need of her needing it. I commute 400 miles a week for work and usually have to run errands when i get home or on the weekend. \n\nRecently I hurt my back and even admist the injury where i could not walk. I had to drive for groceries and or D.r. appointments hers and my children. \n\nThis time has really made me angry and bitter really at the fact that she refuses to be more independent. And its sadly making me notice a lot of other things, like how she won't do basic adulting and relies on me a lot for it. I guess its my fualt though because i used to like being the go to person but this situation is making me realize that she is really dependent on me.\n\nEvery time i bring up the conversation i am met with the notion that maybe we are not good for each other. I know such a dramatic response is charged by the past. Where she feels guilty for secretly racking up $20k in credit card debt. And me being constantly stressed about getting out of that hole. And maybe being pissed about it too frequently.\n\n\nLong story to say...... AITA for being pissed as fuck for her not taking the exam. And bringing it up frequently",

      "description": "So a little before I start, this is going to be quite a short one (sorry). The post only got ten likes before it was deleted, and mom just shrugged me off. Btw, a kigurumi is an oversized onesie that almost always resembles some kind of animal. \n\nSidenote: yelling=talking harshly\n\nI recently got a kigurumi for Christmas from my mom and only got around to wear it about a week ago, mom found it quite amusing and I posed for several pictures. She then said \"this is going on Facebook!\" or something like that, i immediately objected with a: \"no, no, nope, you're not doing that\", basically begging her not to do it.\nShe is, let's just say, mildly stubborn, so of course she posted it anyways. I don't usually go on Facebook so I had no idea until today when my mom said \"look! You've got ten likes on this!\", i began at once to basically yell at her for going against my wishes and invading my privacy (or something like that).\n\nShe did end up deleting the picture after I yelled at her to never do that again.\nI don't know if I overreacted or if my mom was in the wrong,or both, AITA?

      "description": "  \n\nHello, before I start my story, I just want to point out that I’m Danish, so English isn’t my first language so I’m sorry for any grammar mistakes, also this is a long story, TL-DR in bottom, thank you. \n\nThis happened some time ago, but I’ve had a bad feeling about it ever since.\n\n**People involved:** (all names have been altered) \n\n**Fray:** My ex. She’s blond, kind of short and good looking, she’s a bit nerdy and the type to say sorry to a fly after she squashed it she has the “cute girl next door” look.\n\n**Mark:** My friend. He’s tall has dark hair and glasses, he’s very funny a bit dorky but one of my very best friends. He’s a country boy and usually dresses more practically then anything else.\n\n**Michael:** Me. I’m blond, average height, pretty good looking (if I do say so myself) though rather skinny and usually wear a dress shirt and some nice pants.\n\n**Background:** \n\nFrey, Mark and I all started in the same class some years ago. Mark and I quickly became friends as we have the same kind of humour. The first time I talked to Fray was in German, we had to work in groups, Fray and I were paired. a bit later we got to catch up at a preparty and ended op kissing at most of the night at the party the day after I really didn’t know what to text her as I had only been in one previous relationship, while I was pondering she ended up texting me a bit later we ended up discussing what we actually where, after being asked by almost all of the school, we came to the conclusion that she would like to be my girlfriend and I would very much like to be her boyfriend. \n\nJust before we began in school my little sister was diagnosed with cancer and she was in the hospital for over 9 months only coming home a handful of times. It really took a toll on me and I got kind of depressed thought I did my best to hide it from everyone, I hate talking about my problems and didn’t want to make it even harder for my parents or my little brother if they also had to worry about me. Fray was exactly what I needed, finally something good happens to me. I don’t know if it really played a role, but I thought I would include it just in case.\n\nThe relationship for the next long time went great, she loved me, and I loved her more then anything, until she ended it. I followed her to her bus almost every day (a 20-minute walk) there we could talk, complain about school, hold hands and I could get a goodbye kiss. One day she wouldn’t hold my hand, she kept her hands in her pockets, I didn’t think anything of it as it was cold. The day after that again she wouldn’t hold my hand and I could the something was bothering her, but she wouldn’t tell me what, when her bus came, I said “goodbye, I love you” as I always did, her response? “mmhhmm” this broke my heart, it wasn’t a big deal but damnit that hurt. The day after our school held a large party (the same kind that we hooked up at) and I hosted a preparty at my house for the class, she would avoid me the whole day I just drank some more and tried to have fun. When we got home to me after the party and went to bed, she would lie almost over the edge of the bed aka. As far away from me as possible. By this time, I had begun to see what was coming and just wishing she would just rip the bandage off and get it over with instead of this torture. The next morning, she said we had to talk and she broke up, she began crying so I did my best to comfort her while dying inside I send her on her way home and just sat thinking why she broke up, she never gave me a reason, so I felt I was something I had done or said but I couldn’t think of anything. I had difficulty sleeping as I felt guilty because of whatever I had done, and it didn’t help that I had to see her every day in school. Just to say the breakup was very hard on me, I still loved her, but I knew she didn’t feel the same way anymore.\n\nTime went and I started getting over her. After a rather large party I hosted an after party for a small group of friends, Mark asks me if its okay he invites Fray, I couldn’t see a reason she shouldn’t be aloud to come so of course I say she could. Half an hour after she arrived her and Mark were not to be found anywhere, I had just emptied my last beer, so I headed down to my room to fetch my Gin for a Gin n’ Tonic. Then I open my door the first thing I see is Fray and Mark in my bed, they weren’t doing anything just lying side by side talking, I didn’t know what to do so I just said hey got my liquor and went op to the others. I know I wasn’t a lot, but it really got to me seeing my ex, with my best friend, in my bed, the same bed I used to be with her in. some days later another good friend told me he saw it too and asked what I thought about it.\n\nI noticed them beginning to talk each other more and more I school, I even felt happy for them both. \n\n**Now to the reason I write this in the first place.**\n\nsome time ago I got invited to a small house party by one of the girls in the class, she lives in the country and I in the middle of the city so it was a good bit away so I arrange with my mother that she would drive me home when I called, she was happy to do so but of course it would take some time. All the girls invited arrived a couple of hours before so they would have some girl time before the guys came, but as the only dude Mark was also invited to come early, I thought it was strange but maybe transport would be easier if he came early. When I arrive, I was greeted by everyone with a hug, apart from Mark and Frey as Fray had leached on to Marks arm, I give him a handshake and a pad on the shoulder. The party went smoothly and it was fun to let loose, talk and play drinking games with all the others. Most of the party leave early and take a taxi to the dance club, I can barely eat with a fork let alone dancing especially drunk, so I thought Id stay a bit see what happens and maybe call my mother soon. We ended up being only Mark, Fray, the girl who hosted the party and me. We sat in the sofa watching Die hard and eating leftover pizza from earlier and let me tell you Mark and Fray did not watch any of the movie, they were cuddled up exactly the way we always used to when “watching movies” aka. Making out. This really fucking hurt! I called my mom and she came after like half an hour.\n\nIt might not true seeing I was drunk, but I swear se glanced at me all the time, I tried to ignore it as I didn’t want to course any drama.\n\nThe day after I text Mark something like “Hey, listen I don’t get to say who you can and can not be in a relationship with, but you have to see this from my angle and understand it isn’t easy seeing my ex being together with my best friend. If you really like each other of course you should be allowed to, but damn it hurt watching you and Fray yesterday lying exactly as we used to. I think you deserve to know how I feel and I hope you respect me enough to have this in the back of the head when I am near” he said he was happy I texted him and of course he would.\n\nSince this they slowly stopped talking as much as they did before, I don’t know If I really did end their relationship before it started, however I feel like shit knowing it’s a possibility, so I must ask am I the asshole in this situation? \n\n**TL-DR:**\n\nMy long-term girlfriend broke up with me and quickly after start baking on my friend, so I text him that it hurts seeing them together. Since I did, they haven’t talked as much, AITA?",

And afterwards have it thrown in my face by her.\n\n I havent seen or spoke to her in over 5 years, and even cut off a few other relatives to get away from this toxic relationship.\n\nThese past few months she had a pregnancy that ended in a still born (probably related to her drug use/abusive rship), and has been in and out of the psych ward right after. Since then she has been trying to call me, and asked to stop by my house, which i refuse. My family treats and tells me how horrible i am for refusing to be in contact with her, that it'd be good for her mentally after what shes been through. I feel that she should get back in contact with her friends that she talked crap about me with for support (supposedly they all dropped her), we never cliqued and im not going to be fake.\n\nAITA?\n",

This is due to his serious alcohol problem he developed over the last 10 years. \n\nHe is now in an artificial coma and the doctors say that his survival chance is 50/50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow obviously we are all concerned and visit him everyday. Today his sister came to visit and stay with us. (she lives about 4 hours away and the one living the closest to us.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis side of the family is very religious and they do not accept alcohol in their culture. No member of his family knows about his problems as it would create useless tension because they all still live in his homecountry which is about 3000km away from us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother,sister and i initially agreed not to say anything to them about his alcohol abuse but the thing is that his consumption is the cause of his current state.\n\nI don't feel comfortable just telling them that there is no reason for his liver failure and that it just happened. On the other hand, i don't see the sense in basically trashing a possibly dying person. If he passes i want them to remember them in the best way possible even if it means that they don't know the truth. They are his family and deserve to know the truth but it would probably do more harm than good.\n\nWhen he survives his whole family would know about his issue and i don't know how they'd react.\n\nI wanna add that he had phases in which he was very abusive to us but he really tried changing. If we told them about his alcohol consumption this probably would come up as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nINFO: Since they don't speak my native language, we also have to translate what the doctors say so i basically lie in their face. \n\nSo Reddit,WIBTA if i didn't tell the real reason why he is in a coma and just told them that it happened?",

      "description": "I feel like a bit of a shallow asshole, but physical attraction and intimacy feels like something I need to have in a relationship, and I know sex is also very important for them. They are quite significantly overweight - not quite morbidly obese, but well into obese.  There are a few complicating factors.  \n\nThe first problem comes from the fact that they are probably the best friend I have ever had, and we get along very well. The fact that we are so close is the main reason I'm asking - I want to do everything I can to avoid hurting them, because they don't deserve it.  \n\nSecondly, their weight is a sensitive issue. They have taken steps to try to lose it, but it does not seem like they really commit to following through - losing a handful of pounds, then quitting on diet or workout plans. I have tried to offer my help alongside those things, including going to the gym together, but those plans tend to fall through as well.  \n\nThe third, and probably hardest part, is the fact that we have been physically intimate in the past. A large part of that came from the fact that I had recently existed a relationship wherein I fell out of love with someone, but found difficulty leaving them due to their mental and physical health problems, so we had not been intimate for a long time. After leaving that relationship, I met this friend very soon afterwards, and I was desperate for intimacy but too depressed to seek it out, so things just sort of happened. I realized quickly that I wasn't attracted to obese people, but again, I was in a terrible mental place where I just wanted to feel good. He was in a similar place, only half-jokingly mentioning \"using me\" to feel better about themselves.  We did our thing for a few months, but eventually it just sort of faded away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has gotten a lot longer than I expected, but to sum it up they have recently been pressuring me about pursuing a relationship, and why I am not willing to despite how well we get on. The truth is that their weight is unattractive, but if I told them that I feel it would hurt them a great deal, but if I told them something else it would be a lie. Obviously, telling them \"I will date you if you lose weight\" is shitty and manipulative - but is telling them the truth about why I do not want to the same thing? I want to do everything I can to avoid hurting them, but it seems like the only option is dishonesty. Thanks for the perspective. ",

      "description": "AITA for not forgiving my mother and my brother?\nI have really bad trust issues and my brother and my mother have broken them. I love everyone in my family but it's hard for me to just forgive people when they just hurt me emotionally repeatedly. \n\nMy brother is 5 years older than me but for the first 11 years of my life he would hit me. I don't hate him for it though. My older brother was hit by my father but when I was born my dad had hit me a few times and realized that what he was doing was so fucked up so he stopped. But I never stopped getting beat. My brother would hit me out of anger and jealousy. He hated the fact that I didn't have as many responsibilities as he did and the fact I didn't have as many beatings as he did when he was my age. When my brother got into high school he stopped hitting me. We talked about this and he tells me how much he regrets what he did to me. I 100% know that but I can't bring my self to forgive him. I can still talk to him laugh and play videogames with him but I can't forgive him for what he did. My older brother is almost a best friend to me.\n\nI am not really and expressive person when it comes to showing love. My mother will repeatedly tell my brother and I of how much we don't love her. As a child my mother was like a person I could go to and feel safe at home. But every time she would tell my brother and I this we would both feel so sad. No matter what we do we can't get through my mothers head that we love her. One time my mother had said that to both my brother and I. After a few hours my mother when to the store to make food to get away from us. We were both In our rooms and stayed their. I hated feeling sad so I needed to hear something that I can cope with. I watched comedians on YouTube and after a while I started to forget and feel happy. My mother came home and suddenly ran into my room and started yelling at me for no reason. My happiness soon turned into sadness again and I started crying. She left me for a while but came back and started to again at me. My brother this time started yelling at her. One thing I won't forget was when she said that yelling at me made her feel better. I can't hate my mother but I can't forgive her.\n\nI want to know if AITA not to forgive them I love them both but it's not something I can forget nor forgive. \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my BFs brother to be part of his life?",
      "description": "BF (24M) and I (25M) have been together a little over three years now and have known each other for around 5. For all of that time I have known that BF has an older brother who is now 32 but until around nine months ago,  I hadn't met the guy. He was estranged from the family because he'd done some really shitty things to them while in the throes of heroin addiction, including stealing a significant sum of money from their grandmother and physically attacking their mother while intoxicated, leaving her needing stitches and with a permanent scar. Shortly after the latter incident, around ten years ago, he moved to the other side of the country with his dealer/girlfriend and cut ties completely. \n\nNine months ago he moved back and started trying to rebuild his relationship with his family. Initially I actually encouraged my boyfriend to at least give his brother a chance. I'm an ex heroin addict myself so I know how drugs can make you fuckin insane and I know how important it can be to re establish bonds with people you love while in recovery. I'll note I never did anything quite as screwed up as he did while I was in the thick of it, but I figured every case is different and recovery has taught me that everyone deserves a second chance. \n\nTurns out that I was wrong in this case. Although he insists that he's completely clean from all substances (I'm doubtful but have no proof), the brother is still, in my opinion, a complete piece of shit. He has some prior convictions - including the assault on his mother - that make it hard for him to find steady work but he refuses to claim JSA because he thinks it's beneath him. As a result he's constantly pestering my boyfriend for money and will through a tantrum if he's told no. BF works for minimum wage in a restaurant and is currently on part time hours as he's recovering from a sports injury. He hasn't got heaps of money to spare. However, if he doesn't give his brother money when he asks for it, brother goes on tirades, telling him he's selfish and an asshole and asking why he doesn't care about his own flesh and blood etc. He's the same way about getting rides places too, even though bf has been instructed to limit his driving as much as possible until his injured foot is fully healed. \n\nBrother has also once again destroyed his relationship with their parents and their sisters by being a generally manipulative manchild. I've reached a place where I think brother has worn out the second chance he was given, and I believe my boyfriend should cut ties with him again. BF is an immensely sweet guy and he hates to see anyone hurt, even if it means he gets hurt himself, and is having a difficult time letting his brother go. Brother himself caught wind of the fact that I want him out of BFs life and sent me some really pretty nasty messages about it, mostly insulting my appearance, throwing homophobic slurs and implying that as I'm also a former addict and have mental health issues which cause occasional bouts of intense paranoia and trust issues, that I'm the same as him. I'd like to think he's wrong because I'm dealing with my illnesses using medication and therapy, but he maybe does have a point. I'll also point out that he effectively ruined my boyfriend's Christmas with one of his tantrums and in the message he asked why I even care about Christmas since I'm a \"fucking kike\". My boyfriend confronted him about the messages and he apologised for all but the last thing, so that's the kind of dude we're dealing with. He's really starting to cause tension in our relationship and I want him gone but bf keeps insisting that he can't turn his back on family and that he wants to give his brother a chance to better himself. Am I the asshole for thinking he doesn't deserve it? ",

I understand high school relationships don't usually become lifetime commitments but I really want this to work.\n   So when I mentioned this to my mother, who I absolutely adore, my dad was eavesdropping and laughed aloud. We both turned and he said that a girl like her, he had met my gf, wouldn't marry someone like me. I got mad and told him that he was just doing that to piss me off. This instantly made him mad and he stomped upstairs. \n   This happened about 6 months ago, and I still haven't forgotten it. I have been thinking of cutting ties after college, but the more I think of it, the more I feel like it is an a-hole move. My friend told me I should post my dilemma here, so I have.

      "description": "Hi, I’m having some trouble and I just want an opinion because I’m being told things from both sides of this situation. Firstly I would like to mention I am not trying to be insensitive or hurtful or troll anyone, im just a young guy who is trying to figure out if I’m being a major asshole or not. \n\nSo, I was browsing reddit and I saw a meme of pewdiepie that said “Nazi Queen” in relation to the recurring meme in his fan base about his girlfriend being the “queen”. And I thought it was funny, because people are always calling him out for being a nazi and making his actions (like promoting a small channel that he didn’t know had some racism in a few videos, since pewdiepie only recommended him off of a few videos) out to be way more extreme than they were. And I was sitting in my living room, and my older cousin said that was really offensive and I shouldn’t think that kind of stuff is funny.\nSo, in my group of friends for my entire life, we’ve always kind of made jokes about things that would be considered offensive, but none of us actually believe in the real ideas. Like, we’re making fun of people who really ARE crazy and racist and homophobic and stuff. Like we laugh at these jokes, but if one of us said anything about any race being lesser or something the rest of us would call them out. Like we were talking about the current issue with the US border and the migrants, and one guy made a joke about how they were stealing our jobs but it didn’t come across right at first and then the rest of us were like “dude wtf?” Idk, I’ve always assumed this wasn’t that bad because it seems like none of us genuinely believe this stuff. \n\nBut then my cousin mentioned that these kinds of jokes can hurt people, and I was just like, oh shit.. It doesn’t sound like that could really happen, but I may be wrong and I just want to be able to know if I should stop. Because I also think free speech is important, but like, I just really don’t know. Please don’t yell at me, I’m genuinely wondering if this is an asshole thing to do and if so, could you explain it to make me understand? If this really is something bigger, I already see a therapist and I might bring it up to her to try to like keep myself from doing stuff like this. But all of my other friends (I mentioned it in my group chat) said that that was stupid, and they don’t disrespect any sort of minorities. I just don’t know what to do!\n\nAlso I’m so sorry this is so long and probably sounds crazy, I am sort of just freaked out because i don’t want to be an asshole!! ",

      "description": "So this happened yesterday, and I'm feeling crappy ever since.I'm from the Caribbean,we're celebrating \"El carnaval\".Last night was my sisters dancing contest. My cousin and I arrived pretty early to save us some seats, (contest was supposed to start at 8pm we arrived a little before 6).We got a row of seats (8 seats) and so it started, we knew people would come to try to seat but at this point (6.20sh) there weren't any seats left available, we sat there and tried to hold on to the chairs as long as we could but of course it wasn't going to last. Well, let's forward to 9pm, a bunch of people broke into where we were seating (the contest took place in a public plaza) and they were of course blocking the view, it was pretty unfair but I mean what could you do? It was the monitory,we the ones that got chairs, vs everyone else. I figured I'd just step on a chair when my sister danced. Around 9.30sh started to get extremely crowded and seated people started yelling to the ones standing to please move or just seat on the ground so we could see the stage. My Dad got really pissed and started yelling to people in front of him, one of them say something back and there's when it started..yelling back and forth for around 2 min and then Dad gets up and grabs man by the shoulder(I have never seen Dad reacts like this) as soon as I see him tapping the mans shoulder I immediately run and get in the middle of them to push Dad, he couldn't care less, he ended up pushing me back and stuff got nasty, tried to calm him down and sit him but I couldn't, then my Mom got into it too and suddenly I was pushing both them back,Dad started yelling at me to move the fuck out(that's the kind of stuff you never expect your dad to yell to u in PUBLIC)he tried 4 times to get up to fight the guy but every single time I pushed him away, then a random guy (finally some help!) got in the middle and helped me separate 'em. I asked Dad to please seat on my chair so he stays away from the other guy, but he again asked me to shut the fuck off, at this point Mom did nothing( thanks mom! Such great help), I was so frustrated,Dad wasn't listening so I grabbed him by the face and laid eyes on him expecting him to chill but he just pushed me away and again asked to move the fuck off.. once both seat back I grabbed my stuff and went for a walk to calm down., turned off my phone, watched my sister from the distance (her boyfriend was with me). I was so frustrated,I felt so alone, unprotected, Dad apologized, but I don't want to see neither of my parents. WITA for leaving them and walking out of the situation? Should I have stayed? Am I being too dramatic?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 27, W, trying to suck it up and be an adult but somehow I'm still angry.",

      "description": "I’m 19 years old going on 20 in a few months. I still live with my parents because I attend community college in my hometown. I’ll be transferring and going to college a couple of hours away in the fall. \n\nI’ve started going to therapy after I asked my parents if they would let me go (aka let me use their insurance and be okay with me going) to help me with my anxiety. I have social anxiety disorder as well as some generalized anxiety. I’ve struggled with my mental health for what I think has been pretty much my whole life, or at least as long as I can remember, but within the last couple of years I’ve become way more cognizant of it and it’s been bothering me a lot more and interfering with my daily/weekly life. So I asked to go. \n\nMy mom went with me to my first appointment. I told her it was fine if she came with me to see the office or meet the psychologist at the end of my appointment but that she wouldn’t be able to sit in with me because that’s not allowed (and also I didn’t really want to her to, but I didn’t tell her that. I didn’t want to hurt her feelings). She tried to sit in my appointment anyway and my psychologist very nicely said she couldn’t basically and that she would talk to her at the end of the session. \n\nI learned that my mom told my psychologist stuff at the end of the session that just blatantly isn’t true and isn’t really relevant to treating my anxiety. I know she was just trying to help and is just worried about me as a mother, but it frustrated me. I told her I could go to therapy by myself from now on, which I was planning on doing anyway since I’m 19 years old. \n\nI went to another appointment recently and she tried to ask me details about it as soon as I got home. I wasn’t really in the mood for talking about it so I told her that sometimes I wasn’t going to tell her all the details about every appointment; that I was 19 and therapy is a personal thing, that it’s not like going to the doctor for the flu. She said that she had ‘been on this journey with me’ with I fully realize since she’s my mother and I don’t plan to leave her in the dark. But then she said that she pays for it, insinuating that since she pays for it I should tell her all that goes on, which really bothered me since I don’t think that entitles her to knowing intimate details about my sessions. Then she asked if I didn’t want to tell her because I was talking about her in therapy. I said no, because I’m not. I’m doing CBT, not talk therapy. Also even if I were, I don’t have much bad to say about my family. \n\nI felt bad about what I said earlier so I told her that it wasn’t that I didn’t want to talk to her about it, it was that I didn’t have much to say, which was partially true. Then I saw she had read the little stack of papers my therapist had given me without asking me, which annoyed me a little bit. I didn’t say anything but the principle of that is wrong imo. \n\nThen today I came home earlier than usual from college because I had stuff at home I needed to get done and she asked me why I hadn’t gone to a club meeting I usually go to. I told her why and she started berating me about not going and telling me that ‘it’s hard to feel sorry for me’. Basically saying it’s hard to feel sorry for me about my anxiety when I don’t go places like that. But I usually do. \n\nThat hurt my feelings and so I said that she can’t expect me to go into intimate details about my mental health when she says stuff like that, and that I don’t have to tell her anything especially when she says stuff like that. She stopped me from saying anything else. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\nTDLR: I’ve started going to therapy for anxiety disorders. Mom wants me to tell her lots of details about sessions and mental health but isn’t very compassionate or knowledgeable about it and I responded. \n\n\n",

We broke up so sharing a bed is weird. \n\nAfter the break up we became friends/best friends and decided to get a cat together, I keep it until I eventually leave the country as from my research I cant bring it back home and after her sister takes it. We decided to tell each other if the other person was dating and if there would be sex.\n\nI told her about my date she asked if she would stay over and I said yes. She then told me if she took my bed overnight she would take my cat and never let me see her again. I really love my cat but part of me feels if I give in now there would be more manipulation as well as the uncomfortableness of asking someone to leave but if I am the ass hole or not how can I remedy the situation. I also know this is a relationships issue but she views that subreddit. \n\nObviously this is written from my perspective so may be biased, as an ex she does a lot for me but she also can be manipulative and use me. \n\nTldr-if I let a date stay over I may lose my cat because I wouldn't let my ex stay over.

It wasn't long after his unbanning that he posted child gore, not a fictional drawing though, he posted an image of an actual child who was killed with a machete, and an old co-owner banned him on the spot, asking Fire not to unban Red. I asked Fire about it and they defended Red saying \"He has mental illnesses he doesn't see whats wrong with it,\" despite Red actively knowing what's good and bad. We would be talking about the age where you're a legal adult, mostly what you can do when you're 18, and he's constantly make remarks of illegally doing things such as smoking, stealing, and so on, remarking \"It's legal if no cops are around!\" He also asks the dumbest questions, \"Is it animal abuse if I backhand my cat?\" You'd say \"Yes\" because it's harmful to the cat, he'd answer \"No it isn't.\" He purposefully tries to rile people up with controversial topics such as demanding to let him(17) into the NSFW Room, defending terrorism, breaking laws, even racism despite just about everyone telling him to stop it. I would tell Fire that we should ban Red because of his behavior, and Fire would still argue that he's autistic so he should get a Get Out of Jail card. (Red still purposefully misgenders me..) Red only brings up his Autism if he gets banned and that's it.\n\nWould I be the A-hole if I want this guy perma-banned from the server?\n\nIn Case Anyone Asks: I recently turned 18, most people in the server are 18. Red is 17. We restricted his access across a lot of rooms on the server for spamming images that didn't belong.",

We will call her NF (for new friend). We click and within a few months OF tells NF about her mom and NF tells us about some issues she has with her dad. Apparently the same day NF calls OF with her dad to talk about her mom issues which OF told her to tell no one about. \n\n OF is upset and rants to me about it. I am still friends with NF but OF and NF don't talk much even though we still sit together at lunch. I want to invite NF to my birthday party in two weeks but I know OF will get upset with me. This happened before where I invited NF to hangout with my 4 year friend group to go to a halloween party. OF yelled at me like crazy and called me an asshole and almost didnt go to the party with us (she still went but she didnt hang out with any of our friend group and just ate candy the whole time and took my younger brother tick or treating). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA inviting NF to my birthday party like I was the (supposed) asshole for inviting NF to the halloween party?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I’ve been a part of a small group of friends for a couple years now, but I feel as though we aren’t as equal anymore.\n\nThere are 3 of us and we all share an undying passion for art. I usually refrain for caring much about others’ artwork unless I’m critiquing something as I feel that indulging other’s art can be harmful on feeling of self-worth and motivation, but because these are my friends, I give input on them a lot. Recently, I’ve been shown some incredible stuff from both of them -I still manage to give input on proportions or design choices, but it gets tougher and tougher each time. I’m happy for them as I know they are very passionate about what they do, but there’s this underlying feeling of frustration and fear.\n\nI’m not frustrated at my friends, more so at myself for not improving as much as them or as quick. Both of them improve immensely as I’m left in their dust- hitting an invisible wall that they’ve crossed, but I can’t. I’ve contacted one friend about the situation I’m in and she says that there’s nothing wrong with what I’m feeling and that my thoughts are valid, but I’m still indifferent on her conclusion. \n\nFor this one in particular, the title would be more fitting as “Am I *an* asshole” instead of “Am I *the* asshole”.\n\nI’m happy to clear anything up if needed.\n",

      "description": "My roommate (24 M) and I (23 F) have known each other for a while and ran in the same social circle in college. We're both pretty quiet and laid back, which worked out really well since I work full time now and he just started grad school this past year.\n\nThe walls are incredibly thin in our apartment and our rooms share walls, which means that I can hear just about anything that happens anywhere in the apartment. I go to sleep around 10:30-11PM, and noise hasn't been a huge issue before. He's been pretty great about the couple issues I brought up in the past, and I've tried to be pretty accommodating with other stuff that's come up on his end as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy issue is:\n\nHe recently got a new girlfriend who's been staying over every night now for three weeks straight. Originally he asked if I would mind if she stayed over a few times a week, which I didn't--and honestly, she's super nice and it's not like she's that intrusive or anything either.\n\nIt's just that since the walls are so thin, anything above a normal speaking volume sounds like it's happening right outside of my door. They'll do dishes and laundry at 11:30-12 at night, be in and out of the room opening and closing doors, and speak pretty loudly. \n\nI don't know if I'm justified if I ask for them to be quiet past 11PM on weeknights. Especially with the speaking volume, it's not like they're constantly yelling, it's more like I'll hear intermittent loud exclamations (like, \"Oh my god!\" etc.) or I'll hear their voice go from normal volume to passionate-about-whatever-they're-talking-about volume, but it's usually enough to wake me up or keep me from going to sleep. I ordered some ear plugs so I'm going to try that first regardless, but in case that fails I don't know how much falls on me to suck it up because it's not like it's his fault the walls are thin.\n\nI don't want him to feel like he can't live in his own apartment, but I also need to sleep during the week or else I'll 100% die at work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nI have an apartment with very thin walls, and my quiet roommate is less quiet with a new girlfriend who stays over every night. I go to bed at 11PM but I can hear them making noise (talking semi-loudly, doing dishes and laundry, opening and closing doors) sometimes until 1AM. \n\nCan I ask them to be quiet without making it seem like they need to walk on eggshells around me and my sleeping schedule? I don't want to be a dick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Lee and I met and immediately knew we were the right fit. We were both 22 and never had such a strong connection. After 8 months together and some trips across the world, he was offered a great job in a foreign country. I decided to follow him and find work there. He was terrified I would be deported if I don't find work. As a fail safe, we looked into ways I can stay with him on a companion visa. Marriage was the most obvious answer. Neither of us care about weddings and titles; his parents have been happily together for almost 30 years and never married, and I just never saw why it would matter. But I knew, even after only 8 months together, that I wanted to be with him the rest of my life, no matter what that might bring. We were on a short timeline as we were leaving the country soon, and didn't have the time to sort the logistics of including our families in this. We went to the county recorder's office on our lunch breaks and did the deed, and it was perfect. We couldn't bring ourselves to tell our families because of the drama it would cause.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe married, and are living very far from our families. Everyone here knows us as husband and wife, which we are enjoying. I found work. Both our jobs are very international and we are relieved that our marriage ensures us staying together is taken seriously no matter which culture we are in. Our parents still refer to us as boyfriend and girlfriend, which feels a little strange by this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've been married over 2 years and together almost 3. Lee's parents don't care at all about marriage, but my parents definitely do. They've been asking incessantly if he is going to propose. My mom is so excited for the wedding, is saying she has dreamed of my wedding since I was born. Originally I was counting on my little brother to fulfill her wedding dreams, but she now says it's \"not the same when it's your son. The wedding is about the bride.\" We are feeling guilty (we didn't think weddings mattered this much when we did this), but also so thankful because a wedding sounds horrible and stressful (we are very very introverted), and the benefits of being officially married are coming to us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe talked before about holding a \"fake\" wedding, but we would hate it so much and it's a waste of money. We could tell my parents but my mom might be more upset than we originally expected about \"not being invited to her daughter's wedding\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Yes we should not have eloped behind our parents' backs. But is it really as big of a deal as people make it out to be? Are we the assholes?**",

He made excuses at first but now nothing. I've not made a fuss but I've said I get worried cause something could've happened. As example one of the excuses is he got mugged.\nMost of the time is cause he's out with his mates and on a night out. I say it's fine, please just message me off your mates phone if yours is off so I know. Because it's not usually just an evening. It would be two days or more and they all have my number and know me well.\nWe're both pretty relaxed and have no rules or issues. The only thing he's said he didn't like me doing I stopped instantly. (Going out for whole nights with work people) and this is the only thing I've said really makes me sad. \nAITA for being pissed off cause he's not even understanding why I'm sad?",

When we were dating I was never on board (lol) with him buying a new board and it was a bit of a running joke, but those in his family he is close to are really against him skateboarding ever again.\n\nI just got home and noticed some packages were delivered from a skateboarding company, meaning he is moving forward on skateboarding again, I think. I know if I say something to him he’s going to be stubborn and annoyed and it won’t do anything. I also considered telling his family but that would make me feel shitty.\n\nHe’s going to do something stupid and land in the hospital and where we are at right now I will be the only one around to help him. Also, he’s 30. I know this sounds like a teenager. I have always supported his interests 100%, unless they are dangerous. He’s really stubborn and I don’t think he’s thought through this.\n\nI know I’m not responsible for him but also I don’t think he has a plan for if he ends up immobile.

The manager on duty is now asking me if we should report this (she is relatively new while I’m older and more experienced at the company and we have become friends) to the general manager and I said I thought it would be best as I felt it was pretty serious, but I also suggested that if she does report it to at least talk to the person to let her know she was reporting it, as previously she had told the high schooler she wasn’t going to.

About 5 minutes later she goes up to me asking if i'm ok and that I was being quiet I just asked why she would punch me in the gut she started getting a little teary eye'd and kept asking that I forgive her now ill admit that I was being stubborn when I told her I couldn't forgive her unless I knew why she had hit me but she just continued to say sorry and ask my forgiveness (maybe she didn't know why herself) when she didn't give me an answer I refused.\n\nShe then went off to a bench to sob to herself while my friend went to console her, said friend comes back a minute later asking me to forgive this girl and apologize myself telling me I might regret it if I don't (seemed a little passive aggressive to me) but my friends all said I shouldn't have to one of my closer friends even got a little angry and called the consoling friend a name which resulted in a very short fight where consoling guy hit my close friend and hurt his own hand. Everyone then parted ways and went home with consoling guy glaring at me while he walked the girl who punched me home.\n\nThis happened last week and I was wondering if I was the asshole here\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **TL;DR** Guy gets hit in stomach by girl and doesn't forgive her when she asks for forgiveness ",

      "description": "Edit: Sorry tripped the auto mod. Only mentioned past struggles, feeling good these days!\nThere's a girl (Sara) in my circle of friends that a couple months back spontaneously told me she had a crush on me.\n\nI was taken aback and didn't really sleep that night stressing out about what I was going to do. I like this girl but I barely knew anything about her and I hadn't thought about her romantically up until this point. I was stressed because I just moved across the country to live with my other friends in this same circle and they think this girl and I would be great together. I spend most of the morning and early afternoon agonizing about it. I can't help it. I was thinking about how it would change my life to jump into a new relationship and the dynamic I have with my house mates. It really blindsided me, I was really enjoying myself in this new town and working out again, eating better, trying to change careers. I'm an asshole for making her wait overnight+ a few hours for a text.\n\nMy ex fucked me up badly and I let myself fall into a deep slump of self-loathing etc. In retrospect the wrong call but I told Sara I wasn't trying to date anyone right now. And of course I know rejection hurts and I felt like an asshole just for rejecting her it sucks to be rejected, and maybe I'm just letting my anxiety/fear drive my decisions but I didn't feel ready.\n\nMy friend(Cathy) didn't understand my reaction at all. \"If a hot person came up to me like that and expressed interest I'd be all over them.\" Which I get and I am being too cautious/afraid of another relationship because of my last one(was almost 2 years ago now).\n\nAm I the asshole to expect that group of friends to still include me? I just found out I wasn't invited to a concert/weekend thing that the group is going to. My memory isn't the best but I thought we had all talked about going like I was included. But apparently only they bought tickets. I know rejection sucks and it's embarrassing to be around the person who rejected you for a while but it's been months now and I'm wondering if I'm an asshole for thinking we could still interact in a friend group? Not to mention (it's a small group) we are all going to Japan in May in a few months. I'm definitely invited to that, I was there when we bought tickets. But my other friends failed to mention to the girl that I was going to be coming on that trip the day before we met up to plan/buy tickets. I definitely tried too hard to play it off like nothing had happened the next few times we were all together. In her shoes I wouldn't have wanted me to be weird/ignore her. Should I have apologized again in person? I wouldn't have wanted me to bring it up again from her perspective. My friend that was/is upset with me keeps telling me it can't go back to how it was before and I get that I guess. But then why are we all going to Japan together?\n",

      "title": "AITA for being executor of my grandparent’s trust?",
      "description": "About a year ago, I was told by my grandmother that she has made me executor of their estate, during a family get together, she announced this after being pressured by a large portion of family. Since then, her children and step-children have all written me off (including my own mother). My grandfather has dementia and had dementia while the lawyer was writing the revised trust so it was mainly put together by my grandmother. They believe that because my grandfather has dementia that what is in the trust is not fair to them because none of them trust or like my grandmother. On top of this she has refused for years to answer their calls when they call to speak to their own father. They have always had a rough relationship and historically have been treated unfairly because they’re not biologically related to her (with the exception of my mother).\n\nI have gotten accused of riding the gravy train and remaining executor for the money as since no one else has a relationship with my grandmother.. I must be plotting with her. Although they don’t know what’s in the trust - I have seen it and it is very fair to them and I am not profiting more than anyone else. But they won’t believe me and per her lawyer’s advice my grandmother will not furnish the trust to her children so they can see. I do know that some cousins were written out of the trust while others were not, I was planning to stay as the executor so I could have a shot at making my grandfather’s wishes a reality and making this fair, rather than my grandmother’s wishes. The cousins who were cut out of the trust are also not biological to her, which seems like the reason why they were cut out as well.\n\nTrying to get to the bottom of this recently, I had several calls with family and they attacked the fact I don’t have a job (I have applied to over 150 jobs in the last year and I have the wrong degree for the area in which I live) and that I’m pretty much waiting until I get this “large inheritance”. They also accused me of not seeing him enough and since I don’t have a job - I should be over there everyday (they live 35 mins north and I go over there once a week to stay with him). My siblings and I (because we are biological) were treated great by my grandmother, including receiving cars, college, housing, etc. while other non-biological kids suffered. As much as I recognize this can cause resentment and distrust, I feel like the resentment is overshadowing their ability to work with me in order to set things right with the trust.\n\nI realize some of you may think I’m an asshole for trying to make the trust “fair”, but my grandfather always wanted to treat all family fairly and unfortunately my grandmother has prevented that throughout his life. I recognize there are also questions to why he didn’t do more to make that happen. Overall, I feel like discussing a living person’s trust prior to their death is so extremely terrible.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to help make this trust fair to the best of my ability despite all those I’m trying to help writing me off and attacking my personal life?",

      "description": "I had an audition about a month ago. Now I have a massive phobia of crowds, and also of performing, and I knew I'd really struggle to do this on my own. My friend offered two weeks in advance to come with me for support, which was much needed and appreciated.\n\nThe next day, she said she would definitely come.\n\nThe day after that, she said she would probably come.\n\nThe day after, she says she might come. I stopped her there and said that I needed someone with me for support, and if she couldn't make it that's fine but to just let me know then and there so I could find someone else in time. She said no, no need to find anyone else, she would be there to support me. So I thanked her.\n\nA week and a half later, it was the day before and I messaged her saying what time and where to meet etc. She comes back to me saying actually she's too tired and she can't make it sorry bye. This was the night before, remember. I didn't have time to find anyone else. I told her that if she did this to me, I'd never be able to forgive her. She said I'd have to get over it she's just too tired.\n\nSo I went to it on my own. I got through it. It was horrible. And I just saw her completely differently, as the unreliable flake that she is. So I deleted her on facebook and insta, she kept liking my things on insta, so I blocked her. Yesterday was a month after the incident. I got a message from her on facebook saying \"wtf you unfriended me when are you going to get over this?\" I blocked her and didn't reply. Then she messaged me in the work chat, which I can't block her on in case there's something work related, saying \"I miss you\". I reminded her I said I wouldn't be able to forgive her if she stood me up, and to accept it. She said no, she won't accept it.\n\nSo now I feel bad. She's making me feel guilty. But she really let me down and I just plain do not have any warm feelings toward her anymore, I don't see her as a friend. I told her this would happen and she still decided not to come, I don't understand why she's sending me these pathetic messages.\n\nAm I the asshole for not caving here? It's getting on my nerves.",

      "description": "(Mobile user)\n**TLDR**- coworker has been over an hour late 3 days in the past 2 1/2 weeks... AITA for being upset at her, especially because she has small children and an hour long commute?\n\n\n\nOkay. First things first, I work night shift from 6pm-6am at a group home for males in the IDD community. It’s easy enough but the tough days are tough even when they’re asleep. I have regular cleaning duties and a list of items to complete during the night on top of assisting our 3 clients. The days where my complaints arise happen to have been tough days where I had to complete more than usual and things had generally not gone well. \n\nMy coworker works opposite shift as me (6am-6pm) She was hired about a month ago and I know that she has been learning the ropes just like I had to do when I was first hired. She’s 25 has two (or three) very young kids and lives about an hour drive away from our work. She has been late three times in the past two and a half weeks. One day it was 2 1/2 hours. The next it was 1 1/2 hours. This morning it has been about 1 hour.  \n\nFirst time I completely understood because her excuse was that her kid got a hold of her phone and turned off her alarm. Completely possible and freaking sucks cause it happens. Like four days later for the second time her excuse was her baby was in the hospital. I was upset before she told me, but it’s not like she could help that her baby was sick. She didn’t tell our boss the night before when she had taken her in so it just seemed weird, but when something happens you don’t immediately think to tell your boss about it, right? Completely understandable even though I was annoyed. \n\nThis morning however, she said the roads were bad. Now, we just got snow yesterday however there are not many people on the road at 5-6am and she could have left earlier. There was no reason she couldn’t have left early because it snowed YESTERDAY and the roads were bad THEN. The road is pretty bad anyways when it snows a little so she really should have. So, now I have to stay after my shift AGAIN and wait for her to show up.\n\nI know that having multiple children is hard especially when they get sick, and commuting over an hour to work fucking sucks when the weather is bad...but my own stepmother did this for over 12 years on top of attending college full time for 4 of those years (albeit we were all in high school at this time). She had to deal with 3 hormonal teenagers, an asshole husband, and over an hour commute on TWO LANE MOUNTAIN ROADS. She was only ever late 2 times and called off once during those 12 years due to weather. \n\nAm I the asshole for being upset that she has been late so many times? I mean...me having to stay (nobody else to come in) cuts into my time to go shower, sleep, eat, and mentally prepare myself to come back to work for another 12 hour shift... Or Am I the Asshole for just being insensitive to a string of unfortunate mishaps that has befallen my coworker? \n\nIDK",

I didn’t want to stop seeing her, so I offered her a play to stay until she got back on feet. \n\nThat was four months ago. It’s become obvious she’s not going to leave now (my closet is filled with her clothes), she has decorated some, refers to my room as “our room”, has a vanity for makeup im my room and never talks about leaving anymore. \n\nI wanted time to live by myself, I just got divorced a year ago and now I feel like I’m married again. \n\nShe is VERY comfortable here.

      "description": "For a bit of context, I just got my license yesterday after school (I still haven't even had it for 24 hours as of writing this) and I called my friend to see if he wanted to go and get something to eat; my treat.\n\nSo I was at an intersection that is very strangely positioned with one road (the one I'm trying to turn into) being straight while the other one (the one I was turning from) was diagonal and connected to a highway about a mile down. At this time (roughly 5:30PM), traffic was kinda shitty coming down the diagonal road from the highway. I was behind two cars who were also turning. The light went yellow and the first guy pulled out and turned, the second guy pulled out quickly as well, and as I passed the line and started into the intersection, the light was red. As I turned, I looked to my right and saw a woman in a black SUV screaming and hollering; I had just pulled out in front of her because I wasn't paying good enough attention (I have ADD that I take medicine for, but it had most likely worn off by that time, I was singing and half focusing on my music, and was also trying to focus on where the hell my friend lived; but none of those are excuses, just explaining my mental state at the time).\n\nAs I drove down the road and realized what I had done within only one and a half to two hours of getting my temporary license, I stopped singing and started shouting and cursing over how stupid I was. I pulled into the parking lot of a strip mall and called my dad and told him what happened (I never have much self-confidence in myself and if I screw up something I'm doing, I'll dwell on it and completely lose morale). My dad said his usual, \"You've got to look out for shit like that, Will.\" But after sleeping on it I've began to wonder: is what I did make me an asshole?\n\nI mean, I believe what I did was an asshole move and I should have been paying attention; but at the same time, the light turned red right when I crossed the line and had began starting into the intersection so if I stopped I would have been either blocking traffic or getting a chance of trading paint with a passing car. Either way, they are both asshole moves, but was what I chose make me a bigger asshole than the other option?",

      "description": "Look, before you judge me harshly for the title, there was good reason.\n\nCONTEXT: This person and I (We will call him George) had just met 2 days ago before we started dating. It was definitely way too fast and I didn't know enough about him to know what he was like.\n\nAlright. This all started in August of 2016. I was in a Skype call with some of my new friends, including George. Everything was normal, we were watching one of the people create a YouTube channel banner. A few hours passed and we all decided we were going to end the call and start typing. George PM's me, just saying \"Hi\" which I have always found normal. \n\nHe starts asking me questions like what my favorite color is and what I like to eat, things like that. Again I find this normal as I then did the same thing. But then things started to get a little weird.\n\nWhen I would leave to get a drink or something he would message me things like \"Where did you go bb!!, You left ;-;\" etc. I found this pretty strange at first but got used to it, thinking it was just something he did.\n\nThe next day he asked if he could be my boyfriend. I was pretty young and stupid (I still am young and stupid, but I was even more stupid lol) I ended up saying yes and things escalated quickly. We would send each other pictures of each other and call for hours a day. \n\nA couple of months in I found myself uninterested. We had met prior and it was very awkward and humdrum.\n\nIn those couple of months, he started doing some infuriating things. When I wanted to go to sleep, he would spam me in my text messages with heart emojis. I ended up having to turn off all notifications for my phone because it annoyed me so much. Whenever I would be gone for more than a minute he would spam me asking where I went and if I was ignoring him. Eventually I did start pretending to have naps or be out with family so he wouldn't bother me.\n\nI never brought up the fact that what he did was annoying me, but I did make it obvious that I was starting to become bored with the \"relationship\" (if you could call it that)\n\nDuring the last 2 months, he ended up cheating on me with someone I was friends with, I knew but I didn't really care because at the time I was constantly ignoring him for other people and was planning on dumping him.\n\nFebrurary 2017 I told him that we couldn't see each other anymore. The excuse I made up was family issues. I finally felt a release when I was away from him and I do not regret any decisions I made/didn't make.\n\nTL;DR. I was in a relationship with someone that I ended up not loving, I avoiding talking to him because he annoyed me and ended up dumping him for a fake reason.\n\nSo tell me, am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Some background:\n\nMy wife and I already have an awesome 4 year old son.  We had talked about having 2 kids before we ever had him, but then after he was born everything was so great with just him that we weren't even sure we wanted a second kid anymore.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's been asking us if he can have a baby brother or sister.  This has reopened the conversation about having a second kid (which we had discussed previously as probably not being in the cards anymore).  Pregnancy is hell on a woman's body, and it was no different for her.  She's nervous about it and I don't want to force her into having another pregnancy if she doesn't want to.  That being said, she's been very gung ho recently on the idea of adopting a kid that has been through the foster system.  I'm not even necessarily AGAINST the idea, but I just have a lot of concerns.  For starters, while I'm sure I'd like and even love a child we adopted together, I worry that I'll never have the same bond with a child that is already a toddler or preschool age.  Also I worry that, because this kid will likely have gone through hell that put it into the foster care system, we'll be adopting a whole cadre of potential issues with this child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm perfectly happy with our little family of three, and I thought she was too.  With our son asking us for a sibling, this has  kind of blown the whole status quo straight apart it would seem.  She told me she feels that, because of the reservations I have about adoption, I'm putting all this pressure on her to get pregnant.  But at the end of the day, I would still be happy if we didn't have another kid at all.  I don't know if I'm the asshole here, and maybe this is more of an r/offmychest post, but I'm really starting to feel like it...",

Until, my Aunt, starts yelling at the \"kids\" ( everyone under the age of 20 ) for sitting down. \n\nA little bit of extra information on this Aunt, shes a huge Narcissist. She micromanages everything around her, and ruined my uncles 17th birthday party by instilling a bunch of rules for a group of teenagers, who were just roasting hotdogs on a fire and talking. \n\nSo, once again re-iterating that this is MY HOUSE, i dont get up. No one is standing except the people she is bothering, so its not like im taking anyones seat. Not to mention that i sit here almost every afternoon because i live there, and she doesnt. \n\nAfter i refuse to get up ( and i say something along the lines of \"I live here, and sit here everyday, you aren't making me stand \") she proceeds to lecture me aggressively, not quite yelling, and repeatedly attempts to pull me out of the chair. Calling me disrespectful and saying I'm ruining everyone elses time. \n\nFun fact.  Im typing this from that same chair, but im getting some dirty looks. AITA? ",

      "description": "Throwaway. So we're both in the same college and our families live several hours apart from each other. There's a lot of reasons I want to break things off but the main one is *I've* become a toxic person (partly due to mental illness and partly just to being an asshole, I can work that out in therapy, preferably without any future partners until I'm better enough) and have been harmful to her and others.  \n\nThe problem with breaking things off when college classes are in session is this: When classes are in session things are so intense and there are so many deadlines coming up, I don't want to jeapordize either of our academics with a big thing like a breakup. This is especially true when a break is on the horizon: work piles and piles up and it's hard to break up with someone when you have 3 papers due in as many days. I know the obvious solution is \"just do them in advance\" and I want to do that, should do that, and need to do that, but due to aforementioned mental issues that's probably not going to happen. \n\nWe are on spring break right now and I'm driving up to her house in a few days. I figured this might be the best time because she'll have her family around her, won't have work to do, won't have to see me anymore for a few days after I break up with her and leave, and can start the last leg of the semester with a clean break. But of course it's also the most assholish time because she'll be expecting a nice romantic week together. To add to that I had planned to drive her home at the end of break, which of course I'm still willing to do but practically speaking her options would be \"take an awkward multi-hour car ride with the person who just dumped you\" or \"take the Greyhound,\" and everyone knows greyhound kinda sucks. Even if i pay for her ticket it would still suck. \n\nShe has no interest in a breakup (which I know makes it even worse!) so it will have to be me to do it.  \n\nWIBTA? If I don't break up with her now then when? Right when classes start? In the middle of class? Wait until summer? This cycle has gone on so long ",

      "description": "So my family plays softball on a league as a way to hang out together and just have fun. We are not that good but we’ve been getting better and it’s been a fun 3 seasons. My (23/f) bf (28/m) used to play on his own team in a different league and when they were done for the season he joined our team. This is the first season he’s played with us. Now my bf is pretty good, especially compared to all my cousins and myself, but he’s really good in general. \n\nLast night, he had invited some of his friends to watch the game since it was the last one of the season. So some info on my bf, he’s very confident. He’s not so much cocky but he knows he’s good and not afraid to admit it. The rest of the team had left at this point and it was just his 3 friends and the wife of one of them. We were all sitting around eating and drinking beer. When his playing skills came into the conversation. He was saying how he never makes mistakes and hadn’t made a mistake at any game all season long. Now i don’t know much of the sport and I’ve only been playing for 2 seasons, but I know enough to know when someone makes a mistake as simple as the ball rolled too fast and the person wasn’t able to catch it in time. So I just kind of joked and was like come on, you’ve made mistakes before. And denied it saying he’s NEVER made mistakes, because he was that good. I continued and told him, of course he’s really good but he’s accidentally let a ball go past him a couple of times during the season, at least twice. \n\nAt this point his friends were kind of laughing and one of his other friends was agreeing saying yeah he made 2 today. My bf continued saying he never had and that I’m always his biggest hater, I joked that I just like to keep him grounded so he won’t get a big head. I noticed he was mad at this point and told him again that yes he’s really good. I was trying to touch his leg and kinda diffuse the moment and he just kept saying loudly not to touch him like 3 times when I would playfully try to touch him or his hand. I tried to laugh it off and he got up to get a pitcher of beer. His friends were laughing saying that he was mad and that he’s super confident and has a big head. They were also saying how he wasn’t going to come sit back down with us because me and the other friend had upset him for saying he made mistakes. For the rest of the night, he kind of just stopped looking at me or my direction and didn’t try to talk to me. They were all his friends, so I kind of just sat there. His friends wife and me talk when we see each other and we had previously talked about going to a club and she asked if we still wanted to go this weekend. I was telling her yeah and she was kinda just smiling at me like well if you still have a boyfriend, since at this point he was still not talking to me. (My bf and i have had a rocky relationship in the past and he’s been known to blow things out of proportion and “break up” with me a few times. Many times with that couple that was there.) I just kind of laughed it up and said we still could all go, since I was free the next night. My bf made a comment that “of course she’d go” and I just told her again we’re both free and we could all go. \n\nOn the way home, my bf and me stopped at in n out and we just kind of sat in silence. As well as the rest of the ride home. Once I was home, I sent him a text saying he didn’t have to be so rude over such a trivial comment, and like I repeatedly told him, I wasn’t saying he wasn’t good. And just that next time he could hang out with his friends without me. Since it was embarrassing to have him ignore me the rest of the night and being told not to touch him. He then sent me a wall of text saying I was legit hating and that I don’t know sport talk so what I said was very disrespectful. That I always make him into a pos bf and out him down like no one has in his life. All I honestly said was you’re really good but you’ve made a couple of mistakes sometimes. He said I can’t give him positive criticism since I don’t know the sport to know what’s considered an error. Just pretty much that I turn him into a pos bf by exaggerating things and then acting like I don’t scratch at him too. \n\nSo am I the asshole for speaking I’ll of his softball skills when I don’t know the sport? \n\nSorry for the wall of text! And for any mistakes, I’m typing this out on my phone. \n",

Eventually, it ends up just being me, my friend, and another newer girl to our group. We are all sitting, just talking and listening to music for a while until the girl eventually decided to leave. Right when the girl leaves my friend is fuming and starts yelling at me saying stuff like \"how stupid can you be, pick up on the damn hints.\" I'm just kinda sitting there at this point with my mouth wide open. Apparently he wanted to make a move on her but obviously, that would have been a little awkward with the three of us all together. My friend has never told me anything about their relationship before this, and I did not notice any 'hints' he was giving me to apparently just leave. What boggles me the most is he easily could have pulled me aside for a second and explained the situation and told me to leave, would not have been a problem.

      "title": "AITA for yelling at my roommate to be quiet at 3am?",
      "description": "So this happened last night with one of my roommates...\n\nI went to sleep at around 2am and she knew that as I had told her that I would be sleeping soon. My roommate likes to work from the living room instead of her room since it helps her to be more focused and she sometimes watches Youtube or w/e and I can hear it from my bedroom (either the walls are super thin or I have bat-like hearing). Now usually I don't mind this and I have never called her out on the noise coming from a video.  \n\nHowever, my roommate also likes to facetime her friends but it is harder for her since there is a 3 hour time difference between time. So she calls them at 2am here while it's 11pm there. She had the call going at a pretty high volume and was talking into her laptop without using her earphones which has a mic built in.\n\nI thought I could withstand the constant laughing and rapid fire girl talk and just lie there on my bed to sleep (I even tried putting in my noise cancelling earphones but I could still hear their high pitched speech). After 30mins of trying to sleep, I had enough. At first I texted her at 2:39am with \"can you be quiet pls\", which she responded with sorry and lowered her overall sound output (talking and laptop sound) from an 8 to a 6 (my relative scale of loudness). Another 5 mins goes by and I message her again at 2:44am and ask if she is using her earphones and its built-in mic. I also straight up tell her that she is being loud and that I can't sleep because of it.\n\nShe shuts off her facetime and proceeds to wait a few minutes before watching Youtube without earphones at a 2 on my volume scale (don't you think the average person would take a hint and use earphones for the sake of common courtesy??). Normally I would be ok with this since it wasn't THAT LOUD but I was so ticked off and I openly yelled \"DO YOUR EARPHONES NOT WORK??!?\"\n\nShe has the audacity to message me \"yo if its loud just text me like i reduced the volume to half and its even quiet for me, you dont need to yell like that LOL\" after I had already messaged her twice. She then says that our other roommate doesn't complain about the noise and he's closer to the living room and suggests that I have \"sensitive ears\". She follows that up with \"it was rly weird LOOOL you have weird anger issues\".\n\nFinally, peace and quiet. Too much to ask for at 3AM IN THE MORNING apparently without having \"anger issues\" (we are also university students btw and luckily I didn't have classes this morning). Now I get that I shouldn't have yelled like that but I was pushed to my limit. This type of incident where she was being too loud late at night has happened a couple of times in the past and I had called her out each time on the noise. But this was the first time that she tried to call me out on being \"suddenly\" angry.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

      "description": "we were tied at the hip since we were 4 and met in kindergarten and I always considered her my best friend in the whole world. no one else even came close. she had a really rough time with mental illness in our teens and attempted suicide multiple times. I supported her through that and was her shoulder to cry on. it was really a really difficult time but I couldn't abandon her like all our other friends did because she was hard to deal with and very emotionally draining. a bit after she got a handle on her mental illness she met this guy and started hanging out with him a lot. we were 16 or so and he was 25 if I recall correctly. I thought it was kinda weird that he would hang out with a highschool kid but I didn't think much of it as she has always had weird friends. I hung out with both of them for the first time after they met because I was curious about this dude she had become such fast friends with. hanging out with him was awful. they picked me up from my house in his car and this guy starts doing 180km/hr down the residential streets. he's purposefully swerving all over the place because he thinks it's fun and my friend and him are laughing and having a great time and I'm just frozen in fear in the back seat. at one point he let's go of the wheel completely and asks my friend to steer because he wanted to send a text message. I learned later that he was on coke. so I was freaked the fuck out but miraculously we got to our destination in one piece. we were gonna have a bonfire beside the lake. he whipped out a blunt and started smoking it which made me very uncomfortable since he was my ride home. (as I write this I'm kicking myself for getting back in the car with him I should have called my mother to rescue me but teenagers are stupid) then he starts getting really racist. talking about some guy he knows and calling him a nigger. I'm mixed so this made me super uncomfortable and I guess he noticed and went on that rant racists go on about how not all black people are niggers, only the bad ones. I mostly just sat quietly until he and my friend decided the beach was boring and they drove me back home. \n\n when they met he had a girlfriend and after about a year they broke up. I later learned it was because he beat her up and choked her unconscious and that it was not the first time he had abused her physically and put his hands around her neck but this time it was bad enough that she left him and filed a police report. my friend said that the ex was a liar who had cheated on this guy and was just generally trash talking her. I thought the guy was awful and dangerous before but now huge red flags are going off in my head. I told her to talk to the ex and get her side of the story before she makes judgements and that I thought he was dangerous and that I didn't think she should hang out with him. she assured me she was fine and I mean I'm not her mom, I couldn't stop her, so I just told her to be safe. I would still express concern to her about it every so often because she seemed to be getting more and more into this guy and spending a lot of time with him. she assured me they weren't dating and I believed her. they were probably dating at that time I think but a bit later they became an official couple and I was shocked and scared for my friend. when his ex found out she sent her a long heartfelt message where she said that she was too young for him and that he was preying on her, that if she dated him he would do all the things that he had done to her and she begged her to end the relationship. my friend called her names and said she was lying. eventually he began to manipulate her and control her, telling her what to wear, yelling at her and insulting her in front of people, and he always had to know where she was and who she was with. then she confided in me that he slapped her hard across the face during an argument. I said she should leave him. all of our friends were begging her to leave him. but she wouldn't, insisted it wasn't that bad and talked about how nice he was otherwise. the stuff you hear all the time from abuse victims. a month after this she drops by my house one day and says that he doesn't want her hanging out with me anymore.\n\n I don't have a doubt in my mind it was because of my race. our white friends would be invited to hang out with them and he would call me a nigger around them. after that it's like I stopped existing to her. she didn't talk to me for 2 years. it was so hard. it's one of the most painful things to happen to me and i felt so sad and angry and hurt and abandoned. I kept up with the happenings of her life through friends for a while and the abuse escalated until he was doing all the same things to her that he did to his ex. eventually I stopped asking because I came to the conclusion that our friendship was done forever and that I had to move on. it took me most of those 2 years to get to a point where it didn't hurt anymore and I had moved on. after they broke up again she messaged me on Facebook. I can't remember if she apologized but I'm sure she did. and when she turned up again I realized that I wasn't as over it as I thought I was and that I was still very hurt over what happened. regardless I accepted her apology and we hung out. it wasn't the same as before. I guess our time apart had changed us into different people, or maybe my hurt feelings were why it didn't really feel right. I would respond to her messages when she sent me them but at this time I started having my own mental health issues and started to slowly lose contact with all my friends and isolate myself. we talked less and less until we just weren't talking at all anymore. we'd hang out occasionally but not frequently and because of how depressed I was I imagine I wasn't much fun. I feel like she assumed I was acting this way on purpose and only with her because she sent me a message a little while ago and she was pretty upset with me. she said that I was punishing her for being abused and that it wasn't her fault that she cut me off. I honestly wasnt trying to do that at the time but I've done some thinking about it and I don't think I can continue being her friend. it just reminds me a lot of how lonely senior year was without her. I feel like I'm an awful person for doing this. she was abused horribly and I know about how hard it is for victims to leave their abusers and how messed up your mind gets when you're being abused like that but at the same time I can't get over being dropped like that. and the fact that it was because of my race cut really deep. I went to a school with only a handful of other black kids and I encountered a lot of racism there and it was awful. I think I would maybe be able to get over it if it wasn't for that but idk. sorry this is so long\n\nTLDR: my friends racist abusive ex boyfriend made her drop me (most likely because of my race) and now that she wants to be back in my life I'm not sure I can accept her as a friend again. am I the asshole here? am I punishing her for being abused?\n\nsorry for length and any typos as I found writing this very upsetting and I don't want to proofread it",

      "description": "Awhile back, someone commented on a Facebook post about Stephen Hawking going to Heaven, saying that they should be respectful of his beliefs and that he probably did not go to Heaven because he does not believe in Heaven. I am agnostic so I am uncertain, but I said that that is technically not true. Someone can believe that a god specifically and consciously *chooses* to not send people to Heaven if they do not believe and to send them to Heaven if they believe. However, it is not illogical nor impossible nor in part of the mechanism to believe in it in order to go there. Heaven either does exist or does not exist.\n\nI replied to the person's comment saying that someone who believes in Heaven might not go to Heaven, and someone who does not believe in Heaven might go to Heaven, explaining that it either does or does not exist. This person was not religious, but kept repeating themselves to me as tho I did not get it. Yes, I get that they should be respectful by not making the original post. However, I just said that if Heaven does or does not exist, it is not *impossible* for someone not believing to go to Heaven and someone not believing to not go to Heaven, and they got angry and accused me of not respecting his beliefs. AITA?",

      "description": "I’ve been in a relationship for a few years now with a girl I’ve known for quite some time. At the beginning of our relationship we had a very active sex life and we would do it almost every day of the week. Being a college kid I felt that was necessary to relieve stress and get my mind off of things. Not to mention the fact that my testosterone levels are probably at their peak. \n\nRecently the number of times per week has decreased anywhere from 5-20 times, to 1-2 times a week if I’m lucky. I am very into this girl and enjoy the time we spend together, and although sex isn’t the backbone of our relationship, it is still important to me. \n\nI’ve never become angry with her over the fact, but I have brought it up multiple times and she has said she wants to have more sex but in the weeks following it will just steady out back to the bare minimum. We spend so much time alone together and quite honestly, we get bored a lot, which is another reason I would think that sex should be more prevalent. \n\nI don’t want to make this a big issue between the two of us but I can’t see myself with someone who has so little sex especially when we had so much only a year ago. \n\nAm I the asshole for being frustrated with this lack of sex?

      "description": "This might be a bit of a read but I'll try make it as short and to the point as possible.\n\nI met a girl on campus (let's call her Jane) and we initially clicked based off similarities we had. We immediately developed a quick bond and friendship, based off honesty and being able to speak freely with one another.\n\nShe quickly caught feelings for me so I told her that I'm in a relationship with someone else. This caused a bit of initial confusion, but we agreed to continue our friendship. Our friendship, however, was a bit too personal. It bordered on emotional cheating, and I definitely wasn't being respectful to my GF in maintaining my friendship with Jane.\n\nDuring my friendship with Jane, she would constantly mention how she'd never allow what was happening between us to happen if she was my GF. I found this annoying because whilst she would call out our friendship as being wrong, she would still send me hearts and mention how good of a friend I am etc etc. There were times when I would purposefully try to maintain some distance between her and I, but she would call me out on it.\n\nAnyway.. not so long ago, Jane and her ex decided to patch things up and got back together. This put Jane in a tough spot since she still had feelings for me, but also wanted to work things out with her ex. She now found herself in the same position I was in, having to balancing her relationship with our friendship. \n\nAnyway, fast forwarding to the present, Jane has become much more critical of our friendship. She doesn't want to cut it off, but she feels that our current friendship is making her disloyal and disrespectful to her partner, and not allowing her to be completely there for her partner.\n\nNow this brings me to my question. I'd firstly like to point out that I am undoubtedly the asshole for ever allowing this to happen. I am completely aware of that. It was wrong and disrespectful to my GF. I'm not asking for judgement on that part, I know I was wrong.\n\nBut I want to know whether I'd be the asshole if I decided to cut off Jane as a friend. We promised one another that we'd be there for each other, but now things have changed. I think Jane is a bit hypocritical because she was perfectly fine with all this when I was the one having to balance the morals of having a close female friend whilst still being in a relationship. But now that she's in a similar position, she's being very critical of our friendship.\n\nI still care about her as a friend, but I feel like our friendship should just be cut off. Would I be the asshole for breaking the promise we made and cutting contact with her? (I'd tell her this, not just ghost her)\n\nTL;Dr: Became very close with a friend, even though I had a GF. She was initially fine with it. Now that she got back with her ex, she's become very critical of our friendship and I want to cut contact with her. WIBTA?",

I’m talking them arriving at 2 and leaving at 10pm. Not only that but she has 2 very bratty and young kids, one starting school the other in year 3 who trash the place every time without fail leaving me and my sister to clean up. She also leave their kids at our house where the youngest one has to be literally dragged up the stairs to go to bed and the older one destroying the house.\n\nthey also leave there dog, one that isn’t ‘potty trained’ and smells, at our house for days on end and don’t give thanks afterwards.

      "description": "This morning I woke up to loud music that I could hear pretty clearly from my apartment. I live on the third floor of my building and the walls are pretty thick so I don't usual hear anything from the neighboring apartments unless they get pretty loud. Regardless, I just assumed it was someone in the building and it was irritating but I didn't think much of it.\n\nAn hour or so later I went out to walk my dog and found the source of the noise was actually a man two or three buildings over who had set up two speakers and was playing his music at top volume. I live in the city and the buildings on my block are lined right up against each other so this actually wasn't much of a distance. Not shocking that I could hear it from my apartment given how loud it was. He was drinking something out of a red solo cup and shouting Happy New Year to everyone who walked by. When I passed him and he said it to me I ignored him, so he repeated himself and then I grumbled Happy New Year and kept walking because I was miffed about the loud music. He said something like \"Is it really that bad?\" but I ignored him and kept walking.\n\nAfter I finished my dog's walk I felt kind of bad. I found the loud music very annoying but I guess he was just celebrating so I don't know if I was being unnecessarily snarky. I tend to keep mostly to myself and I'm not really an overly friendly neighbor in the first place so I don't know if anyone else would have been more friendly to the guy. ",

      "description": "TL;DR: I'm 31m, in a relationship with 29m, nearing our fifth year together. We aren't out as gay. A few months ago, my partner did a 180 degree turn on his opinions and now he wants to start telling people we're a couple. He's angry with me for not agreeing. Am I the asshole here? Because I feel like I'm going slightly mad.\n\nHi guys. Hoping to get someone impartial to weigh in on the bind I'm in because I'm too emotionally invested in this whole situation.\n\nSome further explanations are in order, so here goes. My partner has been dealing with some mental health issues over the past year, including seemingly random panic attacks and increasing anxiety. He figured the stress was work-related and started seeing a therapist as per his GP's recommendation.\n\nLong story short, he's unpacked some bottled-up stuff that's been causing him distress, which apparently included not being out as gay. I supported my partner when he decided to come out to his sister, though I made it clear I didn't want him to involve me personally.\n\nEver since, I've been feeling resentment from him and we've been arguing. When we sat down to get to the bottom of the issue, he accused me of \"smothering him\" by insisting on staying closeted myself, and consequently a couple. I don't even personally see this as a closet issue, but as a desire to keep the different facets of my life separate. I've always been like this, just don't like opening up and I think people are too prying in general. I'm not close to any of my family members or friends anymore (most of them live abroad), and I see no point in disclosing my personal relationships to co-workers. Also, we don't live in the most accepting place on Earth, so even though I'm technically legally protected for my sexuality, what's to stop my boss firing me under a different pretense if she were to find out?\n\nI'm no activist and I don't want all that potential trouble. I'm comfortable with how my life is and don't want to change the relationships I have now. I thought my partner shared my viewpoint, seeing as he was even more reserved than me when we'd just started dating. He's never mentioned being unsatisfied with our relationship or hinted at wanting to be explicitly known as a couple until these past couple of months.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here? I support my partner coming out to his own friends and family if that's what he needs for his own peace of mind, but I don't want to do that myself. I know it's a complicated issue on some level because we're together. But we also have our separate needs and personalities. What is your take on this?",

      "description": "Some context: about a year ago a very good friend of mine lost his father to heart related issues. He and his family had been struggling with money for a while well before this; he had told me a few weeks prior that they weren't paying for their house anymore and were refusing to leave until the bank came to take it from them (something along those lines, I'm young and have no idea about this stuff). His father had to leave his job as a chemical engineer because his mother was diagnosed with MS and was unable to work/ take care of herself. On top of this, they were paying his older brother through college.\nFast forward to today. We're seniors in high school, it's 2nd semester, and senior events are coming up rapidly. He expressed an interest in coming to our senior party, but said he was unable to afford it. I offered to help him, and talked to my dad about his situation. My dad is a teacher at our high school, so he was able to find out that one of our assistant principals typically helps people in this situation with Prom and other events. He would be willing to meet us halfway to pay for a ticket.\nIn the past few weeks, however, something has changed. This same friend who told myself and several other mutual friends that he couldn't afford a $55 ticket has bought a Nintendo Switch, a new phone, and a guitar within the past month. He also bought a plane ticket to go to California and meet his e-girl. Obviously these were red flags to me, since I had agreed to pay for him under the pretext that he couldn't afford it and had gotten my dad to agree to help me pay for him to go to prom. I confronted him about this last night, and he told me he's got 18-years worth of savings for himself. He also blocked me after this conversation.\nOur mutual friends are remaining pretty silent about this and removed, though one of them has told me privately that he believes this friend of ours is using me for my dad. I feel bad because of all he's had to go through, but if he has enough money to buy all these things for himself, why should I pay for him?",

I wouldn't if I had the choice, I'd rather walk alone.) and she started trying to talk to me about some real shit, to do with \"depression\" (multiple times she's been \"exposed\" for faking depression. There's little evidence either way, but it really comes across as fake) and I told her as nicely as I could that I can't help her.  \n\nToday, she got mad at me for this.

So it’s out of my price range. I was gonna move to a place o could afford but the promise of free rent caused me to move here. \n\nOnce I arrived I was told rent would be 1000/month. I kept up at first but it was almost impossible as the cost of living is also more expensive here. We have someone who lives in the basement so now we pay 700/month. But after I gave birth my partner took a month off (he saved his paid leave) but his employers fucked up and wouldn’t put him back on the schedule for over 2 months. \n\nI talked to my parents about this and they verbally agreed that I would pay 300 a month until my partner started working again. First priority is diapers and food for the kids. \n\nThen my dad and I got into a fight - he likes to throw my son (who was 1.5 yrs old at the time) around, but I’m not okay with that - my dad is 70 and frail and my son is 30lbs. He also gives him weapons to play with. When I said that we not allowed he told me that it was okay. So I told him he can’t be around my kids until he can listen to directions. \n\nTwo days later I was given an eviction notice citing that it was due to me not paying rent. We came to an agreement that he isn’t to throw my kids around anymore and he rescinded the notice and thinks that he should be able to stop by and play with the kids but I’m not ready. \n\nI’m so hurt that he gave me an eviction notice because he was mad instead of just listening to directions or having a conversation with me that he was that angry. My mom agrees that his behavior was very dangerous but that didn’t stop the eviction notice. He’s now getting mad that I am not over the eviction notice and thinks that I have no right to be mad. \n\nI know I wasn’t paying rent but an eviction notice feels so extreme to a me. Oh and by the way when he sent the notice I my daughter had just hit 6 weeks old. \n\nAlso I know he would have evicted me. He did the same to my older sister - I didn’t know this until after the fact when I talked to her about it. ",

      "description": "Hey guys, \nSo back in middle school/high school I didnt have many friends, I was a weirdo, the weirdo that works out and sings pretty darn well and plays the guitar. My sexual experience also only started at 17.6 but since I've been going wild. I didnt have a lot of experience with people nor friendships because I think I might have a trust issue. I'm a handsome guy, well, with my beard, I used to workout a lot before I broke my collarbone and tore a muscle, but my body still looks tone. Anyways, whenever people started getting closer, it's either they wanted it more than me, and in response I backed off, or I wanted to go out with them all the time. And when they went out with other people without inviting me I got hurt.\nSo, the real story. I had a birthday last friday, and it was my first birthday that I actually had the chance to do something, to party and to drink with friends, because I finally had some that were around and liked parties. So I felt like it should be a special occasion. 2 weeks prior my birthday, another friend of theirs has a birthday, and they went out with him 2 days in a row. So I expected they would treat me the same, after all back in the days we were best friends in elementary school (we drifted apart and got back in contact at the age of 19, I'm 20 now).\n\nThey told me they want to go out but too tired because they went snowboarding.\nOn Saturday, a day after the special day, 2 of them went out with other people, and I saw it on their instagram and got pretty down because of it.\n\nI might not be engaging, or be overly hurt, but I just truly feel betrayed because we started getting real close. And although I might not value birthdays, because I never actually properly celebrated it with friends, I still felt as if they should've done something special for me.. \n\nSo I just stopped engaging a lot with them.. and took my anger out on weed and had sex with different women in a row already.. so I'm not in the best place. Btw same things goes with women, either I'm too into them and they're not as much, and I get hurt, or they're into me and I'm not so much. Idk how to change that\n\nAm I an asshole to expect them to celebrate with me? And good thing to note, one of the friends that was supposed to go out with me, but canceled, just opened a group to celebrate his birthday in a month. So.. ???\n\n",

      "description": "On Sunday afternoon I was shopping at the grocery store around the corner from my house. I don't want to say the name because I'm worried about this getting on social media and I'm almost positive I saw people filming with their phones (also posting from a one time use account for that reason), but it's a national chain that's focus is affordable health food. Think whole foods with bigger variety and way cheaper prices. Because of this, I know a lot of vegans and vegetarians shop there but this place has a full butcher shop, fish place and deli counter. It has vegan products but is not vegan to put it succinctly. \n\nI was in the soup aisle and I was checking out the bone broth when I hear something from behind me. Thinking back I THINK she said something like \"you shouldn't eat that, it's murder.\" But I honestly didn't hear her so I turned around and said \"thank you.\" This is all such a blur please don't quote me on any of this, it's just the best of my recollection. \n\n\nHer: \"your body will THANK YOU, as will all the animals.\"\n\n\nMe: really confused \"thank you.\"\n\n\nI set the box of broth I was looking at down and found a store brand that was much cheaper and put in my basket. \n\n\nHer: \"wait, I thought you weren't buying that?\"\n\n\nMe: \"excuse me?\"\n\n\nHer: \"you agreed that meat was murder.\"\n\n\nMe: \"no I'm sorry, I eat meat.\" \n\n\nThis is where I start to think something was really, really wrong with her. \n\n\nHer: \"you PROMISED me, you PROMISED me! No more animals will have to die. YOU PROMISED me.\" \n\n\nI just slowly turned away from her and went into the next aisle. She turned the other way so I figured I was done with her. Instead she looped around and met me coming the other way in the aisle I was in and kept screaming \"you PROMISED. you PROMISED!\"  and at this point she was in full tears, her face was red and now people sort of had us boxed in on both ends watching the \"show.\" \n\n\nI was livid at this point so I said (and this I can quote) \"look you stupid b!tch, I didn't promise anything. leave me the fuck alone.\" And with using that word I think I turned the crowd from being somewhat sympathetic in me dealing with the crazy person to me being an extreme asshole who was calling her names. She collapsed in a heap and I tried to excuse myself through the 4/5 people at the end of the aisle. I was shaking because I don't enjoy confrontation and I just set my basket down and went to the Safeway down the street but was a bundle of nerves the rest of the night. And I'm still dealing with it. I have no idea what came of the woman. \n\n\nThe look on those people's faces is haunting me (and i'm PRAYING this doesn't end up on youtube) and I feel awful for what I did. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "This situation happened a few days ago, but its spreading rapidly through my friend groups and social media, and I'm kind of at a loss as what to do or if I'm actually an asshole for the way I handled it.\n\nSituation starts with me (20M) and my trans friend, let's call her (19 MtF pre-op) Kat. Now Kat and I have been good friends since high school, and since we're sophomores in college now that's roughly 6+ years of friendship. She's a part of my group of closest friends, and while I don't consider myself as close to her as I do some of the others and rarely hung out alone with her, we were still fairly close. \n\nFast forward to a few days ago, and Kat and a few other friends are hanging out at my apartment, drinking, playing Smash, and having a good time. Hours pass and friends have to leave, but Kat noticeably isn't leaving. Now this is usually fine, I'm okay with having friends sleep over if they just don't feel like heading home, but Kat kept insinuating they didn't want to just sleep (with forced jokes like \"But I want to still *Smash*\" or \"*We should Smash more*\" while rubbing against me.) \n\nAdmittedly a little drunk but picking up on the obvious cues, I bluntly said \"Fuck no, I'm going to sleep.\" Kat responds, \"So you'll fuck X but you won't give me a chance?\" (X being a former fwb of mine in the group, and it being known that we were active for a while) and then she drops the million dollar question, \"Is it because I'm trans?\"\n\nOf course the drunk idiot I am said, \"Honestly?....Yeah dude.\", thinking to myself that since she's pre-op it...wouldn't work out in a way I'd be comfortable with. Not necessarily an issue with her being transgender, more so with her parts in intimacy. Also now that I'm sober I'm sure I would've said no regardless, as even though she passes very well and is on hormones, it would still be very weird to me since I knew her before transitioning, and wouldn't be able to not think of the male Kat.\n\nAnyway, Kat hears this, tears up (attributing this to being drunk and getting rejected) packs up her things, calls an uber and storms out. At this point I was drunk, tired and really just wanted to get some sleep. I wake up Sunday morning to my phone absolutely loaded with messages from friends, Kat's brother, Kat's sister, etc. She relayed what happened last night and now my friends are divided on how to feel. Some say I had the right to say no, others are saying my reasons for saying no are the issue. I already tried texting Kat my explanation (not just being trans, pre-op, wouldn't be comfortable, etc. etc.) but it seems I'm blocked on almost everything, and news is spreading fast. It's not the easiest thing to have to explain myself to every person calling me a transphobic POS.\n\nSo, AITA for rejecting her sexual advances with my main reasoning being that they're pre-op trans and I wasn't comfortable with that? Can't help but feel like what I'm saying is prejudiced, despite being friends with them for years as a trans person, but at the same time should I feel bad for rejecting her for pretty much just being trans?",

      "description": "A little bit of background information before I get into it...\n\nMy partner and I live together with my three children (11 yo son, 3yo daughter and 20month son) he has two children from a previous relationship also (9yo son and his 7yo daughter) he has them every second weekend from Friday until Monday morning. \n\nThe house we have moved into is smaller than my previous home, so he stays at his old place with his kids while we wait for our house to be renovated. \n\nSo the issue. \n\nWe were invited by my very good friend to attend her wedding this weekend, it's a good 12 hour drive but I was excited. \nI arranged for my children to stay with family and my partner had his kids last week to free up this week for our trip. \n\nAnd then we both got sick. His turned to man flu. Took days of work and I took care of him. Then I started getting sick, but of course I couldn't take a day off and I continued to look after everyone and everything despite how I was feeling. \nAnd then my daughter got really sick. \nWe ended up in hospital with her and I had to cancel our trip away. \nI was pretty upset about it, but that's parenting for you, right? \n\nSo I've been at the hospital dealing with my sick child. I'm getting sicker by the day. My asthma is now so bad I am on the verge of my own hospital admission. \n\nI'm standing in the kitchen cooking dinner for my partner after putting the kids to bed and he comes in and tells me all excited that he's arranged to pick up his kids this weekend. \n\nAnd I just... Burst into tears. \nBecause although they sleep at the other house, they are still here for all meal times. He's keeping them until Wednesday because it's Easter break and he hasn't taken any time off work for that. So I've got five kids to look after on my own. \n\nI cried to him and told him I needed a break. I'm tired. I'm unwell and I need help. \nTo which he replied that I was being unreasonable and unfair and he should spend as much time with his children as possible. \nAnd normally, yes. Yes yes yes. It's important to them and him and us as a family, but I needed him to... I don't know. Not take them this weekend. Help me. Let me sleep for a day like I let him. Give back a little instead of just taking. \n\nSo now he's at his house and I'm here with my children, with the shakes and a fever and feeling like death warmed up. Still with the housework to do. Still with the food to cook. Still with all my responsibilities and his responsibilities and zero help. \nI asked him to look after my youngest and the eldest so I could rest with my daughter but that was inconsiderate of me to ask apparently. He needs one on one time with HIS children not mine and I should ask my family to help instead of him. \n\nAm I an asshole asking for help and support? ",

I knew if she found out I was screwed. Well it turned out she was gonna be in emergency care for the next week due to a blood clot in her lungs. While all the students were sad I was a bit relieved because after a whole week there was no way she could narrow down the suspects to me. I wasn't happy that she got seriously hurt but I felt that if it would've happened anyways at least it happened at that time.

To be fair if an old friend does ask me to out for a short time I will go because life's just too short. \nAITA? Cheers",

      "title": "AITA for smoking with my boyfriend and not my friend?",
      "description": "Hi, Reddit. Sorry for the long post, but I want to provide clear details. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI'm a sophomore in college. In my freshman year, I made very close friends with the girls that lived on my hall. There were 5 of us in the group total, and we all live on the same hall in our sophomore year. Out of us five, three of them smoke weed occasionally. I had never smoked but didn't have an issue with the fact that they did. When they would smoke, at first they would ask if I wanted to join, and since I said no every time they stopped asking. Near the end of our freshman year I started mentioning to them that I would probably do it at some point, but never really pursued the interest.\n\nI met my current boyfriend at the beginning of my second semester of my freshman year. We're currently in a LDR (\\~ 3 hours) and every month or so he visits me for a weekend (For reasons, it's easier for him to come to me than the other way around, and that's never been an issue in our relationship). He also smokes occasionally, but has always been aware that I did not. He's never pressured me to, and I'd told him the same thing that I'd told my friends: I'd probably try it at some point.\n\nDuring this past October of my sophomore year, that opportunity arose. My boyfriend has a THC pen that he brought with him during a weekend trip \"just in case\", as he always did (previously, it had always just gone unused while he visited). We had been under the impression that all of the group was going out to a party, but it was cold and rainy, so we weren't sure what everyone's plans were anymore. We went down the hall to ask after hanging out by ourselves for a while. (The four other friends share a suite and are roommates with each other). The first door didn't answer, so we knocked on the other. My friend, Sarah, answered. She said that her roommate had gone out with a friend from high school, and the other two girls had also left to hang out with some other friends across campus. Sarah herself was doing schoolwork at her desk. BF and I stayed and chatted with Sarah for about 15 minutes, where Sarah was still focused on her work and BF and I were awkwardly standing by her desk. After a while I excused us so she could get back to what she was doing. After we realized that everyone else was out/busy, my BF asked if I wanted to try the pen. I said yes.\n\nI told my friends about getting high for the first time over dinner a few days after it happened, and Sarah got angry. I think they were always under the assumption that when I smoked for the first time it would be with them (my friends), since they were really the only people that I'm around often that I know that smoke. I realized this when my friend Michelle joked \"\\[BF's name\\] already took your regular virginity, we were supposed to have your weed one\". Sarah was also angry that we didn't invite her to smoke with us. I told her that we did it on our own because everyone else was out and she was busy, and she only replied that \"she would've stopped what she was doing if I had just told her\". She also said things like \"I have no trust in you anymore\", \"we're starting from square one\", and other things. It was said in a joking tone, so I didn't think she was serious, but looking back I'm not sure that she was really kidding.    \n\nSince then, Sarah's purposely gone places and done things with others in the group without inviting me, while knowing that I was free and wanting to hang out. I told the group that this hurt me, and Sarah replied by complaining that I talk to my boyfriend too much and that I'm not present in the friend group anymore because of him, though the amount that I talk to my BF has actually decreased since my freshman year and nobody had said that it was an issue then.\n\n I'm no longer close friends with Sarah because I feel like she always needs all of the attention and for things to go her way (among a few other things) and it's starting to splinter my friend group. Nobody else seems to feel that way about her so I don't know if I'm just biased because of how she's treated me since this incident. Because the friendship started crumbling because of this, I want to know, AITA for not inviting her and causing this downfall?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I am not a weed smoker, but some of my friends are. Recently, I decided to try it with my boyfriend while my friends were out/busy. One of my friends got mad at me for it. AITA for not inviting her, and for smoking with my boyfriend when my friends assumed I would smoke for the first time with them?  ",

      "description": "I am from Lithuania however my grandfather is of mixed Lithuanian and Latvian heritage and has lived in Latvia most of his life. During WW2 he joined the Latvian Legion, 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS. He fought bravely against the red devils to protect the baltic region from communism and Soviet occupation. He is hero. I know what you're thinking, he fought for the nazis and they're evil. I'm not denying Nazi war crimes, they did awful things however you need to realize the complicated situation we were in. The Soviets invaded and conquered Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and fighting with the Nazis was the only way to regain our independence. The Soviets committed horrible atrocities against us and were by far the greater evil. Growing up he told me stories of fighting the commies and killing those bastards. Look i know atrocities occur in war on both sides and the Latvian SS did do some horrific things including taking part in Genocide. My grandfather even knew Herberts Cukurs, who is notorious for his crimes. My grandfather and his buddies were not involved in any of that. They only killed russians. Now in University we had a discussion about WW2 and I got my Grandfather to come over to speak. He comes he relives his childhood growing up in Latvia, soviet Union and fighting the Soviets. People were so rude to him. They would ask him questions such as \"why the fuck would you join the nazis\" \"oh how many jews are you responsible for killing\" \"i hope you burn in hell for your crimes.\" One Israeli exchange student stands up and calls my grandfather a Latvian hitler and goes on about how he and the israeli people will never forgive my grandfather for what he did. I just about had it at this point and I scream at his face to shut the fuck up and tell him I'd knock him out if he or anyone else ever disrespected my grandfather again.I then remind everyone of the horrors of Soviet occupation of my country (nobody in the class is from the baltic region so they are unfamiliar) and explain how living under the soviets was hell. We starved and lacked basic human rights for the 50 years. Anyone who fought to prevent that was a hero in my eyes.  The Israeli  then proceeds to call my grandfather a nazi again and say that he belongs in prison for working with the nazi and that they should've joined the soviets. I just about lose it and with all my might gave him a right hook deeply cutting his lip. He didn't get up from the floor but the class was in awe. I am now under investigation from the school administration and facing expulsion.  ",

      "description": "Ok so for starters, there's a bit of information about myself/my in-laws(who this pertains to) that will perhaps help you better understand both sides, but isn't absolutely necessary to the story so feel free to skip to the ~~ break if you don't want to read it.\n\n\nAlright. So I'm a \"Third Culture Kid\"(TCK) who was born in \"Birth Country\"(BC) and moved to \"Adopted Country\"(AC) when I was just a couple months old. I'm leaving out the details of which countries, because it's crazy easy to find me on Google. I have never lived in BC, and from a cultural standpoint am about 95% AC. I do have some cultural tidbits from AC from my parents, but they are few and far between. I was bullied horrendously as a child for being a TCK, which has left me extremely shy and not much for sharing my emotions or thoughts because it used to be what would always get me in trouble. I also have chronic depression and anxiety that has carried into my adult years and marriage.\n\nI am married to a native of AC who loves, understands and accepts me for who I am, but his parents do not. They try to accept and love me, but they do not understand me as a person. They're very talkative and open people, who think family should share everything and anything. Even while we were dating, they would get clearly annoyed with things I would do(or not do rather), and always blame it on me being from BC... It annoyed me, because no, that's just who I am and it has nothing to do with where I was born, but I figured no harm, no foul, better they pin it on that then get angry with me personally. However their annoyance with me has never settled down and carried into the current situation, and it's getting a lot worse. So here we go.\n\n\n~~\n\n\nMy husband and I had been living in a flat we began renting right after our marriage. At the start of this year though, our landlord raised the rent and we decided to finally move. We'd been casually looking to move for about 8 months at that point, but nothing had shown up that would suit our very particular needs. We've got two rescue dogs, one of which has health problems galore and cannot walk on stairs, and the other has sever separation anxiety and can't be left home alone. So we needed a place that would accept two dogs, was on the ground floor, and had a yard or room or something that we could cater to the needs of the other dog to be able to leave him there. (if he's in a room that has anything in it, he will destroy it into tiny, tiny pieces) Not surprisingly, this is why after 8 months we still hadn't been able to find a place.\n\nSo then we came up with an idea to move in with my husband's aunt. She's around 60 and lives alone in a private house with a huge amount of empty land that we can fence off for the dogs, and the house has a layout that's nicely suited to living with somebody. The only downside was that it's about 100 years old, and so we decided to renovate the rooms that would be ours before moving in.\n\nCue the problems. One thing about the culture of AC is that they are very very pro family. Very. Too much. So rather than helping us pay for say, I dunno, a company to do the renovations for us, my husband's family decided they would do the renovations. Which is all well and good, they do know what they're doing, but it means a lot of time is going into this because there's only so much two or three people who are working other jobs can do, and there's a lot that needs done in a 100yo house. I wasn't a part of anything, because I had to stay home and babysit my rescues.\n\nWe moved in before the renovations were finished. This is again because of our needy dogs, a move is going to be stressful for them and I have this week off of work so I wanted to be able to help them settle down. Especially my little bundle of anxiety who cannot bear to be without his momma(me). One room is basically finished, so we're in there for the time being, while the men continue to work on the other room. This means though, that now I am going to be around while they're working instead of at home, and boy oh boy has my FIL got a beef to pick with me. I had only been here for one day of work, on Saturday(we moved Friday evening, and on Sunday they didn't do anything), and after they finished that day my FIL told my husband that he no longer wants to do anything for me and is only continuing for his sake, not mine.\n\nHe's upset and offended that I haven't thanked them for their hard work... That they haven't finished yet. Which, ok, I know there's some people and I think in America it's much more normal to shower people with praise all the way through things, but that really isn't the cultural norm here, at all... We're well known for being grumpy and hating the world, and I by all means fit that stereotype. Plus I just don't talk a lot, period. I fully plan to offer heartfelt and sincere gratitude when they're finished, give them a gift, spend the day with them(I avoid my in-laws like the plague normally, and they don't really appreciate the fact that normally when we visit it's with at least one dog), etc. as a thank you and call it good.\n\nI never asked them to do everything, they offered. I dunno about other people but when I offer to do something, I honestly don't care if I get thanked or not--I do it because I want to, not because I want praise or gratitude. So long as whoever is happy, I don't need them to necessarily \"share\" that with me. I can see it, I'm good.\n\nThere was another situation before when my MIL made a \"joke\" to my husband at my expense when I wasn't helping with the painting because I'm allergic to the paint, telling him he should have had me fill out an application before we got married to see if I wasn't going to cause problems like that in the future. He wasn't happy, and didn't talk to her for a couple days following that.\n\nHonestly I just feel so frustrated with my in-laws at the moment, they've always made me feel inadequate as a DIL because I was a TCK, they've never understood(or made an effort to) my mental health, in theory they know that I'm a reserved person who doesn't share my feelings on my sleeve and don't talk a lot. However they are open books with their feelings though, and like I said very pro family, and they don't seem to get that this is how I am with my own parents as well. Not just them. I'm no longer certain though if the problem lies in them not understanding me, or me actually just being an asshole?\n\nI was trying really hard to condense this and not make it too long, feel free to ask clarifying questions because I did leave out some things. x.x\n\n\n(I would ask that you please be mindful of the fact that this isn't America, and the culture here IS very different. Not using that to justify myself, if indeed I am an asshole, but to clarify that what is generally accepted in the USA doesn't always apply here)\n\n\n\nTL;DR My in-laws offered to do renovations for us, I don't thank them part-way, and they no longer want to help me.",

      "description": "This post is going to be long as some context is required. Also, I'm really sorry for an inconvenience or grammatical errors as I'm on mobile.\n\nAlso, I'm using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nMy dad and I have never been on good terms with each other, due to past falling outs and him being unjustly cruel, physically violent and abusive to the family. I resented him but my mom told me to let it go and so I did. \n\nHe takes part in activities that I'm sure are inappropriate for a married man and he constantly insults us behind our backs. To him, friends have always been, and always will be, more important than family. \n\nA few months back, he told my mom that she had to make do with 300 dollars for the next five months as he had no money. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. I knew that he had money but was just refusing to give it, as he didn't care.\n\nSo, when he asked me to do some accounting work for him so he could be reimbursed his travelling expenses, I told him that I would be taking all the money that came from it. He reluctantly agreed as he had no other option. \n\nMy mother and brother agree that this was a good move but I feel like this was a kind of doucheove from my side and that I had abandoned some of the morals I upheld. I am still unsure about this decision and my dad does pester me about it.\n\nI plan on giving it to my mom for her use but am still ill unsure whether it was the right thing to do. \n\nSo, users of reddit, AITA?

      "description": "So this stemmed from a conversation my GF and I were having last night. We’re both 22 years old and we’ve been together for 7 months. We’ve always had very open conversation about our past, including relationships and such with no issues. Shes been with a lot more people than me so usually she’d be the one talking about other people to me. She never had any hesitation telling me about them and never asked if I was comfortable with hearing it. There were times where I said something made me uncomfortable but never made a big deal about it and never argued about it. Until last night.\n\nWe were talking about friends of the opposite sex and I was telling her I never really have female friends except for my first year of college. Which ended up with me becoming best friends with a girl at that time that I’m now not close with. I never liked or wanted to have women as friends most of my life. She starts telling me about how she’d just hookup with guys but never just had them as friends and details some of the situations. She had recently talked to a girl I was just gym friends with way before I met my girlfriend. We’ll call her Carly. They talked and then exchanged numbers. They had previously met before and I told her about her and that we “talked” but she forgot.\n\nShe then asks me to explain more about my friendship with Carly. I tell her we’d just see each other at the gym and didn’t hangout outside of it. I then tell her why I said to her before that we kind of “talked” because one time after the gym she gave off a more into me type of vibe and we had a very small and awkward make out. After that nothing happened and we just stayed being gym friends. \n\nThey conversation started to die out and then she became very distant and quite.I asked what’s wrong. She then snaps on me about how I made her uncomfortable and tells me that I shouldn’t have told her. Idk what’s the big deal about it and apologize for making her uncomfortable. It didn’t make sense when she always tells me things about other guys without even considering if I’d be comfortable with it. There’s even a time when she continued talking to a guy she got with while we were dating but not serious and didn’t see a problem with it at all or saw how it looked bad. She doesn’t talk to him now but she just assumed I would be okay with it at that time. She starts to talk with me again. Then out of nowhere she makes a comment about Carly again and decides to randomly delete her number in anger. Continue new convo and then another comment is made about Carly and she starts throwing around fuck that bitch and says how do you think this makes me feel stuff. \n\nI say it’s a double standard. You just brought up other guys earlier have a history of just assuming I would be okay with you talking to a guy still after you hooked up with them but I was just supposed to know this little thing was a big deal?",

I haven't seen her in several months and I'm afraid of dealing with the fallout of her finding out. I previously hid my transition from her by wearing my old guy clothes around her, but as my body developed and my breasts came in, my mom told me I need to wear loose fitting clothes around her so she doesn't notice. To give an idea of how much she's against LGBT people, my aunt came out to her 40 years ago and she still makes homophobic comments about it. I don't want to deal with her bigotry but I also feel badly that she's 84 years old and I'm sure wants to see me. I'm open to hiding my transition again in order to see her but it's going to be a lot harder than before.",

      "description": "Made a friend roughly 6 years ago and we hung out all the time. At one point, about 3 years ago, I brought up the idea of us dating. She turned me down politely because she just entered a new relationship. Things continued on as normal.\n\nNow, 3 years after, we’ve drifted a part a bit.\nWe only really each other up maybe once a month and hang out even less than that. Both of us are in relationships with other people.\n\nA few of weeks ago, we finally ended up meeting up and at the end of our hang out, she “confessed” that she has a crush on me and wants to date me. This completely blindsided me as we had been drifting apart and there was no indication of romantic feelings.\n\nI basically let her down friend-zone style as nicely as I could, and reminded her that we’re both dating other people. Night ended on a weird note.\n\nEver since then, she has texted me consistently asking what I’m up to or to hang out. I’m very busy so I have to keep declining. Then on Valentine’s Day I receive a not-so-cheap gift from her, and she texts me again that same night asking to hang out... on Valentine’s Day... while neither of us are single.\n\nThen a few nights later she tells me again that she has feelings for me and wants to date me. I basically repeat what I said before.\n\nThen *again*, the other night, she asks me how i feel and wants to know if I’ll date her. At this point I’m irritated and tell her that I don’t know what else to say- I’m in a happy relationship and I don’t want to date her. She responds with a very lengthy text explaining her feelings for me **again** and just wants to know if there’s a future for us.\n\nI didn’t respond, and haven’t responded to her texts since. I’ve been ignoring her on every form of social media as well. I feel awful about basically ghosting a long-time friend but I felt like I was speaking with a broken record.\n\nTL;DR: long-time friend continuously asks me to date her despite both us of being in relationships. I turn her down each time but she doesn’t stop asking, so I completely cut her off.\n\nAITA?",

We're basically living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThis month my gf got paid a little less than usual and won't be able to pay her half of rent and daycare. Which normally wouldn't be a big deal because earlier when she's been a little low on cash, she at least chips in a little bit towards those two things. I pay literally every other expense that we have. Streaming services, electric bill, gas, car insurance, everything. Which again is fine as long as she chips in on the two biggest expenses.\n\nBut this month she tells me she can't pay anything because she's going away for the weekend with some people from her choir. And that the hotel is going to cost pretty much half her salary. I get mad because I think her priorities are stupid and that she should have saved up for this trip months ago. She gets mad at me for being mad at her and just tells me it's her money and she can do what she wants with it.\n\nAITA for thinking she should use her money to support our child and pay rent, instead of going on this expensive weekend?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting a life of my own away from my parents?",
      "description": "My parents have coddled me and my brother for our whole lives. We're both undergrad college students right now. They also are super overprotective of us and didn't let us hang out with our own cousins or neighbors for long periods of time when we were children, so they were selective of who we were around or were influenced by. They track our phones with Find my iPhone and we were often lectured if we turned off find my iphone, turned off our phones, or didn't let them know where we were. My dad, mom, and brother are very nosy. There have been many occasions where I have had my texts snooped on, and I never was able to keep any of my personal relationships secretive.\n\nMy parents are really like... old style and aren't accepting at all. They didn't give me a choice on where I could go to college. They wanted me to go to a specific college which has a \"good reputation\" in our area and seems to be the \"best\" college. I put quotes around these because this college offers the same programs that any other \"lower\" colleges in my area offer. So I was forced to go to that college. Parents were disappointed when my brother didn't get into that college and had to go to the second best option. He's trying to transfer to my college now.\n\nMy brother on the other hand isn't as vocal as me. He just stays quiet and obeys anything they say. If you compared me to him and my parents, I would be the rebel or the odd one out. He's the favorite child. He agrees with them about the reputation and college stuff, so I have no one to really rely on or agree with.\n\nMy parents say that they worked very hard for us to get where we are, and for us to get to college. I'm first generation and they're immigrants, so they want us to earn lots of money with jobs that we can get with education and not physical labor jobs. They always say that me or my brother will buy them a house in the future and that our first check or at least a portion of our salary will go to them. They say that we have to take care of them when we're older and expect us to do so. Sometimes they joke, but most of the time they're serious. They won't let us move away from them because they expect us to support them when we're older.\n\nI always contest and say that I'm moving far away from them to do my own thing. I don't want all that I've worked for to go to my parents first before I can do stuff for myself, like support my own family. My parents call me ungrateful sometimes for wanting to do my own thing. I know that they worked hard for me and put in a lot of money for me, but it just seems unfair that they want most of my salary in the future to go to them. It's also unfair how they treated me and how they gave me almost no choice in my own education. If they hadn't forced me to do so many things and been so overprotective, then maybe in the future I would help them out. AITA for wanting to have my own life away from them?",

      "description": "I couldn't get ahold of my regular hairdresser I go to since she was out of town, so I decided to stop at one of the chain haircut places (the in and out places that a mall would have).\n\nAt the time (M21) my hair normally was about 3 inches long, I told the woman I just wanted to trim it up to look more presentable, I had washed my hair just before so she just went to cutting, style was kept the same, and she did an okay job, the issue happened when I went to go pay.\n\nThe price they charged let's just say came to $21.25 (I dont remember exactly), but I would have paid with $30, expecting three $1s, a $5 and some coins less the tax. She hands me just a $5, at the time I collected coins, so I noticed she short changed me and I asked her about it. She goes back into the register, gives me the three $1 (short changing me for a 2nd time) and then asks if I want singles for a tip.\n\nAt that point I was just irritated with her, said no, and walked out. I thought about it a few times after that thinking I'm an asshole for doing that, but at the same time I feel like I may just be hard on myself for no reason.",

      "description": "About um... at least two months ago (time is not my strong suit) a girl confessed to having a crush on me. She had a boyfriend at the time, but we're both polyamorous so that didn't really matter. She told me that she had asked her boyfriend if she could ask me out, and he had said yes. So, we started dating. \nIt was just recently that I discovered through DMs and some screenshots that she had in fact never gotten explicit permission—she had asked how her boyfriend would feel about it, but not specifically if she could date me. He stated that if they were to be in a polyamorous relationship he would be most comfortable with me as his metamour (a member of your polycule that you are not dating, so your partner's partner, partner's partner's partner and so on,) but not much more than that. She genuinely (or so I believe at the moment, since I can relate) forgot to tell her boyfriend that we had started dating until probably at least a week in. When I talked to him later that night about something, he didn't seem upset at all even when I talked about her in, you know, a more romantic way (I called her princess and stuff, because she likes it.) By the time I found out she and her boyfriend had already broken up. I'm still dating her. \nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Background: I was around 16-17 when I stopped talking to my mum verbally. I forgot why, but I guess something inside me just went off. I live with her and have for a while.\n\nI have two younger sisters and a father. A few months before I stopped talking to my mum, she kicked out my sisters without any notice, just as they got home from school. My parents divorced and had a messy marriage. My dad was physically abusive and narcissistic, but I still do see him and even talk to him, especially when I'm studying with him. Both sisters live with him.\n\nDuring the divorce, my mum was awarded both the 7-bedroom house and his investment property. And from what I was told, she nearly got his current flat, but I won't get too much into how she didn't get it, as legality may be a bit confusing.\n\nNow, my mum is clearly not taking it well. Sometimes I feel sorry and bad for her, sometimes I just feel extremely annoyed and not empathetic. I suspect that a year before I stopped talking to my mum, she prevented me from seeing my dad, but she denies this. I had proof, but that phone broke, and now I have to depend on my memory, and I've been made to believe that I remembered things wrong.\n\nEvery time I look at her, I just feel mildly angry. Her state consists of noticeable liposuctions and cosmetic surgeries. To me, she is a daily reminder of where all the money that she claimed to not have for me to shower daily and have heating, went. From what I know, she never worked a full-time job in her life. There's always an excuse.\n\nThen again, she does take care of me and buy me clothes. Even though I cook my own meals and take care of myself, she has and still does her part. Am I crazy and the asshole here?",

I transferred to a college in LA for this past year; previously I went to one an hour away from home for two years. \n\nSo my 21st birthday is coming up, and I’m planning on spending with Thursday night to Saturday morning with my friends over at my old college. \n\nMy family’s pretty upset at me - they already don’t like it when I spend time away from home over breaks. It’s worse because it’s also my birthday. My mom and sister really wanted to take me out in the evening for dinner and spend time together. \n\nThe thing is that I do spend a lot of time with my family and I do care about them a lot. I do feel that it’s somewhat disrespectful that they paid for my flight and they are my family and I’m choosing to spend my 21st with other people. However, we also do have a pretty complicated relationship (family is both the reason I stayed closed for two years and then moved acrossed the country).\n\nI also really want to spend time with my friends in New York (we’ve stayed very closed even with the distance). With one of them graduating this year and me gone, we don’t have much time to spend as a group. Also, my family doesn’t drink, and I do want to celebrate my 21st in a pretty typical fashion with my closest friends. \n\nI brought it up to my mom before I came home multiple times and she brushed me off every time. Eventually, I decided to go without her input and she’s not stopping me, but she’s pretty passive aggressive about it and obviously hurt. \n\nI’ve always struggled with knowing how much of my time I should give to my family and how much I owe to myself, but I really can’t tell here. So am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR; my non drinking family wants me to spend my 21st with them; I’m planning on spending it with my college friends instead. ",

Well, his profile was hot, but in person, he wasn't someone I would normally go after. But he said he was just visiting, and my other FWB was out of town, so I knew this was just gonna be a one time thing, so I said why not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn't really getting off, so mid-coitus I reach for my phone and ask \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you watch porn?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim: Yea, sometimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Okay \\*\\*Pulls up porn\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim (after seeing the thumbnail): Okay, no thanks to that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I put my phone away and continue fooling around. I tell him I'm getting tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim: Okay. Should I go then?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Yeah, my family might come back soon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ask him if he wants me to walk him out, but he refuses.\n\n \n\nHe gets back on grindr and messages me \"Thanks for the shitty day, if you're not into someone, say it before so I don't exchange sexual energy with someone who doesn't embrace me as a soul.\" Then he says that I played porn without consent, and that I triggered his sexual trauma. He accused me of playing games and putting him on the spot when I asked about the porn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI of course apologized for the awkward hookup and triggering his trauma. I thanked him for coming over anyway, because I did genuinely enjoy his company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here's the thing. I didn't know he was a sexual trauma victim. Obviously that's something to take very seriously, but as far as I know, everything I did was consensual. I asked if he wanted to watch porn, and then when he got uncomfortable I put it away. Sure it may be an uncomfortable question, but that is why I asked. Communication, right? And when I realized that I wasn't really getting anything out of the hookup, I told him that I was tired, and he took it as a signal to leave. So that's also consent. Just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean that I didn't get his consent at every step, and same for him. He got my consent at every step. How was I supposed to know that it wasn't going to go well. The whole point of getting consent is to avoid giving people trauma. But how am I supposed to get consent if simply asking a question (while we're already having sex mind you!) triggers the trauma?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I let him talk about his opinions and feelings, and he did mine. He still thinks I wronged him, but he was at least glad that I listened to him.  ",

Thirty minutes after it was scheduled to arrive, I called him and asked his whereabouts in relation to the restaurant. He said “I dunno I’m not even at the restaurant yet” and I said “okay, please hurry, my lunch is about to end” and then he hung up on me. He arrived fifteen minutes later, after my lunch had already ended. He never contacted me after the phone call. \n\nVery upset and hungry, I posted a review on DoorDash’s Facebook page, explaining what happened and giving the employee’s first name and last initial so that others could avoid experiences with him in the future. Two people commented on my post, one stating that the same guy never delivered her and her coworkers $75 worth of food, leaving them without a meal and out of $75. He wouldn’t answer his phone. The other person said that he never delivered their food, either, but that the restaurant confirmed it’d been picked up, and he wouldn’t answer his phone, just like with the other person. \n\nThey wanted him to get fired, and were very vocal about it.

      "title": "AITA for pushing my mother to get her own apartment so I can move on with my life, knowing it causes her stress?",
      "description": "I want to make something very clear right off the bat,  my mom and I have an amazing relationship and I love her with all of my heart. Myself (F21) and my mom have lived in the same apt for over a decade.  It's a kinda crappy little spot, but when we first moved to the city it was necessary and we made it our home. Our lease is up for renewal again, and I'm honestly wanting to leave here for a litany of reasons, none of which involve her. To sum it up the landlord and neighbors are absolute terrors and I'm often uncomfortable in my own home, this is a new-ish thing too so please don't give her slack for putting us here, things were very different in this area a decade ago. The problem is my mom does not accept change well. To the point that she went back to college years ago to get a degree that she hasn't made any effort to use because she's comfortable in the job she's had for over a decade despite the pay being sub-par. I'm about to be starting what is considered in my area to be a fairly high paying career, and my SO has an amazing job as well. We could easily afford an apartment and it would be beneficial to both of us to have our own space. However, the rent in this apartment is far too high for my mother to pay on her own.  When child support was coming she was OK, and when I was of age I stepped up and paid my own way, but now I can't help but feel stuck here. Here's where I think I might be TA. I can't help but feel the situation is unfair to me, as I don't want to live in this apartment and I would like to begin my life elsewhere, but I love my mom, and I know how hard change is for her. This puts me in an uncomfortable situation, and the fact that she blows me off every time I try to have a conversation about it just makes it worse. I know she's afraid of change and I know moving does awful things to her, but I still can't help but feel like her fears are conflicting with my growth and it's frustrating. She gets frustrated and won't have a conversation about it, won't let me help find an apartment for her, she just says everything is fine as is. I don't feel heard, but lately I've just felt awful about bringing it up, and now another lease contract is due in about a month and I don't think I want to sign it. Part of me says it's just another year, another part of me asks how many years I'm willing to wait. I don't want her out of my life, but I'm afraid she'll resent me for pushing her too hard to move. So AITA for wanting us both to move on with our lives, even if it causes her stress?\nTldr; mom can't afford the apartment we share on her own, but I want to move out,  which would screw her financially if she stayed here, but she's unwilling to leave her comfort zone",

We had been talking for over 6 months, had a 130 day streak on snapchat, and were facetiming almost every day. We had shared a lot of deep stuff and been quite open with each other. Obviously, I had feelings for her, which I made obvious to no success a few months prior.\n\nNow the girl came to Colorado, and we hung out a couple times. We went to the movies, and then we Netflix and Chilled two nightd in a row. First night nothing happened between us, just some flirting, and she was kind of shy. Second night this happens:\n\n15 minutes in, she gets a call from a friend she instantly takes. Her Friend goes:\n- Hey, can you go on a date with this guy so you can hook me up with his friend?\n- Sure, whatever. Says the girl im hanging out with\nafter some talking I hear the following from the friend:\n- Won't your boyfriend be mad?\n\nI instantly shifted my mood, as I was shocked and pissed as I wasn't aware of this boyfriend. She seemed like it was normal for her to not mention she had a boyfriend after Netflix and Chilling two days in a row, in my couch, in a dark room. I cut things short there, especially as the boyfriend was not aware of what was going on, and cut most ties with the girl. \n\nAITA?",

I was taken back by this, and just dismissed it. Letting him know that he never will. He then proceeded to get upset, until he just blurted out that I’ve been with “many people” which followed with “of course you’re ready to settle down.” I just thanked him for expressing his feelings, and moved on from it.  \nI’m a super passive person so of course I just dismissed it. This was the first count. \nA few weeks later, while I was with him  he proceeded to ask me about a possible threesum. Which I turned down instantly.  He was visibly angry by this, yet again. Following this, he than pressed on and asked if why not tons of times.  Me again being passive, just gave in and stated if he ever wanted to sleep with another woman, it wouldn’t matter as long as he came home along with the condition that I wasn’t aware. \nMy boyfriend is aware of me being a extremely passive, and often calls me a “doormat””.  I would have forgotten about it all but today he kept going on  how attractive a girl was. Not in a soft manner either. Just blurted out“wow she’s really hot, she’s got a fat ass”. I suddenly got visibly sad he got very upset. \nI’ve since then explained my emotions, and tried to stand up for myself when he just called me “irrational” and “too emotional “. \nI know I gave into his wants but only after he pressured me into it. \nAm I the asshole for being upset here?

I honestly wouldn't have dated them if I didn't think they were great guys and everyone is an adult (late-20s). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of this, I didn't think twice about continuing to talk a bit more often to one of my exes even though he has a girlfriend...as I said, I'm still on speaking terms with all of my exes and even some of their new girlfriends. Our discussions never went anywhere near inappropriate (only about work and his vacation) and he and I haven't dated for over 5 years. He suddenly asked about my dating life (we haven't seen each other in person in a couple of years due to me around). This raised a red flag immediately. I opted to just be silent until I could figure out what to say and he back peddled hard within a few minutes. He stated he was in a happy relationship and he was just curious. So stupid me let me guard down and answered that no I wasn't dating anyone. He then turned it back around and started claiming how he still felt this connection between us, wanted to know if he still had a chance, and said that he just didn't feel the same about his girlfriend of a couple years. I tried to shut it down as fast as possible saying that if he felt unhappy with her that he needed to talk with her and that I wasn't the type of girl to ever get in the middle of another relationship. He backed down and put the conversation more neutral. I continued to text him back but was careful to not let him do something like that again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that I've thought about it more and more, I feel like I shouldn't have let him off so easy and that I'm a bad person for texting him back politely. I haven't said anything to his girlfriend and a part of me feels like I should have done that. But I don't actually know her, and I really don't want to get involved. I probably should cut off contact completely, but there is a part of me that just doesn't want to cut off contact because I have spent years of my life caring about him and his family. I also don't think he's a bad guy...although the current situation isn't earning him any points. And I guess I should also state that I don't want to date him again, so it isn't some twisted thing like that...I just genuinely enjoy his friendship. So AITA for not cutting contact off immediately and for not bluntly calling him out on his behaviour?",

      "description": "My girlfriend is a very bad backseat driver. She yells at you whenever basically anything happens, tells you what gear you should be in/how fast you should be going (often when she's objectively wrong) and sits there 'panicking' about perfectly normal things that happen all the time. I'm not the best driver in the world, but she takes it way, way, way too far.\n\nThe thing is though, she's an excellent (if a little dangerous and overconfident) driver herself and has given me about a billion lifts throughout our relationship. I've been paying my dues back ever since I got my license, but every time I drive her anywhere I end up incredibly angry at her and very frustrated.\n\nI've told her about a million times to cut the shit, but she just ignores me and says 'I should just drive safer'. Every time I end up saying stuff like 'I'm just going to stop giving you lifts', but I end up driving her around anyway because I owe her a LOT of lifts. She openly admits that she does this to friends and family too, which is horrifying to me.\n\nA week ago, I was on a roadtrip with her from my grandparent's (which is about a 5 hour drive away). She had (and has) a broken wrist so I'm the one driving, and of course the entire time she's in my ear about one thing or another. I mostly just ignore her, but a couple of times I get angry with her and tell her to quit it, but she never stopped. When we got home, I gave her the same tired line: 'next time you need to go somewhere, find somebody else'.\n\nToday she texted to ask for a lift to and from work today, with barely any warning. Her work is about half an hour drive away, so that's effectively two hours of driving for me to take her there and back both times. To be fair, the reason she needs a lift is legit: she's still hurt, and parking at her work is going to be impossible today due to some event.\n\nI don't want to, I don't think she deserves it, and she's unapologetically awful to drive with, so I refused, citing her behavior during the roadtrip, and she got very very very angry with me.

They report these non-buying morons coming into the store leaving book/magazines lying around *is an increasing hassle for them.*  They said employees spend about 3 hours a day picking up after these people.\n\nI have no problem commenting to these people when they get up from their tables leaving their mess.  I haven't yet used the *asshole* epithet against them.  But I might do so soon when they take exception to being told to \"clean up your mess.  Pick up your shit.  Dump your trash.\"",

      "description": "Background: This past fall my parents asked if we (my family and my sister and brother-in-law) wanted to go on a vacation with them. We are all very close and it was a no-brainer to say yes. My dad had been sick with cancer for years, was getting worse, and wanted one last trip all together. My dad had the reins - it was his trip - and he picked out an amazing house in Fort\n\nMy dad passed away just after Thanksgiving. I have mixed feelings about the vacation because I know it’s going to be hard in a lot of ways. But ultimately it is a trip in his honor and he would want us to go. The best way I can describe my feeling about going is the trip feels sacred. \n\nMy MIL lives about 3 hours away in FL. When she originally found out about the trip she was hurt that we hadn’t told her about it/invited her and I explained that it was about my dad and about the limited time we had together. She seemed to get it (though I know she was still hurt). \n\nRecently, she has been calling my husband to get details about our dates/where we’re staying, etc. so that she can take time off and come for a few days (I’m not sure exactly how long she wants to come but has made it sound like it wouldn’t be the whole week). My husband has been putting off telling her details because he doesn’t really want her to come either. \n\nI get it. She lives far away. Our daughter is currently 15 mo old and she doesn’t get to see her much. She wants to see us. But to me it feels like a complete invasion and I don’t want her there - even if it is only for a few days. AITA? ",

      "description": "Just for a little context, I personally believe that dog owners should pick up after their dog because I like a clean neighborhood...but here’s my problem. \n\nEveryday when I get off from work (usually around 10:30PM), I take my dog out for a walk. I usually like to not have poop bags in my kitchen garbage so I walk  towards the communal trash bins to dispose of it there. My dog unexpectedly took another poop right when we were almost towards the house. I start to grab a bag to pick it up, but I couldn’t see where he had pooped. It was night time, the porch light wasn’t on, and my phone had died so I couldn’t use my flashlight. \n\nIt was a long day so I was kinda like “ehh fuck it”. My neighbor saw me try to walk away from the mess and called me out. I explained my situation and told her I couldn’t see it. She then turned on her porch light, and what I saw was hundreds on dog turds on her lawn. This wasn’t little dog turds, but giant ones. My 20 lbs shiba’s mess  looked like nothing there. \n\nI told her it was absolutely ridiculous she’s causing such a scene when she had so much shit on her own lawn. She basically told me that this was her property and she was free to do what she wanted with it and that she demanded me to pick up after my dog. I did it of course but I thought she was nit-picking for no reason when her own lawn was covered it feces. I don’t understand how me leaving my dog’s shit on her lawn would even impact her life or her ungodly lawn.\n\n\nTL;DR: My neighbor wanted me to pick up after my dog but her lawn is already completely covered with dog feces.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

My dad chalks it up to me being fat (I’m 215 lb so I am) and “giving up”. He continues to violate that and keeps trying to get me in a relationship. Now when I say he’s crazy, I don’t mean kill-you crazy, I mean he hates practically everything that deviates from “normal” like coffee, alcohol, LGBTQ+, whatever. Now a couple months ago, he went crazy. He decided to, after my shift, still in the lobby, yell loudly “Hey u/IAbstainFromSociety! Look at that cute Asian girl over there (points to one of my co workers randomly)! Hard working, she’s cute.” This absolutely fucking infuriated me to the point of wanting to punch him in the lobby of the McDonalds I work at. Instead, I decide to compromise with myself and blurt out “She’s 20 you moron! Why won’t you respect my wishes!” That shut him up and he got very embarrassed. He runs off back to his car and I run to it too. He apologizes profusely but doesn’t mention any of the my wishes part. The girl was 14, and I knew that. Am I the asshole for doing this?",

      "description": "So rewind back to senior year of high school, there was this SUUPPER fine ass girl (let's call her gisele) who was a junior and I was trying to get with (I would have been down to either date her or smash). So she was single and quite the party girl, and one of her friends was this huge ass dude (call him Dave), who always knew what parties she'd be at, etc. I would have done the normal method of approach however this girl was not an easy girl to talk to as she always hang out with her friends (cheerleaders) and reject anyone that talked to her in school. She was also a junior (however we were both 17 at the time). So I am friends with this girl who was the school thot, everyone would hit her up for $20 blowjobs (but she wouldn't have sex). \"Dave\" was one of her prime customers and she thought he was in love with her but he was just throwing her around, but that's a story for another day. I have her bring me to meet Dave, Dave knows who I am (I ran a music business during high school and got a lot of clout since one of my artists was getting famous and everyone knew him, also I made a lot of money selling dope) and decides I'd be cool to hang with. We chill a couple times, I invite him to a couple of parties and he goes but then gets scared when we about to go in since he don't know anyone there. One night we go to a Spanish party and he too scared to walk in so he says \"aye I got another party\" and we go. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the baddest girl in the world (at the time), Gisele, however we had smoked some super strong dope and I was on an addy which made me too fucking high to get lit since it wasn't really a party, rather it was a hoe house as there were only maybe 16 people there and 10 of them were either doing lap dances or fucking however Gisele was just sitting there, bored since she was looking to dance but she isn't a hoe so she wouldn't dance with the people just tryinna fuck. That was my motherfucking chance but I was SO FUCKING high, I couldnt do anything other than babble some syllables. That was my chance and I missed it. I still keep fucking with Dave to try and get another chance but the opportunity never comes. I was only friends with Dave to get with Gisele so over time we stopped chilling. After a later time, I found out he was using me to get to parties (which is fucking wierd since he never went in) and for some dope (but he matched every time so it didn't make sense). He also wanted to be cool with me because I was making money and working with music artists. We'd never chat in the halls, or anywhere other than at a party.\n\n\n Am I the asshole for using him or is it negated since he was using me?",

      "description": "I met this woman Sarah on a dating app a month ago.  On my profile I specifically state that I don't want to date anyone with kids.  On Sarah's profile there is no reference to her having any children.  Sarah and I have gone out 4 times and had our 5th date a few nights ago.  Things were great.  We have a lot in common.  She's funny, charming, and attractive.  I thought I'd hit the dating jackpot.  At no point during any of these dates did Sarah mention having a child.\n\nWell during our most recent date we went out for drinks and a few minutes after we sat down Sarah came clean.  She admitted she has a daughter from her previous marriage, and that she was afraid to tell me because she knew I'd turn her down if I had known ahead of time.  I asked her if that was why she had no reference to her daughter on her profile and she told me she'd been turned down so many times because of her daughter that she had to make a new profile.  She said she figured that if I got to know her better she thought I could overlook this \"no kids rule\" that I have and be happy with her.\n\nI told her that I couldn't just overlook this.  I paid for our drinks and left.  She sat there quietly staring into her drink as I left.  I didn't hear from her until this morning when she texted me asking if we could talk.  I told her there wasn't much to talk about, but that I recommend she be more honest in the future to avoid hurt feelings.  She told me I was being a selfish asshole and that my hatred of kids was a very ugly trait.  I blocked her.\n\nWas I an asshole?  Was I too cold and not understanding enough of her problems here?  Is this an understandable lie given how hard it can be for single parents to date?  I feel justified in ending things, but maybe I was too harsh in the way I did it?",

      "description": "In my town we have a really nice dog park that requires the dog owner pay an annual $400 fee plus provide records that our dog(s) are up-to-date on shots and the like.  For the past 4 years I have been a regular at this park, always paying my dues and having the appropriate records on file.\n\nSo yesterday I put my two dogs in the car, drive over to the dog park (which only takes about 5 minutes), and realize I forgot my dog park pass.  I immediately think to myself, \"Damn.  Do I go home to get the pass or do I just ask someone to let me in?\"  Now, those with access to the dog park take this rule fairly seriously.  You are strictly told by the town to not let people in.  But as I look into the park I notice a dog owner that I know really well.  I know her dog (who plays with my dogs), I know her husband, I know personal information like about their daughter, etc.  We are very friendly and she definitely knows I have always had access.\n\nSo, I go up to the fence and get her attention and ask her if she would let me in.  The exact way I put it was \"[Her name], do you mind letting me in?  I forgot my pass.\"  To which she responds, \"Sorry, no, I've had my pass revoked in the past for letting people in.\"  \n\nI immediately say I understand, give a polite thanks anyways, get in my car and go back to my house to get my pass.\n\nWhen I return the woman comes up to me and says she was glad I was able to get in, and she proceeds to tell me she never did have her pass revoked, that's just a line she gives to avoid confrontation.  I immediately felt like an asshole that I put her in a position where I asked her to break the rule AND where she had to lie to me.  Now, I did later learn that you don't lose your pass if you let someone in unless you do it multiple times, and even then there is a way to appeal (which I believe in my situation, that would be the case).  However, I still felt like an asshole because I did ask her to break the rule.\n\nI told this story to my friend who said I shouldn't feel bad.  He told me I was fine for asking if she'd let me in since I do have access to the park.  It's my right to be there.  He also said the woman is also not an asshole here because she has a right to say no and to follow the rules.  And let me be clear, at no point in this exchange was I mad at her.  I thought I was the asshole.\n\nMy friend told me to post this story here to see what Reddit users thought.\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole?\n\nTLDR: Asked to be let into a dog park.  Felt bad I asked a person to break the rule for me.",

      "description": "I work at a laser tag arena as a rule enforcer and often have to remove people from games for breaking the rules. In this particular instance the person removed was there celebrating his birthday.  We have 5 simple rules that we require people to follow; no climbing, no running, no physical contact, hold the laser gun with both hands, and no foul language put downs or intimidation. Removal of rule breakers is generally left up to those of us in the arena.\n\nThe game where the kid got removed had 40+ people including the workers packed into a 4500sq foot room with obstacles. There was a good amount of running going on in this game and we had to do a global final warning, and shortly after the birthday boy ran right past me and I kicked him out much to his parent's displeasure. They kept saying that I should've given him another chance but I stuck by my original decision.  So AITA?",

      "description": "Me and my ex-partner had a relationship for nearly 6 years, being engaged for two of them. My partner suffers from problems such as social anxiety, depression and attempted suicide, however through the high's and low's we were completely committed to being with each other. This Halloween, my partner asks for us to split up on the reason that everything was getting too much (with her social anxiety, depression) and that we needed space. However, she stated that it was only until she worked things out and that she still had the same feelings, and would probably get back together anyway. After  a week, she said that the actual reason is that she didn't love me anymore which left me incredibly confused. \n\nWe argued back and forth and we tried to move on, however for the past month I've been wanting to try and salvage anything from the time we were together. The problem I had was that we never tried to rectify or fix anything wrong in the relationship, such as the reasons why she didn't love me anymore. These were issues like not treating her the way she should (she's completely right) and that she felt alone. Over the past year I've been dealing with depression also from a multitude of reasons, so I can completely see where she's coming from. However I'm alone in thinking that we should at least try to salvage anything through talking, seeing what she wants, and attempting to fix what has gone on. We agree that our first 5 years were the best of our lives, but now already she's \"moved on\", has a new boyfriend (that has contradicting accounts from her and her parents) and it's \"too late anyway\" to try and attempt to fix it.\n\nI feel like i'd have no problem in moving on if we tried everything and it just didn't work out, because I can accept that sometimes people just aren't meant to be. But we didn't, it was just left to die without even attempting to fix or acknowledge the issues before we broke up. Now, she has me blocked on all messaging services bar Messenger, and will refuse to see me or talk on the phone. I am completely at a loss.\n\nReddit, AITA for wanting to attempt to fix my ex-partner's 6 year relationship?",

      "description": "Hi all, looking for input on a work situation which is making me frustrated, but nobody else at the organisation thinks is a big deal.\n\nI work for a combined education centre and museum in a country where English is not the first language but is mandatory in schools, and as we have many international groups visiting a lot of our materials are needed to be translated to English, and some seminars and tours are also offered in English. I come from a different country where English is also not the mother language, but as an adolescent/young adult I went to study then work for 8 years in the UK, so I seem to have got a reputation as an English expert in my current workplace. However, I am by no means perfect yet alone qualified to translate, and I find on the spot translation very difficult, simultaneous translation impossible, and written translation ok, but to be honest, boring.\n\nMy workplace has agreements with professional translators, but their fees are high, and rightly so - they have impressive skills and talents. To save money though, for anything that is not an official publication, bosses and colleagues start to ask me instead. I have several problems with this:\n\n1. It takes the time away from my actual job as a teacher who organises and conducts seminars/study visits etc. Rushing preparation for events because I have had to translate things for other departments makes me feel like I am not honouring my committment to my students properly.\n2. I end up being an assistant, not a professional. It is frustrating to plan a programme which I am really passionate about then have my boss order me to sit at the back and help those international participants who do not understand so well whilst a colleague delivers the programme and gets credited with my work.\n3. I feel used. Some staff in other departments who know nothing about me and have barely even said hello, just ring up and say they need translation without asking if I have time, or saying please or thank you. I feel you should have manners if you want a favour. I do say upfront if I really do not have time, but then they act really pissed off, which I do not think is fair.\n4. I just do not enjoy translation. I get that there are parts of jobs that just are not enjoyable, but this is way more than I feel I signed up for when being hired.\n5. I am not a native speaker and cannot guarantee that I will not make a mistake. I would be embarrassed and feel unprofessional if a letter went out to teachers with a mistake on it.\n6. Some of the other staff speak just as good English as I do anyway. Once I went with a colleague who was leading a German tour and had to summarise the information in English as we went along, and I completely went blank on some vocabulary and he jumped in and helped anyway, so I am not sure while I am always the one who gets told to interrupt my own work for translation.\n\nI have tried to raise this with my colleagues and bosses, but only one, who gets used in a similar way for another language, sympathises with me. My department boss first thought I was offended because I do not get paid a professional translation fee, saying herself that I am not a professional... I know that, and aside from insisting on overtime pay if I stay longer for this extra work, it is not about the money. Otherwise, she just does not see my problem. She keeps saying I should be flattered, and that English is a good skill I should be proud of, and makes me feel arrogant and spoiled for even raising the issue.\n\nI am worried that if I put my foot down too hard, I will get sacked and miss out on my actual job, which I love, when I am given the chance to do it.\n\nWhat do you think, reddit? Do I owe it to my colleagues to use my language knowledge, or are they taking advantage? Thanks for your input.",

      "description": "I have Taiwanese ancestry, and am currently living in the west doing my Masters. My girlfriend is friends with another student from the same university, who comes from China. We got along fine, until we were all sitting together eating lunch and one of her friends asked her what she thinks about the conflict, to which she responded with all seriousnes that she does not mind Taiwan people, but if they ever wanted to be independent china should kill them all for being traitors, and their opinion does not matter as they do not have a voice. I continued eating my meal. As she never was in any way offensive to me, I strongly assumed she was just being stupid and decided to inquire later about it. I did that over Messenger, and she confirmed that she was being serious and restated her opinion.\n\nThe same day I had a talk with my girlfriend and essentially told her that I would very much like her not to be friends with said person, as I felt that her beliefs were quite offensive. Just to be clear, this is not something I have ever done before. My girlfriend said that she does not care about other people opinions, and she never actually harmed any of us - which is true. She does not know I have Taiwanese ancestry, and I do not know how she would treat me if she did know. \n\nNow I am conflicted, if asking my girlfriend to break that friendship off. On one hand, she did not do any harm to us. On the other, I would not be friends with someone if my girlfriend found out that this person is a white supremacist.",

      "description": "Generic mobile apology, etc etc\n\nMy mom has been visiting my family for the last couple of days. While she's been here, she's been complaining about my dad's family. Recently, my dad's mother passed away and my aunt and her family have laid claim to everything she owned--her house, her possessions, etc. My mom is mad because this means that none of the other children or grandchildren (include myself and my siblings) have anything to get.\n\nHere are some necessary details:\n1. As far as I know, there was no will.\n2. My dad's mother lived in another country, with the aforementioned aunt and her family, who helped care for her in her old age.\n3. We have no relationship with my dad's mother. He married a woman of a different race, enraging my grandmother. She never had any interest in us because we are the black sheep of the family.\n4. This aunt, when she visits our country, often stays with my mom and dad. Sometimes, she's here for months at a time.\n\nNow I love family gossip and a good inlaw rant as much as the never person, but it started to aggravate me after a while. I told my mom, without raising my voice or being rude, that I didn't really want to hear any more. I don't understand how you can complain about someone and say that they're greedy and lying and then open your doors to them. It just felt like a lot of empty talk to me. I also don't feel like we had any reason to expect anything. My dad's mother had no love for us and it isn't like we ever tried to connect with her. Yes, it would have been nice if she had put her racism aside and taken an interest in us as we were growing up, or even just left us something small to let us know we meant something to her, but that didn't happen. And honestly, I don't want anyone saying they did me any favors, in this life or the next.\n\nSo anyway, my mom is upset with me because I said I don't understand why if she's angry with this person (my aunt), she would let her stay in her house. She said she's not angry, and I said that it sounds like it the way she keeps bringing it up.\n\nMy mom is an extremely giving and forgiving person, always willing to make sacrifices for someone else, but I think she lets people take advantage of her.

      "description": "Just some background on my past relationship— I was in a year-long relationship with a Filipino guy during college. He was very much a mama’s boy, and his mother was extremely jealous of any time he and I spent together. She also got pissed at him for spending $40 on my birthday gift— she thought he should be spending $20 or less, yet come time for her birthday, he dropped $200 on a designer bracelet for her. She was also unhappy (and very vocally so) about her son dating a non-Filipino girl. When I voiced my concerns he said that this was just a “Filipino” thing and that they’re very family-oriented and that I wouldn’t understand. I spent some time looking at various Internet forums and I found that a lot of people had similar experiences with Filipino in-laws. Eventually we broke up because of these issues, and I vowed to have more self-respect than to date someone whose family verbally harasses me and disrespects my culture. \n\nWell recently my friend wanted to introduce me to someone that she knew. Keep in mind that I am in my mid-20s now and I am honestly looking to settle down in a serious relationship with future potential. She showed me some pictures and I thought he looked cute. Then she said that he was Filipino and also that he still lived with his mom. I told her that I probably wasn’t interested in a date then, just because of my past experiences with a Filipino family. She somewhat ignored these remarks/laughed them off and proceeded to share my number with this guy. \n\nHe started texting me and I responded a couple of times. I also looked through his Instagram/Facebook and saw that he posted a lot of pictures with his family members, he made a post on Mother’s Day calling his mother the most important woman in the world, said nothing came before God and family. Asides from the whole family thing, I am not a religious person by any means and he didn’t seem to share the same hobbies as me. So the conversation grew stagnant and I eventually stopped responding. \n\nMy friend checked in with me a couple of days later and asked how it was going. I said I wasn’t into him, and that she shouldn’t have given him my number in the first place. I said, “I told you, I don’t like Filipino guys, and I’m also not some church-going girl.” Maybe I could’ve worded it better or not brought his ethnicity into it, I don’t know. \n\nAnyway I guess she told the guy this because now he is texting me and telling me I am a “racist cunt” and that I didn’t even know him so how could I make those assumptions, not every Filipino guy is the same, etc. I am not responding but I did tell my friend she shouldn’t have told this guy all this shit. She said that it was my fault for making assumptions. \n\nI feel like I was justified in expressing initial discomfort with the idea of dating someone whose culture I have historically been at odds with. I also feel like I did attempt to give this guy a chance, but all signs indicated that he was similar to my ex-boyfriend. Additionally, we had differing religious viewpoints and hobbies. \n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "First post: feel free to ask for more info if needed. \n\nWe have been together since we were 18 and 20. Regarding sexual partners, He doesnt keep count but it is significantly more than my partners. I can count the partners I have had on one hand. The penetration is what I have to feel safe about and that is rare with someone I just met.\n\nAbout five years ago, we dabbled in the swinger lifestyle. He said I brought it up back then but I don't remember ever saying it and aside from a little liquid courage or trying to appease him, I've never entered into these relationships on my own. Even after his not-so-subtle push for me to be a hot wife or a cam girl. He regularly encourages me to go get drunk and go home with someone, claiming he just wants to share me. I've never done it, because I don't want to. He insists I just won't admit I want to sleep with other people or get out of my comfort zone.\n\nI was molested as a child. During the early phases of our relationship and exploring intimacy, I even had breakdowns about conflicting feelings of being sexually touched and allowing myself to let it feel \"okay\". He knows my past. \n\nHe is a fantastic lover. He has studied my body and strives to give me so many orgasms, I lose count. Amazing! 10/10\n\nHowever, he has also put hidden cameras in our bedroom, more than once, after I made it  clear how it made me feel. One time, I did try to allow it to satisfy him but I hated being watched. He has coached me via text to mastubate and such while watching me, on a camera, I didn't know existed. \n\nWe recently started couples therapy. I've been in therapy myself about two months longer than our couple sessions, different therapist of course. \n\nTherapy seems to be going well and sometimes he can see my perspective but he recently asked me if we will ever have sex like we did, meaning allowing him to use all sorts of toys on me. I don't always enjoy it. I usually don't ask for it. When he asks and I decline he sighs and shows obvious disappointment. I'm processing a lot of my own trauma including the deceit I feel about the cameras and have only been willing to use toys a handful of times in the last 3 months or so. \n\nAITA for telling him that I like the sex we have without all the toys, restraints and additional partners? At least until I can process everything and feel safe again?\n\nIt's my body and I certainly can't predict when I'll suddenly feel like I'm trapped and being abused again but I'm trying to learn how to process and let it go. I'm trying to stay in my \"safe zone\" and proposed I do still enjoy it sometimes but I want to be the one to ask to do toys, etc because then I actually do want it versus him asking and me feeling guilted to oblige or having to tell him no and him being visibly disappointed. \n\nHopefully, I was clear. Thanks, reddit friends. ",

      "description": "This situation has be resolved, I’m just more or less curious as to what the internet might think.\n\nI’ve been with my girlfriend for over two years, and while we have our troubles, the relationship has been phenomenal. We usually go about fights by talking through them and we try to understand each other. It’s important to note that I have crazy anxiety, and I understand this and try my best to combat it. I know I might get dreadfully anxious due to something that doesn’t deserve it, and I will try my best to control it.\n\nSo my girlfriends dream job is to be a piercer. She’s pierced herself multiple times, pierced her friends multiple times, and she’s actually very good at it. I’ve pushed her into it as well, she deserves to follow her dreams. She tried and tried to get an apprenticeship, but people kept turning her down until now. She finally found someone willing to train her. She’s been going and having an amazing time, and I’m happy and proud for her.\n\nUnfortunately my anxiety has gotten the best of me here. I feel like there were too many independent variables, but that was an issue we were able to talk out. I had an issue with her piercing wherever she wanted, and her being the only girl surrounded by guys that she shares a passion with. Now for this part, I knew I was wrong. Whenever these issues pop up, I talk to her about why it upsets me, how I’m upset at myself for being upset, and then she walks me through why I should be more comfortable with it. She nearly never has to compromise because I know I’m in the wrong.\n\nNow here’s where the real AITA comes in. My girlfriend was over he other day and offhandedly mentioned something her teacher said.\n\nHe said, “So your boyfriend is okay with this?”\n\nShe said, “Yes.”\n\nHe said, “Good, I don’t want to have another boyfriend barge in because his girlfriend is piercing a penis.”\n\nAnd you know what, I took that wonderfully. We never talked about it happening, I never realized she might be piercing dicks, but I just figured hey, it’s a part of the job. I just let it go because it was her passion, and it genuinely did not bother me.\n\nShe goes to the salon, trains with her teacher, and has  a fantastic time. She gets off and calls me right away, tells me about her great day and so on. She then asked me, \n\n“Do you want your dick pierced?”\n\n“Well no not at all.” \n\n“Okay! Well then I’m going to have to ask someone else!”\n\nAnd there was the problem. The idea of her piercing dicks wasn’t an issue when it was a stranger. But the idea of her asking our personal guy friends to do it? I immediately had an issue with it. I don’t want her to know what one of our friends dicks look like, work related or not. It just bothered me a lot, and she simply could not understand why. AITA?",

      "description": "Me [19F] and 2 of my friends [19F and 20M; in a relationship] live in NorCal and were all planning to save money and move to SoCal together. 20M already has a place down there and the plan was for the three of us to find a 2-bed together once his lease expires in about 5 months. we had been talking about it for months and even had specifics figured out about how much we would each need to save for the move and how much we would each pay for rent every month. I was pretty stoked because I don’t have the best home life and they are both well aware of that. Me and 19F were going to find a place in Tahoe up until 20M came into the picture in 2017, so moving out together had been our plan for years.\n\nAnyway, they never directly talked to me about removing me from the arrangement but instead started saying things that implied that only the two of them were going and never told me why. I would feel better if I at least knew the reason why they decided to do this but I didn’t even get a heads up and I’m honestly pretty hurt. I’ve worked my ass off to save thousands of dollars for the move only to be silently pushed out of it, while the other 19F is unemployed with nothing saved up. Her prospects aren’t looking too good either, based on her performance when I (stupidly) vouched for her &amp; got her hired seasonally at my job. Would I be the asshole for confronting them about this?",

      "description": "So me and a friend both just found out about Stan Lee's death and honesty we're both fans of the guy and everything he's done and we obviously agree it's sad he passed. 95 is good fuckin going but still.\n\nI said to my mate *\"Looks like I'll have to add a filter for \"Stan Lee\" for a few days now.\"* and he gave me this look and told me that I was being a dick. I defended my statement by explaining the following but he wasn't having it.\n\nMy argument is, I'm not undermining his passing and I'm not telling people they shouldn't make posts, discuss his achievements and tell stories etc. All I'm just saying is, yes it's sad but I've honestly never been a mega fan. I appreciate his work but I'd rather every other post I see for the next week *not* be about this one thing so I'll add a filter and keep on enjoying other content on /r/all or stick to other specific subreddits.\n\nHe says I'm not being respectful and I'm being really insensitive. \n\nIf I had said, ***Oh for fuck sake I don't care\"*** I could understand but I was genuinely sad to hear the news. I just don't see the point in looking at hundreds of posts about a celebrity death for days every time it happens. It's the same reason I have a filter for \"Trump\" because I'm not using Reddit to discuss politics.\n\nI just want to watch funny videos, read funny threads and discuss topics that personally interest me... Sometimes I browse /r/all and I'd rather filter out stuff I find repetitive or I don't want to see... It's not an attack just a preference.\n\nOh and my mate to my knowledge isn't a huge fan either, he just got really funny with me for saying I was going to filter the posts.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

      "description": "Well, I tried to be concise but failed. Here's my short story about the first time I've broken up with someone and the resulting potential assholery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been seeing this guy for just under two months. This is the longest I've ever dated someone because I'm in my early 20s and working through some of my own issues, but this guy seemed really nice and we had a lot in common so I tried to make it work. He was also very receptive to the fact that this is the first time I was giving a relationship a shot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though I did enjoy being with him, I realized last week that I haven't been feeling much emotionally and I don't think I see it going anywhere. He would tell me that he missed me, how he wanted to do things and go places with me in the future, etc, and I'm nowhere near there. I didn't make those same comments and responded to them without talking about our future or saying that I missed him back. There were other things that added to the decision, but I'm blabbering. Knowing that we wouldn't workout, and also knowing that I wouldn't be able to see him until Sunday at the earliest, I did the deed. I texted him and ended it - very respectfully, but still via text. He seemed upset that it was via text and essentially called me childish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was hesitant to do it by text, but I didn't want to lead him on for days and pretend like I'm still interested to talk when I've made up my mind. I also can't imagine making him sit through dinner if I know I'm going to end it, or going out of his way to come to my house just for me to turn him away. Ideally I would go to his place and do it, but we just graduated so he lives with his parents and I was never ready to meet them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked online at a number of blogs that gave me some direction and said it's normal to do it via text if you've been dating for less than two months, but looking back how the hell does a blog know right from wrong? I weighed the facts -- we don't text a lot, never talk on the phone, and we've seen each other probably 6 times over the course of almost 2 months -- so I thought this was ok. Now I'm worried that I owed him more than I gave him and should have done it differently. Maybe I just feel bad because it's the first time I've ended any kind of relationship that's over two weeks old, or maybe I'm the asshole.",

      "description": "So I am trying to word this carefully, as the initial title is going to make most people automatically assume I am an asshole. So before judging please read the full amount.\n\nSo my wife is 7 months pregnant, and she basically has not had a fun time (obviously being pregnant). So i've taken over I would say 99.9% of the \"work\" in the house. This means all chores/all cooking/cleaning/etc..., also getting her everything she needs, rubbing her back constantly, etc...\n\nAnd I do this glady because, well being pregnant sucks and it's hard and I am not pregnant so im obviously able to do these things easier.\n\nHOWEVER, she has been getting upset here recently because well..it gets tiring to me obviously to have to be responsible for everything. Sometimes Im not 100% super excited to run up and down the stairs to get something 5 times in 30 minutes or go out at 11pm when im getting ready for bed since I have to get up early for work because she wants X food item. Or rub her back for the 5th time when im trying to get things done around the house. The thing she gets upset about is that I sometimes have a sort of look on my face of I would say \"Not exactly excited about what she's asking me\".\n\nNot let me preface this that I have 100% NEVER complained about any of this, I don't roll my eyes, I don't go \"UGH Seriously?\". Occasionally when it's SUPER late I will say \"Is there any way I can pick up X items tomorrow on my way home\" but I still end up going out. I work as a Nurse so my days can be quite long and I am tired some days naturally.\n\nBasically she gets upset because she can tell I don't want to do these things because I get tired sometimes, or I will occasionally want some alone time to decompress because I mean...im stressed too I mean I got my first kid coming and that's obviously stressful along with taking care of everything. Don't get me wrong im not trying to diminish her difficulties obviously as being pregnant I imagine is absolutely not fun...but does that mean I have to be 100% smiling rainbows all the time?\n\nI make sure to NEVER complain about anything and I have never ever said anything about it being inconvenient or anything. I just don't feel like it's abnormal to get a little tired of taking care of someone sometimes. I mean I know people that take care of sick people go through the same thing, SURELY they feel these emotions too?\n\nAITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Im (M27) and have lived in the same apartment for 5 years. I’ve been married for two years. My previous upstairs neighbors were great and I never heard them. In fact if I didn’t occasionally see them I would have assumed the upstairs unit was vacant. 7 months ago however we got new neighbors up there. It’s a single mom with a daughter I estimate to be 5. \n\nThe first week of them living there was fine, but then tragedy struck my peaceful and quiet world. I work from home mostly and all day I would hear loud music, and what sounded like they were dropping bowling balls on the floor for hours. They then got a puppy they would leave alone for hours on end that barked non stop. The mom would bring countless men over and have the loudest sex I’ve ever heard. Also they would let her child run and jump around until 2am. \n\nAfter talking to them about how loud they were I finally started to complain the landlord and nothing has been done. So I decided to take matters into my own hands. I bought several google homes and a canary view security system, and whenever I’m gone or they get to loud at night I’ll yell up and ask them to be quiet, and when they fail to do so I blast some music or an annoying noise. \n\nStill that didn’t help, but I finally found a solution after telling them I can’t sleep and they’re making my life miserable and her only response to me this whole time was, “sorry you think you’re better than me.” And “You have no idea how hard it is to be a mom!” I started waiting for them to sleep, and I placed my security alarm by the vent and randomly will turn on the alarm in the middle of the night until I hear them wake up and about something. Then I turn it off and wait for them to sleep and do it again. \n\nI’ve only done it a few times, but they’re much more quiet now. \n\nSo... AITA? ",

      "description": "Hi, I'm going to make this as short as I can. I worked at a very small retail company for one day. After my first shift, I missed a call from my manager (was busy with a family emergency) and she immediately cancelled all my future shifts via the When I Work app. I messaged her as soon as I saw the schedule change and informed her I was quitting immediately because I don't tolerate managers that behave this way. She apologized and said there must have been a miscommunication but I still quit and asked her to mail my check and I would mail the store key. This messaging occurred two weeks ago and I have not recieved my check, if I was working there I would have received it last Friday. \n\nShe never said she wasn't going to mail my check until yesterday, almost two weeks after I quit. I was told that all employees receive their checks in the mail and I honestly didn't think it was an inconvenience of any kind. She messaged me yesterday and said it's company policy to not send a final check until all \"company property\" (the key) is received. This is a really small check, the shift was only five hours at minimum wage, so it really has no bearing on me. I mean, I'm pretty broke so the money would help, but it isn't detrimental to my life. The company does other sketchy things (pays employees under the table) so I'm weary about sending the key before I get my pay. I looked into state law and company property does not seem to impact pay in my state. She asked me to personally drive to the store and deliver the key and she would have my check ready (she implied that it hasn't been made yet, even though it's past due). The store is about 40 minutes from my house and I'm really not trying to waste gas because as mentioned, I'm pretty broke.\n\nI sent the manager a message regarding the state general law with citations and links, since it is state law to pay employees that have resigned on the following regular pay day. I informed her again that I will mail the key when I receive the check. I'm really not looking to take her to court over a small check but I'm also not cool with how this company operates, no taxes and they're not paying me now. I'm trying to figure out if I'm the asshole since I *could* just drive there. I feel like I'm being stubborn but I also don't feel like I'm being unreasonable.\n\nSo, AITA for the being stubborn about not sending the key until I get the check?",

      "description": "Right at the start of 2019 I met someone at a new job well call Shelly after about a month of dates we got together and im extremely happy because I’ve been in a emotional draught for years now (I wasn’t the most good looking guy in HS) everything is great except one thing. A friend, who I’ll call Mac is a long time friend with Shelly. They kissed once at a party many months ago and she regretted it. As there friends we all go out together with another friend we’ll call Steve. But as of late they have been meeting up at about 12 ( it’s no secret from me) without me or Steve. Bear in mind this mac got with and slept with my ex which in all honestly I didn’t care about at the time. Steve also told me that his brother asked Mac how he feels about us two being together and he got proper jealous and almost angry. I have trust in Shelly but I’m beginning to dislike Mac and honestly want to call him out on it. So I guess this is a “am I gonna be an asshole” i hope that doesn’t break the rules but thank you for reading. I’m 17 btw if that is useful info,\n\nThank you",

      "description": "This is a 2-part: and also not understanding my fiancee's point of view on it? \n\nA relative passed recently who was a hoarder and she had tons of items she purchased, some of which she never opened. As with hoarding there were bug droppings in some things - for context - but for practically this fact never came up in our discussions. \n\nSo she passed and left a bunch of opened and unopened kitchenaid stuff, all of which can be cleaned. My fiancee loves her kitchenaid and wanted stuff on the wedding registry for it but claims that if we take one of these items we'll have less on our registry to fill out for guests, which is a bit of a valid point because we're already having trouble filling out our registry and guests are asking us what we want, which shows me they want to give us a gift - however from a practical point of view I consider it completely wasteful and impractical for that. However I'm not interested in the kitchenaid gear, so I have no stake in where we get it from, so now it's just me trying to convince her that her feelings are wrong and I can't understand it at all.\n\nCan someone please tell me I'm the asshole and why?

I was raised in a Mormon family and fell away some years ago, it had nothing to do with the CES letter. would I be an asshole if I posted the link to this letter on my Facebook/Instagram and other medias? I'm considering posting this exact paragraph word for word:\n\n\"to all my friends and family. I know this may come as a shock to you, but the church of Jesus Christ as you know it and have believed in it for years, is false. I don't want to offend any of you and I want all of you to know that I have loved and will continue to love you, regardless of the choices you make after reading this post. whether it be to read this letter or to ignore it or even to block my future posts. I accept all consequences. I know that some of you have questions regarding the church's true history. the answers to your questions can be found in this letter. to those of you who have never questioned the church or it's leaders, I believe you still deserve to know the truth. \n\nCESletter.org\n\nI love you all and nothing about that will ever change. you all deserve the truth and it is my greatest hope for you to one day find it. thank you.\"\n\nWIBTA for doing this so publicly? \n\nthanks in advance. \n\n",

      "description": "This is a throwaway account.\n\nI [24F] just got back from a two week long trip to visit my long distance boyfriend [26M]. This is the second time this year we’ve seen each other and I was really excited to be able to see him again. \n\nA thing is that I know he has this friend (who lives in another country pretty far from ours) who he talks to a lot, which is fine and he’s allowed to have friends. But, he kept pulling out his phone to text her while we were out alone together, like at restaurants or while we were laying next to each other cuddling. They weren’t long conversations, just quick hey I’m doing x texts, which I send to my friends sometimes too. It just kinda bugged me since we don’t get to see each other often, and he kept taking opportunities to text her even while we were out on a dinner dates together and not actually using his voice to talk to me much. Our conversations honestly felt pretty one sided. It doesn’t bug me that he has a friend, just it stung that he kept looking at his phone to text her during our two weeks together we get couple of months or so. There was an instance where he even bought a gift to send to her at a gift shop we stopped at (for transparency, he bought me something at the same place). \n\nI wouldn’t even have minded if he wasn’t doing it while we were cuddling in bed or on dinner dates. \n\nAnother thing is that I know he had a crush on this girl about 3 years ago, and says he doesn’t anymore. I genuinely don’t know if it’s my insecurity making me feel this way. I really don’t want to be a controlling girlfriend who gets upset at her boyfriend for so much as talking to another girl, so I said nothing about this during the trip. But, it’s still bugging me. WIBTA if I confronted him about this? ",

      "description": "Bit of background, me and my fiancé are only 19 but have been dating for over two years. We’re also religious which isn’t the reason for this but is necessary for the story. My parents are paying for most of the wedding (They’re well off) and me and my fiancé are paying for the rest (I have savings she doesn’t really but has been saving) her parents aren’t having a great time money wise and are only buying the dress.\n\nAnyway, I’d been at my fiancé’s house with her parents and we’d been sorting the invites out and writing a letter to our Place of Worship as is required to get married there. I decided to write the letter with my fiancé’s father as he is an Elder there and we are getting married in the place of worship where they live. At the same time I sent a screenshot to my parents of what our invites look like. We hadn’t finished them at all, just finished the design, since we obviously didn’t know if we had permission to use the POW.\n\nSo we finished the letter and I went back home and as I walked in my parents give me a list, an actual list, of everything wrong with the invite (address and stuff) I tell them that we just filled them in so we could look at the invites in full since this is how the website work but they then started calling me useless and said I should have done it with them. \n\nThen my father demands, doesn’t ask, demands to see the letter, which I was going to show him anyway. He reads it and critiques everything, even me spelling something wrong. I then explained that it was a draft and I was going to get it spell checked by my sister since that’s what she does as a job but he was then demanding I rewrite it all. \n\nNow I was beginning to get frustrated now. I understand that they are supporting me and being very generous but this, too me anyway, is just being controlling and a bit disrespectful toward my fiancé and her parents. \n\nI tell them to “not be so-controlling” and they immediately throw a fit at me and I just leave them too it because I’m tired and have been working all day. Next morning my sister won’t speak to me and my parents are being super short with me and now I’m just fed up. \n\nAm I the asshole? Should I have handled it differently? I just feel guilty now for wanting to plan my own wedding. Should I?\n\nTl;Dr \n\nTold my parents not to be so controlling over the wedding invites and a letter which I designed with my future parents-in-law and hadn’t finished.\n",

      "description": "I've been dating my Girlfriend now almost 3 months now, and I think she's amazing. We meet on New Years and we just clicked so quickly it was awesome. We like a lot of the same games, and actually played alot of COD together on PC. During those sessions, she would know how I would be accused of hacking since I would always get MVP in almost each match. IWe generally use to laugh about how mad some people would get over how good I would do. \n\nSo this is to pretty much give context for today. I was playing some Black ops 4 and I got hackusations from a dude in the match. As you can imagine, the conversation turned into me calling him stupid, and he said he would send the proof on reddit as he said, \"Say Hi to Reddit!\" since he accused me of wall hacking. \n\nNow, I was starting to think it was funny that he pretty much said he would post the gameplay of me \"hacking\" onto reddit so I said as a joke \"Send me the link babe after\". \n\nIn that situation I suppose I was being a bit of an AH.\n\nAfterwards, I was talking to my girlfriend and I mentioned how I got accused of hacking again, and I had a screenshot of the chat in game about it that I took earlier for a mate of mine. I sent it her since I wanted us to get a good laugh. However, she became very upset that I had called them babe, and then she dropped the call. I asked her why she dropped it and she said she was waiting for an answer. We got into a little argument where I said she was over reacting considering the context that I used it in, and how it was clearly in a  condescending manner over something that was pretty trivial. But, she thinks it was uncalled for, said \"how many times you do this shit without telling me\", and again how she wants to \"hear the right answer\" about the whole subject. She then proceeded to say I was blaming her for the argument. \n\nI can understand how your partner calling someone babe can hurtful, but I still do think that in this situation and my use of it isn't something to be upset about. \n\nAITA here??",

      "description": "A close friend of mine, we'll call her Y, that I've known for many years (since we were in our mid-teens and we're both in our twenties now), she is polyamorous and has been seeing a guy for around a year now, let's call him A. A is married. His wife is fully aware of what's going on. For the record, A is in his mid thirties, I believe, and Y is 21. Now, Y is transgender. On hormones, has small breasts now, the whole shebang. As is the case with many trans people, she has some insecurities about her appearance. As her friend, I always do my best to subvert these insecurities if I'm able to do so, and I reassure her that she is in no way masculine. But the problem is, she relies completely and entirely on men for her validation. Attention from men is how she gets her self worth, and being told she's pretty is the only way she is confident. While I understand this to some degree, I also know that relying on any one group of people for your validation is massively unhealthy.\n\nAs some of you may be aware, there are people out there who fetishize transgender people and only want to date them. Now this guy, he seems to think of trans women as pokemon, he's gotta catch 'em all. He uses Twitter as a place to publicly pursue trans women. Now, I'm not polyamorous, and so I spoke to people who are or were in the past, so that I could give Y the best advice possible. I'm not sure if this is standard, but A stated on Twitter that someone he was seeing (he tagged the girl) was the best kisser he'd ever kissed. Y, who is not normally jealous, was uncharacteristically upset about this, to the point of obsessing over it. She also obsesses over him, and relies entirely on his validation for everything. She is depressed because of things he does. After a long discussion between the two of us, we decided it was best that she end things with him, as he is clearly detrimental to her mental and emotional wellbeing. Two days later, she got back with him, saying she \"needed him\". I told her that I couldn't watch her do that to herself and to tell me if she needed anything, and when she was no longer speaking to him. \n\nPart of me feels really shitty for doing this to my friend. It's very painful for me to watch her hurt herself this way. It'd be different if he made her happy, but he doesn't. Am I a shit person? ",

      "description": " I've been staying with my older sister and her family. My car key (single) gets lost  often. It just disappears. The young kids take it and leave it somewhere by accident. I don't have any keychains and I can't get one. My time outside of work is limited since I work long hours and bc I'm a busy person. \n\nFor info, my sis and her family moved into a  house, I came with them. My niece and I both stayed in the same room but on different beds. Once she turned 13, her mom told her to go share a room with her aunt. She didn't wanna do this since the room we shared was her room first, she hates her aunt, blah blah.\n\nHer mom made her move in even though she didn't want to, and she also left some stuff in my room bc she had no other space. She was mad towards me bc I had other places to stay but since my sis insisted that I stay. The only other place I could go to was in bad condition, so I thought she would understand my situation.\n\nThis keychain was included of the objects she left in my room. She got it as a gift. First, I took it from her since I needed it, what was a 13 year old going to do with a keychain? She  found out and started raging. She took it back from me and hid it down in her other things. This was a couple months ago.\n\nA few days ago, I cleaned out my room since it was really messy.  While I was cleaning, I went through her things and threw things out that she didn't need.  Deep in a pouch she had, I found her keychain. I took it. I needed it. I almost lost my key for good, but this keychain would ensure that I wouldn't lose my key, and my car. \n\nShe didn't need it. She left it in my room and did nothing.\n\nToday, I was playing with her sis, and I dangled the keychain in front of her to play. Major mistake. My niece walked in. She saw the keychain and immediately went to grab it. I ran towards the door but she closed it immediately. Her mom, who was also in the room, said that she should let me have it. She said no and she started yelling at me, telling me to give it back. She took it out of my hands. She took the keychain off of my key and threw my key across the room. I told her that it was unfair as I always gave her things, (money, snacks, etc.) but she said that all didn't matter since she always declined them. I then said that at least I'd offered to give her stuff even when she didn't need it, but  when I need something, she doesn't give it to me. \n\nI left the room and her mom and her started arguing. Her mom was on my side, telling her that I needed it more than she did. My niece made petty remarks.\n\nWhen my sis's husband got home, she told him everything that my niece did. My BOL started fuming and demanded that she apologized. She said that she wouldn't as she had nothing to apologize for. I told her that she had no manners. Her parents both agreed with me.\n\nNow she won't talk to me and avoids her parents more than usual. She didn't even need or use the keychain. I needed it and I was going to use it. AITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "Last weekend my partner and I costumed up and attended renfest with some friends. A female friend and I stepped to the side to take some pictures at a photo op station in the ‘tavern’. A presumably drunk male came up and was hovering around me while I was trying to arrange my skirt and boots talking about how he was getting turned on looking at me. At some point he even put his hands on my thigh/boots. I was uncomfortable and exchanged looks with my friend but we just ignored him and go on with our picture taking. \n\nI told my partner about this when we got back home and he was upset that I didn’t bring the creep to his attention as it was happening less than 8ft away from him. He stated that by not immediately speaking out or reacting with anger I’m only enabling these guys and they’ll keep doing it to other people. He feels like I need to assert myself more in those situations or at the very least call for him so he could confront the guy. I can get angry after the fact and I get upset with myself for not being angrier during the interaction but It just never occurred to me to bring my BF into the situation. It was like I existed in a bubble and all I saw was myself, my friend and I was desperately trying to ignore this guy out of existence. \n\nWhen these situations happen I just freeze up, I’m uncomfortably passive and I wish I could react with fire but I don’t. Last time it happened I was separated from him in the grocery aisle and a man came up to me trying to start conversation, standing really close and touching my shirt. I froze and my eyes were scanning around looking for my partner while I maintained cordial conversation. The man buggered off once my partner returned (partner didn’t know what was going on, he literally walked up and the other guy disengaged, there was no confrontation). \n\nMy partner doesn’t really get mad AT me but he does express that I need to stand up for myself in those situations. I feel like it’s easier for him to say, he’s 6’5 with broad shoulders whereas I’m 5’1 and have a racial passive of ‘creep attraction’. \n\nAITA for not standing up for myself and enabling these creeps into thinking their actions are okay? \n",

This one started with an argument about playing Minecraft, then it switched to her saying I acted like I was perfect and that I was always right.\nSo, it started out with her accusing me of not wanting to be her friend because I was playing Minecraft without her. It was over text. At one point she typed “your” instead of “you’re.” I don’t always correct people, but the difference between “your” and “you’re” is my biggest grammar pet peeve. Anyways, I quickly slipped in “you’re*” into the argument, then continued proving my point. I never said anything about her being bad at grammar or calling her stupid. She then accused me of acting like I’m perfect and acting like I’m always right. (The fact that I’m coming on here to see if I was right or wrong proves that I’m not always sure if I’m right.) I’ve corrected the grammar of her and other people on multiple occasions, and I frequently correct myself. Correcting grammar is just a habit of mine that I can’t easily control. So, what do you think? Am I an ah for correcting her grammar? ",

      "description": "This is a long post and sadly basically a TL;DR version of what happened, so I apologize for that. \n\n\nMe and my gf have been dating for three years now. We are both about to graduate and we live quite far from eachother but still fairly close (30min bus drive).\nAfter 3 years of our relationship I know each of ger friends pretty good, both in and out of school, I am on first name basis with her mom, sister and aunt and even their dog likes me.\nHowever, althought I invite her very often, she never goes out with my movie group (4 other couples + 1 other single guy) and doesn't even know my gaming pals from school which I talk with all the time there, even when she visits me in my class.\nLast thing you should know is that I almost regulary go to her place every second week at Friday, stay with her whole Saturday and leave Sunday morning to go home. \nYesterday, we had a fight about me not coming over this week because I have too much work to do. When I asked her to come over if she wants to be with me that much she started yelling at me that she will just distract me from work and stuff and that she wanted me to hang out with her other friends more who will also be visiting and that they think I am rude to her for not coming.\nThen I brought up my friends. I asked her about them, how they probably feel when I invite her multiple times for a screening and she never comes. She disregarded that with another guilt shot about how her mother was looking forward to seeing me to which I replied: \"Oh yeah? And what about my dad? Do you even know his first name?\"\nShe had nothing to say, instead she started yelling again that she doesn't even know my friends names because I never invite her anywhere and that I don't care about them anyway because I always choose her in front of them (I missed 5 movies for the past three years, we usually screen on my home week) \nThis left me stunned. And after a few hours of thinking I don't think I should go out with a girl who ignores my friend, but is it really something that big to end the relationship over? It's pretty rocky relationship but we always calm down very quickly after a fight and are more than fine again... \nThank you in advance for your opinions and any help! ",

For clarification, she's not majorly physically impaired, but she's neurodivergent and needs special care for her mental health. They've screwed up her medication before, teachers have behaved...*indelicately*, and now they forgot to file the paperwork for her to take her standardized tests, for college, with the accommodations she *needs.* And now she has to take these tests *without* the accommodations even though *she is qualified for them,* and her school Is. Not. Apologizing. She's unable to transfer schools, even though her therapist thinks it would be healthier for her, so she's stuck there even though she hates it. She told me which faculty members had screwed up the paperwork, and I went to her school's website to find the address and names needed to send them glitter bombs. Glitter bombs are envelopes that can include notes, and they're filled with glitter so that when the recipient opens them the glitter gets everywhere and fucks up their day. Obviously I wouldn't add a note related to her in any way, because that would get her in trouble. I'm also not just going to address it to the school itself, because then some poor schmuck who has nothing to do with this might open it. I haven't sent this yet, and she doesn't know I'm thinking about it; If I did this, WIBTA? And if so, would there be another way to fuck with them (without implicating her) that would make me NTA, or at least *less* of TA?",

      "description": "So I just started a job delivering pizzas for a pretty popular Pizza Chain last week. So far I really like it, and the tip money is better than I expected it. \n\nWhen I interviewed, they asked about my availability and what type of hours I was looking for. I told the GM that I was looking for somewhere between 35-40 hours per week, since I rent an apartment with my boyfriend so I still need to be able to pay rent each month, and then a few other minor expenses on top of that. She said that those type of hours shouldn’t be hard to give me, for a number of reasons that don’t really matter for this post. She then asked about my availability, and I said I was pretty much completely open, as I don’t really do anything else besides work, take care of my cats and hang out with my bf, so I didn’t need to plan around much and was just trying to take whatever I could get. \n\nNow that I’m on the schedule, I’m closing 5 days a week which means I go in around 3-4pm, and am there until 3:30am. Don’t get me wrong, the amount of hours I’m getting right out of the gate are great, but working until 3:30am just isn’t something I’m okay with doing as frequently as they seem to want me to. This usually means I am making deliveries in our area as late as 2:30-2:45am, and as a 115lb 5’2” girl I just feel outright unsafe doing it, as I’m usually the only one out and about at this hour (obviously). \n\nMy other issue is that this takes a huge toll on me emotionally, my bf works day shift mon-friday, and so with these schedules we now NEVER see each other, except for maybe 1 or 2 days a week, and it makes it really hard to plan and get things done together. \n\nSo my question is, would it make me an asshole to tell my GM that I’d like to change my availability so I wont be working past say, 10/11pm? I’d be open to closing maybe 1-2 times a month, but I feel like saying that after I just told them I had full availability is like a slap in the face. So, WIBTA?",

      "description": "Throwaway for personal reasons.\n\nMy boyfriend [25M] and I [24F] have been together for a few months. It's been going well, but one thing I absolutely can't stand is his taste in music. He really likes bands that are loud and annoying as shit and every time we're in his car I offer to take the aux cable but he declines. He always has \"another band to show me that I might like\" which I think is unfair luckily in my car he is less controlling about what we can listen to so I get to use my phone. When he does this I go along with it or say the music is fine or good because it's his car and I don't want to hurt his feelings but it really gets me frustrated internally. \n\nI can usually deal with it for the drives but recently he found out that my family and I are going on a trip and got me a gift which was nice. We haven't been a \"gift\" couple but I was pleasantly surprised that he thought to get one. When I opened it it was a bunch of his old CD's with songs highlighted with a note explaining why the songs were highlighted and to listen to them and *why* along with a portable cd player I guess for the flight?\n\nI appreciate the note and it was a really nice note about how the songs made him think of me but I really just want to tell him that I'm not interested in the music he likes. This has gone too far and I think it's a red flag that he doesn't realize that this is bothering me.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'm a teenager and I would like to know how I should feel about what I did. Although, I've already decided I was a bit childish.                          \n\n\nStory:   \nI live with my father, step-mom, younger step-brother, and five year old nephew. Over the years of my father and step-mom being together I have received allot of issues from my step-mom. (Ranging from her purposefully not telling me dinner was done to taking me on an emotional roller coaster and being terrified to go home) I have gotten use to small pettiness here and there, but I also feel like, as the child in this story, I should get some credit for being mature up to this point. I needed to wash my clothes, I wash my own because no one else will, and I put everything from the dryer onto a stack. I make sure that none of it is her work things and if I find something that needs to be folded I do that. I put my things in the dryer and head off to bed(around 8 or 9). When I wake up in the morning I see that my step-mom, the only other person that uses the washing machine, has put my clothes, that I was going to wear the next day to school, in the clothes basket I left in there. So in retaliation for all the years before this, i threw her two work shirts and a jacket into the garage that was covered in dog hair and sand. I didn't walk on them or anything like that, just dropped 'em outside. After discovering her clothes were not in the dryer, she immediately went to me and asked what I did to her clothes. I told her and she went off to my dad (who was now in the garage) about how immature i was. This was the first time I've ever done anything so disrespectful and nasty to any adult (as I understand I will grow as a person as I get older). I just need to know.. AITA? \n\n",

      "description": "So yes, based on the title, it feels like I'm an asshole.  But I want some outside opinions.  I'm going to try to keep certain details vague so that it doesn't give away too much information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI organize an LGBTQ+ social group on Meetup.  Its been running for almost 5 years now, and it is my baby.  It has been fantastic!  The group is centred around a specific activity, and of course, everyone is welcome, not just LGBTQ+ members.  So occasionally we get heterosexual people who come simply because they enjoy this specific activity and its great! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout two years ago, an older man with special needs (I believe Down's Syndrome) started attending.  My mom was a special needs teacher when I was growing up, so I have always been good with people with special needs.  He would come every 2-3 months and I would do this activity with him and sometimes get other people to join in.  It was fine.  Lately though, he has become a bit of a sore point.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe now comes every month.  He commandeers the group and gets mad at others who don't want to do things exactly his way.  He has been rude to many people in the group, and I've also noticed a big dip in attendance.  We used to see 30-40 people every month, and lately we have only seen 10-15 people.  It sucks.  Honestly, he brings down the vibe and is ruining the group.  I have spoken to him and told him that his behaviour and his words are rude and are making people uncomfortable.  In return, he told me I wasn't a mind reader, so I don't know what people are thinking.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to be inclusive, thats the whole point of my group!  But I'm starting to think he is driving people away, and my group is going to slowly become just him and a few people and I'll have to shut it down.  I don't want to do this.  So I have considered banning him from the group on Meetup so that he won't see the meet ups anymore.  Am I the asshole?  ",

      "description": "So I'm Jewish, my wife is Catholic. Christmas isn't a holiday that means a whole lot to me but my wife and I have been hosting her immediate family (12 people total when you include SOs) for the past few years, and it's more or less been fine. I've never been into hosting people in general, but it's something my wife wants and, you know, go along to get along. \n\nHowever, we have the same argument every year, and I need a ruling. \n\nMy wife and I's household income is significantly higher than anyone else in both her immediate and extended family, as well as the extended family of her siblings SOs. This isn't to say we are rich or anything, it's more to say that they are all low income earners\\* and we are just barely upper-middle class.\n\nBecause of this, I am constantly being pressured for inviting various people that my in-laws know (including young children) that don't have a Christmas dinner to go to. I've caved a few times for various people and I always regret it. I love my in-laws but they aren't very \"gracious\". It's not like we are sitting around the tree enjoying each other's company. Everyone pretty much comes in, eats, lounges around on the couch, we open presents, and then they leave. No one brings a dish to contribute, no one says thank you, no one helps clean up. They aren't overtly rude or disrespectful but I always feel unappreciated, especially after spending hundreds of dollars on food, and days cleaning the house while chasing 2 toddlers around. \n\nThis is fine, they are my family, and I gotta live with them.\n\nWhat I don't think I have to do is provide extended family and/or friends with a Christmas just because they can't afford their own, or don't want to put the effort in to make their own. I get that to a person making $25k a year someone with our income may as well be a millionaire but I don't think that makes me responsible for instituting an open door policy. Especially considering these people come over, they don't bring my kids a gift, they don't bring my wife flowers or a bottle of wine, and they don't ask me if there is anything they can do to help. \n\nMy wife's argument is that these people don't have the luxuries we have, and it's Christmas, and it isn't that big of a deal for us to buy a little bit more food, and a few extra toys for their kids, it's just one night. She's right, but I don't think I'm wrong either. I've done this for a few years, and have never been shown any appreciation, and that's important to me. My wife and I work hard and have two kids to take care of, we work all week, chase toddlers around all night, spend 2 days cooking and cleaning, just to have a bunch of people I barely know come into my home, sit at my table, and eat my food and I have never received and sign of gratitude for it. Sorry, I can't get over that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*when I say \"lower income\", no one is eating cat food for dinner, they aren't sleeping in refrigerator boxes. They are just manual labor workers who can't produce the same kind of Christmas meal we can. ",

      "description": "First the backstory. Everyone involved with this story is over 20 years old. I work with a girl and her mother. Until today I had assumed we were friends. We usually talked in the mornings before work started. Today me and her was sitting in the break room talking and this nosy old harmless man was looking at us. I told her somebody was watching us and she said that she didn't care and that I was her friend. I sat with her and ate lunch and talked to her. This evening at second break I went to where she usually goes for break and waited on her. Apparently she had texted her mother and asked her to tell me that she had a boyfriend and that people were starting to ask if we were dating and could I stop spending so much time around her. She has never said anything to me about wanting time alone. If she had I would have accepted her request. While it's true that I had a slight crush on her I've never tried to be anything but friends with her because I know she's happy in her relationship and I respect that. I've never asked her out and I've never even tried to do anything romantic. All I wanted was a friend. What I take away from this is that she's embarrassed to be seen with me in public and only wants to know me when it's convenient for her. But she doesn't even have the courage to tell me this herself. I'm hurt and mad that she couldn't even tell me this herself. And she claims to be my friend. If your someones friend why should you care whether people wonder if your dating. Just tell them we're just friends and let it go. Am I justified in my feelings?",

      "description": "Ok so just so you know this all happened in middle school and I have felt remorse. I heard from her friends how it impacted her and I feel so bad. \n\nI’m now in high school but from November in 7th grade to May in eight I knew this girl. Let’s call her “tia”. So tia was very obviously autistic. She was sweet  but very nice but I’m pretty sure she’s trans as well. And no I’m not transfobic and if you are I don’t wanna hear about it. I’ll call her “she” because I have no confirmation if this is true, and she asked to be called she.\n\n\nAt first she talked to me non-stop during my 1st period in 7th grade. I was fine with it, she was nice and I didn’t mind being around her. I moved out of my first period and moved to English 2nd period around January.  They she started to meet me before each period. I never told her my periods or other classes it she figured it out. A bit odd but okay. I talked to her for a minute. Then she found me during lunch. I was actually just getting more popular, after years of being a fat nerd I was really exited to be friends with kids who were actually popular. She followed me there, and embarrassed me. Talked about anime, talked about bad video games. Talked about going to church with her family, then talking about how there were only 3 genders. (She said she was the only person who were the 3rd) it got really stressful. She gave me chocolate on Valentine’s Day takes about undertale for a long time. \n\n\n\nI started to avoid her a bit and kind of resent her. Luckily I only stayed friends with the nice kids who I used to hand out with. I only talked to her at the beginning of the first class. She was still pretty chill when we were alone. Started talking about how the type of guys she finds cute were [literally describing me] I was flattered but she wasn’t my type and it was a bit awkward. \n\n\nBegin eight grade. It was about a month before she found me again, I was fine with it. She was more chill actually. Then she began to follow me around everywhere. She found me at lunch even when I hid, she shewed away all but one of my remaining “friends”. I was fed up but she was a possibly trans autistic Chinese girl who was tall as shit living in an oddly racist community. I started to get fed up. Telling her I needed to be left alone, she left and came back 5 minutes later. After 2-3 months of being stressed I would see her around my corner and have to talk again I got fed up. I was eating in a grimy corner right next to the construction site alone. I decided to stop noticing her.\n\n\n\nIt was so empowering, I felt like I owned the world. I spent time with my remaining friend, I slowly gained more. She started to cry around me however. Thinking I hated her. Now her friends started telling me to talk to her and calling me mean. She had been telling them we were dating. I was confused because I thought they would all understand. After she kept following me around for another month I got the school involved. I got a makeshift restraining order, she still came to talk to me. She even once bathed into the boys bathroom said “hi I’m sorry you hate me” and left. Around May after I was having a really chill time with friends having fun and being happy during lunch. She her friend walked up to me and gave me a note from her. It said “from anonymous admirer. (Not tia)”\nLooking back I should have looked at it longer. But I still have the note and I can tell you it was her writing. Comparing it to the old projects we worked together on in 7th grade. (Yes I’m a little bit of a hoarder I know) .But I started pacing and hyperventilating I had to go to fucking therapy for that shit. My friend calmed me down. I had rehearsed this for months. I walked up to her, and she was looking at me. Handed her gift back and said. “I’m flatted tia, but leave me alone. Please leave me the fuck alone”.\n\nShe was in a very religious family, so that stunned her. I had never swore around her. she started sobbing and had to take 3 days out of school after that. I felt amazing yet other hated me. I had threats of “making you feel the same” I was told the scum of the earth. And I started to get bullied, which wasn’t fun. Finally I got another note 3 weeks later. From anonymous. But it was obviously tia. I told the office and they said they could do nothing about it, as long as it said anonymous. Skip to now, I have a crush on one of her old friends, no grudge against her, and I am horribly guilty. I will answer any questions you ask btw",

      "description": "I’m not even sure where to begin here. \n\nToday at lunch I was out with a friend. It just so happened that my little brother was at the same restaurant (I’m 26, he’s 17 for reference) with a group of his friends. My brother is not a Trump supporter persay but he loves being a jerk to people and where we live outside Portland, the number one way to get under people’s skin is to talk about Trump. \n\nMy brother thinks that Jussie Smollet allegedly staging the attack on himself is one of the funniest things to happen in a long time. I will save my feelings but I don’t think it’s funny no matter what happened. My brothers latest thing is saying “This is MAGA country” instead of saying hello, goodbye or thank you.  So at the restaurant  he was seated sort of fatty corner to us and every time the server would approach his table and leave he’d say “this is MAGA country.”\n\nI heard him say it maybe 5 times and then I lost it. I got up and told him that he had to shut the fuck up or I was going to kick his ass. I sat down and he screamed at me “hey sis, this is MAGA country!” I got up and screamed in his face that I never wanted to hear those words come out of his mouth ever again and I warned him. He said it again and i just left paid my bill she left because I couldn’t take it anymore.\n\nI’m so furious that he would do this to me but my parents are mad at me saying that me “attacking” him in a public space on encouraged him and is counter to how they are dealing with him which is to ignore him until he grows out of it. In light of what they said, am i the asshole here?",

      "description": "Some back story: Me (27M) and my girlfriend (24F) have been exclusive for only about 4 months now. She's an exchange student, and she spent her first year on campus living in the house of a woman in her 40s that hosts many exchange students. My girlfriend became close to her host, so she frequently visits her house to hang out. She dated a guy for 6 months who also lived there and still does, so he's frequently there. As a side note, I'm totally ok with this. I've never had an issue with it at all because I know she's very close to her host and like that she keeps in touch.\n\nAnyways, the other day she wanted me to meet her host, so I go there with her. There were several of the exchange students hanging out in the other room. She mentioned one of them is her ex but didn't point him out. That's fine, I think nothing of it.\n\nAfter we leave and are back at her new place, she asks \"did you see my ex boyfriend?\" I say that I'm not sure because there were several people there. She said, \"he's the really skinny one with long curly hair.\" I responded, \"oh yeah, I did notice him and yes he was very skinny.\" For some context, him being abnormally skinny is something she's talked about before which is why I responded that way. I was agreeing with her description of him.\n\nAfter I make that observation, she responds, \"yea but his penis was so huge!\" She said this in a very enthusiastic way as if to exclaim how great it is. Then she walks over towards me to give me a kiss, and I stop her and say, \"wait, what did you just say?... Are you serious?\" She goes again in a sort of giddy tone, \"yea it was so big.\" \n\nAt that point I just calmly said, \"you know, that really hurts my feelings and makes me feel like I must not be as good for you in that regard or something.\" She gets kind of upset that I seemed offended and asks why that would offend me. For what it's worth, that's never been a concern of mine or something I'm self-conscious about, but I now feel like I'm being compared so it stung a little. \n\nI tell her it was unnecessary and rude, and she tries consoling me by telling me she didn't like anything else about him. My response is \"ok so his big penis was important enough to you that you dated him without liking anything else about him.\" That upset her. \n\nI left and haven't answered her texts because I think I just need time to process my feelings towards her going forward. She seems apologetic, but I can't help but keep thinking that was  immature and disrespectful thing. Was she trying to make me jealous? I don't want to play games like that. I feel bad for ignoring her apologies, but I feel weird about her now.\n\nAITA for ignoring my girlfriend for a few days for telling me about her ex boyfriend's huge penis?",

      "description": "A good friend and I recently went to a drifting event to see what it was all about... and we got hooked; we wanted to get a project car to drift.\n\nUnfortunately, the issue is we are both still college students, meaning that we are POOR (and unemployed). But, recently my friend got a large sum of cash as a gift and I have been saving up via previous summer jobs. \n\nSo, a few weeks ago, we found a 1996 Mazda Miata for sale. Only $1000 bucks. We agreed to split the cost, 50/50. However, as we did more research we discovered that the car we were about to buy didnt run (electrical/ECU issue) and that some of the parts were missing, making it needed to be towed. \n\nObviously we dont have a tow or a truck to get the car. We also dont know anyone with a tow or truck (meaning that we would have to rent them out). At that point I decided that it would not be worth spending all that money, and that it would be better to wait. When I told my friend, he got very upset. Granted, we have been talking about purchasing this car for about a few weeks. We got into a pretty heated argument. It got to a point where he began to criticize my as a person, stating how I \"dont take risks in life\" and that because of that I \"wont go far\". I told him the reasoning of financial issues the car would bring, and that it isnt worth it, but he  immediately shut me down every time I said that. It got me pretty upset, so I mentioned how his parents would always give him extra cash whenever he wanted/needed it (Because he is from a well-off family). It got him even more upset.\n\nSo, I left his place, telling him that if he wanted to buy it, he could, with his own money, and that I wont get involved in it.\n\nAITA? We havent talked since and Im beginning to feel pretty terrible. \n\n",

      "description": "Hi there! An hour ago my mom and I had a slight argument. All is well now, but I still feel like shit for making her cry, even though I still don't fully understand why she was mad at me. So Reddit, am I the asshole here?\n\nToday I went for dinner at my dad's (my parents are divorced and have a very bad relationship right now, as in lawyer stuff etc.). The parents of my step-mom were there too. The mom has a very fast progressing form of dementia, which is pretty fucking brutal to see. The dad was telling about some issues he's having and is getting very emotional (she doesn't understand much anymore and can barely dress a table). He has to get surgery soon so everything was even more difficult, you know .. the emotional stuff.\n\nNow, I've had a lot of issues with empathy before because I sometimes don't understand situations thanks to autism. But this time I really felt a bit sad for them. \n\nI came home to my mom and I told her about them and their issues with the dementia. Then I get this reaction, \"That is not my problem\". She says this twice in a snappy voice while twisting her head in an annoyed way.\n\nShe's normally a very empathetic person so I was really taken aback by this. I got upset and went upstairs to get something. When I came back she was upset with me for getting upset with her. She said, \"How is that my problem? I don't know these people. They're the parents of my ex-husbands wife!\" She repeated this quite a bit, and \"does you dad care about stuff that happens here?\" and \"if I take on every problem, that would make me crazy.\". \n\nI felt really bad for making her cry, but I never expected her to /really/ care. Just an acknowledgement would've been fine. I say a lot of stuff during the day. I just felt that she was mad at me for telling her stuff, which I do all the time. These people are just very friendly and I didn't immediately connect them with my dad ...\n\nEventually we did agree on the fact that dementia in general just really fucking sucks.\n\nBut I still don't know how to feel but I also feel really guilty.

      "description": "About two years ago, one of my close friends, Emma, came out as trans. I've been absolutely nothing but supportive by calling her by her chosen name and her new pronouns. I've never had an issue with her being transgender, she's still the same person to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe both love debating so we are part of the debating team at our school. To begin the year, everyone writes a topic on a sheet of paper, then one gets chosen randomly as practice. Emma's prompt about the biological and psychological basis of transgender people was chosen, however, we were put on opposite sides (again, random assignment by our teacher), with her arguing affirmative, and me arguing negative. Needless to say, I was a little nervous about what Emma would think as she tends to get really offended, but I figured that she knew how supportive I was of her, so it shouldn't be an issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmma glared at me for the entirety of the debate, and became pissed off when my team won. She didn't look at me for the rest of the meeting, and confronted me at lunch time with a group of her other LGBTQ+ friends, all equally looking pissed off. I asked her if everything was okay, to which she accused me of being a transphobic bigot and if I really believed everything I had said in my debate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't want to lie (though I probably could have to avoid hurting her feelings, but that isn't right either) so I said that I supported most of the biological evidence (mainly that though trans people identify as another gender now, they were born and will die their biological gender due to her existing chromosomes) but rejected the psychological evidence (these research articles I had were very dated so I didn't support them), meaning that though Emma is biologically male, that doesn't matter, in my opinion, because of how she identifies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmma took extreme offense to this, and started to cry, assuming that I meant that I didn't see her as a female. I explained it wasn't true, she was a woman in every other way, and I've always called her by her name and preferred pronouns other the past two years, so obviously it didn't matter. She didn't want to hear any of it and left after yelling at me some more, with her LGBTQ+ friends threatening to tell the school and forcing me to go to a class to \"reeducate\" myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn one hand, I feel like I owe her an apology for how things went between us, but on the other hand, I don't want to apologize for something I said in a debate that I do believe, even after I've supported her for so long, especially since they insulted me. I just want to know if I'm the asshole in this situation, or if everyone was being shitty. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - In a debate for our school team, I said that I supported the notion that trans people are born and will die as their biological sex due to their chromosomes, but it doesn't matter because they identify as their chosen gender in every other way. My trans friend, Emma, proceeded to become upset and insult me with her other LGBTQ+ friends. AITA?",

      "description": "My friend and I have known each other since 7th grade. We’ve been through a lot together and have generally been pretty supportive of one another through some difficult times. She has been through a series of short-lived jobs and experimented with some different careers. Though I feel we do our best to support one another, she can be quite difficult (e.g., bailing multiple times on appointments with one of my colleagues who took time to meet with her to help her launch a website; berating me for telling her that I’m proud of her for making healthy life changes after she was hospitalized for a mental health issue). I realize some of these behavioral issues are out of her control but being around her brings up challenges to my own mental health. I don’t have interactions like this with anyone else in my life where it feels as though I’m constantly walking on eggshells and my family and our mutual friends have remarked several times that she is a toxic presence in my life. Lately, she only wants to catch up when she has something to share and will say she’s too busy to chat with me anytime I initiate a phone call. It all fees very one-sided and yes, a little toxic, but because of our shared history, I can’t bring myself to end this friendship. When kept at an arm’s length and living a state apart, this is a non-issue.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was recently laid off from my job and am in the middle of some other major life stuff including being in grad school full time. I received a call from her excitedly telling me that she has taken a job that will relocate her to my city. She asked me to meet up on her next trip to the area and to ask my partner if they have anyone in mind with whom she can be a roommate. I just don’t have the mental or emotional space to deal with her right now so I declined her invite and don’t plan on investing my energy to weave her into my partner and my social lives after how poorly she treated my colleague. I plan to see her occasionally when she moves but she won’t be a part of our daily lives. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nWhen I declined her invite, I truthfully explained that this is a very difficult time for me and that I can’t commit to any social visits until I get these issues straightened out. I never lied to her. I will be be supportive from an arm’s length and visit with her when it’s convenient for me but I am focusing on my own mental health and well-being. AITA?",

About an hour later he showed up to my place blind drunk. I told him to grab his things and leave. He was too drunk to even get his shit together to do that.\n\nI locked him out of my house but he wouldn't leave.

      "description": "Just to get things straight my girlfriend (24) and I (25) have been together for 4 years and have lived together for about 2 years already. Relationship has mostly been great up till this year when things started to take a dip. The sex life diminished, not much romance between the two of us and we were kind of in cruise control. Of course when its like that things start to pile up and we get more frustrated at each other easily causing us to bicker more and be easily annoyed at the other. It's not all bad but more negative than positive.\n\nSo to the problem... We went on vacation for about 2 months together exploring Europe, trying to bring back some excitement and spend time together but that failed and I just got more annoyed at her easily and even if we were spending time together 24/7 the romance and sex never came back. I did talk to her about this once in passing and once as a serious conversation before Europe, while also bringing it up during the trip. She always seems to have some reason wether it be mental, family or what not and I tried understanding that for as long as we've together. She also said some of it was me so I tried to change during the trip as well. But enough is enough. As the cruise control went on we had a discussion on NYE again and we went into 2019 annoyed at each other but neither of us wanted to ruin it so we kept face.\n\nAt that point I thought if this is what the start of the new year is like we don't have much of a chance, and thought it be best to break up. Even though its super close to a 2 month trip which so many good memories were made, AITA for breaking up with her?",

      "description": "I'm 16, every year for Christmas my cousins from out of town come stay at our house for the week. There's about 5 of us and we usually drive around town and hang out on one of the days. My oldest cousin (21) is the one who drives us so ultimately he gets final say on who gets to come.\n\nMy youngest cousin (13, only child), we'll call him Tristan, has medium/low-functioning autism. He can sometimes act properly but he's more of a nuisance than anything else. He constantly makes disruptive, loud noises and harasses strangers. Usually he doesn't hang with us and stays home with the rest of the family, but this year his mom/my aunt asks him if he wants to go and says yes. Then one of my other cousins (17) says \"We're going to an escape room and then going bowling, so the music and sounds may be too loud for him.\". My aunt then says that we can spend a few hours with him, drop him off back at the house, and then go out without him. My oldest cousin says he's sorry and that he can't change our plans to accommodate him. Then my aunt goes on this whole rant about how Tristan is just like us and that he just wants to hang out with his cousins for once. But what's funny is that Tristan doesn't really seem to care at all but whenever his mom asks him he unenthusiastically says yes. She says that he's being sincere but I don't buy it. Then I asked if she was more angry about it than he was. She then gets really angry with me and tells me that he can't express emotions that well and that he does want to hang out with us and that we're all entitled. She storms out of the room. \n\nThen we try getting out of the house and Tristan follows us. So now I'm second-guessing myself and I guess he actually wants to go with us. But then one of my cousins tricks him into going back into the house by saying that there's a game for him inside (which is kinda shitty imo). So he goes inside and we drive off.\n\nAITA/AWTA?\n\nTL;DR: Autistic cousin \"wants\" to hang out with us, we say no, his mom says we need to take him, we decide not to because it seems that she's more upset with it then we are. Turns out he does want to go and my other cousin sends him on a wild goose chase to leave us alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": " Repost because I didn't spell WIBTA properly in the original title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince before my boyfriend and I met 3 years ago, he' been using the \"no 'poo\" technique of hair care. For those unfamiliar, this is when you only utilized shampoo/conditioner every few months. You still wet and hand scrub in the shower every few days. The idea is that you're allowing the scalp to self-regulate and find a balance with the amount of natural oils present on the head. His hair isn't gross, per-say. It just looks, feels, and smells a little greasy. It's not the sleazy-looking type of greasy; it just looks like he uses a lot of gel. He got the idea from a mutual friend who doesn't wash her hair often because she is constantly traveling. Her hair is INCREDIBLE and she can easily style it because the natural oil allows her hair to hold shape.\n\nSo my question is WIBTA if I requested he wash his hair for a little while to see how it looks. As I seriously value body autonomy and person choice, I would feel selfish asking him to do so. I'm conflicted. In the years we've been dating, hes washed it maybe a 12-20 times. I know that sounds disgusting but it's average for those who use no 'poo methods and it really isn't bad. I don't mind and I promise it's not as disgusting as it sounds. His person hygiene is great in general. These shampoo-ings, however, are not the deep conditioning that would be needed to remove the oils, however. So it feels softer but it's still not 100% clean.\n\nI'm not sure if I am considering this purely out of curiosity or if there is a part of me that secretly thinks his hair is disgusting. Occasionally during sexy times he'll want me to grab his hair but I'm hesitant to because it's greasy. I don't think that's the reasoning but the unconscious mind is a complex thing.\n\nAlso, I always welcome personal experiences and information about no 'poo! And if INFO is needed, let me know. I know this is a bit of a ramble.\n\nIn judging this, please try to judge based on whether this would be an acceptable request given his right to bodily autonomy, not whether you think not washing your hair is a gross thing. As his girlfriend, am I allowed to make sure a request? Like I said, his hygiene otherwise is perfect.\n\nTL;DR I'm considering asking my no 'poo boyfriend to wash his hair regularly for a short period of time to see what his natural hair is like. WIBTA?",

      "description": "First and foremost, I am not looking for sympathy. Long story short, I had told my friends the week prior that I would be killing myself on this one particular date because I always hear people saying that they wish they could have had that last goodbye, or they wish they could have done one last thing, so I wanted to make sure my friends would be at peace when I would hopefully be dead. My plan didn't work out as it was meant to, I spent the whole day trying to kill myself via carbon monoxide poisoning in my car, but each time I would pass out I'd wake up to the door being open (the human body is really good at not killing itself, just look up responses to the helium hood) So anyway, after maybe 6?? hours I go home and I check my phone, expecting some messages and it is absolutely radio silent. The group chat is going as usual but no one either noticed or cared that I was not there. They all knew what I was going to be doing, I made sure I was honest because, again, I didnt want them having any regrets when I died. But it just got me upset and I did get a little bit snarky the next few days because of this and now I just want to know if I'm being an asshole.   \nThank you ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for a year. We have a good amount of sex, probably PIV 3/4 times a week and 'other' ie oral/touching, about the same.\n\nThe issue is, he only cums in me about a quarter of the time when we have PIV sex. It makes me feel useless and like my body is broken. I get upset and I try not to get emotional around him, but I don't always succeed.\n\nI've spoken to him about it, he says it is because he is very unfit and he gets tired and out of breath. Which I believe as he does get out of breath going up 2 flights of stairs to our bedroom, and he does seem to cum more easy in a passive role, for instance I've never known him not to cum lying down having a bj.\n\nI can't remember exactly when I first spoke to him about this, but I do remember it was at least as far back as April last year. He told me he was going to work on his diet a bit and get a bit fitter, but he hasn't. We've had this conversation so many times now but nothing has changed.\n\nI hate myself for getting upset and taking it so personally, but I am so hurt and angry that he doesn't seem to care enough to do anything. This is the only thing we seem to have any issues with. Also, it's affecting my self esteem, I've told him if he could be complimentary outside of the bedroom and initiate sex more (I'm usually the initiater), this would make me feel a bit better too. This sort of happens, but not really.\n\nI guess I just want your opinion on the situation, I love him a lot and I suppose he must be attracted to me as we do have a good amount of sex. I'm just tired of feeling ugly and useless. It's on my mind as it happened today, I got upset and he just shouted \"I'm not having this conversation again!\" and said he didn't know if the guys I were with before just had constant streams of cum or something.\n\nAnyway sorry it's jumbled, and thanks\n\n",

      "description": "So I don't have kids yet, but recently I brought it up to my parents that I don't plan on giving my kids traditional names from their culture when I have them. This conversation started because recently I had legally changed my own name from the name I parents had originally given me. My parents are immigrants here but I was born and raised here. The legal name they had given me was extremely difficult to near impossible for people here to pronounce. I made school really hell for me because no one could ever pronounce and kids would make fun of me for me. Imagine how the first day of felt like every year when they got to my name in the attendance call. Not only that, no matter where I went, I could never have a proper introduction because the conversation would always start with the other person trying to figure out how to say my name. Doctors would often never say my name when my turn came in the queue. I hardly ever got responses back in job applications because I'm pretty sure it gave people the impression that I was a foreigner who spoke little English, though I was the exact opposite.\n\nSo anyways, I've told my parents about my name change and while they would have preferred I not change it, they would understood me in that regard. As we were discussing names, I mentioned to them due to my own experience with my own name, when I have kids, I will not be giving them any sort of traditional name. I will be giving them more English/Westernized names so they can be integrated into the culture here and not go through what I went through growing up. They told me they don't like that decision, and I should give them a name that fits their culture and religion. I told them where they live is more important and their names will effect how people treat them for the rest of their lives. They then insisted I lost my culture (something I'm pretty sure many first gen immigrants go through) and I'm disobeying their religion by not giving them a religious name. My family is Muslim if you guys haven't figured it out yet. But I held my ground and said they won't have control over my kids' lives, I will, and I want to do what best to make their lives easier. When they mentioned culture and religion, I'll admit I don't follow either one of them much. I grew up completely Westernized and do not follow their religion at all. Not giving them a name that fits both does not bother or concern me. So in this situation, am I wrong for not wanting to cave in to my parents wishes to give my kids a traditional name?",

At various points in my life i'd play up my femme side more and my masc side more. usually i just dress in jeans and a tshirt. femininity always felt performative and a bit uncomfortable to me, but i did occasionally enjoy it. *we did not meet or fall in love during one of my high femme phases so that's not what's up*\n\nHe's made lots of shitty comments over the years about my dress. I've mostly brushed it off as him being oblivious but wanting to be good; he would want someone to tell him if he looked weird. The thing is though he makes these comments over normal, fashionable-ish outfits (i'm not gonna be doing any shoots anytime soon but i'm not a slob). He's called me boy, man, dude. Not like in the colloquial like \"sup boys, let's do this\" but \"whatever, *boy*\" if we're arguing and i happen to not be wearing a dress.\n\ni've told him before to cut it out, that it hurts my feelings and i dont appreciate it and that it's not funny when he calls me dude boy and man \"jokingly\". he stops for a bit and starts again in a couple weeks. we had a huge fight about it recently where i asked him to just leave me alone about my clothes, that all i did was put on a flannel over a hoodie because it is fucking cold. he said his preferences are important and need to be considered. i said my happiness as a human being needs to be considered and he doesnt get to control how i dress all the time and that he's been a bit of a bully. he insists we need to compromise. i dont think i should compromise who i am as a person to be a prettier thing for him to look at. I want to stress, again, that i have always been this way and that my dressing this way is not some new thing. he's picked at it over the years but in the last couple years he's gotten REALLY weird about it. during the discussion he said he was afraid of me getting my mental health in order because when i do i start having problems with things. i really dont know if im being delusional here. i feel like he's trying to be controlling, and yes since i started getting help for my depression i've spoken up when i'm bothered (im not a shithead cancelling all our friends or something, but if someone is rude to me i wont smile and simper anymore, ill tell them to not treat me that way)\\\n\n**tl;dr** husband increasingly critical of my appearance, came to a head and he says i need to compromise and dress how he wants more. i think it's shitty to try to make me compromise my sense of self (i am not a super feminine person) to fit someone else's aesthetic preference",

      "description": "Okay so my town has this intersection, it's a three way of two of the busiest roads in town and the cars on the part that goes straight across go 55mph and don't ever stop, while if you are trying to make a left on to the road you could sit here for 40 minuets. The road was curved and wrapped a hill so visibility was really not great especially for cars going 55. There was bunch of collisions after they built the highschool literally right next to it.\n\nI avoided this by driving ten minuets out of my way on to a back road, but this day I missed the turn so I had to go through this dumb death trap. I had done it a few times though and it's not like there was another option. I sat there for twenty minuets until it was my turn, and waited another five minutes for an opening on my right, then asked my brother if I was clear on the left. He said yes. I looked and saw nothing so I gunned it thinking I finally had the perfect break. My brother as it turns out didn't really even look, and there was a car in my blindspot. He swerved barely avoiding me, but didn't crash and continued right behind me. I felt bad, but we where both okay and it was an honest mistake. I figured I would just have to live with that guilt.\n\nWe get to the highschool parking lot and I pull into a spot in the back with no cars around me when suddenly a car pulls in directly behind me. I think it's weird because there are spots all around us, but whatever, I start gathering my backpack when there's a tap on my window and then someone opens my door. This guy starts ranting about how i cut him off, how I needed to slow down and not rush because he could have died (even with the wait time at the intersection we where still 20 minuets early) and how it was selfish teenagers like me who where ruining the world (a bit much but k). I apologise and tell him it was an honest mistake, I was being careful but just didn't see him. I was scared for my life, he didn't seem threatening he was just upset and reasonably so, but I had grown up with stories of kids being shot inside their cars because their dad cut someone off and I really didn't want to die in my fucking highschool parking lot. He rants about how he had driven a motorcycle the that intersection just a few months ago and a car forced him off the road, and he had been in the hospital for months. He talks about how I could get someone killed and it would be my fault, and I apologise again holding back tears. my uncle had died getting slammed of his bike at an intersection.\n\nEventually he leaves, and after my brother gets out I drove back home, had a panic attack and then refused to drive for four months. Ever since then I have always been super paranoid about being followed and constantly check my rear view. The incident was about four years ago. I still think about it every day, and was hoping maybe I could finally get over it if I heard what some other people thought.",

      "description": "Throwaway account because this is a sensitive topic, I feel at least. So I have gotten mixed feedback on my actions. I'm a psych student, running my thesis study. Now my topic is extremely sensitive, I had to go through the university IRB, not just my professor, to get approval. I can't even know the name of my participants from the signature of the Informed Consent to Participate, they turn the form 9ver and place it randomly in a folder of other signed consent forms, so I never learn their identity. Today I had a participant already beginning the study when another student barged in and began chatting with my participant. The person who walked in literally did not acknowledge me as a person in the room at all. I interrupted, because they clearly seemed friendly and I didn't want the confidentiality of the study breached, and said, \"Can I help you?\" The person who walked in said they were there for a study, but wouldn't confirm any details except the timing of their appointment, so I explained there might have been a mix-up with the online system, however I currently have a participant going through the study at this time, please step out. The student without an apppintment left in a huff without waiting, and then the participant that was originally going through my study actually left without completing it and admonished me as they left. I dont feel I was rude about it, but I definitely didn't sugar coat it I guess you could say. AITA, I genuinely want to know?",

      "description": "Hello /r/AmITheAsshole,\n\nI am currently having some trouble determining if I would be the asshole in a certain situation and thus deciding what I should do in the situation. First some backstory:\n\nSlightly more than 1 year ago in my second year of uni a friend of mine told me he liked someone in our friend group. So I helped him with advice and my opinion on things (so I have been kinda involved in this). He asked her out but she said 'I have to think about it' and so she did for nearly half a year until he proposed that they would go on a 'trial'date. They did this for about 1.5 months and then they started an actual 'relationship'. This relationship lasted about 2 month before he broke up with her because 'she was spending to little time on me' and 'the relationship didn't turn out as I wanted'.\n\nSince then she has started to flirt with me and I started flirting back and liking her. So recently I started thinking about asking her out but I also realized it might be a very asshole thing to do and I do not want that. But there are two things that made me doubt whether or not I would be the asshole. First of all even though he was the one who ended the relationship he still had emotional trouble but recently (about a month) he started saying that he was over her (I doubt this). Secondly during the half-year 'thinking' period he always said to me that 'he just wants what makes her happy even if that is a relationship with someone else' (which I also doubt).\n\nSo here is my question are my doubts of being a asshole coming from a rational place or just from my penis/heart and would I be the asshole if I asked her out (or even worse got asked out by her)?\n\nTL;DR: Friend likes girl. Weird shit for about 2/3 year. 'Relationship' for 2 months until he broke up. Now (about 5 months later) she is flirting with me and I am starting to like back. WIBTA if I asked her on a date?",

      "description": "So, for context, I had two friends that I traveled with for 3 days to a new city. Before the trip, I was already lukewarm about them because I was pretty sure they were talking about me behind my back. They're closer with each other, so I didn't really mind. My whole thing is if you're not fucking me, financing me, or feeding me, then I really don't care if you don't like me/talk about me. Usually, I drop people out of my life if I feel like they don't like me, but I made the mistake of making this trip 4 months in advance. Oh, and we would also be staying in the same hostel room together.   \n\n\nNeedless to say, that trip didn't go great. In the nicest way possible, I told them before the trip that I would go off and do a few things on my own since the places I wanted to visit wasn't the same as theirs, so I spent a lot of time on my own exploring the city. The reason I did this was that I *knew* that if I spent too much time with them that I would probably end up getting pissed off about something. I decided to hang out with them one afternoon and they just started ragging on me, so I made up an excuse and left, pissed.   \n\n\nAfter that, the whole trip was just tense. I felt more sensitive to their \"jokes\", because some of it felt really personal. They would tell me things like \"You're not reliable\" or \"You're socially awkward\", and it was like a 2-on-1 situation. But, it was also my fault because I should've addressed the issues while they were taking place. But I just thought I would stick it out for 3 days and then never talk to them again.   \n\n\nAt the end of the trip, we were at the airport on the way back to our home city. There was a man just yelling at one of the service people, waving his hands in her face, and I always have an issue with that. So, I said very loudly that he was being \"unnecessary\". My friend then told me \"You don't need to get involved.\" And I snapped. I told her, very strongly, that I would \"Tell an old man he was being unnecessary if he was being fucking unnecessary, and I take issue with you telling me not to get involved.\"   \n\n\nMinutes later I realized I had lost my temper and apologized. Told her that none of my anger was directed at her, but towards the man, and that I was sorry that if I hurt her and that it wasn't my intention. Anyways, the flight back was quiet and when we landed I said goodbye, hugged them, and then fast walked away from them. Later, I sent them a text saying that I hoped they got home all right.   \n\n\nNo response and I haven't talked to either of them in 3 months.  I thought that was the end of that. I felt bad for yelling at her and just fast walking away from them at the airport, but I felt like I had done enough apologizing at that point. I just figured our friendship was over. Then I got an invitation in the mail for her wedding (which the other friend on the trip is a bridesmaid in).   \n\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I write in a note that says \"I won't be able to make it, but congratulations!\" and respectfully decline the invitation? I don't want to have a conclusive conversation where I say \"Hey, I don't want to be involved in y'all's lives, I don't like you\", but I also feel like it would be disingenuous of me to go to the wedding, but I also feel bad because they're extending an olive branch . . . I just don't want to take it.   \n\n\nI don't know, I'm just really confused. ",

      "description": "I initially posted this to a different sub, and was referred to post here for professional asshole checkers.  Here is the story as it was laid out there:   \n\nSo, our local liquor store chain has a policy where they card everyone under 40. They also have signs all over the store stating that if you are under 40 and they fail to card you, they will give you 40 dollars.  \n\nSaturday I decided to do some drunk streaming, and went to the store to get cider. When I was checking out, the cashier asked me what year I was born in. I an definitely over 21, and told him the year.  \n\nHe then finished the transaction without asking for my ID. After I paid, I pointed out he didn't ask for my ID, So he replied with, oh, can I see it?  \n\nI told him he could, but that wasn't the point, and that I am under 40, and wanted my 40 dollars. He then made a huge production about it, told me I had to wait for his manager, and in general got really rude with me.  \n\nI wound up waiting for about 15 minutes, but finally filled out some paperwork to get a check mailed to me.  \n\nAm I an asshole for asking for my 40 bucks?    \n\n\nEditing original post to clarify some things brought up in comments:   \n\n\nI have no idea if this is a franchise location or not, but there are a lot of liquor stores under the brand name in my area.    \n\n\nI also don't go to this store very often, the last time was 5 months ago and I did not recognize either of the cashiers that were working.    \n\n\nI do not believe that I look like I am 40 at all, and most people peg me to be early 30's when asked how old they think I am.      \n\n\nAnd in my state, there is, in fact, a law that states that everyone purchasing alcohol must be asked to show ID unless they \"reasonably appear\" over the age of 40, that's not just a company policy.    \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This requires a little backstory: \n\nIt's coming up on two years since my girlfriend had her ex-boyfriend's father die while they were in a relationship.  It was obviously a traumatic experience for both of them.  They had a messy breakup months later (He was caught talking intimately with another girl).  A couple months later, I come into the picture with her and have been since, for about one and a half years.  Last year, my girlfriend texted him to tell him she's thinking of him that day, and I remember thinking nothing of it because of how hard it must be to lose a father.  They continued texting the following days, which turned into a hatred-fueled name calling fest between them.  They've had minimal contact since.\n\nNow, it's almost the second anniversary of her ex's dads death.  My girlfriend is adamant on texting him again saying she's thinking of him.  I've reminded her of what happened last year, but she's insistent on contacting him anyway because she says that's what she would want someone to do for her.  I can't help but think things will go sour, or that there's an ulterior motive for her contacting her by thinking about what happened last year.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to contact her ex about his dead father?",

I found both of them, hours dead, first thinking they were just drunk. To be clear my girl hadn't used heroin in several years, she knew my feelings on them. \n\nOur relationship was not an easy one. She struggled with depression and barely left the bed the last year she was alive. We also both have pretty serious drinking habits. I knew she was thinking about using again but never imagined one use would kill her and one of her best friends. \n\nFlash forward a few weeks, and something happened between me and another one of her friends (let's call her Julie) from when they were teenagers/young adults. They hadn't seen each other in years but had recently re-connected via Facebook. Julie helped me so much with coordinating and designing things for Emily's memorial, and overall had been very sweet and compassionate. \n\nIt's very quiet here at the apartment since Emily's passing, and Julie's company very much helps get through those nights. We sleep in the guest room, in fact I haven't slept in the master bedroom since Emily died (she and her friend died on the bed).\n\nI, along with Julie, both have strong feelings of guilt considering our newly intimate relationship.

When I get home I play with my eldest, generally while doing everything I can to take the youngest off my partner's hands until I take the eldest to bed at 7ish. After that I swallow whatever I can for my dinner, and have the youngest until bedtime at about 10. I train for rugby once a week on a Thursday night, so I don't come home I go straight there and land back usually around 9, I stopped going twice a week when we had the first one. And I play a match most Saturdays. So I'll be out of the house for maybe 6 hours from lunchtimes for the longer away trips. ",

      "description": "Two years ago I met this girl, let's call her Elise. We hung out a lot and eventually made out and had sex. The making out kept happening but sex didn't happen anymore. I specifically told her I was not looking for a relationship and she agreed with my decision. Later she got into some relationships with other guys and whenever that happened we still talked but never really hung out. Her last relationship just ended in a bad way and all her friends were the friends of his ex bf. She doesn't have a lot of friends right now but she can manage. Immediately we started hanging out again and I started caring deeply about her. She is doing very bad in college so I told her to come to me and I'll help her. What she studies is my job so it's easy for me to help her. I basically forced her to come to mine, work on the assignment and if she had any questions I would gladly answer or help her. Eventually we got her last assignments done and she passed the year.  We still kiss and make out now and then and feeling started to creep up. She is brutally honest and so I am. We don't lie to each other ever and that's why we are such good friends. Now I have another female friend who is legitimately a very good friend of mine, let's call her danielle. I have no desire to kiss her or have sex with her. One of my best friends is her boyfriend and he basically says that he'd trust to put us both naked in a bed and nothing will happen, which is true. So you can say the intentions of my friendship with danielle are equal to hers. With Elise it is completely different. I have very strong desires to sleep with her and it is always on my mind which makes our friendship unequal. Yesterday I told her that I was potentially open for a relationship with her. Now she is brutally honest. Her response was that she does not like to be touched, is very probably going to cheat on me (as she did with her last) and does not want to ruin our friendship. I gave a honest response and I told her that our friendship is unequal because I want more and she doesn't. I also told her that not having a relationship potentially might also be the end of our friendship as I will not know how to deal with it  It is eating me up and I don't think I can ever be the real friend that I always tell myself I am for her because I am always chasing for wanting more. I'm considering to pull the plug at least for now and tell her that I don't want to see her for a while because I need to sort out my feelings.

      "description": "My mom's going through a divorce, and someone committed arson and burned down the house right before it was to be split in the divorce. She's been working with the insurance company on a settlement.\n\nMy mom's lawyer called me earlier this week. He expressed concern about my mom's mental state--she has not returned any phone calls or emails from him or the insurance company. He was worried that she was intent on dropping this case and asked me to reach out to her. As far as I had known, she wasn't intent on dropping anything and wanted to use any insurance money gained for a down payment on her own place. I called her after she got off of work and yelled at her. I told her the situation, then told her to call me back once she had gotten home and checked her emails. I call her back later and she's in tears. She tells me how I upset her earlier and how she is tired of fighting and wants to move on. She expresses how she is tired of dealing with this past life of hers everyday and wants to move forward. She is exhausted of going back home for court cases and talking to the insurance company all of the time giving them information. I counter with how this is the easy part. The hard part was testifying under oath in criminal cases and recounting everything he had done. These people just want clarification on inventory inside of the house. Besides, she's currently renting, but she can't pay that high ass rent forever. There will come a time when she will need somewhere to live. She replied, \"I'll cross that bridge when I get there\", her mantra to everything. I told her, \"you won't cross it, you'll be living under it. You need to finish what you've started to secure your future. If you don't do this, I'm so done.\" She then throws the \"after everything I've done for you\" card, and follows up with \"you'll just cut off your family like that?\".\n\nI'm triggered and I tell her how I feel. The only three family members I feel like I had were my grandmother, mother, and brother. My grandmother has late stage Alzheimer's and will soon forget who I am. I've already cried and grieved because the woman who raised me is no longer there. My little brother and I weren't close after I left for college, so I don't even know anything about him. All I have left is my mom, and I'm not going to take care of her forever when she won't even help herself because of her \"feelings\". So yes, I absolutely will. She cried and we haven't spoken since. AITA here? I tolerated my father's abuse for at least 15 years, and I did all of that for HER. I want what I think is best for her, and I'd much rather her have somewhere to live in 20 years than be sad she has to talk to an insurance company once a month now.",

      "description": "So, my husband and I got married about six months ago. It was a very small affair, practically an elopement, with just immediate family and a few friends each. I also didn't plan on having a bridal shower or a bachelorette party either, considering how low-key the wedding was going to be. But then one of my best friends planned a small surprise bridal shower for me, which was lovely, but not something I ever wanted. I had planned on sending thank you notes because that's what you're \"supposed\" to do. But immediately after the shower my then fiancé and I had a lot going on with family drama and illness, planning the wedding, moving in together, and both of us starting new jobs, so I didn't get a chance to send them. \n\nA few months after all that, the wadding came and it was great and our family and friends were very generous with their cards and again I planned on sending thank you notes because it's what I was \"supposed\" to do. But then right after it was the holidays, a family member passed away, and I was also busy applying to graduate schools, so I didn't get a chance to send them yet again. Now it's been 6 months since the wedding and 8 since the shower and I've been told (by the friend who planned the surprise shower) that it's too late and I was rude not to send them, even though the shower was a surprise and the wedding was so small. \n\nAlso, I did take the time to thank everyone personally at both the shower and at/after the wedding for the gift/card they gave us and for attending. Which I feel is something that isn't an option at bigger weddings, which is the whole reason for thank you cards; so you can thank everyone even if you don't have the opportunity to do so at the event itself. So, although I know I didn't technically follow etiquette, that's not what I really care about. I want to know if I'm an asshole and (more importantly) if people who attended my shower/wedding probably think I'm an asshole. What do you guys think?",

      "description": "So this happened back in May. \n\nLet me preface this by saying that my brother in law is 16, I'm 20, and I'm married to his sister who's 21 (20 at the time). They are 4 years apart and grew up really close, as they live up in the mountains, about 30 minutes away from any other civilization. Since we met and started dating (3-4  years ago) He's always been physically rough with her, trying to wrestle, grabbing her as if she were a brother. I usually tell him to stop, half joking, buy always gives the excuse \"she's my sister! It's ok!\". Not saying you can't be rough with your sister (I definitely was as a kid), but once you're an adult, that type of horse-play usually stops.\n\nBecause he never had a brother, he has taken me as an older brother. He copies me, and loves everything I do, basically becoming obsessed with me. I love it!!! I didn't really get along with my brother growing up (6years older than me) and so it is really great to have a younger brother now.\n\nSo in May, we had been married for two months, since March. We were visiting at their home (8hr drive) after this last semester ended, we visit maybe twice a year as it's far. The visit went well, and during breakfast one morning, her brother came down stairs and as she (my wife) was sitting on a stool next to me, he puts her in a headlock. Now she instantaneously looked at me and asked for help, and told him to stop. He didn't stop for about 15 seconds, so I stepped in behind him and put him in a headlock. \n\nI'm in the Army, and not much bigger than him, but I am substantially stronger. He submitted and during the headlock I squoze (past tense of squeeze? Haha) hard enough for him to be choked, and I let up  (still had him in a headlock, just like he had my wife) and I whispered to him \"I don't care if she's your sister. you will never put my wife in a headlock again\". \n\nHe kind of slinked down for a few hours and didn't talk to anyone. He came around and stopped feeling sorry for himself, but he was very visibly upset. \n\nNow, we still have a snap streak going, (his idea) and all is back to normal. Thinking about it, I was just protecting my wife. I myself went through a similar situation with my older brother in law who married my sister, and I believe that to be a very important lesson to learn.\n\nAm I an asshole?",

      "description": "The situation isn't exactly how the question makes it sound, I promise.\n\nSo I work in a call center and I oversee a fairly large group of people who are part of a special program. The people in this group are some of our top performers, so we use them to train new hires by having them sit with the new people and listen to their calls for the first 3 days.\n\nWe normally only need about 20 people, and the whole group is much larger, so not everyone gets to train the new hires every day. We randomize the list of who's going to sit with new hires every day for the following day, and the people who aren't on the list take calls as they normally would. If someone on the list doesn't come in that day, I have to find someone to fill their spot before the training session starts, which is super short notice.\n\nThere is one person who was ADAAA benefits. For those who aren't familiar, The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA) is a civil rights law that was originally passed by Congress in 1990 (as the Americans with Disabilities Act-ADA) and protects individuals with disabilities from discrimination in the workplace, as well as school and other settings. \n\nThis particular person is allowed to miss a certain amount of hours per week without receiving any corrective action. What they have been doing for the last few weeks is clocking in, coming to the board at my desk to see if they're on the list to train for the day, and then clocking out and going home if they aren't on it. Now within the last several days, this person has been frequently late, like 30 - 45 minutes. By this point, I will have already found another person to train in their spot for the day and I have to tell this person that they will not be able to train today because I had to assume they we're not coming in, just as I would with any of the other employees. \n\nSo yesterday, same thing happened. This person comes in super late and I have already found another person to take their spot, they reacted a little poorly. I could tell they were upset so I apologized. Later on that day I get an email that they sent to their direct supervisor (supervisor forwarded it to me) and they were saying that they felt like they were being left out of training because of their mental health issues, and that me and their supervisor were giving them negative feedback about their performance despite ADAAA benefits excusing them from work.\n\nI have NEVER reacted in a negative way to this person regarding their attendance, and I haven't given them any feedback at all about their training performance.\n\nI cannot start the training session with only 19 people, because I'd have one new hire sitting around doing nothing. I cannot wait on this person, assuming they even come in given their attendance forgiveness policy.\n\nI'm scared that this could tarnish my reputation or even cost me my job!",

My mom starts laying into me that I need to use a computer to apply for jobs. I tell her that I want to have a computer but I can't afford it right now.

      "description": "For background, I'm from South America, and have been living in Japan for a few years. To go back home, it would take at least 2 flights and 28 hours one way, so I never get to visit (can never attend family gatherings, weddings, funerals, etc), since my work schedule is pretty hectic, and I rarely get to take actual vacations. If you're anything familiar with latin american families, you must know this is a pretty big deal for me, and I miss my family and friends (and everything else) like crazy, even though my life here right now is pretty amazing.  \n  \nAnyway, the longest national holiday in this country is coming up, and this year, it will be a 10-day thing. This is a rare opportunity for me to actually be able to spend a few days in my home country, so I started making plans to travel with my boyfriend a while ago (he is Japanese, and works even more than I do). Due to multiple factors (job change, move, other setbacks), we couldn't get to purchase tickets months in advance, and since this is the only decent holiday in this country, the prices quickly sky-rocketed, and we couldn't afford it. So we had basically given up on going anywhere, and were thinking of things to do during that period that wouldn't break the bank.  \nUnrelated to this issue, things haven't been going too well for us as a couple. We have been fighting a lot, there is quite a lack of affection recently, and while it's embarassing to admit, I'm resenting him a lot lately. I have been thinking of breaking up, but we somehow always make up after a fight, and we still like each other (have talked about marriage, etc). So I'm torn about that as well.  \nRecently, my father has contacted me offering to pay for my trip back home, because he knows I have been kind of down lately, and honestly, because he misses me. I got super excited, and there is nothing I'd like more than going back for the first time in years, but that would mean leaving my boyfriend behind, when we were both looking for things to do together during the holiday.  \nConsidering things haven't been great for us recently, and how much I need some time away, I'm pretty much set on taking my dad's offer. That would make my boyfriend pretty upset though. So, Would I Be The Asshole if I went back home and left him with nothing to do?  \n  \nTL;DR: Boyfriend and I had plans to visit my home country for the first time in years during the holidays. Realized we couldn't afford it, and gave up. Things haven't been going too well with said boyfriend, because of unrelated reasons. My dad has offered to pay for me to go, because he wants to see me. I want to go, but boyfriend would be upset. WITBA if I went?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I expose my Mom in front of our family?",
      "description": "Note: sorry if the format is off, I’m writing this on mobile\n\nOkay, here’s some context to the situation:\nI am a middle child. Right after I was born, my Mom and Dad divorced, and eventually both got remarried. My dad got remarried to a nice woman who treats me like my own child. My mother, however, remarried a man that she, plain and simple, doesn’t get along with. She even had my little sister with him.\n\nAnd when I say she doesn’t get along with him, they haven’t since day 1. I have memories of their fights. They ranged from things so little as who was cooking dinner that night to what they were going to do about my “unruly” big sister, who stayed with my mom at the time. They eventually put her out of the house and made her live with my grandparents.\n\nDespite these things, I still went to stay with my mom over the summers (she had moved to a different state) and, every time I go down there, they argue. In front of my little sister, nonetheless, who can’t stay with anyone else as they’ve effectively separated themselves from the rest of the family. It got to the point that I only went down to “visit” so that if fight broke out, I’d be there to comfort my little sister.\nAfter this past summer, I decided that, for my mental health, I couldn’t go down there anymore. Luckily, my little sister has a phone now, so I made sure that she had my and my big sister’s numbers so if she ever needed to call, she could.\n\nFast forward a couple of months, and I get a call from my big sister. We talk for a little while and then the topic gets to the fact that my mother and her husband got into another fight, and my little sister had to call. \n\nThis conversation later turned to the fact that, apparently, my mother used to be very abusive to my older sister, and when she “decided” to kick out my older sister (her husband was really the one who wanted it to happen, he NEVER liked my big sister), she said that she “would gladly give her up to the state if no one else would take her.” Needless to say, this pushed me over the edge.\n\nMy mother and her husband cannot admit their own faults, and they don’t want a divorce because they “wouldn’t want to put my little sister through one” (despite the fact that my mother already put two of her kids through one). This led me and my big sister to come up with a plan to expose my mother in front of our family in a last-ditch-effort to get her and her husband to come to their senses and find a way to either make their marriage work, or a separation work. We honestly believe that this could be the only way to bring change. I was planning on doing it around my graduation this year (when my mother would come up to visit), but I’ve recently had second thoughts. If I were to expose my mother to: stop her from exposing my little sister to these fights, and to stop my mother herself from living in a toxic home, would I be an asshole?\n\nI love my mother, I always will, but this honestly needs to stop one way or another.\n\n",

She clearly has a thing for me because I always catch her stares unintentionally, which is always awkward. She finally built up the courage to tell me that she thinks I’m cute. I responded with a “thanks” and that was it. Hopefully signaling to her that I don’t think of her the same. She invited me to a small party with her and three of her friends, one of them is super attractive. My inner fuck boy instantly said “yess”. I got all dressed up, and put tons of cologne on, hoping to stand out to the hot girl. Throughout the party I avoided the girl who was nice enough to invite me, and instead hung out with her friend. She said it was time to watch a movie, and she sat right next to me. The hot girl sat on the other side and she was leaning on me, which lead to me putting my arm around her. The girl who liked me got up and didn’t come back until the end of the movie. I felt like a complete dick so I started being super nice to her when she got back. Her eyes were red, which literally tore me to pieces. I told her I liked her outfit, and complemented her hair. She seemed fine by the end of the night, so I left. She avoided talking to me from that point on.  AITA?",

I admit, I didn't really want to work, I wanted to keep studying so I got kind of a lazy attitude back then. Now I have graduated but have given up on University, I have been working full time for 2 years.\n\nAnyways, my mother keeps shouting at me that I am  lazy and she is sick of me playing videogames all day instead of going out with friends (which is not true, I do play videogames a lot but I will hang out if I don't have to wake up at 6 am the next day).\nNow I am sick of her insulting me so I recently started getting angry and shouting back at her, even if I feel bad about it. \n\nWith that said, my mother is sick, she suffers from severe depression and you can kinda tell when she is on her \"bad day\". In any case, I still don't think I deserve all this hate from her, life is hard for me as it is (trying to live on my own, with no support whatsoever).\n\nTL;DR: My mother is crazy and I get angry and insult her back when she insults me.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been struggling with this problem for a while now, but recently I have been talking to someone, that I have known for about a year now, and so far its been great to get to know and talk to this person. However, almost quite recently there have been a series of events that have happened over the course of the past few months taking the form of meaningless arguments almost. Often we will squabble about different things, but it almost always boils down to me telling them how I felt about it and them merely stating that it wasn't their problem, even though they could clearly see that I was upset by it, and constantly refusing to apologise for anything.\n\nFor example, a week ago when we were talking I asked a question, and was met with radio silence on their part. I asked again and they responded by imitating me and mocking me in a condescending voice just out of the blue, and mocked me for a few more minutes. I was surprised by this as the mood had been completely different before, but they just started to insult me, etc. So when I responded a bit surprised, and to be fair a bit forcefully, they said I should stop being so toxic, and that I had started the whole thing. We then proceeded to fight a bit about that, and then they attacked me for wanting to feel right in the argument, and not stopping in my persistence of wanting to know why they started this argument and then left. \n\nOf course, I admit that I might be a bit touchy from time to time, and that different people see things and problems different ways, but it has always been my view that if you have hurt or offended someone you should at least apologise for it, (even if you don't agree with the other person), instead of saying lets agree to disagree in order to escape an argument, especially when the person themselves started this conflict.  I have always made it clear when I have felt upset by anything hurtful the other person is saying, so am I the asshole here?",

A bread, a case of water and some milk \n\nNow I don’t know her sister well and but I do know she is a mother but to me that was very rude to not even ask me and I tell her \n\n“I don’t know where you get off, because they aren’t yours to give away, I share them because it’s too much for me and I’m being generous. Don’t do it again and I want you to pay me back for them”\nAnd storm off\n\nLater her boyfriend tells me I was a dick and she was just helping out her sister and that I shouldn’t be so selfish especially since I didn’t pay for it. They haven’t payed me a week later and I haven’t asked for it again but things are tense\n\nSo AITA? \nToo me I feel like if I have to buy the groceries I normally wouldn’t have to I should be compensated accordingly \n\n",

      "description": "Well, I just discovered this sub a few days ago an wondered, to be honest, what possible situation would require me to post here one day, and well...here I am. Judge away please.\n\nTitle says it all really. My family has always spent the holidays together at our parents house (at least Christmas), usually and this year since my sibling is working and can't get off for Christmas, my family is demanding we all travel to their place (requires multiple flights for all of us) to celebrate together - meanwhile - this sibling will be working on Christmas itself. \n\nI've had a not awesome year - some of that related to family relationships - and I'm just beginning to gather back all my positive energies, taking care of myself, meditating and exercising, all that superduperwonderful stuff and it's just starting to help, just starting... but this seemingly small thing is causing a lot trouble both in my mind and theirs. \n\nI love my family and will probably miss celebrating with them but I also know that the situation (being where this sibling lives, under their \"rules\" and ways of thinking) during the short time I have off from work myself, is just going to exacerbate all the negative energy I'm looking to avoid. \n\nIt's also a lot of undue stress. I have a dog I would need to travel with and also significant other who, gratefully, they have invited, but also have expected they will want to spend their holiday there as well. I mentioned this to my parents and they responded that my significant other could stay home (alone) with our dog, if they preferred.\n\nI expected to travel for Christmas, I thought I'd go to parents place which also happens to be in a very relaxing and nice place, so also creates a reason for travel and time off. It's easy to get to, and enjoyable for everyone.\n\nAt risk of sharing too many details, I'll leave the description of my sibling's home location as 'being most well known for it's library'. \n\nI love books a lot but imma pass here. \n\nI'm being actively guilt tripped about this whole thing, and honestly, it's not working very well - I'm pretty set on not going, but... while quickly thinking about this all again I remembered this subreddit and thought I'd see what you all think. \n\nI was going to leave this part out because it seemed like some sort of unsound argumentative logic, so feel free to ignore, but a big thing pestering me about all of this too is that there have been other holidays like thanksgiving in years past where I've been stuck working the day of and I invited my family to come to me, but they rejected for one reason or another multiple years in a row. The invitation I offered them was of equal travel distance, though direct flights, and a central location that was easy for everyone to get to. \n\nAm I right to feel strongly that this is a double standard and my family doesn't have the right to demand this of me or guilt me for my decisions here or am I the asshole for ruining a Christmas family tradition?\n\n",

      "description": "**Backstory:**\n\nI startet and finished a apprenticeship as a system engineer, did my mandatory military service an then worked until 2017. In 2017 I quit my job and did a one year fulltime school (Maturitiy / Maturité) that I can start studying.  During this time I started working as a freelancer for a former co-worker that started his own business. When I was finished with school I startet studying fulltime and also worked 40% part-time for him.  In this winter I decided I miss my freetime and changed to part-time studying. I currently work 60%.\n\nImportant during all this time I am employed as a freelancer with a notice period of two months. (two months are mandatory in my country) If there is no work he's not obligated to pay me anything, I work per hour. I never worried about that since I always had enough work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Today:**\n\nThrough a coleague from University I got a really good job offer. Better pay, paid trainings for tens of thousands of dollars and it is a dream job from the tasks. It sounds really great. I really want that job, but also don't want to destroy my bosses business.\n\nI just landed and startet a Project worth 80 grand. That the company only got because of me. I told him if I took the offer I would finish the project and create a perfect documentation that when I'm gone someone can take over. I always put the company first I worked on weekends, evenings no matter what. The main thing was that the customer was happy. I will also miss one week of lectures, because I will work one week on the project on the other side of the planet, with jetlag and everything.\n\nIn the \"talk\" about my idea to leave he got really mad and came on a personal level and gave me a guilty conscience. My boss told me he thought I would help him build up his company, to what I never accepted or signed anything. I mean I love what I do and do a goddamn good job. But I always saw me as a salaried. I don't own any parts of the company. Even in this big project he presented himself as the main character to the customer. As if he did all the planning, preparation and hard work. All my other Projects are really good documented with a couple of weeks someone can take my job over. I even asked the new possible employer if he could wait until august that I can learn in a new person for my job. Further he told me it's unfair that I leave and let him hanging. I give him goddamn 5 months to find someone. \n\nMy boss and I always had a really good time during work. I would even call him a good work friend.\n\nHe told me I could leave but he would never forgive me for the betrayal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI talked with my two best friends about that. Both told me that I'm not an asshole for wanting to take the opportunity and should leave if I wanted to. \n\nAre they right? What do you think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to babysit my brother's kid and critiquing his parenting",
      "description": "So, my brother has a kid, he's 12 and kind of a spoiled brat. I love him because he's my nephew, but i don't want to babysit him. I'll get into why.\n\n\nLast weekend, my brother had to do Christmas shopping, so he sent him to stay with me for the night. He had to wrap gifts and his son was always snooping.\n\n I have never babysat him before, or really spend long preriods of time with him. But He was absolutely unruly. I had housework to do and everything and he kept bugging me, about wanting to go out to eat. I tried to fix him something at my house but he made fun of my cooking, he spit it out and fed it to the cat. He screamed at me for 20 minutes to take him out to eat. My son had enough and just begged me to \"Take him to dinner, he's not gonna shut up until he gets what he wants\". \n\n\nSo, i did. I just gave in. But he wouldn't tell me where he wanted to eat at. I drove past all these restaurants, but nothing interested him. So i begged him to tell me where he wanted to eat at, he eventually just blurted out this restaurant that's really expensive, i tried to tell him otherwise and we could go to a McDonald's or something, but he started kicking the floor of my car, screaming that he wanted food from this place. I got him his food, he ordered over 10 dollars worth of crap and when we sit down to eat, he eats about half of it and then complains that he ordered the wrong one. He wanted the spicy flavored food, not the regular. So, he threw another tantrum in the store, and i got it for him. He ate some of that, but threw the rest away.\n\nBefore we left, i bought something for my kids and on the way home. He ate 10 bucks worth of food, and when i look in the backseat, he's done chowed down on the food i bought for my kids too. So, we passed a Gamestop on the way home, and he asked me to stop. I said no and he threw another tantrum, i stood my ground but then he started throwing stuff out the window. I just did it, i had enough. I went to gamestop. But, evidently that was wrong too. He wanted a game called Battlefield, but they didn't have it. He started whining about that, even though there were hundreds of video games in that place, nothing there interested him. So, he threw another tantrum, he fell to the floor and started screaming \"I want battlefield!\"\n\nSo, i went up to the counter and asked \"Please, for the love of God, do you have Battlefield in the back or something?\", they actually did. He got me a copy and i paid for it and we left. On the way out, i bumped into an old friend of mine. I tried talking to them, but he kept pulling my arm, and he even grabbed pebbles off the ground and started throwing them at me.\n\nWe got back in the car and he had annother problem. Apparently i got the wrong version of Battlefield, he threw the game on the floor of my car. At this point i had enough, so i took him back to his father. But when i got there, he wasn't even wrapping anything. He was on the couch in his underwear, drinking a glass of wine. He got mad at me because i brought him back early. \n\nThe first thing the kid did when he got was take out the battlefield game and show it to his dad. \"Hey dad, look what uncle joe got me! Haha!\" and he went in his room. My brother started yelling at me, he said he couldn't have that game because it was too violent.\n\nI tried telling him about the damage his kid had done and he just said \"Oh boys will be boys\", i tried telling him he was an awful parent since his kids that bad.\n\n\nYesterday, he asked me to watch him again. I started shouting \"Hell no! I will never babysit your little demon again!\" I told him he needs to get him checked. Then we had a big argument, he brought up all the things i've done bad as a parent and how my kids turned out.\n\nSeriously, what the hell is wrong with that kid? That is not normal.\n\n\nSo, am i the asshole here? Was i wrong to criticize by brother's parenting and not wanting to deal with his child? ",

      "description": "Let me start off by saying my birthday was about two months ago. The friend I'm talking about in this post surprised me on my actual birthday by coming to my house before I came home from school and having balloons and cake ready. Today is her birthday. This week, I work 3-6 pm everyday. On Monday, I asked her to grab food with me before I go to work and she kind of just brushed the idea off so I said another day. I asked her to hang out on Tuesday and she said she had work all day. I told her she gets off at like 7 latest so we could hang out after and she said she'll let me know. She never got back to me. Last night, I texted her and asked if we can hang out on Thursday. I don't work Thursday so I planned on buying tickets to take her somewhere she's been wanting to go as a surprise. She left me on read so I texted her the same question this morning and asking why she didn't reply and she texted back saying \"I just woke up\". No answer about Thursday again. Today (her actual birthday) didn't cross my mind because I have an essay to finish by tomorrow. I finished work at 6 and my boyfriends house is on the way from my job to my house (hers isn't) so I stopped by. I came back to my phone with an angry message from her calling me a shitty friend and person who only cares about her boyfriend since I was with him today and not her. She knew I was at my boyfriends house because we share locations with eachother and she was checking mine. I literally asked her multiple times this week to spend time with her and I asked about Thursday twice because I wanted to surprise her with the tickets but I stopped trying after she didn't respond to me twice. She gave me so much attitude about me and called me names. Am I wrong here? I'm really sick of her attitude and how she approaches me and never takes a second to sit there and think \"hmm maybe I was wrong too\". She just immediately attacks me and then doesn't reply when I make some kind of valid point. What do I do? Am I wrong? I only swung by my boyfriends because it was on the way. I think we're old enough where we realize we don't have to see eachothers exactly the day of our birthdays. \n\nEdit: I also want to add that I couldn't surprise her the same way she surprised me on my birthday because I worked today and she didn't so there was no way I could have been in her house while she wasn't. \n\nTL;DR I asked my friend to hang out multiple times this week and she either didn't reply or declined. I swung by my bf's house today after work (it's also her bday) since it's on the way and she blew up on me calling me a shitty friend. AM I WRONG?",

      "description": "I'm at college studying general beauty and one of our tasks was to do face painting on a client. Our teacher invited a class to be our clients so people who couldn't find anyone could get the work done (cause we can't do these assignments on each other). The class was for people with disabilities; which was fine. I was more interested in getting the work done. My teacher assigned this boy to me. \n\nI always got anxiety when doing a treatment on a client cause I get worried that I'll fuck up (I even get it when doing treatments on family members and loved ones). It was kicking in alot with this particular client as he kept talking to me but I did what I needed to do and that was the end of that. Not.\n\nThe boy started out by saying hi to me when he would see me. Fair enough. But then it boiled down to him following me which happened today.\n\nI was chilling with my friends after coming back from English. I saw the guy on the way. He said Hi and I said it back. All was fine. But then, as I went outside, he followed and stood behind me. I thought it could have been a coincidence. Maybe he wanted to go outside. I decided to go stand outside my friend's classroom cause it made me feel a bit uncomfortable. We stood there and a few minutes later he stood at the end of the corridor peaking round the corner looking at me. It freaked me the fuck out to say the least. I was going home anyway so I decided to wait outside. And of course he followed me to the courtyard and said bye. \n\nYou could argue \"he has a disability\" or \"he just wants to be your friend\". That's reasonable. But I don't have an interest in being his friend. I keep my friend circle small and don't trust many people. Frankly, following me and being creepy is not going to make me want to be your friend. It's gonna scare me off.\n\nI'm also worried that this guy has no boundaries and doesn't understand what is appropriate or not which scares me even more. If I did choose to be his friend, would he even be capable of respecting my boundaries. I don't want to take that risk in case it's the latter.\n\nSo reddit AITA for not wanting to interact or be friends with this boy? I also want to mention I have nothing against disabled people as I have a mental disability myself (it's not noticable however). I'm just concerned based of the behaviour that's been shown by this individual already.",

      "description": "I’ve been in a long term relationship with my girlfriend for almost 5 years. We have a daughter together; she turns 2 on Saturday. I got fired from my technology sales position on Monday for inadequate performance (despite me making a sale last week, but whatever). I have always struggled with my finances and I never graduated from college.\n\nMy girlfriend makes me feel like a burden. She’s a doctor and makes about 25% more than I did at my most recent job. Some months I wasn’t able to contribute to the mortgage- I had a lot of debt from my failed attempt at college and young, dumb mistakes with credit cards. My credit was shit so the mortgage was in her name, and she put in the entirety of the downpayment initially, but I have given about $5000 since then (out of $31K). She’ll say things like “my house,” and it really gets to me. \n\nSince I lost my job yesterday, my girlfriend has been so much worse. She had told me to look for another job because I hadn’t made a sale since I was hired in October, and sure, I probably should’ve listened. However, we’re in the situation we’re in now, and I have interviews and stuff lined up. Anyway, tonight she came home from work around 8:30 and freaked out because I hadn’t cleaned the house like she had asked earlier. I explained that I was very busy sending out my resume, setting up interviews, and taking care of our daughter, but she was beyond reason. She told me that she’s going to consider EVICTING me if I can’t “contribute” at all and said she wanted to put a fucking parental control code ok our TV. She says I’m already “behind” on mortgage payments, to which I responded that I think paid a fair percentage based on the difference in our incomes. That set her off, and I’m currently banished to the guest bedroom. \n\nI’m looking for a new job, it’s not like I don’t want to contribute. Am I really the asshole for paying less toward our mortgage if she makes so much more money?",

      "description": "A few months before she passed away, my mother and father were planning on possibly getting a divorce. My mother had suspicion that my father was cheating on her because he started hanging out at the neighbors house a lot. At first it was for about 30 minutes to an hour, then his time over there grew longer and longer. (Our neighbor was a single lady with kids btw) then it got to the point he would come home drunk or either high at like 3am and complain about how shitty he was feeling. My mother was the sweetest person in the world and had always put up with my father. Me and her did some snooping and we found out he did have an affair with that lady. My mother was heart broken. She confronted my father and he told her that he loves them both and doesn’t want to get a divorce because they have been married so long. I was so pissed off when I heard this. At that point I tried to distance myself from my father and wanted to be there for my mother. They lived in silence and awkwardness for a few months. He continued to go over there. I feel like my mother became desperate for love and attention and that’s when she decided to join a dating app and meet people. She met a guy that lived about 2 hours away. She would drive there to visit him sometimes, he would never come here. When she told me I was kind of worried for her and suggest that he should come here and meet us sometime. But she looked so happy and so I was happy for her. At this point I still tried to cut the relationship with my father off even more. One day when she was driving to visit him. My mother was in a car accident, and passed away. I was playing video games in my room when my father stopped in my doorway in shock and started crying. I had never seen my dad cry. I got up and I asked what was wrong, he just kept telling me I’m so sorry. When I walked out of my room I saw 3 men standing there. Two cops and a counselor type person. I didn’t cry at first, I just had this bitter hatred in my mind and the only thing I kept thinking about was “if only he didn’t cheat she would of never left.” Eventually, I did cry. Moving on a few weeks after that, I was jobless at the time and my father wanted me to start paying rent, he knew I didn’t have a job but I didn’t have anywhere else to go, so I used my credit card for a lot of stuff and racked up some debt because of him. I cried everyday for weeks over my mother. One day my mind wasn’t as clouded and I was enjoying a round of games with my friends, they knew what happened and tried to cheer me up always. My dad heard me laughing and came in and tried to ruin my laptop by dumping his tea all over it. He slammed his hand on my table and told me I never respect him and neither did my mother. He wanted me out of the house and pretty much kicked me out. Luckily my sister was moving at the same time and offered for me to live at her place. When I moved I told myself I would never go back to him. He texted me a very late happy birthday once, sometimes a I’m sorry, then he just got colder towards me and one day told me he will never help me with anything again. I didn’t reply to it. He was never a good father to me. But I’ve been told I should forgive him and reconnect our relationship.\n\n\nTLDR; Am I the asshole for giving up on my father because I blame him for my mother’s passing away? And not forgiving him?

      "description": "(On mobile, sorry in advance) tldr at bottom\n\nMy current roommate (f18) and I (f24) moved into an apartment together in December. I only said yes to letting her move in with me because I thought it would be a good experience for her entering adulthood and it would also help with bills for a bit (this is my first apartment after leaving my ex, so I had no furniture and wanted to buy some with the extra money I was saving having a RM.)\n\nWe split everything 50/50, we discussed how things would get done around the house (like chores and such) and privacy things (letting the other person know if we are inviting people over, ect). So far she hasnt done any of her half of the chores, and has brought people over all hours of the night. I did Express to her multiple times that we had talked about and agreed upon house rules and she wasnt following them. She usually plays the victim role and apologizes a lot, then saying she'll never do it again but did it again anyways.\n\nWe've lived in this apartment for just about 12 weeks now, and shes only stayed here maybe 5 weeks out of 12. I believe it's because I told her no booze/partying allowed (because shes only 18 and I'm 24 so I would get slapped with a heavy fine if the cops showed up.)\n\nAfter talking to a mutual friend about this, they told me that my RM said she hates living here and she wishes she never moved in, but RM tells me to my face that she loves living here and it's so nice.\n\n\nTldr; Helped out a friend by getting an apartment with her, only to have her not help out when shes suppose to. AITA for wanting to ask her to move out?",

      "description": "I’ve wanted to move in with by dad for a while now after I found out my mum is pregnant. I am much to old to be having another sibling and I know that if I continue living here, many parental responsibilities will be put into me. This happened with my younger sister. \n\nOn top of that, I really do not like the baby’s father. We fell out not long ago because he has some tendencies that my sister’s abusive father had. ( The baby’s dad is not abusive and has been a great father figure to my sister but the way he acts sometimes really upsets me ). \n\nI get along with my dad and his wife very well. My stepbrother and I are the same age so we get along alright but he’s usually in his room so I don’t see him much. Being at my dad’s house is a lot more peaceful and stress free than being at my mum’s house. I think, especially since I’m taking my GCSEs in May/June time, it would be a much better household for me to be in.\n\nI’m not old enough to move out on my own yet so I proposed the idea that I move in with my dad but every time I bring it up, my mum gets really upset and makes me feel like an asshole about it. \n\nSo am I the asshole or does it make sense that I want to move out?",

      "description": "I’ve known that I was bisexual for a pretty long time and as much as I do support the LGBT+ community, I have a really hard time being proud of who I am.  I always felt really uncomfortable about the fact that I’m attracted to girls. \n\nI told a couple of my close friends, three of them were queer themselves and one because I trusted her so much. I didn’t tell this particular friend because I was afraid that she might judge me and because I don’t entirely trust her. \n\nIn the past, she has told me a bunch of secrets about other friends that I probably shouldn’t have known about. She didn’t think it was a big deal for her to tell me as long as the other friend didn’t find out. This made me really not want to tell her anything because I feared that she would do the same thing to me. \n\nI am terrified of people finding out that I’m bi even though I live in a pretty progressive area. Everyone is accepting of it but every queer person that is out has their sexuality be their identity. Like this one ace guy at school isn’t made fun of for being ace but that’s definitely what he’s known for even though he doesn’t make a big deal of that. I don’t just want to be thought of in my friend group as the bi gal. \n\nWhen I finally told my friend it was because she had jokingly asked if I was bi and without thinking I just said yes. She was very supportive of me and told me it was super cool. I felt really good about myself and I was thinking about how silly it was to not have told her sooner. \n\nFast forward a couple of months and she knows that I told a bunch of my other friends before her. She is now being super passive aggressive and bringing it up into a lot of conversations and basically just calling me a bad friend for not telling her. She got super angry at me when I told her about one of my friends I had told first (who is a bisexual guy) because we weren’t as close as I was with her. AITA for not telling her sooner?",

      "description": "Hey!\n\nSo, I'm in high school and I run a club along with another person who we'll call D. This club has a subcommittee which is run by N and M. The club handles a school-wide competition of sorts, and everyone in my grade is involved in this nomination and voting process. We have some reservations about N and M running it, but we leave them to it. We ask them to send us the final voting form before they send it out, and they don't do so. \n\nImmediately, we see some discrepancies in the form. More specifically, there was a category that we agreed to take out because it would be incredibly controversial that they put back in by themselves and also generated all of the nominations in that category by themselves (all other nominations were created by the student body), and they took out a category that we agreed to include and refused to tell us why they did. We tell them that we removed the controversial one, but then D and I examine the form even more closely and discover that there were serious problems with who was nominated. Firstly, we always email the people on the form to determine if they were comfortable with their nomination. This did not happen, and a lot of people were upset that they were nominated into specific categories that they were explicitly not comfortable with. Secondly, there were people with many nominations that were outright left out of the form which wasn't fair to them. Thirdly, the majority of the people on the form were in the friend group of N and M. This, coupled with the fact that multiple people came to us and said that both N and M were bragging amongst themselves about rigging the form during multiple classes, made us very wary of what they had made.\n\nDue to all of the problems with the form, we shut it off because it was too problematic to keep it open, and we also didn't trust the both of them to deal with the form in an unbiased way - especially because both of them have a history of behavior like this. We work to recount the nominations and drop all of the recounted numbers in a shared document. On the top, there's a paragraph outlining the methodology of how we made the form. \n\nN and M see this and get very mad. They say we need to meet after school on a day to discuss. We were initially going to talk to them about it after the weekend, but we figured it couldn't hurt to discuss it at that point. So, they start getting mad at us for not telling them about how we closed the form, how it hurt that we recounted all of the numbers, and how we supposedly are \"making up rumors about them\". We explained the reason why we did everything that we did, but they wouldn't budge.\n\nAITA for shutting off this form and recounting the numbers in a new document?",

      "description": "Alright so I unfortunately got diagnosed with Genital HSV2 a while back. \n\nSince then I’ve had some conflicting test results but I’ve decided to just tell everyone I have sex with that I’m 100% sure I have HSV2 and to give them all the statistics on transmission and testing before we have sex. \n\nI think it’s the right thing to do. \n\nHere is the issue: \n\nThis guy (K) and I had hooked up at a work function about 6 months prior to me getting HSV2. It wasn’t planned and just happened. After that we didn’t really keep talking besides causal conversations because he lives on the other side of the country from me. \n\nIn August we had another work function and he was texting me and was being somewhat flirty. He never said outright he wanted to have sex again and at the time I was seeing someone. So I didn’t think I needed to disclose my HSV2 status to him. There is a lot of stigma around it and I didn’t want to deal with anxiety of a disclosure to someone I didn’t think I would sleep with again. \n\nMy Bf and I ended up not working out so when 3 weeks later we had another work function I ended up seeing K again. \n\nHe walked into my room and started kissing me and I informed him we needed to talk about something if he wanted to have sex. He agreed and said we would talk later. \n\nLater that evening he came down to my room and immediately started trying to take me clothes off. I stopped him, made sure we were both fully dressed and then launched into my disclosure speech. \n\nI covered the fact that I have HSV2, where I have it, the fact that I’m on daily viral suppression medicine, transmission rates for sex while wearing a condom and then spent another 30 minutes answering all of the questions he had. \n\nI informed him that if he didn’t want to decide tonite that there was no pressure and that he could and should take as long to think about it as he needed. \n\nHe ended up saying he didn’t care and still wanted to have sex.  I had to provide  the condoms (which isn’t an issue) but he hadn’t brought any with him under the assumption that I would be okay with having unprotected sex. The last time we slept together we used condoms. \n\nWe had sex 3 times over the course of the 1 week where we had the work function. I made sure he was cool with things and he again reassured me that he was okay with his decision. \n\nThen fast forward to the last week in October when he is texting me. He then goes on to say that it wasn’t cool that I didn’t tell him multiple weeks before hand about my HSV2 status and that if he had more time he wouldn’t have chosen to sleep with me. \n\nAITA? I thought I did everything right and his behavior really wasn’t indicative of him wanting to sleep with me and I was dating someone when we talked. So it wasn’t necessary for him to know at the time. Idk Reddit I’m really torn up about this.. ",

      "description": "My company is currently running a small week-long conference for about 40 attendees in their late 20s/early 30s. There are four of us staff members running it. Our main location is at a hotel's conference center, where we run sessions in one large room the entire day. We're paying for coffee service from the hotel, having them set up coffee and cups for everyone (attendees + staff) outside the room. We arranged for it to be served at certain break times that we have scheduled throughout each day.\n\nSince there's usually a large rush to the coffee as soon as each break starts, I've been grabbing my coffee during sessions so as to avoid the rush. Today, I went to do so at about 10:55am (the break started at 11:00am). As I was grabbing a cup, a server came up and said I wasn't allowed to take it yet because it wasn't time and she had to finish setting up. I was a little miffed but went back to the room. I assumed she had an issue with it since it wasn't 11:00 yet. So, I went back when it was 11:00 to get it (the session was running late so the attendees hadn't started coming out for break yet). Everything was entirely set up. The server wasn't there, and I started grabbing a cup, when she showed up again and gave me a very disapproving look. I showed her what time it was and said that we had ordered it for 11:00. She said \"no, you have to take it when everyone else does. Everyone has to get it at the same time.\" I thought maybe she thought I was an attendee so I said that I wasn't, that I was one of the staff members and we were the ones who ordered the coffee. I then walked off with my cup.\n\nI was really annoyed that she was trying to prevent me from taking some of the coffee that my team had ordered. But after a little while I suddenly felt like maybe I was an asshole for doing it against her wishes. So, Reddit, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for giving a discord server away once I realized it wasn't fun for me anymore?",
      "description": "A while back I was part of a writing forum that became pretty toxic with some cliques going after random people and harrassing them, using slurs, and degrading people not just because of their writing but inane things like their slang. \n\nI got sick of it and left and decided to make my own forum and discord that had stricter anti-bullying rules.\n\nA couple friends joined me and helped me create the idea of it. I created the forum, the discord, did 90% of the work for it, domain name, and even paid someone for a custom theme(which if you know web design, you know cost me a good couple hundred $'s) and made them admins and mods with me. We then began inviting other people to the discord first (particularly people who were upset with the other forum) expressing it was a much healthier place to write, and any bullying would be strictly enacted upon.\n\nEverything was great, until I noticed people were  only joining the discord server, not the forum, and were only doing so to vent about the old forum. \n\nI let it go at first because it made sense for people to vent out their frustrations and get rid of their baggage before starting fresh at the new forum. But nobody was doing that. There were even a few people who joined the discord that hadn't even been part of the old forum, and after hearing of all the drama, decided to join that one instead of the one I'd created.\n\nAt this point I was getting pretty upset with the matter of things, especially since I was expected to listen to people's problems (not just forum related) without complaint, but when it came to me wanting to vent people would express their discomfort or just make jokes at my expense.\n\nMy depression and anxiety was already getting pretty bad in its own, but adding to the fact that I went through the, time, effort and financial expense of making a new forum, only for people to just brush it off like \"oh cool new.forum but I like this place that makes me miserable better\"  made me feel really unappreciated. My roommate had already noticed I was doing badly, and suggested I take a break from discord and forums in general and, so I announced my hiatus, and logged out for about a couple of weeks. In those weeks I realized I wasn't getting anything out of the new discord and that it had just become an extension of the old toxic forum. \n\nI announced I was leaving for good and giving up the discord, and gave the discord not to one of the people who had \"helped\" me make it, but to the admin that I had known the longest and knew would be the most unbiased and fair, then left.. \n\nImmediately, one of my friends who had \"started the discord with me\" started dm-ing me and yelling that I was a bitch and a disgusting person and that I should have given the forum to then or the other person that I typically wrote with. I was shocked but I told them I didn't think I had anything to apologize for, and that I'd chosen the most temporate person in the discord to take over.\n\nAnother friend came at me, implied I didn't care about the friendship and insisted I apologize to everyone even after I explained myself and why I'd left. Later they admitted they'd been emotional at the time, but didn't apologize. I admitted that I still wanted to be friends but it would be hard for me to trust them after they had turned on me so easily at my lowest moment. They then implied I was similar to a toxic friend of theirs and said they weren't going to beg for friendship.\n\nTLDR= left a toxic forum with a couple friends. Made a new forum and discord, spent time and money on it. People started using it as a complaint area instead of what the discord was for, so I gave discord ownership to someone who wasn't those friends but I believe was a better fit for owner. Said friends then yelled and accused me of being a bad friend. \n\nSo the question is: Am I the asshole for starting a forum and discord with some friends, doing most of the work, and when I stopped enjoying it, giving ownership of the discord to someone else?",

      "description": "So my Girlfriend gave me a ride to work last night (I work nights at a hotel) and picked me up at 7 in the morning so I understand that she is tired BUT I don't think that excuses her questionable driving.\n\nOn the way home she was driving in the left lane and I pointed out that we were about to miss our exit. In response she says \"oh uhhhh\" and proceeds to SLAM ON THR BREAKS to a maybe 10 MPH crawl and crosses the 2 lanes of traffic to make the exit. Inside I'm thinking we were going to die but I very calmly ask why she didn't just take the next exit. She responds with \"No it's fine, we're fine\"\n\nThen on the next road we pulled onto from the exit we took she decides to drive maybe 10 feet away from the car ahead of us (doing 50 in a 55). The following conversation takes place.\n\nMe: Hey could you slow down a bit?\n\nGF: I have someone riding my ass I can't\n\nMe: Yeah but the difference is if you hit the person infront of us we're responsible for the damages, if the guy behind us hits us they're responsible.\n\nShe hasn't said a word to me since that conversation and is very visibly irritated.

      "description": " \n\nThinking about what to write now. I would think that I'm the asshole, but I would try to explain anyway. Keep in mind that every person mentioned is a teenager. So we're all... Kinda dumb and emotional.\n\nSo, a few days before New Year's Eve. My then-girlfriend got mad at me for not giving her enough space while I was calling her. Which is fine. I understand this because we had this conversation before. But... Instead of her just telling me she's uncomfortable with calling in the first place, she bottled it up until then. Only to have her sister be the one to aggressively explain that I should've been giving her more space, using my girlfriend's account. My argument was that I would if my girlfriend personally asked in the first place. I apologised and told her that I wanted to hear from my gf herself. After more hurtful lectures, she did. And then she said that she didn't want to talk to me right now. Understandable. I wrote out about how we could prevent this from happening, along with qualms about she had to get her sister to explain like it's her business in an Evernote document. Shared the link with her so she wasn't forced to see it until she felt ready, then left her alone.\n\nBackground information: You could say I'm rather clingy. I tend to repeatedly text and sometimes call my girlfriend until I got an answer. They had a point there. I do this since I get lonely pretty easily.\n\nOn New Year's I wished her a Happy New Year. No response. Didn't push for one.\n\nI asked for a diagram of something for a writing project I'm doing for her as a Christmas gift, which I decided to continue. She gave it to me.\n\nNext day, we were talking pretty normally about the same writing project. But I when I was about to side-track, she says she's busy. I left her alone.\n\nThe next night, Wednesday, I got somewhat lonely and asked if I could say goodnight, then proceeding to say goodnight. No response.\n\nGood morning the next day. Along with mentioning I got a slight confession to make to her. No response.\n\nThis alone is pretty okay, I probably would be fine with it. But it's the longest that I've ignored for, so I was worrying.\n\nI came to the conclusion that maybe she was getting tired of me and that she rather be with another guy. She asked a while ago if she could date him, I allowed her. But ever since she got angry with me. I noticed that she had been talking with the other guy more. Every day. I noticed by their offline times that they've been staying up at night talking to each other, every night. I was thinking that maybe there was more to her ignoring me. That there was another reason she wanted space. She only read my own texts when she's online with him too.\n\nOf course, I got jealous. I asked twice Thursday night if she wanted a proper conversation about what happened before. Read. Ignored, talked to the other guy maybe; they were both offline. I called her. She ignored the call. So, I decided to make a long text assuming that she dumped me for the other guy. Since that's the point where I could've been the asshole, here's a link to an Evernote document to what I said exactly.\n\nLINK: [https://www.evernote.com/shard/s707/sh/0a9d1779-cddf-4168-aed6-978c99a95fab/00dc40809356393f00793cff13033c08](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s707/sh/0a9d1779-cddf-4168-aed6-978c99a95fab/00dc40809356393f00793cff13033c08)\n\nSo yeah.. I said all of that. Her best friend called me to ask why would I say all of that and hurt her. And... Realizing that I really hurt her, I regretted saying all of that very much. I would love to take back what I said. I tried my best to explain to her best friend that. But, being her best friend, she supported my ex saying that she needs her space. That the other guy can talk to her because she gives her space. But then I kept saying that I would give her that space if she took only a few seconds to respond and say she stills needs some.\n\nNote that I have left her completely alone for 2 days straight, and contacted her to say Happy New Year, and left things short until she was comfortable to discuss my writing. I did give her space. Apparently, it wasn't enough for her.\n\nYesterday, she called me to say that it was over. We're through. I was hurt, I asked her to reconsider. And.. She and her friends sort of celebrated this break up hours later in a group chat we're all in. A friend of mine kicked me out of the group chat knowing that I would get hurt if I read everything. It just seems like they rid of someone who was a complete pest and were pretty glad to rid of him. Is that how someone should feel after breaking up with someone? \n\nTL;DR: My ex wanted space. I gave her said space. I noticed she was talking to another guy more often while I left her as alone as possible. I then sent a long text accusing her of wanting to be with the other guy, yet I still want to be with her so much. I regretted accusing her. She broke up with me.",

      "description": "The bride is my High school best friend of 10+ years and she is getting married after a year of engagement. They are perfect together and honestly couldn’t be happier for them.\n\nShe is a nurse who has made significantly more money than I have In my career which is perfectly fine she’s literally saving people for a living. But she doesn’t seem to get how much money we are all putting into her wedding. \n\nCut to the problem: I’ve spent over $1,000 on festivities and themed clothes for her wedding and just spent an extra unforseen $100 on my bridesmaids dress. I just received the rehearsal dinner invite (4/3) and the dinner is on April 25th and the attire is all white dress code.  I do not own anything white and neither does my boyfriend who is also invited. \n\nSidebar: I have always worn all black almost weirdly and she has always made comments about how I need to branch out over the years. Recently I have worn different colors and for her bachelorette cruise I wore a tropical themed dress and sequin jacket that are both out of my comfort zone but on theme. \n\nSo her asking to wear all white is not only shocking but annoying because I will have to buy something for it within 3 weeks and I’m so self conscious in it and she 100% knows it. We have joked about how I probably won’t wear white to my own wedding. So an outfit I will probably never wear again. \n\nWIBTA if I don’t go even though I am a bridesmaid and one of her best friends? I don’t want to spend another dime towards her wedding and I especially don’t want to buy a new all white outfit that I know I’ll never wear again. ",

      "description": "My husband and I work for the same company.   We work in the same building, on the same floor, and sit about 10 feet apart.   We don't have the same jobs, but due to proximity and similar reporting structure we know all the same people. \n\nRecently there were some changes on the team he works with, and new people were brought on board.   One of them is a very pretty woman in her 30s.   I've seen her over at his desk talking to him pretty frequently, but I'm not a person who gets jealous at ridiculous things.   He can be friends with whomever he wants.   \n\nHe told me the other day that the woman (I'll call her PCW for pretty coworker) had told him a story about being downstairs at the coffee shop with the admin for our area.   PCW was telling Admin how my husband is so funny and so easy to talk to, and how much she likes spending time with him.    Admin asked her \"You know he's married to Wimaine, right??\"  PCW laughs and says she knows, but they're just talking.   \n\nJust recently, I've noticed how much extra time she is spending standing or sitting next to him at his desk.   The other day I was offsite for 1/2 day for a charity function, and when I got back, she was sitting next to him, very closely, working on something together.    She asks him if he's going to an after-work function.  He tells her No.   She's disappointed and says if he's not going, then she's just going to go home instead. \n\nSeveral times recently I've noticed *other* people notice the relationship between Husband and PCW.   They look at me, look at Husband and PCW huddled together, look back at me.... you get the picture.   Admin confirmed the convo where she told PCW that Husband is not available, and told me (jokingly) that she's got my back.   \n\nI trust my husband completely, and am not worried about anything happening.   I know he sees her interest -- he acknowledges it -- but he's not stupid.   He does enjoy the attention from a young pretty woman, which I cannot fault him for, because we are middle-aged and not models.   \n\nI told Husband yesterday that while it's cool that they get along and they are friends and whatnot, the fact is that we do work at the same place and know the same people.   Their closeness and amount of time spent together cannot be a topic of speculation or discussion among others at work.   I have a HUGE project I'm in charge of, his work is important, too, and to top it off our company is in the middle of layoffs.    The last thing we need are distractions or a reason for HR or management to think that we are complicating the work environment.     I told him that since at least one person has for sure noticed it, chances are that others have, too.   And that because of those things, he's got to find a way to nip all this in the bud.    Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Hey there people of reddit, first time poster here, so forgive me if I make any mistakes. Also, so sorry for how stupidly long this is going to be.\n\nI'm not really sure how to start this off, so I'll just jump right into it. Earlier this week, a friend that my girlfriend hasn't talked to in three years passed away., and obviously, my girlfriend was really upset.  I've tried to help her, though I'll admit that I had no idea what I was doing. I don't know if I did a good job, but I tried to make her feel like she could come to me when she needed me. \n\nToday, my girlfriend and I were having lunch together. She seemed uncharacteristically quiet, and I could tell she was upset. After lunch, we end up going back to her room, and it's not long before she's crying so hard that she almost throws up. I tried to comfort her the whole time. I didn't know what to say, and I wasn't sure there was anything I could say to make her feel better, so I just let her cry.  She calms down a bit, so I check my phone, find that a group from my class was meeting to do mandatory peer reviews in about 10 minutes. I couldn't just ask them all to delay it for me, not when they were already meeting up.\n\nI stayed as long as I could. Our friend came over eventually and tried to talk it out with her. When I was about 20 minutes late and she had calmed down a little bit, I left; I know I shouldn't have left. She really needed me.\n\nThat being said, I felt. I just dropped out of a class of mine two days ago, one that's mandatory for my psychology major, and my dad was understandably upset about this. He's been paying for my college all by myself, and although I've never been on top of my educational game until now, I felt like I had to put in the work this time around.I just felt like I owed it to him to at least try and be more focused on my education. \n\nShe ended up going home,  and when I texted her after a while, she was understandably upset at me. Although we did make up, she told me that she thinks she can't trust me to be there for her from now on. \n\nI've always tried to be there for her whenever she needed me, and even when she didn't. I've tried to be as supportive as I could be, and while I don't know that I did the best job, I know I put in the effort. That's why it hurt so much when she said she felt like she couldn't trust me. She said this wasn't the first time she felt like this, but I've always tried to be there for her, at least as far as I remember. I haven't said this to her, but it really ticked me off that she let this one time I couldn't be there make her think she couldn't trust me. \n\nSo, AITA here? I know I should have been there for her, but I couldn't just not go to the meeting either. \n\nTl;dr- My girlfriend's friend, who she hasn't spoken to in three years, passed away recently, and I left her while she was still upset to go to a group meeting for a class.\n",

      "description": "So, right now I'm in a comfortable place financially for the first time in 3 years. I just splurged on a new TV and a bunch of weed to celebrate moving into my new apartment, and while discussing this with my cousin, she told me that she is two months behind on her utility bill, and she will have her utilities cut off on the first if she doesn't pay 275. She asked if I can lend her the money, and I told her that I couldn't do that. She called me an asshole and asked me if I'm really going to make her and her kid sit in the cold when I have the money to spend on stupid shit. I told her that I'm not happy that she's in this situation, and I'm not going to apologize for treating myself to nice stuff after going through hard times. She stormed out and told all of my family that lives in the same city as us. Now they all think I'm an asshole.\nThe reason why I didn't lend her the money is that I've lent her this amount or more 5 other times, and I've never gotten a cent back. I've always gotten assurances, but I've learned to see them as bullshit. This was during times where I had nothing, and I suffered due to not having that money. I'm in a great spot now. If I go around handing out huge wads of cash, I'm worried that I won't be eventually. Yes, this WAS a selfish decision, but I'm done being a martyr, especially to someone who doesn't keep their word and talks about me behind my back. Im taking a stand, even if it means my 13 year old cousin suffers. AITA for this?",

He said that I should have waited for him. He wasn’t letting it go so I started to shout back as well. He then starts insulting me saying “you’re gay!” And when I wasn’t offended (I said something like “as if that’s an insult”), he started shouting go back to where you came from (I am of foreign descent). I just called him a racist, flipped him off with both hands, and left.\n\nI felt like he was way out of line because I honked at him.

      "description": "So there’s this person that I recently met at a college party. We both hit it off, and while we don’t text often or meet up, we’re usually pretty friendly in passing, and they’ve offered to buy me alcohol im the future since they’re 21. We ended up at another party together, and things got awkward. Since she had been drinking at other events, she let me and a friend have most of her drink. It was late into the party, so I was already kind of drunk.\n\nAfter a while I was hammered. My friend came up with the bright idea of playing matchmaker, and asked me if I’d want to make out with her. Being very I drunk I agreed, and they went about setting us up. Needless to say, it failed, and the entire situation was very awkward, although I didn’t try to force anything physically (I never would).\n\nThe next day I texted them as normal but after a little they left me on read. I felt so guilty and horrible, but I didn’t know how they felt, and I didn’t want to come out with some huge apology that they would see as even stranger. I haven’t really seen this person at all since that party, but there’s another coming up soon that we would both maybe be at. I feel like it would be horrible to ask her to pick up something for me (I would be paying her obviously) after what happened, but I hate mooching off other friends, and I’m not great at parties where everyone is drunk and I’m stone cold sober (which this one would probably be based on the people going). How dickish would this be? I feel so bad",

      "description": "A little background info first (on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues). I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 3 months. We’re both in the same class and also just so happen to sit next to each other. We’ve been going through a little bit of a rough patch due to some dishonesty on her side. She’s been dishonest/white lied before, and we discussed and solved it in a healthy manner. I told her the number one thing is just being honest with me. I tried to drive home the point that I wouldn’t judge or fault her if she was just honest. \n\nFast forward to the day in class. We’d previously been riffing about some issues about her being dishonest about her dealings with a guy. She had deleted texts, lied about him being gay and overall had not been up front with me and tried to white lie her way out of the situation when I asked who he was (as I had never heard about him). She immediately goes into a defensive shut down when I ask about him (visually upset and frustrated). So I simply left. I got up and talked to friends at the other side of class just trying to give her some space to calm down. They ask me what happened, since they saw the fit she threw. I simply answered that I was discussing things that didn’t up with her. No accusations or statements that she cheated. Things just didn’t add up. I told them nothing that I didn’t know for fact. \n\nLater that day my phone blows up with people from a group chat I used to be in calling me a bully and a bad boyfriend. She refused to communicate with me for a good 30 minutes and it took a lot to even get her to talk to me. I explained to her that I wasn’t making fun of her and that I wasn’t upset about her friendship with another man, just her dishonesty about it. But she paints me as this humiliating dickhead and bully for discussing my feelings with classmates I trust. She thinks I’m telling everyone she cheated (which is not true). I understand how she can be upset but I made sure to tell her that the stuff she assumed wasn’t the case. So am I the asshole for the way I handled it? ",

      "description": "More specifically, that and their attitude after the spoilers occurred.\n\nSo this actually happened a few hours ago, and after a period of radio silence between us, I'm left wondering if he or I were the one to overreact. \n\nAlrighty, so on to the story. The person I'm seeing (32m) and I (27f) enjoy watching shows together. Generally speaking he picks them because he has kind of a different taste than I do (ie, I could watch mad reruns of The Office and be content, but he likes to mix it up, and watching shows with more grit). Now, in principle, I'm generally fine with this because he does show me things I haven't seen before that I do end up enjoying (although I have had to put a foot down once or twice when I'm completely disinterested in a show, and he puts it on anyway... but that's a whole different ball o' wax...).\n\nSo today we were watching one of His Shows, that took me a little while to get into, but I'm beginning to be invested in the storyline, so I'm actively watching as well. At the end of the episode, there was a moment off camera with a gunshot, and it was framed like Female Character would die. I reacted like, \"oh no,\" so he says, \"Don't worry, she doesn't die,\" which peeved me, but I felt was said with good intentions. The next episode comes up, Female Character actually shot someone else, and the story moves on.\n\nHe followed my sigh of relief with, \"She does die later though.\"..... Like wtf dude, ok spoilers much?\n\nSo I asked him to give away nothing more because I would like to watch the story unfold. He counters my request by saying, \"Well, Male Character dies, too...\" .... Male Character also hasn't died yet... \n\nSo I asked him to say nothing more about it, or I just don't want to watch this with him right now cuz he was ruining it for me. He complains that, \"You're allowed to make comments but I'm not? Yeah, ok that's fair.\"... which would be a fair point if my \"comments\" weren't all related to what's *currently on screen* in *shows he's already seen and I haven't*.\n\nSo I got frustrated with the whole ordeal and just quietly switched off the show, did not choose another, and leaned back silently to browse my reddits and breathe. He took this as me being passive aggressive, and started scrolling on his own phone making very loud comments about everything on his feed.\n\nI asked him to stop that as well, and when he chose not to, I asked him to leave. (Funny enough, got a text half an hour later saying he'd cooled off... )\n\n--------------\n\nSo TLDR: He wouldn't stop spoiling a show I've never seen before, then got pissy when I tried to breathe.

      "description": "So I'll get to it. Me (19f) have had a best friend (19m) for more than 2 years now. We've been through shit and though amazing times. Lately we went through a tough period and we're not really just as close. There are some things left unsaid and seems like no one wanted to say them.\n\nFor context, he;s been smoking weed for about a year and a half or more and has these 3 friends he does it with, which in my opinion are toxit (barely graduted, spending their parents' money and doing/dealing weed etc). He knows I don't like them, but I've never been to vocal about it.\n\nSo today I caught him in a small lie and got all annoyed and I snaped. So I told him everything I had on my soul, and poured my soul. He's been smoking HUGE amounts lately, like huge, more than he has ever before and hangs out with these friends all the time just to smoke and drive around the town. I know those friends are into stronger stuff and I'm really scared he might end up doing other things as well. So I told him that I care, that he is not heading in the right direction imo and he should really be more careful as those guys are just there for him when it comes to smoking, not real friends like me and him have been. Told him I can't stand to watch it. He replied \"stop texting me SHIT LIKE THIS\". \n\nI can't tie myself to someone doing things like this, I was more open than ever, but I've just started therapy after almost killing myself and I can't have toxit people and drugs in my life. Told him that, from my point of view, unless he decides to contact me and talk about it, our friendship is over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm heartbroken but I can't watch how my best friend is slowly changing to the point I don't recognize him.

      "title": "AITA for giving a peer a failing grade, having him lose scholarships?",
      "description": "I graduated uni in 2017 with a compsci degree. Part of leading up to it was a capstone project. I was kind of thrown into the \"remainders\" group, or a group of people who didn't come up with a group themselves. Only two of us six knew each other and the rest were strangers (I was one of the strangers). We picked roles early on and my job was technical writer (writing documents and manuals).\n\nIt became evident early on that not everyone pulled their weight. Of the six of us, I did my role, the lead programmer (LP) did their role, the team leader (TL) was active, and the other three didn't do much. I want to focus on the TL as being a good leader but other than verbal input, had nothing in the project. The other three did their work but it was really poor quality or outright didn't work: LP, TL and I had to redo their work.\n\nOr so I thought. The TL mentioned at every group meeting he had to redo x, y, or z but we learned after the fact he did not. He and LP were friends and I guess LP did all that extra work and TL took credit for it. TL was still active and went to every group meeting and was involved in discussions, but we all were.\n\nAbout halfway through the 8 month course, TL stopped showing up unless it was a meeting with the professor. He continually took credit for work he didn't do, even once going as far as saying he did everything. If you were to split the project into four parts: programming parts 1, 2, and 3, and the documentation, I ended up doing part 1 and all the writing, and LP did part 2, and one of the other three stood up to the plate late in the course and did part 3.\n\nTL ended up vanishing more or less. With a few weeks left, he stopped showing up or replying to e-mails. LP caught him once and he said that he's happy with how the course went and there's no way we can fail, so he's taking a step back.\n\nWhen it came time to do group evaluations, here's how it worked: the project was worth x marks, and we would grade each other from 0% to whatever%, and you would get that mark based off x. If the project was graded an 80, and collectively your peers gave you 50%, you'd instead only get 40. But if you got 200%, you'd get 160, etc. The caveat is your total amount had to add up to 100 times the number of group members. So if you gave someone an extra 1%, you had to take it away from someone else.\n\nI ended up giving LP 180%, that third guy who picked up the slack 150%, the two other guys who didn't do much (but still participated throughout the whole course with discussions) 85%, and TL 0%. His average group evaluation ended up being 20%, low enough that he failed the course and allegedly his average dropped enough that he lost a scholarship. TL ended up having a falling out with LP and now LP and I are pretty good friends.\n\nAITA for basically deciding TL's fate? He had to return for an extra year, pay the tuition all over again, and this time without scholarships. He was active in the first half of the course but never more than a guidance/discussion role. Maybe the biggest asshole part of me was we all made a silent pack between ourselves to give him a bad grade but told him we didn't care for group evaluations and were going to give everyone 100%.\n\n**tl;dr:** capstone group project for university. One member did basically nothing but take credit so I gave him a 0%, ensuring he failed the class and lost a scholarship. AITA for going overboard?",

      "description": "So I’ve had this friend since High school. Let’s call her S. S and I are like sisters. We’ve started our friendship off with a bit of a teasing play but now we know each other very well and try to talk a lot. We usually discuss our love lives, stuff like “ughhh men!!” Or things like that nature. I usually initiate conversation but lately she hasn’t really talked to me. At all. \n\nWe’re both young adults now which means we’re still getting our lives together. I understand she has things going on in her life that doesn’t include me and she understands the same. But as of lately, she’s been ultra distant. \n\nI’ve been trying to plan a cruise. My boyfriend doesn’t want to go out on a cruise with me and I don’t want to go alone. I wanna go in two years- the prices are much cheaper and it seems easier to plan around in two years than say a couple months. I ask her, not including when this’ll be or where, I just say “hey wanna go on a cruise” and she instantly says “I’ll be working.” This was unlike her cause the last thing she ever wants to do is stay working. She’s the party hard type so I was confused. \n\nI had let it go. If she doesn’t want to go, then that’s fine. I asked my group of friends, including her, if they’d like to do Dollar Days next month. It’s a two day event where things downtown cost a dollar for entry. Things like museums, the aquarium, the science center. It’s fun and it’s a nice weekend event. I shoot her a message and “No I’ll be working”. I didn’t say when it’ll be or what date. \n\nI feel like she’s pushed me aside, this is extremely unlike her and i don’t know what’s changed. I really don’t want to resort to begging her so if she truly doesn’t want to hang or be around, so be it. \n\nBut does that make me an asshole? ",

Jill had just started working in an office and at one point an attractive guy (Lets call him Mike) got recruited into her part of the company (they werent higher or lower than eachother). Since she had just started the job (an assistant) she had no time to spend with me. Due to this she missed our big anniversary dinner that i had planned. Mike and Jill weren getting very friendly at work (not cheating , thank god). Also we had both told eachother our \" I love you\"s so i felt thretened by Mike. One day i brought her food while she was at work (apparently she had a lot of work). Along with her knowing i was threatened by Mike ultimately led to a big fight and she suggested we break up for a while. In my devastation i left the apartment and with some of our mutual friends i went to a bar were i got slightly drunk and brought a girl home. The next day Jill came over to apologise and i managed to keep her from seeing the girl. Finally one of my friends (that i went to the bar with) accidentally let out that i had sex with a girl to Jill. Jill was devastated and in our huge fight (the fight which broke us up) she was yelling at me, asking why i did it. My counter-argument was that we were on a break and that we were not together. This went back and forth a little and after a long moment of silence the fight ended. We broke up.\n\n A few weeks later she did go on a date with Mike\n\nWho is the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for making my friend take back her cat",
      "description": "My friend had been talking to me about looking for a new home for her cat as she was planning on moving back to her hometown right after graduation (summer 2019). She had been pressing me to be the new owner to her cat because I was the only one she trusted (friends for more than a decade) but I pushed it aside stating I have no idea how to take care of a cat and my boyfriend is afraid of cats. During this conversation, she asked me if I was willing to take care of her cat during Thanksgiving break as she was going back home. I asked my boyfriend, he said it was okay since it would only be for a couple of days, and all is good. \n\nSeveral weeks ago my friend had a housing issue and needed a place to crash alongside her cat. I personally didn’t mind, but since my boyfriend is terrified of cats I had to ask first (He can be around them but he will absolutely not touch them). I asked for his permission and he agreed. (Although I forgot to ask my other roommate which was an oopsie since later in that week I found out he was absolutely terrified, even more so than my boyfriend. Essentially he locked himself in his room for the entire duration the cat was here.)\n\nAt first, my boyfriend and I didn’t really mind the cat mostly due to the fact that the cat was afraid of the new environment and so she was pretty docile. The only thing she really did was interact with us shyly or hid under the sofa. The worst part was when she became used to our apartment. She started scratching everything, our doors, the sofa, the chairs, shelves, our TV.  She was so incredibly rowdy and it had started to irritate me because, again, everyone in the apartment was afraid of cats apart from me so I had to be the one to step in to stop her. My friend, the cats' owner, never comes home until late at night around 8pm to 11pm so she never took care of the cat either. \n\nDuring their stay, my friend had dropped a couple of hints that I personally thought was a suggestion into keeping her cat. (Reminder from the very top of the post that she had been pressing me to be the new owner) She would say things like:\n\n“It’s great that she’s getting used to your apartment”\n\n“You guys are bonding so well with her.” and several other things\n\nIt may not sound like anything, but to me it was. Especially since I knew the desperation she had in finding a new owner for the cat.\n\nWhen her housing issue was resolved, it was around 11pm and she still had not come home. She had messaged me saying that everything was fixed and thanked me for letting her stay over. I asked her to come to pick up her belongings and her cat. Several minutes later, she drove up to my apartment and as I went to open the door for her, I see her unloading something from her car. She walks to the entrance, with a big bag of cat food and cat litter. \n\nI said, “What are you doing” and she responds “You said you would take her for the break.” Basically, the conversation went to me keeping her cat up until the end of Thanksgiving break which wasn’t until 2 weeks (so I was keeping the cat for 3 weeks pretty much). I was mad. She didn’t ask me prior to her coming to my apartment if I could house the cat until the end of Thanksgiving and she had already bought all the belongings of her cat. (At this point, I knew what I did was wrong, accepting the cat into my apartment even though I didn’t want to. Everyone that I had confided in told me I should’ve said no from the start. But I just felt so obligated to say yes, especially since she went through all the trouble of not informing me, and bringing all the cats stuff over.)\n\nAbout an hour later, I messaged her trying to clarify at what point was she picking up her cat because all she had stated was that I keep her cat up until the end of the break. She responds with, “actually could you keep the cat past Thanksgiving break?” And I think at this point I kind of lost my rationale. I was just all around irritated. But what was probably worse than this is because when she had said what she said, I realized that keeping the cat past Thanksgiving break immediately goes into winter break which is 2 months long. And for me knowing her for more than a decade of my life, I know she was purposely manipulating me into taking care of her cat for probably the entire duration of winter break. I argued with her during this time and after a long confrontation, she decided to come to pick up her cat in the middle of the night. \n\nIt’s been a while since I spoke to her since there's a bit of tension between us. I was just trying to wait out the awkwardness between the two of us before starting a conversation. But just yesterday, I found out from a mutual friend of ours that she had been talking about me and how I was overreacting and misunderstanding the situation. He told me her side of the story and I realized that she had been cutting corners to the story saying, “I only asked her to take care of my cat for Thanksgiving, I don’t understand the issue.” \n\nI’m just so confused right now and am unsure of what to do. From my perspective, I just feel like she’s been pushing me into taking her cat even though she knows my boyfriends afraid, my roommates afraid, and we collectively have no idea how to take care of a cat.\n\nTLDR: friend kept extending the duration of an agreement we made on taking care of her cat.\n",

      "description": ":: Okay so this is my first ever post and I am on mobile, but I needed an opinion. \n\n    For some context, I am in high school where the phrase “snitches get stitches” is literal. I am in a fifth period class that I only take due to it being an easy grade. The teacher will also leave the class for long periods of time , so a lot of kids take the time to vape. (School has bad drug problem) Now I have bad asthma and smoke of any kind is a big no-no, but I usually keep my mouth shut. I myself don’t do and/or have never done any drugs.\n\n    So a few days ago and it goes the same as every day, but instead of one or two kids it was four. My lungs can’t take that and I go to the nurse. I almost went into an asthma attack, but I luckily got my inhaler in time. I tell the nurse what happened and she calls the principal who is in charge of the punishments here. I wasn’t there, but he apparently went to the teacher’s room and told Everyone that he knew about the vapes and one kid hand him over. I don’t know what happened to him, but he probably got ISS (In school suspension). The teacher chewed everyone else out and said that if she ever smells vape again she will have everyone searched.\n\nMy question is: AITI for snitching for my own health, but causing people to get in trouble and being a snitch? That kid is only a freshmen (so is most of the class and the rest are sophomores) and that’s gonna be on his transcript.\n\n//Thanks for reading! :)\n\n",

      "description": "  \n\nMy roommate moved into my fully furnished apartment last August. Utilities are all in my name, but the internet had been in my former roommate’s name. I asked new roommate to put the internet in her name. She was agreeable and shopped around for a provider. I told her I had a router that we could use, but by the time she picked a provider, I was out of the state on vacation. Move in day for her was while I was gone, and in the 4 days until I returned, she had set up the internet and had ended up buying a router instead of asking me where my old one was or paying to rent one from the provider. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, 5 months later, we are finally sorting out utilities, and I get a text from her asking me to pay her $30 for the router she had purchased. I asked her what would happen if/when one of us moved out, would I get my money back or would one person buy the other one out? She then said she will switch to renting a router from the provider, which would cost us an additional $13/mo, and also requested that I pay her $25, or $5/month, for my use of the router from August-Dec. I refused, as it wasn’t making sense, and asked her if we could just talk about it in person instead of over text. But she persisted. She then told me to “forget” that she ever bought the router and to pay her my half of the cost of what the rental fee would have been if we had gotten a rental router starting back in August, which would be $6.50/mo or $32.50 (more than half of what she paid for the router.) I refused again, and told her we should just talk about this in person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease help me wrap my head around this and give me a reality check if needed. She and I have not had any disagreements, and up until now, have had a really laid back relationship (one of us buys toilet paper or soap and the other just buys it the next time sort of thing, even though if we are splitting hairs I have bought the majority of things in bulk from Costco.)  I just need some perspective and help reframing things before we talk again.",

Ive been meaning to catch him outside to talk to him about moving it but haven't got lucky. When I got home from work today I figured it was finally time to do something about so I walked over and knocked on their door and asked if they could move the truck off my property. Instantly his wife starts getting defensive and tells me that I dont own any property(I am renting, they would know that) . The husband hearing this comes over and we smooth it out relatively decently and he agrees to move it but in the background I can hear his wife yelling \"He just wants to be an asshole dont even bother\" even though I have let them slide with their unconstrained dog getting in to my yard and trying to attack my dog multiple times and I feel like I have been more than reasonable. AITA here? It doesnt really hurt me if he parks his truck on my yard but still I just would prefer he didnt. ",

      "description": "First some context: My roommate, (let’s call her Jane), who’s a close friend of mine, started dating some guy recently and I disliked him from the moment I met him. He was already dating someone else when him and Jane met on Tinder. Only recently he broke up with the other girl, even though Jane has been seeing him for a few months. Their relationship makes me uncomfortable because I can’t understand how Jane is okay with him cheating on his ex to be with her. I try not to be judgmental, because it doesn’t necessarily affect me directly, but I just really can’t stand him. (I’m only talking about how they met because I feel like that’s one of the main reasons I dislike him so much. I just don’t trust cheaters.)\nThe actual problem: Now he spends most nights at our place (4-5 nights a week, and sometimes he doesn’t leave for like 2 whole days). Whenever he’s here I just lock myself in my room because I feel uncomfortable around him. They usually hang out in the living room, where the TV is, and they watch TV and talk loudly at night. They always leave the living room and kitchen very messy (empty food containers, dirty dishes, their homework everywhere). While I’m not the tidiest person, I try to avoid leaving the common areas messy or dirty and she used to do the same. Today, I even noticed that his toothbrush is in our bathroom, so I think he’s just keeping some of his stuff here already.\nWhat bothers me the most is that Jane knows that I’ve had serious issues with an old roommate and her boyfriend because the guy would spend most of the time at our place. Now I feel like she’s doing the same and doesn’t even realize it. Jane knows I like privacy, yet her boyfriend is basically living with us. \nI haven’t said anything to her because my boyfriend sleeps over sometimes too (usually around twice a week, on weekends), and I don’t want to be hypocritical or petty. Also, I like Jane and don’t want to make her upset. I just don’t want to be sharing my space with someone I really don’t like and I don’t think it’s right for him to spend so much time here, knowing that it’s a shared space. Am I the asshole for not liking this guy and not wanting him here all the time? ",

I was hosting a game of Cards Against Humanity recently and I invited X since she's got a good sense of humor for CAH. X said sure, she could come, and then asked me if Y was invited. Y has that same sense of humor, so it's a reasonable question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is that X and Y are great people when they're separate, but whenever they're together they just go off on whatever they're talking about and leave anyone else as the third wheel. I know this because I did a school project with both of them, we went to get food after we were done working, and I was very much just awkwardly standing by.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nX is more reasonable about it, since she rarely talks about Y if he's not around. But Y is always going on about X.  And indeed, Y told me that he's got a crush on X, and I'm 95% sure X likes Y as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich brings me back to the Cards Against Humanity game. I told X that I wasn't going to invite Y because I thought four people was the ideal number for CAH, which is true, but also because I wanted her to be present and focused on the game and enjoying the company of others, instead of just talking with Y the entire time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole? My side of the argument is that I wanted to spend time with X before she inevitably starts dating and becomes completely inseparable from Y, but the negative side, of course, is that I indirectly stopped X from being with someone she might have preferred to be with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not trying to blame X nor Y here, they've done nothing wrong; this is a scenario where either I'm the asshole or nobody is.",

      "description": "So I'm just gonna jump into it. Me and my boyfriend live in an apartment, it's rented so it's nor mine or his, we share the costs. In a few months we'll be travelling for approx. 2 months. Around that time my friends girlfriend is going to be in town for a couple of months. My friend lives in an apartment with roommates, so shares the kitchen/bathroom and stuff and just has a room to himself. \n\nMy boyfriend, friend and his girlfriend figured they could just live at our place in the two months that we aren't there. My boyfriend says it's a good idea and we could use the money. However, I don't really feel comfortable with it for a couple of reasons:\n1. I know how my friend lives or at least used to live, not the tidiest person ever. I like to keep our place tidy and clean and don't want to come home to a mess.\n2. I don't want to get in a fight over money in case something breaks. We don't have superexpensive stuff, but still. What if something breaks that costs 500 bucks new and they give us a 100 to cover the costs. I don't know what they're like with money, but people tend to fight about money-related issues. I don't want to risk our friendship over something stupid like that.\n3. I think is kind of a hassle having to take all of our stuff (clothes, towels, shoes, coats, bathroom supplies etc.) to either our parents or somewhere else. We don't have a storage unit, but when someone else lives there you can't just keep your closets completely full. I think it's too much work for just those 2 months. \n4. I reaaaally don't feel comfortable letting another couple sleep and do god knows what in our bed and on the couch, I personally just think that's gross. \n5. Sure we could use the money, but we'll be fine without it as well, we certainly don't depend on it, since the rent isn't that high anyway. \n6. when we come home, obviously tired, I don't wanna come home to an empty home, meaning we have to go pick up our clothes and stuff from where we stored it. \n\nMy boyfriend thinks I'm overthinking and making too big a deal out of it, but I feel like it's OUR home and if I don't feel good about it, that's my right. I don't think I owe them anything and the only plus is the money that we can do without. \n\nSo long story short: am I the asshole for not wanting to rent out our house for just two months?\n",

My dad died when i was four years old and since then they have been in and out of my life but mostly out of it. In elementary school they made contact with me in 4th grade and would eat lunch with me without my moms permission or knowledge and while they never directly told me not to tell my mom, when i eventually did it was abundantly obvious what they did was not cool. Later the next year (i dont know why) my mom let me go to there house and church stuff and see a movie but later that year they basically didnt communicate with me for years except for the sporadic birthday card. In short they have been mostly not in my life and i have no emotional connection to them beyond some guilt for not wanting to talk to them. My grandfather recently had a brain bleed and almost died and since then they have been trying to communicate with me more now. Not to mention i have an amazing relationship with my grand parents on my moms side specifically my moms dad who has basically been a father figure my whole life. So am i the ass hole for just not wanting anything to do with them?",

      "description": "I recently joined a local adult kickball league for fun. Nothing serious. There are ten games, ten teams, no tournament. \n\nAt the fifth game today, the team captains decided not to let in subs because the score was too close against a top team. Usually, one of the captains has called it when it’s time to switch out. Today, nothing was said until the second to last inning when one of the other subs was like, “Hey, are we gonna get to play at all?” Maybe they got distracted, but it felt sneaky. \n\nI don’t really want to show up anymore. It doesn’t seem worth my time. I don’t have another five free hours to waste by showing up with the hopes that I’ll get to play for a bit. I’d rather do something else with my limited time. I also think the captains tried to “accidentally forget” other people were waiting to play so they didn’t have to sub us in halfway through the game. \n\nIt’s such a minor thing, but I’m annoyed. \n\nI joined because I wanted to play kickball and have fun, and I feel petty for caring about this.  Shouldn’t I want my team to win even if it means not playing?  \n\nMaybe I just see adult kickball as much lower stakes than my more competitive teammates, but I’d rather everyone who shows up for a game would get some playtime. \n\nWe obviously have enough people that we won’t forfeit if I stop coming.

AND the wedding is a 7 day long event. I know some people who have destination weddings and it usually includes the family and close friends because everything is paid for.

      "description": "Hello everyone,\n\nGrowing up, I was obese.  Very obese.  Throughout my adolescent and high school years, I was 200 +lbs.  At 5'2, that's a lot of weight to carry and my peers definitely never let me forget it.  My mother, with whom I love very much, has always been very thin and I remember being seven years old and wanting to spend time with her - while in her room, she would try on clothes and ask me if I thought she looked fat.  She fat shamed people in front of me and would always point out how I was the biggest girl in the room.  She told me about the salad diet and fed me only salad for dinner many times.\n\nAfter graduating college, she told me I would never find a job or a partner if I didn't lose weight.  EVERYTHING I ate was a constant reminder that I would be useless in every day life.\n\nThree years ago, I made a complete lifestyle change and successfully shed nearly 80lbs from my frame.  Though I physically look well and healthy, I have a twisted and distorted way of viewing food.  I exercise nearly 90 minutes a day, eat the same foods over and over again day after day, and feel unbelievably guilty every time I eat one little cookie or cupcake.  I have no friends or romantic partners because I schedule life around eating and going to the gym.  I truly hate this.\n\nLast night, my mother and I had a full on BLOW UP.  Now she told me I was too thin and was worried about me.  I ended up going absolutely crazy and told her she was the reason I am the way I am - afraid of eating - that my earliest memories are of her weighing herself in front of me and telling me how no one would ever love me if I wasn't \"skinny\". It was pretty fucking bad and my father had to separate us.\n\nI cried myself to sleep.  This morning, my brother called me and demanded that I apologize to her.  While I admit I had a breakdown, this has been building up inside of me for years and came to a head when she made a comment about how I shouldn't eat more than what was on my plate.\n\nWhile I understand WE are responsible for the choices we make in life, I can't help but feel that she led me down a very dangerous road.  I want to get better .. I truly do .. and I want to live a healthy and happy life, but there's that voice in my head telling me I will never be good enough unless I'm thin.  She reinforced this on me every day growing up.\n\nIf I am an asshole for losing my shit, I am sorry .. but I needed to get it out.",

      "description": "I'm a homemaker of two adorable little girls.  My husband is my best friend and my girls are my entire world.  It's the hardest, yet most rewarding job in the world.  It is work though and and I feel like I should get at least some compensation for all that I sacrifice.  My husband doesn't feel that way at all though.  We very very rarely fight, but last night we had by far the worst in our relationship and I'm heartbroken about it.\n\nI have been feeling this way about money for awhile now.  So I decided to draft up a list of the stuff that I do around the house.  Daycare, cleaning, cooking, ect and after the tykes were put down I presented it to him and explained that I would like to be have a separate bank account and be paid (min wage) for the hours that he's at work to be put into and that money be for the work that I put in for the family.  I figured that was completely reasonable, but apparently not.\n\nHe asked me what was wrong with our current bank account so I explained that I feel guilty spending money from it on stuff that's just for me.  Like manicures or going out with my friends, stuff like that.  Then I told him I'd also like a weekend.  Two days off where I can get back to myself and feel like a human again.  I said we could plan my weekends for when he's off to watch the girls, or hire a sitter for at least part of the day, just so long as I have some time to decompress.\n\nHe was silent through all of this and when I had stopped explaining, he kind of laughed and asked me if I was being serious.   I got a little defensive and said no and started telling him that this is what I needed, but he cut me off.  Now he's been my rock since I met him.  I have severe depression and he knows and has been my biggest support dealing with it.  He said in a jokey type way that if I was a paid housekeeper I would have been fired years ago.  I'll be the first to admit that with two toddlers running around the place gets messy and it's hard keeping up with it.  Especially dealing with depression that makes me not even want to get out of bed.  I got angry and told him he had no idea what it's like running around all day taking care of the kids.  He works in customer service and his job is literally sitting in a chair all day talking to people on the phone.  He said of course he knows, he comes home after working all day and takes over playing with the girls.  Like playing with them for a few hours before they go to bed is even remotely similar.  I told him that maybe he should really try to walk a mile in my shoes.\n\nThen he went after my weekend request, saying that he already gives them to me off because he helps out.  The thing with that is that he is a homebody and he likes staying in.  There's been nothing stopping him from going out and doing something different, but because I'd like a little time to myself once a week I'm evil.\n\nHere's where it got really hurtful.  I tried to explain to him that he really can't and doesn't understand the toll that my workload puts on me while also suffering from depression.  He is apparently \"so fucking sick of that excuse\".  Like I said, he's been my rock.  I thought he got it and understood what a struggle it is to deal with depression, but instead he just views it as an excuse.   I honestly am not sure if I'm going to be able to confide in him anymore after this.  I'm devastated.\n\nAt the time I got livid and started yelling at him.  I can honestly count the times he's raised his voice to me on one hand so I was a little taken aback when he started yelling back at me.    He said he didn't want me to work for our family, that if I really wanted a pay check let's get day care and I could get a job.  I asked him if he really wanted a stranger raising our kids and in really mocking tone he said no, he wanted me to walk a mile in his shoes.\n\nWe argued for a while.  I was in tears by then end of it.  I really just can't believe such a simple request set him off so much.  He's been absolutely amazing before all this, I just don't get it.  I really don't think me asking for money that I can spend on myself without feeling guilty would be such a big deal.  \n\nHe slept on the couch last night and either couldn't hear or purposely ignored our daughter when she woke up crying and I was up with her all night.  Now I'm exhausted, depressed, and feeling so alone and right when his day was done I got a text from him saying he was going out for drinks.  I've sent him multiple texts trying to get him to come home and he's just ignoring them now.  Was it really such an awful thing to just want the work I put in to have some value?    ",

      "description": "*English is not my first language \n\nSo I study speech therapy and one of the things we do is we get external clients which we have to examine and treat. This lesson is every Tuesday at 8:30 in the morning. To get to this lesson I have to travel for approximately 1:10 minutes in total. So I have to get up at 6:30 in the morning to get ready. With this schedule I get in school on 8:25 and a few minutes later I'm in class. Now here is the problem.\n\nSo last term we had the same schedule only we did not start at 8:30 but 8:45 so everyone could get 15 minutes early to prepare and so that there was no chaos before the clients came in. But this term as we have more clients we had to move it 8:30. Now this girl from my class said that we still had to be 15 minutes early. For me to do so I have to take a train 30 minutes early and get up at 6:00. I refused to do so, mainly because I have class to 20:30 the day before and can only get home by 22:00 which means it's impossible to get 8 hours of sleep. Now there are other people in my class who mostly agreed to do this and also this one girl from the same town as me. Now she is was irritated by me being later because she did take a train earlier. Although she does not have class to 20:30 the day before.\n\nNow a discussion ensued with me taking on half the class and refusing to come in earlier. They think I should show solidarity. They think it is unprofessional to show up just a couple of minutes before client contact. Because others do show up early. Now last term this was not an issue because I came in at 8:30 anyways as this is the regular time class's starts and also the earliest. They are obviously irritated by my refusal and see me as unsupportive to their issues. After the discussion they made the statement to never do anything for me again if I did not agree to this. This infuriated me quite a lot as I have been supportive of any issue regarding the group and have always helped them out. I know this is not binding but still to see it thrown away this easy just sucks. \n\nStill I do not think their irritation is enough to cut down my sleeping hours. There are no real rules forcing me to do this. Also my contacts are my responsibility if I come in a few minutes before they should respect that and only act when things are going south.\n\nSo am I the asshole I really don't know they kinda really make me feel like I am.

      "description": "So my brother and his fiance were engaged to be married last August, but less than a week before the wedding it was called off. My brother is pretty private about his relationships, so I don't really know what happened between the two of them. My siblings and I all tried to talk to him in the weeks after the wedding but he just said he didn't want to talk about it. \n\nThe holidays came and went and we found out he was traveling with his ex over winter break, which is cool, we all honestly had no idea that they were still together. I had seen my brother a few times since, but since he had always said he didn't want to talk about it, we didn't bring it up. \n\nSo, just today I see my brothers ex fiance for the first time in over 6 months. It was my mom's birthday and we all went out to dinner and  my brother brought her along. She ended up sitting next to me and I was telling her about this wedding that my wife and I went to yesterday, it was really nice with a beautiful cake and center pieces. I had taken a bunch of photos and was showing them to her, and she seemed interested. I honestly didn't think twice that it might upset her. \n\n\nWell, my brother texted the family group chat later that I was being a huge asshole to her, that the gf had to go to the bathroom during dinner to have a cry. He said that they're working on their relationship and there were hurt feelings and feelings of embarrassment on both sides, and it has been difficult being public about the relationship again and now his gf feels  unwelcome by me. My sisters agreed with my brother and say that I should have known better. But...it's been 6 months. It wasn't on my mind? They want me to apologize, do I have to? ",

      "description": "I'm gonna apologize for formatting right away, mobile. I'll do my best. \n\nAnyways, last summer, my family and I found out that my little sister was qualified for a trip from Wishes &amp; More, a company similar to Make-a-wish. My sister has ITP, an immune disorder that makes it so she has a super low platelet count in her blood. This basically means that she bruises easily, and any head trauma is serious. She no longer has active ITP, and her platelet count is normal. However, she has the chance of it dropping again in the future.\n\nWe are to go to Disney for her trip, originally we were supposed to go over this past winter break. However, she got sick and so did my other siblings, so we rescheduled. The new dates are over spring break, and the week following. This means I would be missing a week of class, and missing 3 midterms. Not something easy for college classes.\n\nNow since rescheduling, I have moved out and started a new job, one that I've been trying to get for a year. I am 18, and have obligations too. My professors said I can miss the midterms, but they can't have me take them early or late because it runs the risk of cheating. Whatever. Dispite explain things to my mom, she doesn't understand that I am an adult now and I have obligations other than my family. I think it's harder for her there because previously, I worked as a PCA (personal care assistant) for both my sister and my brother, and could help out more than I can now.\n\nI have offered to try and get a plane ticket for part of the trip, as the rest of my family is taking a transit van down, adding 5 extra days of just travel to the trip (we're from Minnesota). I can't really afford to do this, but either way, this isn't a good enough option for her either. \n\nAnyways, now that I've finally stated officially that I can't go, she is being super passive aggressive and mean every time I reach out. Even if I'm trying to help her in other ways, like offer to watch the dogs while they're gone, as it's expensive to board. I don't know if I should just suck it up and miss the midterms, and have my grade suffer, just because I'm sick of her acting this way. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I brought my family dog from home to my college apartment because there’s a lot going on that my mom cannot handle. My grandma has dementia that’s progressing pretty quickly and bringing the dog would alleviate some of the pressure/responsibility off my mom. (I live with my mom, sister, and grandma back home.)I also brought my dog because my roommates are never home so I feel pretty lonely and that took a toll on my mental health. \n\nIn the past 12 days he’s been here, I’ve asked for help taking him out and feeding him once from them. They said no, which is completely valid. However, I received a really long text about how it’s my responsibility to take care of my dog, when I told them I could take care of it if they couldn’t. He also left kibble on the floor after his meals. I attributed this to him just needing adjustment. My roommate was upset with this so I offered to sweep up after every meal. Even though this was a week ago and I’ve found a strategy where he eats all his kibble and doesn’t leave any on the floor, she still complains about how messy the floor is. \n\nToday, he had two accidents in the apartment. The first one was while I was at class and grocery shopping. My roommate texted me saying he peed and I told her I would buy some cleaning supplies and clean it up. She then berated me about how she only wanted her rug to not get messy with the dog, but he peed on it. I came home and cleaned it up promptly. I then went to my friends’ house for a couple drinks, but I then received another really long paragraph saying that the dog needs to go ASAP because of these incidents. \n\nI don’t want this post to get too long, but I can definitely clarify anything in the comments!

      "description": "  \n\nHi Everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsing a throwaway because I don’t really want my partner seeing this. We live in different countries and are planning to get married next year but can’t agree on the date. Originally we had both agreed on June, but due to the Visa processing times I thought January would be better for several reasons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now we’re able to talk about three weeknights and one entire day on the weekend. We’re also able to visit each other for about five months out of the year. Due to work changing, once we get married the time we spend together will change to one weeknight and one entire day on the weekend and we’ll only be able to visit each other two – three weeks out of the year. Because of current travel schedules if we get married in June that will be twelve months apart whereas if we get married in January it means seven months apart. Five months may not seem like a big deal, but five months is a massive amount of time, especially since during this time we’ll be able to see and talk to each other drastically less.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther than time apart, the other reason I want to get married in January has to do with finances. When my partner moves he’ll be taking a seasonal position at my company making about twice what he would in his country. Because of the timing of the Visa and the seasonal aspect of the job, if he moves in early 2020 (us getting married in January) he’ll be making about $13,000 more than if he were to move in late 2020 (us getting married in June). Not only that, but I currently work three jobs (60-70hrs per week) and have a chunk of debt I’m working towards paying off. If he comes here sooner I’ll be able to pay off that debt and work less much quicker. To me this all means we’ll be better off financially because he’ll be making more sooner, and I’ll be able to put a lot into savings once my debt is gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn his side, he says he feels uncomfortable with getting married in January because it’s not what he pictured. He also said he wants our anniversary date in June because January has too much going on (right after Christmas, New Years, etc.). He said the date lasts forever whereas finances and time apart are only temporary. I can see the aspect of the date being an issue. I’d prefer June as our anniversary date as well, but I figure we can set that date when we have an actual wedding ceremony in a few years (this first one will mostly be only paperwork, no special venue or pictures or anything). He’s also fine with the time apart whereas I struggle a lot more. I have no family or friends where I currently live and I’ve never liked long distance to begin with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love him with all of my heart and we see eye to eye on most things, but to me it doesn’t make sense to wait. If we get married sooner it means we won’t spend as much time apart, we’ll be better off financially, and from a selfish standpoint I won’t have to work nearly as much as I do now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo.. am I being a selfish asshole for wanting to get married in January instead of June?

      "description": "My sister and I are both adults in our 20's. She has a habit of bringing into conversations extremely cutting and sensitive things whenever we have small disagreements. These disagreements range from the trivial (like, ordering food or watching something on TV) to *any* social or political issue. I make sure that I never insult someone because of a disagreement and I always convey my views with logic, but if it happens to hit some magical amorphous trigger she replies with insults that she *knows* hurt me. As an example, the last time we were together a specific political subject was brought up, and because I disagreed with her stance she told me I sounded like I was going crazy or schizophrenic. She knows this would hurt me because I suffer from anxiety and was diagnosed with OCD when I was a child which led to some awkward moments in my childhood (giving me an almost Pavlovian response to being called crazy). I know she knows all of this, and I explained to her that she shouldn't insult me because we have differing views. Later in the day, a disagreement during a card game ensued (over something silly because they were reading the card question too slow to make sense of like one word every 5 seconds), and she made the same insult when she saw I was mildly frustrated (I think she said I was \"having an episode\" or a \"crazy episode\" or something). \n\nAnyway, I absolutely can't stand being treated like garbage by my own sibling so I decided that the next time she would insult me I would respond in kind. When she insulted me, I told her that what she said was insulting and that I would be insulting her as well. I think laid out the ol' treasure trove of sibling wisdom that I've accumulated since childhood, ensuring that they hit her sensitive areas just like she hits mine. A sort of insult *game theory*, if you will. Well, the thing is that I think it actually worked. After that incident I did notice that she refrained from insulting me over the next couple days. But I can't help but feel like an asshole for doing this.\n\nSee I just feel like my options are limited. I can do nothing and take the insults and let her walk all over me, I can cut her out of my life completely (which I don't want to do), or I can respond eye-for-an-eye. So am I an asshole in this scenario? We only see each other 3 or 4 times a year, yet I'm honestly more personally attacked in those days than in all the other days of the year combined.",

      "description": "Let me start by saying that I'm 17 (aka I don't know what the fuck I'm doing or what I'm going to do honestly), and where I come from, \"close family ties\" is basically branded onto our culture, and any deviation from it will probably get you disowned. And I always felt really guilty for not being as close to my immediate and extended family more than other people. The first few years of my childhood, my parents weren't around very much because they had to work and let my grandparents and great-grandmother babysit me (until my mom quit her job to be a full-time mom at the age of 4). \n\nMy dad is a very short-tempered man, and to be fair, he had a shitty hand dealt to him early in life, but still, he hit me with a belt. He hit me at the slightest misbehavior (like staying out a little too late or eating candy when I shouldn't have) whenever he was home, and he wasn't very shy about insults either--I got pretty high grades (in elementary) and was always on the top of my class, but he always made scathing remarks about grades that went slightly down; the words \"lazy\" and \"a burden\" were used often, and my mom never really stopped him. Nor did he ever once apologized for it.\n\nAs a 4 to 9-year-old kid, I didn't really know any better and thought that it was normal, and I spent a lot of time feeling guilty of the boiling resentment I had for him.\n\nI endured that kind of treatment for a couple more years and then went on to high school (or 7th grade, it's already considered high school here)--and I got my first failing grade--in Mathematics. \n\nI tried to explain to him that I was in a bit of a culture shock from having classes in elementary that were from 7-1 PM, to a whopping 7 AM-6PM, a much more intense workload and a commute to and from home that took two hours, versus the 15 minute walk home from elementary--it's a prestigious school where I'm from, and possibly a prison (and I'm still here for my senior high school or 11th and 12th Grade). \n\nAnd they got angry. Really angry. So much so that after I told them that I failed, my father threw all of the shit I use for school and raked through them one by one. I got screamed for doodles on the back of my notebooks even though my notes for most subjects were complete, or scraps of paper in my bag. He called me a failure, a burden, a pig--every name in the book, and my mother did nothing to stop him. \n\nHe slapped me on the face twice and even threw some of my notebooks in the garbage (I had to pick them out of our trash can when he wasn't around). That sent my self-esteem spiraling down for the next 4 years.\n\nYet in his good moods or whenever we're around other relatives, he'd always say that I was going to be the one who'd build him a house and buy him a car once I get a job. And it takes every bone in my body to stop myself from telling him \"Oh fuck no,\". And every time I express that to someone close to me, they would say \"But they're your parents,\" and that's that to them.\n\nThey had their redeeming qualities, they didn't mistreat me by starvig me or neglecting me, we were pretty well-off and like I said my dad has had a pretty rough past himself, and I love them, but I've always had a burning resentment for both of them. And I snapped and told them exactly that recently--needless to say, they were pissed and called me all the names I've heard before, plus a new one--\"ingrate\". And all the people I told about this incident have told me that was the biggest asshole thing to say to the people who raised me, except a few friends and my boyfriend.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I ask this because I've been very conflicted about this for a longest time, and in a culture of \"family always comes first\" where I grew up in, I always felt massively guilty for not wanting anything to do with my parents after I get a stable job. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So this has been bothering me for the better half of the week and I honestly dont know if I'm an asshole for this. For context she often makes it seem like her class is the most important despite the fact that her class consists of dialoguing about hot button issues (race relations, gender identity etc).  I don't have an issues with that and will gladly try to participate in the conversation on a regular basis. The issue is that it's nearing the end of the semester and I was very close to failing my ceramics class if I didn't finish the current project I was doing in time something most of my teachers understand with the exception being my yearbook and dialougs teacher. Throughout the day I had been peaking in and out of the art room to finish my project after I had done all the work in the class I was in and would ask of I could go most of which said yes then I took it from class to class to try and get it think enough to go into the kiln and not explode something I had been avoiding all year long by the skin of my teeth. As I was hollowing out the final side of the project I accidentally broke through it while it was almost as hard as it could be without it being fired. For those who aren't really into ceramics like that THAT WAS A BIG FUCKING DEAL TO ME. It was nothing to major but it was something that would take around 3-5 minutes to fix which thankfully I could do while we weren't doing anything in my 6th hour because we were officially done with the class right? Nope she wanted me in class because allegedly all I use her class for is for errands. To be fair I am also in yearbook and sometimes run out in the final 5 minutes of class to grab a camera or to talk to the yearbook teacher but for the most part I try to stay in class and participate. Well on this particular day it was a thing that depended on me graduating on time and me having a delayed graduation in August. So I asked her politely if I could run down to the art room, fix a small hole and then turn it in. Something which wouldn't take me all of 7 minutes max. She says no. I try to reason I already have an A in the class and that I needed to turn it in so I could pass that class. She still says no. By the third time my patience is running thin because otherwise I would be doing nothing except failing. She suggests I stay after school to finish it. A great idea under normal circumstances but unfortunately that day I had drivers training of which I had to walk to and I couldn't stay for long seeing as we already get out later than I would really prefer. She then suggests I finish it tomorrow. Again a great suggestion if not for the fact that it was just under bonedry (the state in which clay becomes it's hardest and most fragile until fired). I explain both of the reasons why I couldn't take those suggestions. Finally she tells me to sit down and I'm at a crossroads, do I leave and finish this or stay and possibly fail a class. Well I obviously left and finished the project and went back to class the fix and turn in process taking around 5-7 minutes at most. By the time I return I am informed that that day I wouldn't get any points for the day because I disoeyed her instructions. Obviously I have no issue with the disobeying her orders part because I did walk out of the class. My question is am I the ass for walking out and disobeying the orders in the first place. \n\nTl;dr walked out of a class I passed to finish project in a class that I was failing AITA",

      "description": "So I have a friend who I visit about 3 times a week. I’ve been at her house numerous times when a skinny, scared chihuahua mix type of dog just appears in the yard. I asked about it and she said it’s the neighbor’s dog and they keep him outside almost exclusively. The first time I saw him he was hiding under my friend’s car to stay dry from the pouring rain. She had some dog treats and I tried to give them to him from a distance but he was visibly scared of me, my friend, and her children. Most of the times that I saw this dog he was hiding under my friend’s shed, car, patio furniture, etc. to keep out of in climate weather. \n\nI didn’t see this take place personally, but I did see a text from the owner saying “throw a stick at him if goes into your yard.” He was a 5lb puppy at the time of these texts. Ive also seen this dog wandering down a very busy main road by their home. That always concerned me, but my friend said they have never cared when someone has informed them of this (this interaction was not something I observed personally or over text) I’ve never met the owners and they don’t know who I am. \n\nOne day, it was snowing and the dog was pawing at the door. We let him in and we tried giving him water and food and he ate and drank everything so fast. My friend casually said “do you want a dog?” I thought she was joking and I said something like I would love to give this dog a great home. She then said, he’s here more than he is at his home, so you should take him. And I did. It took awhile for him to not be scared of my boyfriend, brooms, and the bathroom but he is very happy now. I’ve had him for about 2 months. \n\nI took him to the vet immediately after getting him and he had severe fleas and the vet said he needed to gain weight ASAP. And there was no microchip and no reports of lost dogs. So that’s when I felt like he was mine. But since I never met the owners, I feel guilty sometimes. Should I have just called animal control? Or talked to them? I scoured Facebook to see if anyone was looking for a lost dog and I found nothing. I also have started seeing a new dog in their yard and on nearby streets so I’m starting to think they just got a replacement when they couldn’t find theirs? This dog is very new but it seems like they are doing the same thing. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I've been friends with this kid for years now, but this year I realized he had a crush on me. In the spring, he asked me about my ideal date and what my plan was for prom the upcoming year. I brushed this off, just thinking he was awkwardly friendly. \n     \nAt the end of last month, things got worse. We were texting each other memes and I made an immature nut joke (a wifi was called saucon, I said \"more like saucon deez nuts, haha got em.) He responded with \"if you want\" followed by \"comere bitch, open your mouth.\"  Again I thought he was being just awkward until just under two days later he sent me a text that said \"I want you.\" I responded \"yikes\" to that message, and he replied with \"I WANNA DIE GOD DAMNIT\" and other things of the sort.\n    \nI identify as a lesbian, and he knows that. He  would regularly ask me about a girl I almost had a thing with, including asking about if I wanted to bring her on dates and what I would want to do with her. I thought this was just him maybe trying to get advice on what he should do in the future, but I think I see otherwise now. But, when he was asked about the situation by someone else, he said that I was \"some tumblr sexuality from neptune.\"\n \nI found out at this point he had sort of flirted with two of my other friends, and asked two of my friends that left for college if they were dating anyone and how their life is turning out now that they're not in high school. \n  \nWith the sexual-ish texts, several of my friends getting texted similar things, him touching my thigh once or twice, and threats of suicide, I went to talk in to what would be the counsellors at my school. Because of the suicide threats, he had to talk to the social worker. From then on, he hasn't been allowed to speak to me.\n    \nI feel very bad about this situation because of how close I was with this kid over the years, and I'm starting to think again that I over reacted and maybe he just thought of me as one of the boys. I haven't been able to apologize and I feel very bad. I ended up having several breakdowns in this process and the guilt on my shoulders is insane. I feel like I messed up this kid's life for no reason, especially because I know he suffers from depression, and I worry that I might end up being the cause of something terrible. But, I honestly have no clue how I should feel.\n  \nHe uses reddit, so if you see this, I'm sorry. ",

      "description": "Some background: I live with 3 other people and the first month and a half there were only 2 others. We'll call this new addition, who happens to be the problem in this situation (or so I think), S. \n\nBefore S moved in, my other roommates and I had come to an agreement that we would each take turns buying large amounts of groceries that the whole house could use as long as we split the bill. Obviously, if we wanted something just for ourselves that we bought, we would simply tell the other people or put a label on it. \n\nS seemed to be fine with that initially after moving in, but within the last few months she's started saying she no longer wants to be included in our grocery haul/bill splitting because she can't afford it. That would be fine, I respect that, but she then continues to eat the groceries that we buy, and after asking her to split the bill (on more than one occasion) she'll either claim she didn't eat any, claim that she only ate a little and not enough to amount how much we're asking for (usually it's about $25 dollars, and I live in a very expensive state), or remind us that she said she didn't want to be included in groceries. \n\nS seems to have issues with boundaries. If she asks to taste something or borrow something, it usually either doesn't get returned because she's eaten/used it all, or it gets returned with very little left. \n\nWe're (myself and my original 2 roommates) trying to get her to understand that she can't have it both ways - we can't afford to buy the amount of groceries we buy either without splitting it, so when she uses the groceries and doesn't pay, it's pretty irritating. \n\nI don't feel like the asshole, I feel perfectly reasonable in wanting her to either split the cost with us or not letting her touch anything we've bought, especially considering her tendency to over-use things, but I wanted to get some outside thoughts in case I perhaps hadn't thought about something rationally from her side. \n\n",

      "description": "For some context, I went to a technical school for Computer Aided Drafting. I was the only girl in my year of 5 other guys. I wouldn't say I got special treatment because I was a girl, but because I was nice to everyone, and would often be the snack dump. \n\nI got closest to two of the guys, we'll call them Finn and Wolfy. They were both obsessive furries, and it would show in their own productivity. Often times instead of doing work, they would trace furry art in AutoCAD (a beginner level software made for making perfect lines for drafting purposes, by no means an art program). Finn would often talk about tracing the art, and then putting it on the furry amino as lineart, and since I actually know how to draw, and immersed myself in the community got really pissed at this. He would often do things like this, and never apologized for anything he did. Wolfy was his overweight, chuunibyo buddy (he hissed at me once because I was wearing a hufflepuff shirt and he's a slytherin), and was just about as bad. This went on for about two years. Finn got increasingly cuddly and would share TMI on a weekly basis at the least. He told me he fucked the manager for all the gamestop stores in my area. He was 18 and the manager was almost 30. I felt sick for weeks. Since it was legal, I couldn't take r/prorevenge with it, unfortunately. After he told me this, I knew I was done talking with him, but he got clingier. He would spend more time at my desk than his own, and would follow me around the classroom when I tried to escape. Eventually, it came to the last day. Everyone was passing contact information around, I ignored it until the last bell. Finn was pestering me for it saying things like \"this'll be the last time we see each other,\" yeah I sure hope so buddy. The moment I got outside the building I BOLTED for the car, and didn't look back. Like, proper form, kicking up dirt kind of sprint. I haven't seen him since, and hope I never do again. I feel bad thinking about how he must have looked after I ran. But then I feel no remorse when I remembered why I did it. ",

      "description": "Fingers crossed that I have done this right.\n\nTLDR: Friend doesn't say thank you to my family for paying for accommodation for a trip away and was pretty shit with money and paying her fair way throughout whole trip. Angry for the lack of manners and me and other friends who went on the trip considering cutting her out of our lives.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\nMe and a group of friends (6 of us, all 25-35F) have a tradition every year of meeting up for a long weekend to celebrate someone’s birthday once a year. We all live in different cities with different jobs, so it is difficult for all of us to get together so we use this as our chance to all be together (so this is something that is organised well in advance, as in 8-9 months in advance). \n\nI should probably point out at this stage that my family always pay for our accommodation, wherever we go as they are extremely close to some of my friends in the group and they are also generous to a fault.\n\nThis year, it was to celebrate my birthday and, as it was quite a big one, we went to a city that is pretty well known for being extortionate (I won’t say where just in case someone connected to our friend group is on here and can connect the dots). Because the city is expensive, the accommodation was also expensive as well but they also contributed money towards food and stuff.\n\nAnyway, one of our friends in the group is known for being careful (sometimes a bit skin-flinty) with her money. She does earn a bit less than the rest of us, so we understand this her situation, but in terms of outgoings (i.e rent, bills) she saves a lot of money in comparison to what the rest of us must pay so it feels like things even out when that is taken into consideration. Throughout the weekend she tried to get out of paying for things as much as she could. She skimped on getting rounds of drink in on the one night we went out for my birthday and said nothing when the rest of us paid out fair way, she didn’t contribute money for taxi’s and on one night kicked off because we went out for a meal and split the bill equally (I should note that she didn’t have an issue with splitting the bill equally, she had an issue with us rounding the split bill up individually so we could all contribute fairly to a good tip for the restaurant staff). That and, at times, she was quite rude to people and some members of the group.\n\n(I feel that the background stuff above is quite important to what is coming next, which is the crux of this post).\n\nA couple of days after we had gotten back, I noticed that the girl in question hadn’t said a “thank you” to my family for paying for the accommodation which everyone else had done. I wasn’t after expensive a bouquet of flowers or anything, just a simple “thank you” on social media/a letter/quick phone call would have done. After I realised this, I was informed by my family that she had never once actually thanked them for the previous times they had done this.\n\nAt this point I will admit I was beyond furious and hurt. I cut off all contact with her and in my temper talked to some of the other girls in our group, two of which are my closest friends, about it. They all backed me up and were cutting her off as well, they say partly due to how she acted during the weekend/towards my family and for other reasons which they wouldn’t tell me.\n\nI have calmed down since then and made friendly chat with her because I don’t want to ghost anyone but, at this point, I’m just not interested in keeping up a friendship with her because I don’t really want someone in my life who acts the way she does.\n\nAITA for 1) blowing the whole situation out of proportion, 2) potentially influencing other people’s feelings within this friendship group against this girl, in turn maybe costing her some friends and 3) letting it ruin a pretty decent friendship?\n\nI suppose I’m asking here because I am going back and forth on it. Sometimes I do genuinely feel like I am being the dramatic asshole because she isn’t a nasty person but at the same time I feel so hurt that she doesn’t have the basic common curtesy to say thank you to the special people in my life who went above and beyond to make sure we all had a fantastic time away on top of the other shit she pulled during the weekend.",

      "description": "Female, 30s, US, throwaway. On mobile, please forgive typos, etc. TW: child abuse.\n\nTLDR - AITA for never wanting to go to another out-of-state wedding of my sibling's if they invite my abuser?\n\nINFO: Sibling &amp; I are not super close, but not strained. More like friendly acquaintances, esp since they moved out of state, specifically to the state where our DeadBeat Dad lives. Sibling has a good relationship with DeadBeat. I have no relationship whatsoever with DeadBeat, due to the fact that he physically abused me when I was a toddler.\n\nMom had left him when pregnant with me, then took him back when I was about two or three years old. He was only with us for a year or so, but he beat and derided me pretty consistently throughout, as well as and verbally abusing our Mom and stealing from us/Mom's friends/our neighbors to support his crack cocaine habit.\n\nBecause he abused and traumatized me during early childhood development, I now suffer from clinical major depression &amp; generalized anxiety disorder, with regular anxiety- and panic-attacks. I've developed coping strategies, but a large part of me blames my suffering on DeadBeat. I still have vivid dreams and memories about the times he beat me every once in awhile.\n\nSo, Sibling doesn't remember this as they were a fetus/infant at the time. DeadBeat was imprisoned for theft and drugs basically right after they were born. They didn't have contact with him until they were already an adult. They grew up without ever knowing him &amp; always had a very romanticized view of what having him in our lives would be like. So when he offered them financial help for their newborn and a place to stay, they jumped at it. Understandable, I guess.\n\nISSUE: Sibling's 2nd wedding is coming up. DeadBeat will be there. I thought I was going to be able to handle being near him, esp. as Sibling assures me I don't even have to speak to him or his current wife. However, in these past months leading up to this wedding, my panic attacks &amp; overall anxiety have gotten much more frequent, and I've been struggling more with depressive episodes than I have in recent years. The only major change in my life has been this upcoming wedding. I think it's getting to me more than I initially thought it would. Not to mention that it's out of state, and I'm not in the best financial shape, so there's that added stress.  I also have student loans/debt &amp; I work a non-salaried/non-hourly job - can't really even afford to be going to this one, but I am. None of this is Sibling's fault, and I haven't told them at all.\n\nI'm going to the wedding. I love Sibling and I want to be part of my niblings' lives. But a few weeks after the event, I plan to tell Sibling that this was a one-time-deal. I'm never going to be near DeadBeat ever again if I can help it.\n\nWIBTA for telling them I'm not going to another event/wedding like this? Or should I just not say anything at all unless the situation arises in the future?",

      "description": "I (25M) come from a family of pretty heavy drinkers. My mother (53F), father (55M), sisters (23F and 28F) and cousins/uncles. Including myself.\n\nSince we're in UK, we can legally start drinking at age 18. My younger brother (20M) started at age 17 and spent the first two years of university really going hard at the drinking culture. When we would drive down to pick him up from university once every few weeks, he'd be really hungover, every single time - like a lifeless zombie. He drank pretty much every day, including day drinking pints of beer too.\n\nAt the start of his 3rd year last September, he made the decision to completely quit drinking alcohol forever. He said he had enough of the hangovers and blackouts. Initially none of us in the family took him seriously, neither did his friends, but the weeks rolled by and we realized he was serious...\n\nNow it has been 6 months since he last drank, and I honestly think my family feels threatened...all of them keep trying to pressure him into having a drink, but he doesn't budge. After I had a heart to heart with him, he told me his drinking was really bad, and that his hangovers would last days even. I then told him that I'm incredibly proud of him, and that he's inspired me to stop drinking too (1 week sober so far).\n\nSo my dad asks my why my brother hasn't drank and how he needs to \"lighten up\", I tell my dad that what my brother did is an incredibly brave thing to do at his age, and my dad tells me to shut up and calls me an asshole....he goes on to say that \"You're discrediting real brave people like soldiers and firemen when you use words like bravery so casually\". My mum agreed him with too....I'm lost for words",

      "description": "I'm a college student and an artist in my free time and I'm in a club which puts on a large event each year. They needed a mascot so there was a competition to draw one and I won the competition by drawing a more intricate cartoony character. Here's an [example](https://imgur.com/a/UbLIenB) of what my art generally looks like and the character looks kind of like that. It all seemed to be going well and people liked the character well enough but the president of the club decided to replace the original character with a version where she traced over it, but now the previous shading isn't there. She added some more details but she also made the line work a lot less intricate and changed the character's face around in a way that makes it not my style.  I'm not the best artist in the world but I think my piece looked more dynamic.\n\n I normally would just be a little bit bummed out by this, but she's asking me to do all of the shading on the new version. She also saved all of the layers of colors onto the same layer which would make it take way more time since I would have to undo all of that. I could theoretically do it faster but I don't really feel like treading over old ground in the first place. I offered to just add in the details on the original version(without changing the face), but she said that she would really prefer if I redid the shading instead of taking the faster route. I like my version and I don't really feel like spending the extra time, but I know that I should try to fall in line with what the club tells me to do. She wants it for tomorrow  which I could but I would prefer not to. Would I be the asshole if I just added in the details on the original version? I know she thinks the newer version looks best and that she's the president but I don't want to redo my own work, especially since I think it looks better as the original version. I don't want to be rebellious for no good reason so I want to know if I should take the extra time.",

      "description": "Hi, this is practically a short novel so I'll probs make a tldr at the bottom. \n\nSo, me and my partner live in a single, small bedroom. \n\nWe've just had our second heated argument over this in two days. \n\nHe gets tired much earlier than I do, and I have had pretty bad insomnia the last couple of days. \n\nIt all started on Christmas eve, I wanted to be awake in the day so I could spend time with my mum as I haven't spent Christmas with her in almost 2 years and I wanted to make her happy. This of course meant I had to stay up, as our schedule isn't norma. My bf fell asleep at about 7am and I knew if I fell asleep i'd wake up in the evening on Chrismas eve and wouldn't be there for dinner on Christmas. So yeah, I stayed up until about 11pm and fell asleep. I was not purposefully loud. I sat at my desk and watched my netflix show, headphones in and just did my do. It's winter, I'm asthmatic and have a chest infection and I'm coughing a lot. So that would have been the loudest thing that came from me. He was really, really angry at this but I told him that it was because I wanted time with my mum and he sort of understood. \n\nNow, yesterday literally as I was laying in bed after an amazing night, I realized I had ran out of all of my meds and asthma pumps. It was past 8am so I told him I was gonna hop up for a couple of hours and see if I could go to the doctors and pick up my meds then join him again (I wasn't tired like he was and it was running through my mind and driving me insane.) So i got up and sat on the chair, looking at my phone. He started saying \"I fucking hate it when you do this, you keep me up all fucking night. Just text your mum to do it\"\n\nI stuck my hands up and said \"I didn't think of that\"\n\nI apologized, texted my mum.\n\nNormally, we spoon and cuddle and all is good. I got back in to bed and he just sorta half heartedly cuddled me for a minute before turning away from me. I could feel that he was pissed off at me. I notice he doesn't have any duvet, so I take the opportunity to I don't know, communicate I guess. I say \"Don't you want any duvet?\" \n\nHe's definitely awake, itching and huffing when I say it. \n\nThis upsets me so I say in a completely neutral tone \"Or you can just ignore me, that's fine too\"  which I admit is kind of passive aggressive. I turn over and try to sleep. I can't as the anxiety and tension I felt from what was happening was overwhelming. So I lay on my back and my bf turns over towards me, still awake. I just wanted it to stop and I just wanted to sleep so I say \"Hey, can we just squeeze?\" He didn't respond so I said something along the lines of \"Can we just stop? Why are you being like this?\" (Probably wrong choice of words) and then shit just kicked off. \n\nHe started screaming about how he was tired and that I never let him sleep and I tried to explain to him that I just wanted to sort my medications out and I didn't think of just texting someone else to do it and that I literally just wanted to go to bed with him now. This didn't solve anything. He threw a bottle across the room in which I thought hit my cat so I yelled. He started telling me to leave and go back to my mums and shit. Then we both just kind of agreed to stop talking and talk about it the next day. We lay in bed, I'm sick and snotty and sniffily. This is gross but I had loads of phlegm in my lungs so I was trying to clear it out so it made a little bit of noise, but this threw him over the edge and he stormed out and locked himself in the bathroom. The bathroom is damp, leaky and to be quite honest, pretty dirty. He was trying to sleep on the floor. I came to the door and said \"Come out please, just come to bed\" eventually I got him out and he went back to sleep in bed. \n\n\nFast forward to this morning. We have a discussion about why he was pissed off and why I got 'passive aggressive' with him. He kept saying I was massively disrespecting him as the slightest things wake him up and I chose to stay awake. I tried explaining that I wasn't tired like he was. Am I supposed to sit up in the dark? I can't do anything if he's trying to sleep. I suggested he get some ear plugs but he complained that he can hear his heartbeat and it freaks him out.\n\nI tried explaining that if I do my own thing - its me being 'distant' but I can't do my own thing at the end of the day because this happens. \nHe said that I can do what I want and he's not stopping me. We eventually talk it over and I genuinely understood that he was tired and just wanted to sleep. We leave it and have another pretty decent day. \n\n\nFast forward to a few hours ago.\n\nI was chilling with him and drawing. As I was drawing, he fell asleep. There was still a whole bunch of shit on the bed, his tv and light was left on so I figured i'd finish my drawing. He was out cold at this point, mouth wide open.  I got on my computer to fix colours and stuff in photoshop. I then get a phonecall from my mum who couldn't sort out my meds the previous day and I still didn't have my pumps. Anyway, she called me and said \"I have 2 hours off, if you're awake now I can take you to get them\"\n\nI said yes as I NEED them and told her I just needed to call doctors to see if they put my prescription in. Today was the last day until after new years that I could sort this out as the doctors closes for the year today. I called my doctors, sorted everything out and got my prescription transferred to a chemist so I can pick it up tomorrow instead of today so I could go to bed. \n\nSo, everything is finally sorted out and I get into bed. I spoon him and ask if I could share one of his pillows, very quietly. He basically told me to fuck off and that I'm a selfish cunt and I tried explaining that it was my last chance to get this sorted out. He turned and shoved me angrily and started throwing things across the room at the wall. I told him to stop being aggressive and he said that I didn't listen to anything that he said earlier in the day. \n\n\nThe thing is, I did. It's just some really fucking unfortunate timing as I need my pills and pumps over the new years, and I don't have any and its literally my last chance to sort it out. If i was to sleep, I wouldn't get anything for at least another week or two. \n\n\nHe seems to think I'm trying to hurt him. I apologized and explained but he just doesnt listen and every time I'd say anything, he threw shit across the room so, I don't know if I'm missing something. I was as quiet as I could be. Am I just a cunt? I'm now sleeping on his mums sofa crying because he won't even lay in the same bed as me. This is fucking breaking me.\n\nPlease, am I really being as big a cunt as he says I'm being?\n\nTLDR; my sleep deprived boyfriend is furious at me for staying up later to sort out some errands for a couple of days. We have a messed up schedule and live in a (6x6) room with two cats.",

      "description": "(Throwaway because friends/family know my regular reddit)\n\nFor background, it was a longstanding fear of mine that my brother (2 years younger than me) would get married before I did. He and his girlfriend have been dating 8 years so this seemed like a possibility. I talked to him about it numerous times and he always said he wouldn't do that, they didn't really care about being married or not, etc. \n\nThen on New Years, my boyfriend of 2 years proposed. Our wedding is set for 11 months from now. My brother and his girlfriend were both extremely happy for us and everything seemed great.\n\nHowever, yesterday out of the blue my brother informed me that he was planning to propose this summer. I mean, what? He can't just wait until after my wedding to keep his promise? \n\nI told him that I was hurt by this breach of our agreement but he said I was out of line because he still wouldn't be getting married before me, and he said I didn't have a say in whether he proposes or not. He even went on to say he thought our original agreement was ridiculous (so then why did you agree to it?) and that I have \"no right to police when other people get engaged\" (for the record, I wasn't policing, it was a discussion we had several times where I shared my fears and he said he would respect that).\n\nI don't get why he would want to propose in the middle of someone else's engagement - it's less exciting for them, causes more stress and planning for everyone, and is just a blatant attention grab. I feel like this is almost as bad as proposing at someone else's wedding.\n\nAITA for asking my brother to keep his promise and wait to propose until after our wedding?",

      "description": "I've (16F) been dating my boyfriend (16M) for almost 5 months and he's the best. He's smart and funny and kind to me and we're both very lucky and happy. We don't have a lot of issues, except I have some trauma based anxiety around being touched and he's very touchy, plus he's ADD, which gives him a tendency to touch me without thinking and forget.\n\nI really need the ability to initiate physical affection and pace myself. I say this to him near daily and I still find myself being smothered and I'm terrified I'm going to resent him for it. The thing is, his ADD really does leave him prone to forgetting. But, part of me takes really serious issue with the idea that there's a part of him that sees me like a stress ball. And, it's been happening so long that I don't know what to do, but I don't want to belittle him for something he can't help. I don't want to break up with him, and I don't want to guilt him, but nothing is working.\n\nTonight, it came up, and I got kind of heated. I explained to him exactly why I get anxious about it (it's not a fun backstory) and said that I'm worried about starting to resent him and I need him to change his behavior immediately. Looking back, I'm worried I'm expecting him to meet a bar that's unrealistic. \n\nTL;DR: I love my boyfriend, but I don't always like being touched and he's very touchy, and as clear as I am about my boundaries, he says he forgets and it's his ADD, and I'm harboring anger at the idea that there's a part of him that sees me as something to fidget with.

(I changed names out of respect) He walks up to me in class and tells me that this girl I’ve been interested in and talking to for a few months was talking shit about me and to forget about her and find someone else. I text the girl in question and she tells me it was a miscommunication and she was talking about Jack’s girlfriend Jessica.\n\nSo the girl I’ve got a crush on has her friend text Alexis. She sent her a screenshot of what I said which is vital in this story.\n\nSo a couple of hours later. Jessica logs onto Jack’s Instagram account and starts sending me Rapper lingo and illiterate bullshit. She calls me ‘squid ward’ and says no one cares about my ugly ass. I was very confused but then she says keep my name out of her mouth. I told her I literally said nothing mean about her or not even anything at all really. Then she says she has the screenshot. Then she said the screenshot had been deleted. And then she called me an ugly faggot. I was mature enough to just reply with one word answers and nothing much.\n\nSo then an hour later Jack texts me and says he’s going to slam my fucking head through a wall if I say anything about Jessica ever again. I explained to Jack what happened and then he says. “you’re in a bullshit mindgame with some lying dumb slut. I’m being a good friend by trying to help you.” I was really pissed off and annoyed with this response. So the. I said. “Are you serious. I’m done with you.” And then I decided to not text him again. And then he says. “Text me again Tim when you have an STD.”\n\nMind you this was not the only time Jack told me to forget about that one girl. I don’t want to put up with some douchebag and his pretentious Woah-Vickey-esq girlfriend. \n\nSo am I the asshole here?",

I have never taken them before. Me and the girl had a slight argument as whilst high I was lying with my head on his legs and this made her uncomfortable. I got upset with what she was saying to me and he gave me a cuddle and told me he wished he had met me first. Nothing else happened. He gave me a kiss on the head and went to bed. I was woken up by the girl on Friday morning to her crying saying we had to call an ambulance because he had OD’d and unfortunately he died. I have been distraught. She has obviously been posting on Social Media about how upset she is, with all these pictures and I feel terrible because of how jealous I feel that she got to spend those months with him instead of me.

      "description": "Okay so I'm bi male 20yo. This happened around 3 -4 months ago. Around that time I realized that I like guys too, but now that I look back I've always liked em. so I install grindr for some fun. Mind you I've never been with other guys and the country I live in, most of people are homophobe and don't understand concept of homosexuality\\refuse to understand it. \n\nSo now after browsing through grindr I find this guy who seems cool, so i message him we get along pretty well. He suggests we meet up but I was feeling sick(later I had treatment for UTI). So we avoid it and later that day we exchange nudes. And after sometime I tell him that I need to read because I had mid term exam tommorow and he replies that he feels \"used\". Now I was frustrated because I felt like a bad guy and I told him that I don't expect anything serious or anything because I was new in it and I don't really know where is it gonna go.he said ok.\n\nAfter sometime we plan on doing \"it\" at my house. But that same exact day I fell sick again. Had mild stomach cramp and cold and after thinking it through my parents were home and this may end up really bad. Now  I told him let's not do it today which he takes really badly and says that he is dissappointed. Now me feelings bad I tell him let's do it anyways and I say I'm sure, at this point I just want to be done with it.so I go to pick him up and it's raining like a motherfucker which made me grumpy. At this point I'm freaking out and realized/get scared that this might get fucked up if my mom finds out who btw lives one floor down. So I tell him after meeting him that let's not do this because my mom is home and I feel sick. And I leave and in the way to home I realized that I left that guy in a middle of rain with a fucked up bike. I arrive home and message him that I'm sorry for leaving him there. after that he messaged me that I don't have human decency to help him which I agree that I was a dick (but I literally freaked out and forgot). His last message was \"go to hell\" but i apologized for leaving him there hanging. But I don't know AITA?",

      "description": "This is in response to a post where someone was wanting more \"assholes stepping forward\" posts.  I believe I'm the asshole here, but I've seen enough instances where my morality differs from this subreddit's consensus, that maybe this will be seen as righteous indignation.\n\n\nA Warcraft story that only gamers are going to really understand, but I'll try to explain it so anyone can participate. This is something that happened a few years back and it's fueled by a lot of ego and bias on my part. I acknowledge this was a retaliatory dick move, the real question is \"was it justified\"\n\n\nA little background, in Warcraft, there's two main types of players, those that prefer to fight players, and those that prefer to fight bots (computer control enemies).  There is a lot of friction between the two types of player and the game has a tendency to force them together when certain rewards are only available from a specific activity. This is one such instance.\n\n\nI group up with four random players I don't know and we go to a dungeon.  Early on, the party leader mentions how he's there for a super rare mount, and that he's been rerunning that dungeon all month and can't get it to drop.  I don't care about mounts, I generally don't care about anything that doesn't help me kill players more effectively, so I have genuinely negative interest in this mount.  A short while into the dungeon the leader goes off on me when he notices I don't have the optimal raider build and am completely geared towards killing players, a very common sentiment I get from raiders who are often the \"you will play this very specific way, or you are less than garbage\" type.  I just take it, and keep my head down.  He doesn't go so far as to throw me out.  \n\n\nLater on, we get to a boss that wipes the entire party.  I am the last one alive, and the boss is at ~25%.  When it turns to me, I blow all my defensive abilities including three I specifically only had access to because I was a PvPer.  I manage to down the boss alone,... right before collapsing from poison damage.  But the boss is downed, the entire party is singing my praises and the leader just goes super quiet.  And I pulled it off specifically because I didn't play like the elitist wanted me to.\n\n\nNow, this is the optimal outcome.  I proved the viability of my playstyle and the other guy is eating crow...  but this wasn't enough for me.  When we got back to the boss, the mount I had no interest in, that was the fruit of several hours of work for the raider, dropped.  Loot drops are determined by virtual dice rolls, everyone that wants an item rolls, highest roll gets the item. Everyone knew he wanted it, and no one else rolled.  But I fucking did.  Because fuck that guy for doubting me.  When we get outside the dungeon, he's begging to buy it from me.  Right in front of him, I permanently soul bind the mount to myself \"Maybe next month\"  I mount up, and ride away.\n\n\nI my opinion, I am the asshole. Insist want that mount and never would have rolled for it had he not fucked with me. I didn't need to keep going on this guy,  I had already won.  But I wanted to.  I'm not sorry, I'm fucking proud.  Even now, that day was the only time I used that ugly raptor, but I like to look at it from time to time, and just smile.  Because fuck that guy.",

They’ll have a few kids of color—but it’s mostly white kids. My parents and a few friends parents have even said, out loud, that this is the primary reason that they send their kids to this private school. \n\n\nI live in a predominately black area, so a private school with 95% white kids just seems a little weird honestly. I know it’s not a coincidence. \n\n\nSo I tweeted something alluding to that, and holy shit. \n\n\nI wasn’t expecting anything to come of it, because no one really interacts on Twitter, but people fucking lost it. \n\n\nI had kids DMing me and posting about me, calling me an idiot and insulting me, bringing up Trump(why?), etc. They had a few kids come to my defense which was nice but there were way more people sending me hate. \n\n\nI stopped responding a while ago but they still have people tweeting about me and I just wonder if maybe I was an asshole to tweet that. But then I think that it’s all public and it’s not like I was attacking these kids personally. \n\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I know the title sounds negative, but hear me out.\n\nTwo and a half weeks ago we brought on a new worker, whose main purpose is to make phone calls, send emails and schedule meetings for sales reps.\n\nOnboarding him really shouldn't have taken long, by the middle of week 1 he was already expected to make 100 calls a day, knowing full well most of those wouldn't be answered, taking no more than 30 seconds. It took him almost until the end of week 2. \n\nTo compare, the person who used to do this job was able to do 300 a day. It's been 2.5 weeks, this guy has hit 150 once, his daily target is 200.\n\nThe problem isn't his underperformance, though, it's the fact that he doesn't listen. I've told him, his manager has told him, our boss has told him and the CEO has told him, but he seems unable or unwilling to do his job. He goes off on random tangents, developing RSS dashboards, calling people not on his lists, and taking time to research each person before he calls them, something which is entirely unnecessary. We've repeatedly told him, all off us, to just make phone calls, but he keeps trying to be smarter than everyone, trying to fix things that aren't broken.\n\nYesterday he had another conversation about performance with his manager. Literally five minutes later he was discussing going off on another tangent with me, trying to tell me how to do my job. I tried getting him back on track, I'm not sure how successful I was.\n\nObviously, his performance is hurting the entire team, and it doesn't look to change. I've been trying to keep him focused, but our work hours don't completely overlap. \n\nI was discussing this with one of my colleagues on the team, saying we needed to find someone who could actually do the job. A girl from another department entirely came by and said I was an asshole for talking about him like that, and it wasn't his fault for things not working out. \n\nAm I an asshole for talking shit about him?",

The one girl is ready for preschool now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner is demanding to be involved in the school selection, thinks that the eldest girl is gifted (despite the child being clearly delayed). Her sister is on board with helping, but they are all very codependent. Both kids were fathered by an alcoholic abusive man who makes no contributions to raising them, but is at the family house every day to keep control. The mother lives with her parents as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner is utterly obsessed with her one niece, but not the other. The niece she is obsessed with is a little terror, identical to her father. She often displays signs of developmental delays and aggression. The other is very sweet and calm, very easy going baby. She calls the older niece 'her baby'. Will literally tell people that it is her child. She will interrupt peoples conversations, appointments, etc to talk about 'her baby'. I know she is a triplet and they have stronger bonds, but this one is a daily issue. We do not even live in the same city as the nieces. I find it embarrassing when she talks to others outside the family, that have confused looks and look to me to clarify or explain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach time 'her baby' goes to any appointment, she demands to be there. Will throw a fit if they go without her. She gets extra gifts for her favorite niece, will get a little something for her each time she visits, or on other peoples birthdays so 'her baby' doesn't feel left out. I have talked to her about the bias and how she is inevitably teaching the kid to expect gifts and be demanding. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole for thinking all this or is she just have really strong family bond. Especially with the first born niece. ",

      "description": "My best friend had been dating this guy for about two months when she told me she was going on a road trip with her boyfriend. This road trip would’ve been about 8-9 hours. \n\nInitially I was super uncomfortable with it since I’ve never met him or spoken to him and she absolutely refused to let us meet or tell anyone about him,, especially her parents. \n\nShe said she was going to be gone for three days and I saw her last on Friday. We hung out and she had all her bags with her. She told me that she told her parents that she was gone camping with me which is the first red flag of this story. She also said that I was the only person she told she was going on a trip to and the tplaced all the responsibility on me. \n\nWe both live in the same neighbourhood about five minutes from each other and this lie didn’t even make sense. Before I could say anything else she left as her boyfriend picked her up. \n\nThree days later and I haven’t heard from her at all and I was getting worried. She promised she would tell me when she got there but nada. She was off all social media and my texts weren’t going through and I couldn’t contact any of her friends since she refused to let me meet them too. I may be salty. \n\nI started getting anxious as I kept thinking she might’ve been murdered or had an accident so I went to her brother first and told her what was going on and then we both spoke to their parents. Her mom went into hysterics and we immediately went to the police department to file a report. \n\nThe officer working with us was encouraging me to try and hack her social media to find information as well as find the social media of her boyfriend. Eventually they were able to reach her boyfriend and it turns out she flew to Cuba and didn’t consider the consequences of her lies. \n\nShe said I broke her trust and that I ruined our friendship because I was worried about her. AITA?\n\nWe’re all adults btw. I realize she can do whatever the hell she wants but it was unfair to me and I feel like I did the right thing. I miss her so much but she treated me so poorly. Am I just too clingy or should I have just not gotten involved? Smh ",

Also, nobody knows how to deal with it and nobody has chains or emergency gear in their car because there hasn't been significant snow in our nick of the woods in, as far as I know, over a decade.

      "description": "Using a throwaway here. I don’t think anyone involved comes here but I’m gonna play it safe. \n\nSo back in high school two of my friends, let’s call them Jen and Peter, started dating. They ended up dating for something like a year and a half. Their break up was a bit messy. Nothing too crazy but we definitely wouldn’t hang out with the two in the same room together. But there weren’t many details about why or how they broke up. \n\nThere are a couple things to note here; Peter was definitely much more attached than Jen was. I figured it was because they were each other’s first SO, but after they broke up, I heard a lot from Peter’s perspective since he and I hung out in the same group of friends more frequently.\n\nJen is a very devout Christian that isn’t into sex outside of marriage. Peter isn’t religious and doesn’t have much of a moral hangup with sex. Apparently during their relationship Peter wanted to do more and go further than Jen was comfortable with, and basically complained about not getting any action after they broke up. Peter also said that her being as religious as she was put a strain on things, as he is an atheist. \n\nNow this is all knowledge I gained senior year of high school, after they broke up. This was almost 3 years ago. My judgement at the time was that Peter was a bit of a prick, but honestly I didn’t see him and Jen working out in the long run. They’re just so different on so many levels, but that’s not really a problem. Being religious isn’t bad. Being horny isn’t bad. I just figured it was a bad relationship that ended before things got too far. \n\nIf only that’s where the story ended.\n\nLast summer Jen texted me, as well as a bunch of our friends. She said that Peter had raped her one night in the back of his car in a parking lot somewhere. And apparently he tried to justify that, and a bunch of other sexual shit he tried to pull, by saying that “love isn’t a sin.” That isn’t love. That’s you being a fucking freak who can’t take no for an answer. \n\nThis was the last straw for my friendship with Peter. We were friends for a long time, but over time he just became more and more of an asshole. But we still had our good times, so I kept in touch with him and that circle of friends. But now I have no desire to ever see him again. Jen was one of my best friends from high school. I never knew he had hurt her as bad as he did. \n\nBut the issue now is that that circle of friends still hangs with him, and while I’d love to hang out with them again, I don’t wanna have anything to do with Peter, who is with them most of the time. In fact some of them don’t even think he actually did anything. I brought it up to one of our friends (let’s call him Greg) and he said that he didn’t think it was true. Granted there’s no solid evidence, and there probably never will be. But Jen’s not the kind of person to make up a lie that malicious. And with some of the things Peter told me in the past, it’s all just makes sense to me. \n\nI guess what I’m asking is whether or not it was worth it to cut him out of my life, at the expense of possibly losing touch with other long-time friends\n\ntl;dr - Two friends dated in high school, later broke up, and a couple years later I found out that the guy raped the girl. I never want to interact with the guy again, but we have a lot of mutual friends that still stand by him. Is it worth it?",

      "description": "I just discovered this subreddit a little while ago and I figured out this would be the best place to get rid of something that's been bothering me since the start of the year.\n\nSo, this one needs a ton of context, please stand with me. 2018 just started and next year I would enter University, but to do that first I would need to prepare for a national entry test to see if people meet the requirements of the university here in my country, to help with the task there are educational entities called pre-universities, who work besides regular schools, to lend a hand with studies making sure people remember everything they had learned over the past years.\n\nHere starts my story, I entered in one of these establishments to make sure I would enter University, some of my school friends also entered here. I had chemistry classes with at the same hour with one of my friends so we ended up in the same classroom. All goes dandy until my friend noticed that this girl ended up in the same classroom as us, they met prior to the start of classes in some clubs that the pre-university does before the start of the scholar year. He introduced me to her and I needless to say I found her really beautiful.\n\nTime passed by and we both got to know each other, at the time she had a boyfriend so I didn't expected to be nothing more than a friend to her, I was cool with that, at least at that time. My group of friends ended up meeting more people and we ended up with our little family there.\n\nAll good until we were near the end of the year, I had enough bottling up my own emotions, I didn't told her how I felt about her and ended up hiding the truth from her all the time, even when we ended up trusting each other, we both made clear of that. So I ended up growing balls and I was slowly building up the confidence to tell her how I felt. All the poems I made for her, all the dreamy situations I created, I was tired of dreaming, I wanted to see reality.\n\nThat was until I saw one of her Instagram stories, I had the gut feeling that something bad was happening so I tried to know if she was okay, she ended up asking me if she could call me to talk, because at that time I was the only one she could trust, that's when I knew something bad was coming.\n\nShe ended up telling about all the shit that's been going on at her house, she ended up telling me about how people used to bully her back in middle school, ended up telling me of how bad she felt when people she thought was her friend ended up leaving her in the past years, and a lot more dark things about her. I didn't knew how to act back then, I ended up telling her my story too (but that's other thing) and told her that I would prefer to talk face to face and saying that I would be by her side.\n\nI thought I made the right choice, but for some reason it didn't feel like it. I felt awful, I felt useless, I felt I could have done more for her, I felt I could actually help her but instead I was holding back for some petty feelings. I wanted better for her, I thought that if I was out of her life it would be better, I thought saying my feelings as a goodbye would be the best.\n\nThe day came by and we ended up talking face to face about everything, about her problems and all of that, but she was way better than that day when she called me. I didn't feel like it, but I ended up confessing her, I even bought her some chocolates as a last goodbye. I expected worse but she ended up telling me it was okay, there was nothing bad about how I felt, about her and her situation, in fact she told me she found me attractive and also different from the other people she knew, she said that if I had confessed sooner there might be a chance we ended up together. Needless to say it was the best day I've ever had with her, in fact we ended up skipping classes just to talk more, by the evening it was time for us to say goodbye and there I was with goofiest smile on my face.\n\nBut for some reason everything still felt wrong, I felt like if I was too late, I felt that she lied to not hurt me, I don't know. I decided I wanted to be alone for a little bit and so I did. From now on the problems starts to arise, I noticed that if it wasn't for me starting up the conversation she wouldn't talk to me at all, and also that she started to talk less and less with me.\n\nThe last of classes started to come by and our relationship was kinda better than before, we talked more but still not as much as before, in the final class I ended up asking I we would meet again once we do the entry test and all of this university shenanigans end, and she said of course we would because we are friends.\n\nAnd then is just one shit show after the other, before the test I would ask her how she was doing but she would leave me on read, I didn't blame her because once is nothing, but then more and more time passed by and she wouldn't respond me, nor my friends, like if she disappeared from the face of the earth. At that time I was distraught to say the least, I felt like I was depending on her way too much, so I ended up muting her insta but I would still come by to check her stories, then one day she would respond me saying that she's been feeling like shit in the past couple of weeks and that she needed some time alone, I respected that and I would give her all the time she needed, but I ended up asking if there was anything I could do to help, I expected a \"don't worry, I'll be fine\" but she left me on read again.\n\nI was mad now, I knew she needed some time alone but leaving me on read over and over was really messing up with me and my emotions, so I ended up unfollowing her on social media.\n\nThe weeks after that were a bliss, I finally made peace with myself and my emotions, I felt that if she talked to me I would do it in total peace, and indeed she talked to me in Christmas to wish me a happy Christmas and a new year, I did the same and curious about her state I asked how she was doing, I waited, one day, five days, on read once again, time waiting for her to respond my on read passed by and nothing. Now I was angry.\n\nI ended up cutting ties, I didn't want to know anything about her, I blocked her and everything, not even a goodbye. Time passed by and my anger finally subdued, I ended up unblocking her and she ended up putting her account on private, she doesn't talk to my friends either, like if last year didn't happened at all. And that's about it.\n\nAt the time I acted thinking in myself, I was tired that my mood would depend on her and her actions, I was tired of being the heartbroken mess, and I was tired of being a heartbroken in her eyes. I thought it was the best for the both of us, I would finally stop being an emotional mess and she would get rid of an delusional try of a lover. It seems that everything ended up good for both of us.\n\nSometimes I wonder what would happen if I start to talk to her once again, if I hurt her from disappearing from her life without any kind of reason and if I would get a chance at love. But deep down I know I wonder if I'm the bad guy on the story, or if she's the bad one, or both, or hell none of us.\n\nSorry for such a long story but I wanted to get rid of this for so long...",

      "description": "Some background on their relationship.  SIL and her fiance have been together a little under a year now.  Only about 6-7 months if you exclude all the time they have been broken up (on 3 separate occasions).  Reasons for breakups.\n\n1.  He wasn't \"motivated enough\" she said because he worked part time and used public transport.  He got a better paying job that he hates so he could afford a car to impress her.\n\n2.  She \"needed to be free\" which was code for \"I want to take a trip to my old home town and sleep with some guys I had a thing for back in high school.\"  After a few days back home at different men's homes she came back and immediately got back together with fiance.\n\n3.  This time she broke up because she thought she had a chance with her boss.  He turned her down and she took fiance back *again.*  Total breakup time was about 12 hours.\n\nWell the last breakup happened a couple weeks ago and just the other day fiance (who I'm convinced doesn't actually have a spine or any sense of self worth) proposed to SIL just 2 days after she complained to him in front of the entire family that she has been waiting for him to propose.  When my wife told me about it I shrugged and said \"cool.\"  Wife is more sick of her shit than I am having grown up with her so she and I were both pretty \"meh\" about it.\n\nWell we were just over at my MIL and FIL's for dinner with SIL, fiance, wife and I.  SIL was showing off her ring and I said \"it looks nice.\"  Everything seemed fine, but a few hours later FIL and MIL came up to me and told me how I need to be more enthusiastic and supportive of the engagement.  I told them that I won't be a jerk to her, but we all have seen how the relationship has played out.  It has been a dumpster fire.  I was told my comment was out of line, and my wife agrees.  She thinks I am not wrong to not be as enthusiastic as her parents want though.\n\nAm I the asshole for being lukewarm on this whole thing?  She treats him like shit and he takes it.  Fine his choice, but I don't feel like I have to be enthusiastically congratulating her on an engagement when I honestly think it is going to end either before they even get married or shortly after when she gets bored and starts cheating on him now that she can't just make short temporary break ups to clear her conscience when she wants to sleep with other men.

      "description": "Back info: I've lived in a big city with my boyfriend for 3 years, and I've struggled with having to handle said dog. Dog is a big cutie, and I don't mind occasionally buying dog food or that kind of thing if I'm paid back. But still, dog isn't mine.\n\nMy budget is tighter than what I can live off of, but I was a disabled child, expected to immediately receive SSI and all of that once I became an adult. That didn't happen, but I was advised to not attempt to work until the court hearings and whatnot were over, so I live off of about 200 or less a month (after rent, which is 200. Got lucky with this one). When my boyfriend was out of a job, I assumed dog food duties and general care, but now he has a job, so I've put an end to that. \n\nI've stressed over the past 3 years that I do not have the capabilities to properly care for the dog. Walking distances (dog is one of those active kinds) is painful due to my disease, my shoulder easily dislocates. The dog isn't very walking-friendly, and tends to jerk my shoulder. \n\nThe dog also doesn't keep pace when walking, but tries to run ahead. She's attempted to run out into the street (thankfully empty) more than once, but since she's doesn't do this with my boyfriend, he just rolls his eyes and jokes that its typical dog behavior for her. (The dog is an abuse survivor, so she has alot of weird habits. She's bonded with him during her recovery and doesn't like women very much.)\n\nAnyway, I tend get stuck walking the dog. Last semester, I broke and told him that I was having too many issues with my health and my college classwork was taking up too much of my energy. He agreed to walk the dog 3-4 days a week, on specific days. This worked great, my health improved. It got to a point where some weeks, I could even take the dog on an extra walk! My stress was reduced, and I didn't dislike the dog's (often annoying) habits as much.\n\nBut I went on a family vacation for two weeks for the holidays. Now I'm back, and I've expected the same set up, or at least to not have to worry about walking the dog on his off days. It's been a month, and I've walked the dog every single day. I'm struggling to keep up my energy between the dog, college, job interviews, and doctors. Due to my boyfriend's previous reactions (\"But I'm working and it hurts my feet alot\" and \"well you're not busy/working or doing alot of housework\") that have been constant any time I ask this kind of question, I leave the question to you people.\n\nWould I be the asshole for asking for him to walk his dog 4 days out of the week? Maybe 5 days out of the week?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to borrow my vape?",
      "description": "Background: my girlfriend (27) and I (29) both vape the green in a legal state. Originally we shared one vape, but after a few times when one of us would go out and take it with, she suggested getting another one so we each had our own, and I agreed. We now have a matching pair.\n\nShe smokes at least 4 times as much/often as I do, which means she needs to buy cartridges more often. There's already been one or two occasions where she couldn't afford one and asked if she could borrow some of mine, and on those occasions I let her use mine, although it made me roll my eyes a bit as she had plenty of leaf she could have smoked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarlier today she found that drained her cartridge again and asked if she could borrow mine. I asked why she didn't just go get some from the store, and she said it was cold and she didn't want to walk right now. I said yes, but was grumbling about it, and we got into a small argument which ended with her saying that I was \"making a thing out of this\" and that if I didn't want her to use it, then I should just tell her no. \n\nI thought for a moment and said that I love her, and would prefer if she didn't use my vape. So she left to go get her own cartridge, after making it clear she's pretty upset and thinks I'm being ridiculous. She said she was not expecting me to think of the vapes as \"mine\" and \"hers\" in the first place... but I find that hard to believe because she made sure hers was her favorite color and uses that one exclusively (until it runs out, anyway).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy position is that for something non-essential like smoking weed, \"I don't want to walk to the store\" is a pretty lame reason not to take care of things for yourself, and it feels like I'm basically just being tapped as an accessory for laziness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

I typically end up kicking these people instantly \n\n\n\n\n\nSo when I go through Lfgs (people I invite from look for group posts) I avoid people who say they're a stoner rather it says so in their gamer tag, picture, or actual lfg post. \n\n\n\n\nIn the past few months I've noticed that majority of these people who I've run into who act like this are black.\n\n\n\nToday when inviting people from lfg I caught myself dismissing people who's user name/picture references some sort of black current hip hop culture (guy with the skittles teeth) and now I'm just in the AITA sprial.\n\n\nI'm on mobile so go easy on my structure/lack of information \n\n\n\n\nTLDR I don't want to hear bong rips or music through party chats on Xbox which subconsciously led me to dismissing people who could be black.

      "description": "My university was having a blood drive and I made a point donate because I strongly believe that if you can you should give blood. I went in and did all the questions, talked to a nurse and was sent over to a chair. \n\nNow I’ve donated a few times and have had some not great experiences with needles because I have thin veins (?) or they’re just not ideal. I asked if she wouldn’t mind if I listen to music while she inserted the needle for the IV because I get anxious. I just really don’t like to watch. She was fine with it. I’m sure I wasn’t the only anxious person there or the first person to ask something like that. I want to be clear I wasn’t talking on my phone at this point.\n\nHowever once I’m hooked up and sitting there my BF called me and I answered since I had my headphones in anyway. It helps distract you to talk to someone and we are doing a LDR with a time difference so we don’t get to talk much in the first place. The guy next to me was watching TV on his phone and the girl on my other side had her homework out. Literally everyone was doing something. \n\nWhen I finally finished the nurse came over to unhook me and give me the run down. I told my boyfriend I could call him back and hung up, but didn’t remove my headphones. I guess she might have thought I hadn’t ended the phone call? I listened to her, thanked her and was getting my stuff together to head over to the cookie station when one of her colleagues came over and berated me for being on my phone. She told me that the nurse who had helped me was so offended that she hadn’t wanted to come back over and that I should be ashamed of myself for being that rude. She then asked me if I would be on my phone in a doctor’s office and that it was completely disrespectful. I was honestly to shocked to say anything. \n\nI grabbed a juice box and cookies to go because I was too embarrassed to sit there after what had happened.... and I just honestly don’t know if being on my phone crossed a line into asshole territory or if she was  just overreacting. \n\nThe ironic part is half the conversation with my BF was about how he should donate blood because it’s really not that bad.

      "title": "AITA I completely shut out my depressed/suicidal ex-girlfriend",
      "description": "Throwaway because she has my Reddit.\n\nI was close friends with this girl for about 3 months until we started dating. We told each other about our depression and we got really close and bonded. I very much remember watching her take out the razor blade she kept in her phone case for when she felt that she messed up and needed to punish herself. Quickly, we fell for each other and started dating. I would usually drive over to her house when she had a depressive episode to help calm her down. It became a monthly thing where she would think I was ignoring her and she would break up with me. (I was usually just busy during the day.) One day, about 5 months into our relationship, she texted me a suicide note and I couldn't drive to help calm her down because I was out of town. I called about 20+ times trying to get a hold of her and then I had to call the police because I legitimately thought she was going to kill herself. (Turns out she had tried with pills and the cops found her vomiting.) Eventually, after about 8 months/break-ups we finally decided that we weren't gonna work out but we both still wanted to be friends because we knew each other's problems and really empathized and connected with the other. Honestly, the next month and a half got pretty complicated as we were still hooking up but pledged to not have emotions, so FwBs. I think she felt guilty about what we were doing, which was never my idea. We started arguing about every week. What I mean by arguing is she would think I was ignoring her (like when we were dating) and she would proceed to stop talking to me until I drove over to talk to her. Around Christmas time (had officially been broken up for a month), she had a heavy dose of depression and while on a skype call I watched her literally slit her throat, luckily not enough to cause permanent damage. I cannot handle that thought. I have nightmares about it sometimes and she blamed me for the whole thing about how I didn't care about her. Three weeks ago, she had another breakdown again because of me and she ended up doing drugs and a \"bunch of guys\" (she never told me what or who). We resolved that and talked through a little just trying to figure out what was going on. It turns out she still loved me (I wasn't very surprised but I did not know how to act because we did not work as a couple). Last week, she fucking shut me out again and I have had it. I told her that we couldn't even be friends and that it would be best to go our own way. I feel very responsible for this girl, having gone through a lot with her and I know she is having a really tough time but I can't keep crawling back to her to help validate her sense of self-worth. I am constantly worried that she is going to kill herself because of me and I do not have any communication with her right now. I have never shut someone out so completely as I have this depressed girl. I was helping her for a while (she didn't self-harm for the entire time we dated) but now I feel as though I have pushed this girl into the arms of multiple guys as well as drug use. I feel like a total dick shutting her out after our latest argument because I know that if she decides to kill herself I am at fault because I left.\n\nTL;DR My ex-girlfriend and I were still close friends after breaking up but she keeps pushing me away and I can't deal with that anymore. Now I am worried that she might kill herself and it's my fault.",

Now, I have nothing against anyone in the military but this was a black tie optional wedding and frankly it felt very out of place and it seemed like he was just trying to show off. My wedding had over 300 guests and nobody else felt the need to wear something to make them stand out.\n\nUp until the point that I asked him to leave, he of course was acting very well mannered and like a complete gentleman, as one might expect from a member of the armed forces, and there were even a few excited teenage girls at my wedding who wanted to take a picture with him, to which he graciously agreed. Many people were thanking him for his service, and frankly it just felt like the only reason he wore that was to be in the spotlight and make it about him, which I don't think you are supposed to do at someone else's wedding. If he wants to wear that to his own wedding then fine, but the whole point of having a dress code at a wedding is so that no one guest will stand out too much.  I felt that he should have known this, since the whole point of uniforms in the military is so that you don't stand out from everyone else!\n\nI felt kind of bad about asking him to leave, but it just didn't feel right for him to be there like that.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I am well aware that when a school bus stops with its sign out, that you can't pass it. School children could be crossing the road to the left of the right of the bus.\n\nThis morning, I was returning home after dropping my son at day care. We were running a little late, and when we do, I see a bus as I leave, that takes some kindergartners from the pre-school, to the Elementary school.\n\nMost mornings, the bus is blocking all exits out of the day care, so I just wait patiently (I'm in no hurry at this time of the morning).\n\nThe difference this morning, is the bus driver leaves plenty of room to pull into the next parking lot, which also has an acceptable exit to the main road.\n\nSo, myself, in no hurry, turn on on blinker, and start making the turn. The bus driver leans on his horn. I look at the driver, but he has no expression, not waving his arms to ridicule me, so for a bit, I thought maybe there was a car behind the bus that was honking.

      "description": "Hello Reddit. I'll try to keep this brief. Edit: yeah nevermind... sorry...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, I've had to take measures to prevent contact with my parents (they're both narcissists and I'm too young to move out) and sibling as much as possible. My dad has laid his hands on me, my mother has been screaming that I'm not perfect, and my sibling (the \"Golden Child\") is being a total bitch. Here's the story behind why I hate them all, individually:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad: He's the reason I'm hypersexual, gay, bullied at school, etc. At any moment, he could walk (well, technically barge) in and say something totally random, but always sexual. He'll say things like \"Damn sex is cool,\" or other shit. He never taught me what was appropriate and what wasn't either, so I sometimes go too far without realizing it. I'm bullied pretty heavily at school because I have no boundaries, and I have no boundaries because my dad never put them up. He's also at the gym half the time, so yeah...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom: My mother wants her finger on every aspect of my life. My social media, search history, relationships, and even faith is under her careful watch. I'm athiest, but I can't tell her that; she'll flip out (because she lost control). She is a teacher at the school I go to, is friends with basically every local authority I could report this abuse to (they'll take her side of the story, she's extremely manipulative), and even tries to drive me and people she doesn't like apart. Recently, she's started filming me without my knowledge or permission listening to music. And she and my dad make fun of the videos. Luckily I know her phone password and I'll delete the videos tonight, but she's gone too far this time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister (last one I promise): My sister is my parent's favorite child. She's always in the spotlight, always allowed to do whatever she wants (including hit me), etc. Her side of the story is always taken, and she's an entitled little brat. She'll steal things right out of my room and not return them (and of course my parents don't do a damn thing). She makes fun of me for being depressed. She gets whatever cake she wants on her birthday, I get plain vanilla with whipped icing. Every damn year. It sounds petty, I know, which is part of the reason I'm here. Is it? Or am I right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit, that's my family. And I hate (no, DESPISE) them for everything they've done and are doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Am I the Asshole? Or am I justified for hating the three people that I call \"family\"?",

      "description": "I'm 27f and my husband is 30. We tried for a few years to have baby, long story short, it didn't work out and we ended up going through a couple rounds of IVF. \n\nFast forward. We find out we're pregnant and we are super happy, like over the moon ecstatic.  We couldn't wait for the 12 week mark to tell people, and started working on a nursery right away.\n\nHowever, we go to our scan and find out we are having FOUR babies. Four. That's insane. I'm cutting a lot of backstory out because honestly, it's hard for me to talk about. At the time, my husband and I are just in shock, but happy we have healthy babies. \n\nNow, I'm a small woman, 5'0 and very petite. At my next scan, it was suggested I consider aborting two of the pregnancies for the sake of my body, and to be honest, I was quietly considering bringing this idea up to my husband anyway because of the money involved with raising four children. We could afford two babies, but no way could we afford four. \n\nMe and my husband are distraught that this is our reality, but we went home and tried to figure it out. From our latest scan, we know we have identical twin girls and two fraternal boys in there. If we go through with the selective abortion, which we most likely will, I brought up that I would like to keep the two girls as they are identical twins (I'm hoping they have the 'twin bond') and also, to be honest, I've always wanted girls. \n\nMy husband is on board with this, but as soon as I told my mother and sister the scenario they kicked off, calling us selfish, entitled, saying we are searching for designer babies, etc.\n\nThe way I see it is that we have to make a choice which babies go if we do this, and it breaks our hearts that we are in this position but we need to do what we can for the sake of our children. This story sounds so tragic, like a soap storyline or something but it's honestly the hardest thing I have ever done. \n\nSo, my question is both AITA for having a preference in this? ",

So I was the one driving from place to place, picking up things to then dropping off, and then helping out at the warehouse where everything was being dropped off.\n\nAt the end, she asked to go to here sister’s house and I said sure(I had nothing to do there, but whatever, I don’t mind). At that point I had driven approximately 3 hours, and just wanted to be home, but we stayed there for around for a couple hours. Her two cousins showed up, and one of them left to go eat and took their car. When we were about to head out, my gf tells me we’re going to take her cousin and gives me an address that’s 20 minutes from her sister’s house, and around 25 more minutes from/back to our apartment. I say no, that i’m Tired, and If anything, I rather just pay an Uber for her.\n\nMy gf flipped, said I was an asshole, telling me that was unbelievable, that if a cousin of mine ever needed a ride she wouldn’t hesitate to take them(I don’t even have family in the state, so it was purely hypothetical statement), that I was being egotistical, etc. (let me make it clear, i’ve Given her cousin rides before, and have offered in different occasions where she needed but didn’t ask. Today I just didn’t want to drive somewhere that wasn’t along the way to the house, plus I offered to pay an Uber, which she found unacceptable. \n\nI honestly don’t see what’s wrong offering to pay someone’s Uber if I personally don’t feel like driving. So, Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr : was driving a lot today, before going home, gf tells me to give her cousin a ride home, but I say no due to it being in the opposite direction and i offer to pay an Uber. I get called an asshole. Am I?",

I’ve also lost contact with my parents because of this. \n\nFor the most part living with him has been fine. He picks up after himself (mostly) and still goes to school and works to help me out with bills. \n\nOne thing however, is that lately he has been seeing this boy and bringing him over to the apartment to have sex (I have a spare bedroom). \n\nI don’t care if he’s having sex or who it’s with, and I mean I really could not care less I can’t emphasize that enough, but it is making me so uncomfortable in my own place. I can hear them at night, and when I get home. I’m losing sleep because it makes me so awkward and uncomfortable. I feel like I’m losing my mind. \n\nThis kid is also hanging out at my place a lot more than I would like. I suspect he doesn’t have a very good home life. \n\nI really want to tell Ryan to maybe cool it down because after all it is my place but I also get that maybe they don’t have anywhere else “safe” to go beside my house. I don’t want to make him uncomfortable and I don’t want to seem like a huge asshole if I ask him not to do it at my place anymore because he does help with some of the bills. But again, it’s kind of making me go crazy always having this kid over and hearing them. \n\nSo,  WIBTA for asking him not to bring guys over anymore? ",

      "description": "I was talking with my friends and I told them about the Ainu people. The short version is that there were 2 migrations waves that populated Japan several thousands years apart. The second wave was formed by what we think as \"japanese people\" today, while the first was the Ainu people who now live mostly in the north of Japan.\n\nI then told them that some Ainu people look quite different from the rest of the japanese people, look [at this young man for example](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-ainu-people-in-japan-147355150.html). I said they look \"like indian people but with slanted eyes\".\n\nFinally I said \"it's funny, you wouldn't expect the 'original japanese' to look like that\". At this comment one of my friends got really mad at me, saying that I couldn't make fun of how people look like. I agreed, but tried to explain that I wasn't making fun of them, rather I said \"funny\" in the sense of \"unexpected\" or \"surprising\".\n\nHe then argued that it was still wrong. That I should be more open, that I shouldn't asume. I tried to argue that it was indeed surprising and it wasn't wrong to say so, but he wouldn't have it, arguing that I should have at least phrased it some other way.\n\nThey all agreed that I was being very insensitive and made me feel like shit. Anthropology is like a hobby to me, and when I find out things like this I want to share them, but I don't want people thinking I don't respect other people and makes me don't want to talk with people about this sort of things.",

But after a while, A started to call and talk to me outside of the normal groups and got closer to me, which prompted me to start to be a little more open.\n\nAt this point, I talked to A every day despite my wish to talk to other friends more. Then, A started telling me about how bad their life is and how much of a useless person they are. \n\nThe mental state I was in was not optimal to be dealing with this, so I averted and tried to make them happier without stressing myself out.  Eventually it got out of hand and A was doing really bad, and I couldn’t even help them at first. One night I had to stay with them for hours to talk them out of something and it was clear that A was becoming slightly obsessed with me. Don’t think I’m just being a narcissist- A’s friends noticed his unusual behaviors as well. \n\nIt eventually got to the point where A tried to drive a wedge between my SO and I. A started saying a lot of weird cryptic things and was in such a bad place that I couldn’t take it. At that point, he had messed with my head and my SO’s some and I went to our mutual friend to sort things out and he recommended I talk to A, which I did later on that night. \n\nA then days later cut themselves off from me completely after trying but failing to make me guilty.

      "description": "So the tl;dr of my backstory is that I was sober for 18 months but chose to drink again in October. Since then I've been struggling to get sober again. I had a falling out with my old sponsor that makes us unable to reconnect. I've been unable to stay sober since but I feel like if I reach out to a certain person, he'd be able to help me. Thing is, hes a reasonably famous musician here and I don't want him to feel like I'm imposing myself on him. He's been dealing with groupies for years and I'm scared he'll see me as yet another loser who wants to latch onto him. But I honestly relate to him and feel like I'd have a good chance of staying sober if I work with him. Am I the asshole if I pick him? I'm not doing so because he's famous, but I feel like this is the manipulative side of me. Help?",

      "description": "This literally just happened 20 minutes ago and I've been sitting wondering if I just came across as an ass to this 13 year old neighbor. \n\nI was sitting on my couch when I heard a bang. Through the window, beside the front door, I saw a kid come onto our porch and retrieve a baseball. I didn't think much of it and figured it must've just been a bad throw. However two minutes later, it happened again. I initially got up to just tell the kid to be a bit more careful, but when I looked outside he was playing catch in our yard. And was having his friend/sibling/whatever throw to him. I honestly just felt like it was rude. I mean, he was probably a good 10-15 feet from my front door and in the past 5 minutes had managed to hit the ball against our house twice. What if I knocked out a window? So I made a comment of \"are you playing in our yard?\" with a rather annoyed tone of voice. To which he replied, \"oh... sorry...\" and walked back to his yard. \n\nWas I the asshole? Should I have just let the kid enjoy playing and not be like that grumpy, old man who yells at kids for stepping into his yard? ",

      "description": "I, a 22 year old female, am in a relationship with SO, 22 year old male, and the EX is a 24 year old male.\n\nI got to know know both of these guys at the same time, they were in the same group of friends. Initially, I hooked up with SO, but it was only a party-thing, and we remained friends. After a few months, I started dating EX, and a few months later, we moved in together. I knew that SO had a crush on me before I started dating EX, but I thought it had passed, at least when I was living with his friend. \n\nI broke up with EX after being living with him for nine months, for several reasons. He would not do ANY chores, even though he didn’t have a job, and didn’t attend his classes. I worked and went to uni, and still had to make dinner for us, do the laundry and clean the house. He was very jealous, for small things like me coming home from work 15 minutes later than usual, or going to the gym. He had a very negative attitude to everyone I cared about, he wouldn’t make time for me, he wouldn’t see my family, and he would mostly just play video games. \n\nI was fairly certain that he was depressed, but no matter what I did, he wouldn’t get help. Eventually I got so drained that I had to leave him to be able to take care of myself. \n\nI was very happy with my decision to go, although I was concerned for his well-being. \n\nAnyways, about two months after I moved out, I had a party. SO was invited, and we ended up having sex. We both felt a little bad for my EX, but considering I didn’t want a relationship, I didn’t think too much of it. I then found out that he had feeling for me the entire time I was with my EX, and I started catching feelings for him pretty quickly too.\n\nWe kept the relationship quite secret until the semester was over, as SO and EX study at the same campus. When it was announced, I was quite nervous to see if EX would contact me, and I was very unsure if I should tell him about the relationship or not. I ended up not doing that, and neither did SO, and EX never contacted me. \n\nSO and EX gradually lost their friendship during the time I was in a relationship with EX, as he was really jealous because he knew that we had made out before, so he didn’t want anything to do with SO, so technically, they weren’t friends anymore. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for dating my ex’s friend? Am I the asshole for not telling my ex? \n\nFun fact: Last week, it was announced on Facebook that EX is in a new relationship. With his other friends ex. ",

My stupid ass didn’t realise she had a massive crush on me.\n\nI always thought of her as a very shy girl and when everyone said she was super outgoing I was like “are we talking about the same person?!”\n\nEventually I had to be told that she was interested in me this was months after I first found out about her acting differently.\n\nThis made things slightly awkward between us as by this time we were going in similar social circles. I was then egged on by others that I should do something about this since I knew and that she was perfect for me. I was not interested in her whatsoever. She was 2 grades below me for starters and there was no attraction.\n\nNow here is where I made her cry. I decided I did not want to lead her on so I made an arrangement for us to meet after school and I said to her face that I was not interested in her romantically. She cried and went off, I think to this day I did the best thing as I did not want to lead her on; but everyone called me the asshole and I lost some friends because of this. I feel bad for making her cry and later on found out I was her first “hard crush” which makes me feel a bit worse but overall my thoughts were this was for the best and I wasn’t being an asshole.\n\nWhat do you random internet people think?",

      "description": "So long story short; like... so short I might skip details, I'm 20 and living with my family. I've constantly asked for help from friends and family to get me to the DMV so I can get a license and be able to be my own reliable ride to a job (so I don't lose it due to people not being able to take me). This has been going on since October when my last chance to get a job was ruined when my only reliable ride lost their license. So... I'm stuck at home, broke, against my will (taxis aren't an option here). My family is horrible with spending money; every time we get a chunk we spend it on something dumb. For example; we got taxes and ate at the same Italian Restaurant 8 times in two weeks. It's about $15 dollars per person, and it's a five person household. We spend it on all this dumb shit; then we're broke and \"have to have\" the same meals over and over again to the point where I literally get sick of them due to the taste. I'm not even particularly picky, the list of meals I full on won't eat is spaghetti or pork chops.\n\n The reason I don't like these don't even start when I was young. I don't know if it's my aspergers or something else, but if I eat the same food too many times in a short period of time it's literally ruined for me forever. And my family are the kind of people to constantly have the same meal. Burgers once or twice a week, porkchops like 6 times a month, spaghetti three or four times a month. I know it sounds like I'm being really petty, but the fact the excuse for it is \"because we're broke and this is what we can afford\" is total BS. I've offered to cook recipes for dinner with ingredients we already have, I've offered to help budget, I've offered to help shop for new recipe ingredients when we have the extra money, and I've offered to keep track of cheap and easy meals everyone likes so we have variety. I'm constantly offering solutions, and my mom still gets upset at me when I let out a sigh of disappoint (usually unintentional) whenever I see dinner. She gets upset for the rest of the afternoon; and I feel guilty for something I've offered to fix. Am I the asshole for this?",

      "description": "I get it, Christmas Eve is for family, New Year Eve for friends. But, that’s quite different in our case. \n\nMy brothers (26M and 29M, let’s say, respectively Jack and John) and I (24F) are living in a different country from our parents. We are 12000 km away from our hometown. We’re located in Europe now and our parents are living on a tiny island, lost somewhere in the Indian Ocean. \nWe don’t go home often because the plane ticket is quite expensive and the fly is very long (11-12h or so). \n\nYou gotta know that, at home, we would have very big family gathering (30-40 people) for Christmas Eve and NYE. They’re so much fun because everyone’s here feeling and sharing the Christmas Spirit. \n\nThis year, John moved out from home after a few years of struggling with health issues, forcing him to quit his studies and stay home for a while. He finally got back on his feet and found a job where Jack and I live. I’m very happy for him because he made some friends, starting to take care of himself, got into a nice and healthy routine.\n\nJohn and I have been abroad from a while now, 4 or 5 years. We first moved out because of our studies and after we graduate, we naturally found a job here. We are now used to the distance. We may have got back home twice and we see our parents once once a year. \n\nNow, our parents are very worried for all of us. Parents will be parents. They just wish the best for us and wish we could spend more time together. So our dad booked a plane ticket for the holidays. Our mom couldn’t come along for financial reasons. The plan was then to spend Christmas Eve and NYE together and our dad would go back home right after the first of January. \nBut... a few days ago, long after the booking, Jack and John informed us they will spend NYE with their respective friends. John wants to spend his very first NYE with friends instead of family like we used to do back home. Jack planned to spend the evening with his girlfriend.\n\nI mean, I get it. I also had plans, but our dad being here, it’s only natural to be with him. He didn’t come all this way to spend the 31st if December alone, did he? \nThey literally could have told my parents about their plans before they book the ticket, so at least my dad would have spent the holiday with everyone else at home and actually have fun. \n\nNow, I decided to cancel my plans and stick with my dad for the NYE. We will be two. I don’t know what we’re gonna do but I’m not feeling the holidays spirit that much now I’m mad at my brothers. They told me I should quit my bullshit and that I’m making them feel guilty for wanting to enjoy themselves. \n\nAITM for demanding my brothers to spend NYE with our dad and I? ",

When I am about to open it one of them grabs the packet and runs away and I get my pack back, but since they grabbed without permission I didn't give them a piece.Now my friends are now 2 of my friends are shitting on me for not giving them the pack I told them I would have given them some part if they hadn't stolen it.\nAm I the asshole for doing this?",

He had in the last year and a few years after that seemed to get pretty bad depression and after constantly reaching out to hang out and stuff, I just got tired of always initiating. I have decided that I will not reach out anymore to him, as he does have parents and the like, untill he makes some effort to reach back out to me. My parents think I'm the asshole for not being there for him but the way I see it, everyone is responsible for their own mental health.

      "description": "About a month ago I broke up with my first bf who I had only been dating for a month. The main reason was, that it all was moving way to fast for me and he expected our relationship to last for at least 2years without us getting to know each other first. Furthermore he was making jokes going like :\"You're beautiful but not very smart, are you?\" This made me feel as if he wasn't interested in my character at all. He didn't respect decisions I made either. But don't get me wrong, he could be very sweet and caring, but I just didn't feel comfortable around him. \n\nAfter I've been thinking about ending things for about a week, I finally talked to him. I broke up with him after school(we're in the same grade) As a reason for our break up I stated, that I didn't really feel comfortable around him, which was true but I didn't say anything about the other reasons to not make him feel even more insecure than he already is. At first he was all like:\"Yeah, it's fine. I'm fine. Bye\" Later he texted me, that i had been lying to him and that I played with his feelings because didn't tell him earlier. But I simply needed some time to figure everything out. Later he callmed down and apologized. Still he continued to make passive agressive statements towards me. \n\nNow I'm feeling like the asshole because I'm reminded of all that happened between us every day when I see him in the hallway. But this isn't it... I think I might be falling for his best friend, who is also in my grade but whom I've known for over 2 years. We are friends and I would never act on my feelings since I am rather shy and I wouldn't want to hurt my ex twice, but AITA?",

      "description": "I have been best friends with this guy since the start of high school. We shared everything together, he was like family. Two years ago I loaned him $1500 so he could buy his first car and get on his feet. He told me he would pay me slowly every month and have it paid off withing 8 months as he is starting a high paying job in a trade. I kept reassuring him to take his time and that I trust him because I understand it takes time to start making money. \n\n5 months later, yet to repay me anything, he has 2 credit cards maxed out and takes out a $10,000 loan with the intention of clearing his credit card debt, paying me back and buying a $6000 motorcycle. He did all but pay me a dime. Fast forward a year later to this past summer, I openly share how I feel about this and how I feel like he is using me but he reassures me he is going to pay me back soon. \n\nLast week, he calls me up. He says \"come outside I have something to show you\" I see him standing in front of a 2016 challenger that he just bought. He told me he put 1/3 down on the car and is paying it off over 2 years. Then he transfers me 300 and says I had the rest but I had to use it on something.\n\nMy so called \"best friend\" took advantage of my generosity. I think the friendship is over. In all honesty, all I want to do is tell him to f**k himself and leave. It is not about the money, it's about the respect. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "Throwaway account. First Reddit post. Obligitory \"be gentle\" and all that jazz.\n\nI have a group of friends that I've been associating with for around 5 years now. We get together on a semi-weekly basis to play tabletop RPGs and, until recently, I had no reason to suspect that I had any problem with the group.\n\nThere's no question that I'm the political outlier in the group. I'm conservative, while the majority of the group is liberal or centrist (or just apolitical entirely). I never thought anything of it, because I love every single one of them regardless of how much we disagree. I'm always open to discussion, and in fact, I encourage discussion on topics we disagree about, because I like to test the validity of my beliefs. If I can't defend something logically, it's a red flag to me that I need to rethink it.\n\nRecently, two of my better friends in the group invited me to dinner to discuss some concerns that they'd been hearing about me. To summarize the conversation, some of the members of the group now think that my beliefs are so much at odds with theirs that conflict is inevitable, and certain assumptions have been made about my character that have absolutely no merit to them.\n\nFor example, it came up that my limited support for our current president implies that I'm anti-immigration, which is a concern to the young lady whose parents are immigrants. That's just false. I'm currently researching the immigrant link in my own family tree. I've also been told that I'm suspected to be homophobic, and anti-LGBT rights, but I'm pretty openly bisexual, and I've supported advances in gay rights in the past. These are not difficult revelations to stumble across if you just spend a few minutes seriously getting to know me.\n\nI'm bewildered by this current situation. I've now found out that they scheduled sessions for a game that we'd prevously played together without telling me. I'm being ostracized because of my politics and by incorrect assumptions that stem from them. And more importantly, the two that finally brought this to my attention should know me better than that, and should have easily dispelled the assumptions as nonsense. Am I the asshole for thinking that this is all childish and petty?\n\nTL;DR: I'm a political outcast in my group of friends, and I am now being ostracized because of false assumptions and potential conflict.",

Because of this for the last month my car has been the only form of transportation for everyone. For the last week my car has been making sounds when I turn it and I was told that it was just low on power steering fluid so I went out and I bought more.\n\nI had been trying to make the guys fill it up since but they all refused because they \"were lazy.\" And I'm not going to do it because I know 0 things about cars. \n\nYesterday my wheel became impossible to turn so I told everybody that my car will not go anywhere without it getting refilled. They checked it that day and it was discovered that it wasn't empty, it had motor oil in it. I've been driving a car with motor oil where my power steering fluid goes. They told me we had all the stuff to fix it and that they would fix it the next day. I said alright that's fine. And that they should pick me up at 4:30.\n\nFast forward to today. I called just before 4 so I could see if it was all good. Heres a summary of our conversation. Me (M) my fiance (f)\n\nM- hey honey how the car doing\n\nF- we can't find the pliers so we can't fix it\n\nM- ok I will find a ride home, make sure nobody uses the car\n\nF- I can still get you\n\nM- no do not use the car, i do not feel safe doing that\n\nF- but it will be me driving \n\nM- idc don't use the car\n\nF- but it's fine\n\nM- no don't use the car\n\nF- it's been like this for 8+ months and no problems\n\nM- and? We are lucky the car still works. Don't use it\n\nF- it's fine\n\nM- no seriously don't use it\n\nF- other people need to get to work too\n\nM- and I need to still have a car\n\nF- nothing's going to happen it's fine\n\nM- (I did yell this part) Do not use the fucking car. It is my car and I will decide if it is fine to use. I say it is not therefore it will not be used. I'm not fighting with you on this\n\nF-fix your own damn car then\n\nI did yell at him but it feels pretty common sense to me. Idk guys",

      "description": "Backround ist this:\nMy wife works in another city and we only see each other from Friday evening to Monday mornings. We are working on changing this and it is not meant to be permanent.\nWe have a nice Apartment in the city I work at because that's where we are both from, have our parents and friends at. \nAs most couples do, we split the normal chores betwen us, but because she is'nt here for the most part of the week most of it falls into my part. Only thing she does is the laundry and only because she brings her clothes with her on the weekends and we do all of them here together, plus I normally help her with it.\n\nBut here is the thing, I work a minimum of 40 hours a week and I enjoy doing a bit of sport and seeing friends(I do this on weekdays as it doesn't cut into the time I have with my wife). This made me realize quickly that it's not working out  and I had to give something up to keep our home clean and nice. And I didn't want to.\n\nAs I make enough money I looked into cleaning services and what that would cost me. I found a company that seemd reasonable and talked it over with my wife. She wasn't happy about it at first because she didn't like someone being in our home without us being there and I totaly get that. So we compromised and I made an arrangement with the cleaning company that we would have always the same person come over and for the first few months they would only clean while someone is at home. They were fine with it and of we went. After about 7 months of the same Lady cleaning our home my wife was fine with giving her a key and come in when noone was there. \nI also am the one paying for this completely out of my own pocket.\n\nBackround done.\n\n\nI recently had 2 friends over for a drink after work and to chat. One brought his girlfriend with him (who he is with for close to 3 years now and I know for nearly the same amount of time and am cool with her), who was in our Apartment for the first time, so I showed her around a bit. She made the comment that it must be a bitch to keep clean for my wife with her being away all week and so on. I responded that it was my duty to clean and that I had simply gotten a cleaning service as I would like my time after work to be spend on more pleasurable things as cleaning. \n\nThat sparked a discussion that went on for 2 hours about me ripping my wife of because I now \"do nothing\" aournd the house. And even though I know my wife thinks it's fine I myself am now not sure if I am a bad husband and could change something for the sake of my wife.\n\nSo, fire away.\n",

They're not in a precarious position either. \n\nToday, I came back from an exam, and set my backpack down, before turning around to leave the room. As I'm walking towards the door. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash, and turned around to see my notebooks on the floor, as well as my roommates shattered bowl. He likes to leave his dirty dishes right next to my desk, on the edge of the fridge.\n\nHe demanded that I buy him a new one, I just kind of ignored it, not agreeing or disagreeing, because I could tell he was on one of his frequent power trips. He likes to bully me a lot. Later he brought it up again, with my other roommate in the room. He explained what happened to the other roommate and the other roommate said I don't owe him anything, That it was just a freak accident. This made the first roommate mad, saying that I was negligent and owed him. He's taking a Business Law class, and now thinks he's a legal expert. \n\nAs a side note, one night earlier this semester we got drunk, and when I was looking after one friend getting food, this same roommate went through my drawers and ate my snacks, and went through my fridge and drank my beers. He told me it wasn't his fault, he was drunk and I should've been watching my stuff. I didn't make him pay me and let it slide as a mistake.\n\nI said I don't think I owe him. He told me that he's always known the papers were going to fall and break something of his, so I should've too. I asked why he'd put breakable objects in a place where he knew they'd get broken then. He called me a liar and an asshole. Among other things.\n\nTl;dr My bullying roommate is holding me accountable for a stack of notebooks on my desk falling and breaking his bowl.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "So the game is called [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), or Werewolf. *[--skip down if you know what mafia is--]* In short it is where a group of people are split into innocents (also called towns) and mafia (also called scum) members. The innocents do not know each other's affiliations, but the mafia members do. There are 2 alternating phases, day and night. During the day all players vote to eliminate a player; during the night the mafiosos choose to eliminate a player. Last faction standing wins. Roles may be added for variety. Some of you may know of off-shoots such as TownOfSalem. \n\nThere's a saying that playing Diplomacy (or Monopoly or some other game) is the fastest way to lose friends. I think mafia gives diplomacy a run for its money. \n\nIn the purest form of the game, it is a game of deception and psychological analysis. For example, in a live game, you can ask someone \"are you mafia?\" While this seems like a stupid question to ask because everyone would answer \"no,\" the best players can deduce the affiliation of the responder based on their behavior when answering. When a player makes a judgement of another players affiliation it's called a \"read.\" Seasoned players may have their own play styles, called their \"meta.\" \n\n[----] In this case the game is being played online forum-style semi-anonymously; at the point of the incident I've played several games of mafia on the forum. I've cultivated a meta of brashness/assholery (which is counter to my behavior when I'm just talking with people normally); I'll admit though that sometimes I enjoy ripping apart someone whose read logic I simply disagree with completely. On this particular forum most of my interactions with other people is in playing mafia. I don't want to link to the game to protect my anonymity.\n\nMy ass-level could range from saying things to the effect of:\n\n&gt;\"all your reads are such trash I'd be surprised if a single one of them is correct\"\n\nto\n\n&gt;\"are you being pimped out by [player]?\" \n\n([Hooker](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Hooker) is a role in the game, the implication being the subject and [player] are both scum and [player] is [bussing](https://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=Bussing) the subject), to the worst offender \n\n&gt;\"lmao are you fucking retarded\"\n\nThe specific case that triggered an out of game response was in this one game where I was ripping apart a new-ish player. I say new-ish because he's played several games on that forum as well, but that forum was his first time playing. He also sounded kind of young, maybe high/junior-high? I latched on to him early in the game because new-ish players are easier to read because they tend to give off \"noob tells.\" \n\nI don't recall the exact scenario. But I think I was pretty aggressively accusing him of being scum with exactly 0 evidence. He got defensive. I couldn't get a good read on him but I didn't back off. \n\nHe gave some reads that I disagreed with. I immediately called him out on it, and I believe I said something to the effect of \"you're either a moron or you're scum.\" \n\nI went on to call him a bad player when his reads were proven wrong a a flip (affiliation reveal when a player dies). I even dug up his old games to show that his read accuracy was lower than random guesses, and encouraged other players to \"inverse\" him. At this point I had a light town read on him, but I was still disproportionately targeting him. \n\nI pushed him around for a few day phases before he went off on me. He said I was kind of an asshole. My internal reaction was \"yeah that's how the game is played.\" To my surprise several other players agreed with him. Some said if they see me in game line up they'd avoid joining. All these players are new-ish players of varying skill. \n\nI explained that's just the way I choose to play the game, I'm not like that in other parts of the internet to no effect. \n\nThis escalated out of game. On an unrelated thread my original subject called me an asshole in 3rd person to another player. I interjected saying that outside of game communication is forbidden. The other player agreed with the first player that I am an asshole. \n\nThey never actually called me asshole. The words they used were more to the effect of \"douchebag\" and \"arrogant.\" \n\nI am technically an asshole, I said that in the title. But the question is, am I really really an asshole and should dial it back in game, or are some of these players just taking the game too personally, or am I the one taking the game too seriously?\n\n[----]\n\nI'm putting this part at the end cause it's less related. The fact is the aggressive play style works. I've used it to great affect in previous games. I've seen other players use to to good effect. It has been used on me, with multiple players getting a correct town read on me; the particular case it was used on me was IMO more assholey than anything I've done, the player was using all manner of gay rape language on me. The asshole meta is neither common or uncommon. For a given game, one could expect 0, 1, or 2 asshole-like meta players most of the time. \n\nI also try avoiding being an ass and use a different meta in pure noob games, because I have a line and I don't want to scare noobs away. I don't go off on someone unless they're in a \"big boy\" game. \n\nThe more seasoned players did not get themselves involved in the drama. I've played on other forums with some of the same players, at least one has said they respect me as a player. \n\nI've cultivated the asshole meta mostly because I believe it's effective. But I think it's also because I do have some repressed assholery inside of me for real, or else I wouldn't be able to pull the style off so naturally and convincingly in game. \n",

      "description": "On mobile, so formatting might be weird.\n\nI'm a 17 year old male living in Canada and both of my parents are antivaxxers. My aunt and uncle are also anti-vax and my situation took place earlier today because it became a large topic at my family dinner. My grandparents are provax because they've lived through polio and know firsthand how bad it is, so they helped my Little brother and I try to argue it into my mom and my aunt. \n\nMy aunt doesn't believe that vaccines cause autism but she believes they cause allergies and asthma. Is that really worse than measles? Really? Anyways, that didn't work. I am vaccinated, my Little brother is vaccinated, because in Canada, at 15, you can choose to make your own medical choices. My two little sisters are not, because they aren't old enough to make that choice yet.\n\nAbout 4 hours away from my house, there is a measles outbreak. This scares the shit out of me because one of my Little sisters is immunocompromised. Which is one of the main reasons why my mom chooses not to vaccinate. I know, completely counter productive and really fucking stupid.\n\n I'm trying to convince my mom to get my sisters vaccinated against measles. When I found directly talking to her was ineffective, I thought that talking to my sisters might help. Like, if they thought that they were in danger, my mom might vaccinate, for their peace of mind. I showed them a picture of a child with measles and said \"this kid might die\" and 'mom could vaccinate you and protect you but we have to convince her\", but she's already convinced them that vaccines are bad. I will break that, trust me. They told her and my mom is now furious and told me \"I'm really starting to piss her off\" and \"when [I] reproduce I can choose to vaccinate my kids\". She also told me that it wasn't fair to \"harass\" such a young, immature age group. I'm naturally very argumentative, so I responded quickly and told her \"I tried to 'harass' you about it but I guess you're too immature\".\n\n I have no doubt in my mind that vaccines are incredibly helpful, but am I the asshole for showing pictures of measles victims to my 9 year old little sister?",

      "description": "Pretty much as the title says, but obviously there are more details to the story, otherwise I wouldn’t be making this post. \n\nSo, yesterday I went to the movies with a couple of friends to see The Prodigy. We’ve seen many other horror/scary movies in the theater together and there’s always something. For some reason people are much much ruder when seeing horror movies so we/I was already prepared for the worst. \n\nAnyway, we get settled into our seats as the previews play and a little bit later these two guys come in and sit next to us, leaving a buffer seat (mind you, many many other seats they could have chosen). Almost immediately he takes out his pen and takes a hit and lets out a huge cloud of smoke. I roll my eyes and sigh and then cross my arms. I can see him look over at me and I think maybe he sees how annoyed I am and will refrain for the rest of the movie, I was wrong. \n\nLike 1 minute after this he takes another hit and I look to my friends, we all roll our eyes and I look back at him while I put my arms up in frustration. He then leaves to go refill his soda and doesn’t return until the movie has already started. \n\nHe waits for about 2 minutes after he’s sat back down before taking another hit and releasing yet another HUGE cloud of smoke. I can’t take anymore and I don’t want yet another scary movie ruined, so I turn to him and say, “dude, seriously? This is not the place!” He looks at me with an expression that I can only describe as, “how did she know??” While the people sitting in front of me turned around and glared at me. \n\nBecause of this I refrained from saying anything more when he tried to covertly keep smoking. (He turned to I couldn’t see him but I could still hear it, see the smoke, and smell the flavor he picked! Cherry if anyone was curious. But he would also glance over at me every time he took a hit to see if I saw.)\n\nI’m a very shy person and have only recently began to voice my problems with strangers in a public setting but I’m done having things ruined for me! I thought I was doing the right thing by telling him to knock it off but the way I was glared at makes me second guess myself. \n\nSo AITA for telling someone not to vape in a theater in not the quietest way?",

(26, whoo) I didn’t really do much all day and I don’t usually like to do much, save for like dinner and a movie with my parents. \n\nMy mom wasn’t feeling up to going to an Outback because she was sick and I didn’t want to have to make my dad go alone because he doesn’t like steak. So I just texted him while he was at work if he wanted to go see that new Spider-Man movie at a nice theater and just call it a night since my mom couldn’t go. \n\nUsually, my dad and I both like going to see superhero movies together, it’s our thing. And I really wanted to see it with him because I knew he’d like it, it has good reviews. He said ok. \n\nHe gets home from work later that day and was just like ‘it’s an animated movie, I don’t want to see that.’ And just starts to rag on it mainly because ‘it’s a cartoon and you’re almost 30.’\n\nI just got really upset about it and silently went to my room to cry by myself about it. We didn’t end up doing anything together because I just felt really hurt by his comments and attitude and I didn’t want to spend my birthday watching a movie I know Absolutely nothing about. (He wanted to see Creed 2 or The Mortal Instruments. Not talking shit about Creed 2 but I haven’t seen the first one or any Rocky movie and he knows this)\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "I handle all the PR for an organization I'm apart of including social media and merchandise. Its a type of organization that emphasizes recruitment so our outward appearance is a big deal. Its important that people in think we're a cool, appealing group of people so that they want to join us. One of my friends in this group just started up an Etsy and Instagram account to sell her artwork. Her artwork consists of photos of women traced over in MS Paint with captions about our organization in fonts like Papyrus and Comic Sans, superimposed over photo backgrounds. Its completely un-ironic, looks like it was made by a child, and is honestly pretty unsettling to look out. Of course I would never express a negative opinion about her art to her face, and I have avoided mentioning my aversion to anyone else in the organization because I don't want to insult her work. However, as of today I am working with a new assistant who is INSISTING that we use this girls' art as the icon for our org's Instagram. I'm really reluctant to do so because I have put a lot of work into creating a coherent branding aesthetic for us and don't want to ruin it with art that is frankly ugly and even if it wasn't, doesn't align with the image I've created. Should I be expected to bite the bullet and feature her art to flatter her, even if it hurts our PR? Or AITA?",

      "description": "**First off, the title is a bit misleading but I didn't know how else to phrase it. It wasn't because his dad died that I stopped being friends but instead because of what happened as a result.**\n\nSo, many, many years ago I was best friends with my neighbor, we knew eachother because of how close we lived and our parents had been great friends for years. We'd been best friend's since I could remember, even though I was a little older than him. For a long time, we were pretty close to brothers, we spent as much time as possible together.\n\nA little later, we're still very young (about 7-8 years old I think), it was summer and we were on vacation separate from each other. One day, my mother gets a phone call and suddenly burst into tears. The night before, my friend's father had gotten a heart attack and died before reaching the hospital. Of course, I cried too but I didn't really comprehend what it meant. I didn't know how to act towards him, so I didn't really talk to him anymore, not like I was avoiding him, just that I had no idea what to say. I remember going to the funeral, but again, I didn't really understand it and only really remember running home afterward to play video games. I feel god awful about this, I know I was young, but I feel so bad for not helping him.\n\nThis is about the time the rift started forming between us. After a few weeks, we went back to hanging out a lot. He hadn't recovered at all but sometimes he'd be able to forget about it at least for a while. Then our interests started differing, he was more of the sporty, outdoors type. About this time I got into video games and nerdy stuff. \n\nI still loved him as a brother and it was great. Somewhere along the line though, I'm not sure what time, he started changing. He didn't seem to outgrow being a kid, I think it was because he didn't have a role-model to follow after his dad passed as I did and I didn't offer a good enough one.\n\nSeemingly every conversation, he brought his long-dead father into it somehow. Making everyone feel bad and ruining conversations. I got pissed at him for nothing but that's part of being a kid I guess, it was just so badly timed in his life. About the age of 11 we really stopped being friends, occasionally we'd do stuff but it wasn't the everyday occurrence it used to be. \n\nHe idolized his father and did everything the way he thought his father would do it, which was stereotypically country like, not that his father was. He wouldn't stop singing out loud, watching movies his father liked, constantly acting out for attention and recognition etc. He developed a stuck up attitude and didn't know when to shut up and other things I learned young, mostly from my dad. \n\nThis was in contrast to me. I hung out with different kids and stopped even talking to this friend. He had plenty of other friends, who also really annoyed me. He surrounded himself with people who sucked up to him and did the exact same things he did.\n\nDon't get me wrong I still love him and think he's a good guy but he's just unbearable more often than not to me. \n\n**TL;DR: My best friend lost his father when we were young. I feel bad for not helping him out when we were younger. He eventually developed into being what I guess I'd describe as an insufferable brat a lot of the time.**\n\n**AITA for not being friends with someone because his dad died and he changed?**\n\n(Also gonna post this on r/confessions cause that's what it is for me.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I was waiting at home for a plumber to show up from 2-3. I called my professor for ome of my classes and missed a class to makesure I was here so I could let him in to get this issue fixed (storm drain has weird growths inside of it, we've had the issue fixed before.). \n\nSo, at 6:36 (less than 50 minutes from me writing this) he shows up. I'm a bit annoyed, I missed class for this and I don't like missing classes. If I knew the dude would be so late I'd have made it to class, back, and then some. Dude shows up, I show him the issue, get on my phone, and 10 minutes later he comes up and says he needs to call his boss. He's outside for maybe 15 minutes before I get a call from the group that's covering the expenses of the plumber (don't know their exact name) and they tell me he can't get the lid off the storm drain (the lid I lifted for him to show him the issue) and that they need to create a new one internally and can't do an external one because of our porch, so the bill will be close to 1,400. She says \"He said he's been down there for 2 hours and can't figure out any other way.\" And I scoffed. That prompted her to ask me, \"What time did he show up, by chance?\" And I was honest with her, and her tone switched to a \"Oh really?\" Tone. I hang the phone up and go through an 'oh shit' moment as I hear him pounding on the door. Dude looks pissed, but not violent or anything. \n\nDude explains they called him and said they're not paying him for only doing 10 minutes of work and I sign the thingy that shows his trip is over\n\nI feel like shit. The guy probably just wanted his pay, and he did show up. He didn't do anything, but he gave a diagnosis and did what he said he could. If I knew they'd stiff him, I don't think I would have said anything. ",

      "description": "This is a long one, TL;DR at the end.\n\nSo I work at a company that has a pretty lax 'fraternization' policy. As long as it's not a direct supervisor or department manager, associates are free to date and mess around all they want. Well, I hooked up with a coworker from a different department (I'm just gonna call him Jack for simplicity's sake) I didn't know all that well (we maybe said hi to each other a few times a week, had like two in depth conversations) and regretted it immediately. It was bad sex, it happens.\n\nI told my friend from another department about the hookup because she and I always talk about our bad sex experiences or funny hook up stories. It was discussed outside of work over drinks. As far as I am aware, she has not told anyone else about it.\n\nCut to a week later and I find out from someone in Jack's department that he not only told a group of five of his coworkers about it, he went into great detail about the scars on my stomach from surgery I had in my teens and made fun of my weight (I'm overweight and working on it, but he is also on the bigger side so I found this to be a low blow). According to the coworker, his exact words were, \"I really lowered my standards for her.\" \n\nI was obviously upset by this but decided to let it go because I told someone else at work about the bad sex.\n\nAnother week passes and someone from a different department asks if I know Jack. I said yes and she pulled me aside to tell me he had some pretty nasty remarks to say about my personal life. Apparently, because I freely admitted to him that I had numerous partners, he told some more coworkers that I was a whore.\n\nI always admit how many people I've been with because I think that's important to know before sleeping with someone. I get tested regularly, always use a condom, and, again, I freely admit this before any sort of sexual activity takes place.\n\nAfter this I confronted him in the break room and basically told him to keep my business out of his mouth. He claimed he didn't tell anyone my name and people just happened to guess it was me (nearly 200 people work in our building so I doubt this). I told him to eff off. I definitely could have handled this better.\n\nNow, about a month after the hookup, a friend of mine from high school texts me and asks if I work with Jack. I had recently introduced this friend to a coworker and they've gone on some dates. She and Jack hang out regularly with a group of friends and were talking about our coworker when he asked if she knew me. She said yes and he told her we hooked up.\n\nI'm considering going to HR because of this. WIBTA if I filed a complaint even though I also told someone about the hookup?\n\nTL;DR - hooked up with a coworker, had bad sex. I told a coworker about it and later learned that he has since told at least seven other people (coworkers and people outside of work) that I'm fat, that he lowered his standards for me, and that I'm a whore because I admitted to having numerous partners. WIBTA if I went to HR and reported it?",

      "title": "AITA for not supporting my fiancé’s pregnancy?",
      "description": "My fiancé had cancer and had her ova frozen. Due to the chemo she isn’t supposed to be able to become pregnant. She hasn’t menstruated in four years. \n\nLast April I came home from a show and was greeted with three positive pregnancy tests. We were ecstatic, got engaged, began preparations to have a family. We went to a cadre of specialists and learned we were four or five months along, which wasn’t totally unsurprising given a lack of periods. \n\nThe next month we miscarried and we both took it rather hard. We had a mourning period, but by June I thought we’d processed our grief. Then my fiancé asserted that she was still pregnant. \n\nHer belly had not receded and still looked five or six months pregnant. It wasn’t fat (she’s quite active and eats well), but a hard pregnancy bulge. I am skeptical but support her assertion. \n\nWe go to five more specialists between June and August, all of whom say they can’t account for the abdominal tissue but ultrasounds, low HCG, and urine tests all disconfirm the possibility of a pregnancy. My fiancé is not dissuaded and continues to tell friends and family she is with child. I am now genuinely worried. \n\nBy September, she writes off any further clinical testing and the medical community at large. She begins speaking exclusively with doulas and midwives on Internet groups; looking into cryptic pregnancies, twisted uteri, delayed implantation. Our relationship is strained. \n\nHer physical symptoms do not recede and she continues to tell anyone who’ll listen that she is due any day now. She stops going to our joint activities and lines our furniture with plastics in preparation of childbirth. She researches home birthing and begrudges me for not doing the same. \n\nWe fight. I tell her that I believe her symptoms are psychogenic. I believe that her desire for maternity has produced a phantom pregnancy. These mostly occur in women who’ve lost a pregnancy between 33 and 35 years of age. My fiancé is 34. She accuses me of calling her crazy, and I tell her the subconscious mind longing for a child is very sane, but she considers my disbelief an insult. \n\nShe begins to justify her extended pregnancy in odd ways, saying that she herself was a 52 week pregnancy (she wasn’t), that some pregnancies can carry to well over a year (they can’t), and that we’ll be millionaires once we sue the hospitals who’ve misdiagnosed the pregnancy (we won’t). I refute these claims, as the longest pregnancy ever was three months beyond nine, and try to use her logic (potential harm to herself and the fetus beyond nine months) as a way to reintroduce my fiancé to proper medical care. She refuses it. \n\nThe first week of December we have a midwife in our home who brings a sonogram and fetoscope, hears nothing, and again disconfirms a pregnancy. I tell the midwife my theory and the midwife finds it plausible. My fiancé consents that she is not pregnant. \n\nUntil the holidays, when she tells both me and our entire extended family that she still feels kicks, has bloody mucilage, and has been talking with a midwife 150 miles from our home who has seen this kind of thing all the time. It goes over as well as it sounds. I am both horrified and exasperated. I tell her this is verging on 52 weeks and she tells me some pregnancies can reach 1.7 years. \n\nShe schedules an appointment with this new midwife and announces that I cannot come with her as I am too rife with negativity. I drive my fiancé to the midwife’s home - an apartment in a questionable area of a questionable city - and fill the hour by trying to find a whisky I’ve been looking for. \n\nI am hoping this woman will see the desperation and as gently as possible tell my fiancé she’s not with child, but I pick her up and she’s beaming. I should’ve realized that you don’t scour the Internet to find someone to validate your delusions if you aren’t confident they’ll be affirmed. \n\n“The midwife felt the baby and taught me how to feel it, too. She poked it and it moved from one side of my uterus to the other. She used a Doppler to hear it. She said I know my body and to believe in myself.” \n\nAm I the asshole for not indulging this fantasy? \n\nUpdate: \n\nI’ve asked her go to a therapist with me. She laughed and made my disbelief an issue of me not trusting her body and intuition. \n\nI told her to be wary of the cryptic pregnancy support groups that allege low HCG pregnancies that don’t show up on ultrasound and can last 3-5 years are real and common. They’re taking advantage of vulnerable people. She said there are hundreds of women who’ve had successful births in those groups. It’s cultic. \n\nShe reiterated that she heard movement and a heartbeat on the Doppler. I proposed that by now it would show up on an ultrasound and asked her to get another one for me. She refused and suggested that ultrasounds are linked to autism. \n\nAt this point she said that she would deal with the pregnancy herself since I didn’t trust her and I assured her I was only concerned because I cared. She clammed up. \n\nI’ve notified her family of my concerns. \n\nUpdate 2: \n\nAfter increasingly reckless behavior that led to not one, but two extremely preventable house fires (and with that behavior showing no signs of slacking), I have exited the relationship. \n\nAmong few blessings I’ve had this past year were that my dog was with me on both occasions  and she and I were not harmed by smoke or flame.

She doesn't want to \"stick them in a home\".\n\nI almost immediately said no to this. I highly value our privacy, and I'm not willing to offer to have extra people in the house. I volunteered to pay for high quality assisted living or whatever arrangement they wanted.\n\nAfter some back and forth, she was essentially making me out to be a jerk and was getting mad I was so opposed to the idea. I feel like this isn't a responsibility we are expected to or obliged to offer, especially considering she has a sister and my parents are around the same age as hers. \n\nIf her parents asked if they could move in I would be willing to have a conversation about it, but it upsets me that my wife would consider offering it unprompted.\n\nBoth families are typical white suburban American.\n\nAm I being an asshole or is this something that's expected of children as their parent's age?\n",

      "description": "Concerns one of my friends from the 'original' friend group in college. I'll call them Lucy. We bonded quickly early on but as college has progressed I've made loads more good friends, and come to find that certain people in the original friend group live to try and cause drama. This has caused a certain level of seperation with the group at times.\n\nI've been away in a different university for ages and won't be home until just before Christmas, so I have a huge amount of things planned or responsibilities I have to take care of as I've been away for nearly a year. Lucy is aware of this and has asked me when I'll be free to see the OG group. I've been open and honest and said that I'm not totally sure as I'm extremely busy but I can't wait to see them again. They then respond asking if being away has 'changed me' and being very passive aggressive with their messages about how they basically expect me to drop everything to make sure I see them first. \n\nAs a result this has meant I haven't invited friends from the group to an upcoming party as it would mean having to invite Lucy and certain others as well and I don't have the patience for the possible drama it would cause on a day I want to be happy. Am I the asshole for making better friends with other people and not wanting petty drama at the special occasion even it means not seeing people I consider friends?",

      "description": "This happend a few weeks ago. Me and my previous partner had mutually broken up about two months before this event happend. Our breakup was an amicable one, we were still living together until she got the money to move out, but didn't mind if either of us started dating again. After my ex had been on a few dates she encouraged me to try tinder, so I did.\n\nI started talking to this girl, let's call her Amy, and we agreed to go on a date. The first thing I did was inform her of the fact that I lived with my ex and asked her if this would be a problem. She said that she'd had issues with men and abuse in the past and would find it difficult, but she was willing to give it a try. It was also at this point we both shared any problems we had, such as me telling her I suffer from anxiety and am not good with sudden changes or decisions.\n\nSo we go on our date and it goes alright, although at the end of it she starts to act increasingly strange. Eventually she blurts out that she thinks I'm still sleeping with my ex. She goes as far as suggesting that when she drops me off I prove to her that my ex and I don't share a bed anymore (I'd already informed her we split into separate rooms). I probably should have told her to get stuffed at this point, but I'm pretty bad at confrontation and social things in general so I'm like sure whatever.\n\nSo when she drops me off I show her my ex's room and then my room. She immediately jumps onto my bed, strips and beckons me over. Now I had no plans on having sex, we'd both said sex on a first date was off the cards due to her past and I was already pretty anxious because of the whole situation. I tried to tell her no but that wasn't really working, so I just ended up having sex to get her to leave.\n\nThe sex was slightly strange, she kept attempting to make me not wear a condom and finish inside her, which I was having none of. So afterwards I asked her to leave, although more diplomatically, and she had a full on meltdown over it. I'd rather not repeat the conversation since it went on for hours and involved her hanging around my house until 4am begging me to come save her from the cold, but I thought it was a bit of an overreaction.\n\nHowever since then she's been calling me an asshole and a piece of shit for the whole situation, saying I'm just another piece of shit who's fucked her and left her. I do feel like an asshole but I don't think I was too out of line asking her to leave, especially when I'd already explained about my anxiety and dislike of new situations (I can't sleep without a very specific setup).\n\nThanks for any opinions!",

I believe the majority of the family went out for spring vacations but there is still someone who takes care of the dogs in odd times.\n\nSomehow the dogs got out from the backyard and started running around, barking like crazy. At night the neighbor is taken over by a family of raccoons and human-friendly stray cats. Both of the groups were probably going to eat those dogs alive so I called animal control. Later the person taking care of the dogs went out looking for them and my dad told them what happened. I explained the situation more and they basically said I should have bring them in the house or keep them in the backyard. I am not sure what happens after animal control takes them but I don't want those dogs in the house nor do I have a place to put them in the backyard.",

      "description": "About 2 months ago I was out drinking with my cousin and she told me about her boyfriend's friend (Adam) that she thought would be a perfect match for me. I was skeptical but agreed to meet with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple days later Adam messaged me on Facebook and we started texting. I thought he was nice but I didn't feel like we had much in common. We decided to meet in person anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first thing that annoyed me was that he was supposed to pick me up at [4.pm](https://4.pm). but showed up at 6. He did apologize so it didn't bother me that much. An important detail - I really dressed up for the date, had on heels and all that because he suggested getting dinner when we were texting. I got in the car and he said it was too late to grab dinner and we could go to the lake nearby and spend some time there. I didn't want to be one of those girls that are extremely picky about dates so I thought whatever. We got to the lake and there were a lot of people there so he told me he knows this path that's always empty and we could walk there, talk and get to know each other.\n\nWe walked for about an hour and it started to get dark so I asked if we could get back because I wasn't feeling that good about walking around in the forest at night. He said that we could but we're just 15 minutes away from this little pier and we absolutely needed to go there because it's so romantic. Little did I know, 15 minutes actually meant another one and a half hour of walking. Best thing is, we weren't even talking because he was about 2 feet in front of me and just kept looking once in a while to check if I was behind. We got to the pier and I was getting angry. We just spent 2 hours walking around a lake, he wasn't even interested in talking to me and my feet hurt because I was wearing those damn 5inch heels.\n\nWe sat on that pier for some time and to be honest I was about to cry because I was so uncomfortable and I literally couldn't even walk properly anymore. We walked 2 hours back, it was pitch black and when we were getting into the car he asked me how I liked the date. I said (in a really sarcastic way) \"Well, I never spent 4 hours in my life better\".\n\nSome time after that date he messaged me and wanted to go out again but it never happened.\n\nAbout a week ago I met with our mutual friend for drinks and when we got tipsy he told me Adam told him about our date. Well, it turns out he told him I talk way too much, try too much to be cute and he wouldn't want to spend any more time with me. I was kinda hurt (cause who likes to hear mean things, I mean...) but I just laughed and said \"Just tell him that next time he wants to take a girl on a date he should text me, I'm gonna give him some better ideas than walking around for 4 hours\".\n\nMy friend then told that to Adam and Adam texted me mad as hell to tell me that I'm a bitch and he regrets ever going on that date.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?

      "description": "This is long, TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrowaway because he uses reddit occasionally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my boyfriend hasn't been feeling well the past week, I finally got him to go to the hospital a little over 2 days ago. That's also the last time I heard from him, his last message being \"I'm at the hospital now.\" So I got a little worried about not hearing from him, we talk/hang out a whole lot. His best friend who I've also grown to become good friends with messaged me today and asked if I heard from him, and I told him no I haven't and I was gonna ask him the same thing soon. I told him about him being in the hospital, he was in my area so he asked to come over and smoke a cig on my porch and we'd call the hospital and see if he was still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis best friend arrives at my house, he calls the hospital, and he is still there. He connects to his room and they talk for a bit and hang up. I get the idea to give him a surprise visit because hospitals suck and are lonely and I thought he'd like being cheered up by his best friend and girlfriend. We walked a few miles from my house to the WRONG HOSPITAL and found out he was actually a different hospital with the same name a few cities away. Not wanting to walk there, I called one of my friends and asked if they'd take me to see him at the other hospital, they did, we showed up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst thing that he says is \"Why are you two together?\" And we explain the situation, how we weren't just casually hanging out and met up because he was near my street and we were both worried about him and wanted to visit him. Note his friend has a long term pregnant gf of 5+ years and they have other kids together as well. Nor do I cheat, OR have we ever been interested in each other like that. No need to get jealous but he was I guess because the next thing he said was \"So while I'm in the hospital, you're out hanging with MY friends?\" I kinda awkwardly laughed it off and said \"We just wanted to check on you.\" His friend starts talking to him and catching up and telling him about his kids recent birthday and stuff about his girlfriend, and my boyfriend is clearly not listening, so he asks him if he's okay, and he says \"Dude I'm gonna be honest with you I just don't fucking care right now\" And his friend looked sad and looked down kind of, and after an awkward pause he said \"Thats why I love you man you're always straightforward and honest.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen my boyfriend asks how we got there and how we're getting back and when and being kind of pushy about it, note at this point we've been there maybe 10 minutes at most, and I said \"I'll figure it out I'll be able to find a way back easy.\" Because I didn't think that far ahead yet and thought I'd just play it by ear. But he just snaps suddenly and starts yelling and ranting saying things like \"Dude honestly just leave both of you just fucking leave this is ridiculous I would've fucking texted you both when I was out and you just fucking show up without warning just fucking go seriously go right now like fuck this is annoying get out now.\" I started tearing up a bit at this point, (because he's been really consistently snappy with me the past week anyway and this was just kinda the last push to make me cry) and apologizing profusely and gathering my bag and heading towards the door, and his friend stays back. He goes \"AND TAKE HIM WITH YOU.\" After that, and his friend says hang on he wants to talk to him one on one a bit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I walk out crying and heading towards the exit, and not long after (and some more muffled loudness from the room,) his friend catches up to me and tells me he talked to him and said not to be so harsh on me and that we were just worried and care about him and he just said \"See ya bro.\" And motioned for him to leave. After that I talked to him a few hours later over text and asked if we could talk or see each other when he got home today if he was feeling up to it because I was there when the doctor said they were getting ready to discharge him soon, and all he said was \"I'm not going home today.\" I said \"Oh why not the doctor said you were.. Are you being discharged tomorrow then?\" And all he said was \"idk\" and haven't heard from him since.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for dropping in unexpectedly? I talked to my parents about it and my dad thinks HITA and that I'm an idiot for apologizing over and over to him over it but my mom thinks IATA for \"bothering him while he's not feeling well and to give him space and leave him alone.\" But he seemed to be feeling way better when I saw him today and even said he was feeling a lot better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR boyfriend went MIA for two days after telling me hes in the hospital causing me and his best friend to worry because he's usually pretty good at keeping in contact, we decided to go cheer him up as a surprise, he yelled at us and threw us out.

      "description": "I am a full time college student and I also have three cats. The cats came into my care because of friends who became homeless several years ago and left the state so I have been caring for them for several years now. Recently one of the cats became ill, he is currently hospitalized at an emergency pet clinic. The vet has informed me that it's likely fatty liver disease and that if it is he will need invasive surgery. The hospitalization for a single day has already costed over $2,000 and this is just the diagnostic cost. I have no idea what the treatment costs will be. I feel pretty messed up about it, I have no way to afford to have him treated. I already maxed out my credit cards to have him admitted to the clinic. At this point if he does need the invasive surgery I am seriously considering euthanizing him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: We hospitalized the cat, right now he's still alive and seems pretty energetic given the circumstance. He wasn't diagnosed since his blood wasn't clotting well enough. I have to syringe feed him and we have him on several medications. He isn't eating on his own yet but he is drinking a lot and gets up and wanders around the apartment semi-frequently. ",

      "description": "So, bit of background. I (F24) had a pregnancy scare about a week ago. Forgot some of my birth control pills and had unprotected sex, not very smart of me. The shops were not open yet, so we couldn't get a pregancy test yest. But we started discussing what we should do. Currently I am in a state in my life where I definitely do not want to have kids, so I said to my bf (M26) that I probably would get an abortion if I turned out to be pregnant. He said that we should talk this through if I turn out to be pregnant before we make any decisions. I said sure, we definitely need to talk about it, but when it comes down to it, i'ts my body so my decision. He got really really angry for saying that.   \n\n\nI tried to explain to him that of course we will make it a mutual decision, and we will talk, explore our options and objectively try to weigh all those options, but in the end it is my body and if we really don't agree on it it is my call. He called me selfish and said that say I want to keep the baby, and he wants me to get it aborted, I would still get the last call and ruin his whole life by giving him a baby that he doesn't want. I said well, it is a difficult one, but you cannot force a women to abort a baby if she doesnt want it as it is her body. In that moment it is my decision, and if I decide to have it while knowing very well that the baby is not wanted by the father and I am hurting you by this and ruining your life and very likely our relation, it is still my decision. He thought I was crazy for thinking like this and we just couldn't agree with each other.   \n\n\nLuckily, I'm not pregnant (yay) so we don't have to think about this. But I am still wondering, AITA for thinking like this?",

      "description": "So I am a senior in college taking a BS class because I need four  more credit hours to graduate. The class is mostly full of freshman or seniors doing the same thing I am. It is taught by this very kind woman in her 50's who really loves the subject she teaches and loves teaching and working with others. This shows in everything she does and even though I'm taking this class for the credits and its not in my major or a requirement to graduate I find myself respecting her immensely for her passion. \n\nEnter this one freshman guy. We will call him X. Day one of the class I go to the bathroom during break and I hear X talking to his buddy. They are planning on getting high before class. At the time I think whatever not my business he passes or fails on his own merit. Fortunately, X has very poor attendance even though the class is in the middle of the day and very easy to make it to especially because he lives on campus like half a mile away or less. This all suddenly changes though. As I believe X does sports, not entirely sure he doesn't appear very athletic, however sports require a minimum GPA. I believe half way through the class X realized that attendance is graded or the teacher had a word with him about it. Most likely the latter. \n\nNow X is attending class everyday and he is coming in high as fuck. Like just getting up and wandering around the classroom cursing randomly or in conversation with the teacher and just making a complete fool of himself. A lot of his freshy buddies find his antics hilarious. I usually wouldn't give a fuck but, I can't help but empathize with the teacher. This is something she cares greatly about and this guy is showing up high literally everyday, not paying attention, randomly lying across the desks or on the ground, and just being a complete fucking idiot. She's tried to hint at him that he should change his behavior but, clearly it's not getting through.\n\nI'm really tempted to call him out on it if he keeps it up or try to find some way to get him in deep shit for his behavior. But, on the other hand I'm a senior so I could hypothetically keep my head down and just not have to deal with him ever again. If I decided to call him out would I be the asshole?",

      "description": "So for context my (17f) parents have been much more controlling/ protective of me than my friends parents have been for pretty much my whole life. When I was younger I couldn’t go outside and play or walk to school despite us living in a relatively safe neighborhood, I didn’t have a phone until I was 15 ect ect all the normal strict parent stuff\n\nLast night my expense report from my bank was delivered, and after looking it over I left it out on the kitchen table not thinking anything of it. (all the money in the account is mine- I have a job and have a good amount saved up. Both my parents names are on the account bc I am a minor) While I was in the shower my mom looked through it and confronted me later about the charges on it. \n\nThere were charges for a small coffee shop, chick fil a, and one at the local mall, all of which she was quite upset about. I hadn’t told her when I went to these places, and it is an expectation of my parents to know when I leave for school, arrive at school, leave for home, arrive at home ect ect and I get bombarded with texts and calls if I forget to let them know about one step of the process. In my mind I know this is bc they worry about me, but it has gotten exhausting and feels unnecessary. \n\nIt is also quite difficult to ask to make plans, as most of the time they will say no unless I ask a week beforehand with addresses and exact times on hand.\n\nAll of this is expected despite the fact they have trackers in both my phone and my car, and can see where I am without grilling me 24/7.\n\nThe combination of all of this (plus other forms of lack of privacy and general overbearingness that I don’t have the time to get into right now) has driven me to the point of lying to their faces. I will say I’m home after school when I’m really hanging out with friends or getting coffee, and this has worked for a while. Until now of course. \n\nI don’t feel like this is a big deal. Almost every other person my age can go wherever and hang out with their friends, and as long as they are home by curfew, it’s no big issue. I’ve never had that, and I’m losing relationships with my friends because of it. My parents said I was putting myself in a lot of danger (especially by going to the mall -my mom has got this idea in her head that I’m going to get shot if I go there even though we live in a very safe part of town) and by lying about where I am I have only proved I’m not ready for the responsibility of being let a bit of freedom. \n\nSo my question is— am I genuinely the ungrateful immature child my parents made me out to be and I should just suck it up for the next few years—or is this a normal reaction from someone who has been heavily micromanaged and sheltered their entire life and is desperate for a bit of autonomy?

The night before the exam no other member even opened the shared document. I completed the entire the lab and emailed my professor and TA explaining the situation. I submitted it on Thursday 12 am, and it is due on Friday 5pm. I leave out of town on Friday, so I am unable to submit it to the professor then. I wanted to guarantee that it gets submitted and do not trust me group members to have complete it well or submit it. I understand they may have tried to complete it on Friday before 5pm but I had no assurance of this. Am I in the wrong for going behind their back and telling the professor that I did all the work? Additionally, instead of putting their names on the report I put my own name in 4 different fonts, hopefully to get a chuckle from my professor. ",

For the last months, she wasn't able to purchase any oz of the weed, as she is a freelancer and business have been slow. In the other hand, i have a 9-to-5 job that allows me to buy an ounce every other week, to enjoy after a long and hard day at work. Since she's a heavy user as me (smoking daily) i told her that i wasn't able to keep up my use and hers as well. Then, some days i noticed that my jar was moved from where i left it the night before. I directly ask her if she was taking my weed from the jar. She repeatedly said no, multiple times, multiple days. But i was always suspicious. Last night was the last straw, as i saw clearly that my grinder wasn't as full as i left last night. I confronted her and we had an argument for over two hours. \n\nThe thing is i feel like she's clearly taking advantage of the fact that i always have some in my stash and the fact that she's my gf , and as we live together, 'we have to share everything.' . I don't feel good about it. I feel like she corrupted the trust i had in her by taking without asking or taking my opinion in consideration. So i told her it was the last time this happened and that i would keep my stash locked.\n\nI really love her, but i don't like feeling like she's taking everything for granted from me, like i have an obligation to share EVERYTHING. \n\nTLDR: I dont feel confortable sharing my weed stash with my GF, while she does not pay for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPd. I don't mind sharing other things like computer, videogames systems, clothing, etc. But i really don't like when people mess up with my weed. For me, is a personal ritual and i like keeping my things under control. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She lives six hours away and isn’t a dot on my radar at any time, but she’s in town, so he wants to see her I guess. My brother and I have always been the sort of oddballs of the family. We’re not very close to anyone besides my one cousin, and a few tias and tios. I can only guess his reason for wanting to see her is because he wants to get closer to the family. \n\nWell he’s decided that I’m going to join him, and by decide I mean he’s told my parents he wants to go see her, and somehow it’s now us going to see her. I don’t want to. I have work, I don’t know her, and again I don’t care for her.\n\nNow let’s get to the why: my grandmother is a bad person. Plain and simple. She’s a hypocrite who thumps the bible, but talks about how all “them n-words are moving to the town now.” She’s “had” every disease under the sun. In one year she had cancer, a broken elbow, cancer again, and a stroke. The year before that she had cancer again. Sometimes the cancer is in her lungs, sometimes brain, sometimes it’s random body parts that develop cancer. My dad had a heart attack last year, and a week later she also had a heart attack with the same story as my dad’s. She talks like a baby because of her “stroke” so holding a conversation with her is impossible. Basically either this woman is real life iron man and should be studied, or she’s a liar. The fact that she’s never been sick from her “cancer treatments” or looks the same year after year leads me to believe she’s full of shit. So there’s a few reasons I don’t like her.\n\nI don’t know this woman, I’m an adult, she’s someone who I’ve decided I don’t like and don’t want to spend time with. I’m not going to start shit, but I’m not going out of my way to visit her, and if she wants to come see me I’ll tell her no. My brother, my dad, and my mom (who usually agrees with me about this) say I should lighten up, but I’m not arguing with them, I’m just firmly saying no. They say I’ll regret it later, which may be true, but I can worry about that later. Also, again I do not know this woman, so if something happens to her I cannot say I would care too much, or it would be a huge burden. I love my family, but they don’t need me to tag along with them. Also I work that night, and they want me to go spend my free time before work with her, and I can think of a million fucking things I’d rather do than see her. But maybe I should lighten up.\n\nSo, AITA? Because I really feel like I’m being one, but at the same time, I can’t help the way I feel, and I don’t want to have this bitter angry feeling that I’ll know I get from seeing her. ",

      "description": "I have two children with my ex, who are 13 and 15. My wife and I have been married for 10 years.\n\nIf you're wondering why I'm thinking about Mother's Day in February, it's because my ex rents out a room and does a huge party with her whole family and the kids every year. I usually do not go to that, because while my ex and I co parent fairly well, it's just always a little uncomfortable for us to be together.\n\nMy wife has said she felt left out of the Mother's Day celebration for years but agreed that they should spend the day with their real mom instead. However, my ex decided to invite my wife this year, I guess because the kids asked her to, but I don't know for sure. My wife got really excited and really wants to go, but I feel weird about it. I just don't like the idea of my ex and my wife being too close and this feels like a boundary being crossed. I want to say no, but I don't want to upset my wife. I also don't want to ruin a good co parenting relationship, but I don't want this situation (and my ex) to interfere with my marriage either. AITA?",

He's never attacked me or anything, but he makes me wildly uncomfortable. Examples: \n\n\\-I had my phone in my back pocket and I felt someone take it out. I turned around and he was holding my phone and said he wanted to see if I could feel someone steal it so he could show me that it isn't safe to keep my phone in my back pocket.\n\n\\-He often spends events sitting in the corner and staring at me. Every time I look at him, he's staring at me and smirking.\n\n\\-He started messaging me on snapchat and when I didn't answer quickly enough, he started saying things like \"no one cares about me\" and \"I guess I should just go die\" and it made me very uncomfortable. I asked him to stop talking to me. He didn't so I blocked him and he made another account to keep messaging me.\n\n\\-He was playing beer pong at a party, looked right at me, made eye contact, and adjusted himself in his pants without looking away from me.\n\nI knew he was planning on coming to our next event so I asked our standards chair to blacklist him and she did. The member who was planning on bringing him was informed that he was not allowed to come. She got upset and sent a message to our entire sorority accusing the person who blacklisted him (me, though she doesn't know it) of being a bully and discriminating against him because he has autism. I haven't told anyone that it was me, and as of now, he is still blacklisted. AITA for blacklisting him and then keeping quiet about it?",

      "description": "I’m very heavily tattooed considering my age (F20), with a full sleeve, blacked out neck, chest tattoo etc. as well as stretched ears and piercings. Split tongue isn’t visible unless shown. I like to wear pretty revealing clothing as I just feel more comfortable doing so.\n\nRight now I’m in a country on the Gold Coast and forced to socialize with everyone I live here with (from the same home country).\nThere’s a guy who has a general distaste for me. I’ve had a hard time figuring out exactly why, but know it’s not in my head since I’ve asked a couple others and they’ve observed it too. He’s around 60, so there’s a considerable age gap.\n\nA couple of days ago we got into an argument. I stated: “I’m of course not criticizing person X for how he sees tattoos, it’s a very personal thing, just glad he couldn’t see all of mine since our beliefs differ”, to which he replied “No no, I’m criticizing YOU.”\nOh okay.\n\nThe bickering back and forth, to sum it up, went something like this:\n\nAccording to him I’m “walking around all the time provoking people, not considerate of how others can feel about my tattoos, should cover myself absolutely everywhere I ever go (when I brought up our very liberal European home country he stuck to his guns), should actually think about and respect people, not taking others into consideration at all, should always respect there can be ONE person that doesn’t like it, clearly craved the attention because otherwise I would just cover them up, YOU ARE PROVOKING PEOPLE”.\nMy points were: “You’ve seen that invited over I’m always considerate enough to try to cover myself (skirts down to my ankles &amp; shirts that show no cleavage), I haven’t gotten any bad reactions here and several local people are tattooed as well as people from our home country constantly being here, I’m not going to cover myself everywhere I go just because it might mess with one single persons beliefs never have never will, I can’t consider every single persons opinion, you know I have severe anxiety I just have accepted this will draw people in and I generally avoid eye contact so I don’t really notice the looks”.\n\nI was as civil as possible considering I live with this guy even though I was fuming inside. Even though this was my life choice I don’t feel I should have to take into consideration that another adult can’t deal with other people being different than them in my day to day life, I felt it was extremely rude to suggest I do so. Another person cut the conversation off because they saw it was going south fast.\n\nHowever, I’ve noticed I have an ability to miss out on some social cues, so I’m worried I might be the asshole in refusing to always consider other people’s beliefs in public. So AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Guy tells heavily tattooed me I should always cover my body for the sake of all other people’s beliefs, I outright refuse the idea.",

But, I honestly don’t eat too much, and their are factors on why they believe this.\n\n1. My metabolism is kinda low\n\n2.

For almost 3 years, they did call me fat, but they hardly said it, so I never got bothered by it. It has just recently been annoying me, as they are starting to say it A LOT more.\n\nThey only start doing it when I’m playing with the 2 of them. For instance say I’m just playing with Friend A, or just Friend B. They won’t do it then. If I play with A, B, and C, they won’t do it then either.

I have been feeling quite conflicted about the current situation my girlfriend and I are in.\n\nTLDR at the bottom.\n\nAITA for basically giving my girlfriend (25) an ultimatum, either be with me or remain living with her housemate. Some back story is she has been living with her housemate for 7 years now (Male 33) who does not have his shit together. He can barely hold a job down, struggles to pay rent and bills on time, takes money from my girlfriend, owes her over $2000, gets extremely frustrated with her when she spends the day/night with me, does not do basic chores because he is incredibly lazy, and just overall a shitty person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple weeks ago my girlfriend and I were out the whole day, had lunch, dinner etc and I dropped her home that night. She then messaged me saying that her housemate was extremely angry that she had been out with me the whole day instead of him, and gets even more angry when he knows I have been in the house as it is 'his house' and 'doesn't wan't anyone else to visit' despite his name not being on the lease at all and barely paying rent/bills.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has gotten to a point where I feel like I am tiptoeing around her housemate to be with my girlfriend, as she does not want any conflict between us two. I respect her wish but this is not how I envisioned our relationship going at all. It has been going on for months like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have told her yesterday that she either kicks him out or risk losing me, because I cannot have someone so toxic and disrespectful dictate our relationship. She is an amazing girl and just hates conflict, so she is worried of losing his friendship etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for telling her it is either him or me? I honestly do not want to continue having him around in her life for the above reasons, I feel confident about that, but I also feel bad about putting her in a situation to choose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR - Girlfriend has horrible housemate, gets angry when she is with me instead of him. Told her she either kicks him out or risks losing me as a boyfriend.",

      "description": "Ok, so this past school year has been a mess. I know a lot of this I’m going to tell u is me being a asshole already. Sorry in advance about way too much detailed than needed I’m really nervous and this is my first time posting on Reddit and I’m also on mobile. \n\nMy now ex: B \nEx’s new gf: K \nEx’s best friend: J \nEx’s best friend’s gf: E\nBest friend: A \nAny names used is not the real name of person just theses are the main people. \n\nLast school year was my first year of high school. I was in the band and I met B well we started dating as soon as the school year started basically. I became friends with E and J hated me. He had a crush on B. \n\nBefore I even met K she gave me a dirty look because she had a crush on B. B and I would poke each other in the hallway and that was out weird way of flirting. That was even before we got together. \n\nI met K at the homecoming pep rally and I didn’t talk to her really, mostly because I didn’t know her gender and didn’t want to misgender her. \n\nNow the first question if I am an asshole is with me and my best friend A. \n\nB and I have been dating for about a month at this point. Well we were at Beta. If you don’t know what Beta Club is just look it up. \n\nA didn’t go to school with us, but I went to school with him on and off my whole life. I dated A in 7th grade to piss off a girl that no one liked, but followed around my friend group. B already knew this. When Beta came around I haven’t seen A for like 3 months. Well at beta I was hanging out with B and Mad. We met up with A and went to Hot Topic because we are just emo teens. Well I was talking to A and just walking. Well I accidentally left B and Mad. They got mad. B got mad and I apologized. \n\nThis isn’t where it ends with the story with A. \n\nAfter Beta was over we went back to school and everything was fine. A and I didn’t really text before Beta, so we never really texted after Beta either. \n\nI don’t remember how long after Beta, but B was walking me to 6th period. \nB told me that J was cheating on E with K. \nWell I was shook. \n\nWell long story short. E and J were still together. K was acting like she did nothing wrong and was writing edgy poems about me and E. \n\nYes I did ask B not to talk to her because I didn’t trust her. \nYes I did ask B to save there msges on snap because she could easily make it look like he said something he didn’t. \nYes I hated K. \nK and her best friend at one point tried to FaceTime B after he said I’m getting in the shower. \nK and I also argued a lot, but just stopped talking to each other. \n\nYes I know I was a asshole for most of that. \n\nWell lets fast forward to this past summer and now we are back on the topic of A. \n\nThis past summer B had family issues and wasn’t able to talk to me a lot. His cousin was a ass to me from Easter till the school year ended and because of that our relationship was already damaged. \n\nWell A and I started talking a lot more. We talked about Star vs the forces of evil, Steven universe, and other cartoon stuff. \n\nWell later. When I say later I mean about a week ago. I found out that B was upset about this because I would talk about A and I acting like idiots on FaceTime and ya having the time of our life. \n\nThe start of this school year was a something. I found out my grandmother had a spot of cancer (she is ok now) and she was going to have a surgery to get it removed. Well my dad was like ya I’m moving down to Florida to take care of your grandma after her surgery. \n\nWell this hit me hard because I feel like my dad is the only adult I can talk to. \n\nWell the school year started well I had like 4 classes with K. Well I decided to msg her and be like yo I’m cool and shit. Well later I did apologize to K and we were cool.  \n\nShe became one of my literal best friends. I told her everything. I don’t open up to people a lot, but I opened up to her about family stuff. Like stuff I only told B. I even told her about me knowing I been a asshole to B because I been mad at the world. She even told me stuff that you wouldn’t just tell anyone. \n\nWell this past Beta A LOT of shit went down. The only thing that matters is that B got mad because we hanged out with A. I thought he overreacting. I also kicked J out of the hotel room because K was uncomfortable with him being in there, so I told him to get out I said something that was true about J, but pissed off B’s cousin. \n\nWell B and I broke up. Now let’s get into the real shit that happened with me and K. \n\nK WAS FUCKING TELLING B ONLY THE BAD SHIT I SAID ABOUT B. Ok every time when I was venting about B I always said at the end that I still love him though. \n\nI knew K still had a crush on B btw. I trusted that she wouldn’t do anything. \n\nOk well about a week after B and I broke up K just completely stopped talking to me. Well her and her friend H was talking and I found out that K was talking to B. \n\nI was playing dumb with B and was like oh who’s K talking to. He was like I will tell you later. He told me while we were texting when we got home. I died laughing. Less than a week later they were dating and less than a month after we broke up. \n\nLet me note. K didn’t come to me and say hey me and B are talking or hey me and B are dating. \n\nI found out they were dating because my friend Kay told me. \n\nIf she told me they were talking I would have actually give her some best friend advice and said listen I’m not going to say I’m not mad and I won’t be salty, but bitch it’s been less than a month me and him have been broken up if you want to make sure your not a rebound wait after New Years.(this was in mid December) \n\nWell now it’s been 3 months since B and I broke up and well I’m not as sad that we broke up I’m more mad that K pretended to be my friend for 3 months. \n\nLiterally B will still msg me to “tell me off” about telling people that she pretended to be my friend. \n\nEven now K is telling B lies about me. \n\n\nAm I a asshole for thinking that B was over reacting over A? \nMy opinion: I can see both sides \n Am I a asshole for being mad that K pretended to be my friend and still my bf? \nMy opinion: no \n\nTbh I left a lot of details, so if you don’t understand something ask. \n\nI may do more post about this break up because sis there is so much.

She was so heartbroken but she's my friend and I couldn't have watched her dating that lying idiot (he told her he had broken up with Jess for good). Now the thing is, I haven't told Jess that Brad and Cindy were dating while she and Brad were already back together. I'm pretty sure she doesn't know about it. I feel like as an outside person it isn't any of my business. Jess is a friend but not that close and I don't want to be caught in the middle of something.

I’ve known this friend (We’ll call him Jake) for about 13 years now and I consider him practically my brother however I’m worrying that I’m doing the wrong thing right now. Basically him, I and my girlfriend at the time would all go to fires during the summertime which is where his future gf (we’ll call her Jess) comes into play. About a week or two into the summer my girlfriend dumps me and I take it pretty bad, like I stop going to the fires and basically just shutting myself out until Jake comes over and forces me to go to the next fire. We go and arrive early so we are the second group there and sit down. The next person to show up is Jess and her friends so she sits down right next to me, throughout the whole night we’re flirting and just really hitting it off, one thing leads to another and I offer her a ride home and we make out a bit. Through the week we talk and blah, blah, blah which leads to us hooking up, I’m her first which is important later. After however we stop talking as much and about 2 weeks later I get back together with my ex. Later in the week We go to the next fire and discover that Jake and Jess are now dating also which is only surprising to me because Jess and I are the only ones who know about hooking up. Anyway, a few months go by which leads us to tonight, she came into my work and was very flirty to the point co-workers noticed. \n\n\n  So, TLDR ; AITA for not telling my best friend about hooking up with his now current gf who believes he’s her first ",

      "title": "AITA for requesting a refund from a crappy gas station?",
      "description": "I was recently on a long road trip and found myself running dangerously low on gas. I was forced to stop at a very sketchy &amp; run down backwoods gas station; and was the only person there, save for a towering, intimidating skinhead-looking guy manning the attached store. I decided that I was only going to fill my tank up part of the way (I was going to stop when it hit about a quarter tank of gas); while not a gas snob, I had some reservations about the quality of this place’s gas as a result of its setting, and only wanted to have to use the minimum amount to safely get to my destination.\n\nWhen I had pumped about a quarter tank, I wanted to stop and pay, but had some trouble figuring out how to do this. The screen directed me to press a specific key when finished pumping, but there was no key on the screen that I could find that fit the description provided. I tried and tried to figure it out, but had to give up and ask the guy inside for help. He came outside, picked up the pump, and continued fueling up my tank.\n\nI stopped him, and re-explained that I’m **not** having trouble figuring out how to fuel; I’m done fueling, and I need help paying. He nodded his head as though he understood, but stuck the pump back in, and continued fueling. I stopped him again, explained myself again, only to have him do the same thing **again**, and then again after another interruption/explanation. Every time I was kind, patient, and repeated my question so clearly that I think a 4 year old could easily have understood. I finally asked to talk to his manager, and he said he was out. Feeling that I was going nowhere with him, I just gave up and said, in a frustrated and obviously sarcastic tone, “Fine. Whatever. Fill it up all the damn way”, which he did.\n\nI don’t know what his issue was. He was clearly a native English speaker, and didn’t appear to be deaf/hard of hearing. He was either 1) mentally disabled/slow/lacking in comprehension, or (the more likely option) 2) willingly ignored me, knowing his gas station would make more $. I called the gas station the next day, was connected to the manager’s voicemail, and explained my situation. I requested a refund of $30 (the difference between the cost of the gas I ended up being given and the cost of the gas I had **intended** to put into my tank). The extra gas I was given got me around just fine, but I had made it clear to the guy multiple times **I** **didn’t want it**, and only gave in because there was no other option. Sort of like if a pizza place showed up to your door with a bunch of extra crap you didn’t order, refused to take it back, and charged you for it.\n\nThe manager never called me back, so I called again, was finally connected to him, and explained things again. He was very rude, calling me “entitled”, saying I should move on with my life, and accused me of mocking the intelligence of his employee (I most certainly didn’t); and made clear he was not refunding me. AITA?",

      "description": "Right so I've been dating this girl for about 7 months now, lets call her M, and I'm like crazy into her. Ever since we got together we had been looking forward to a school dance, The winter formal (basically prom for tenth graders). Now M had this weird friend who had always just been there, we'll call her E. Shes always been strange but not exactly antisocial. She pops into convos at weird times, shes generally awkward, and shes always around M and I (At lunch, in the halls, during club meetings, in theatre, etc etc etc). We put up with her because M and E were girl scouts together, childhood friendship etc, but now its difficult.\n\nAlot went into preparing for the formal, I actually wrote her a song and performed it to her in front of the entire school right as lunch started. It was extremely sweet, M was shocked, and E was squealing in the corner the entire time like a dying animal. All in all, it was a little weird but sweet.\n\nNaturally she said yes, and we were set to go together to the formal. Eventually the dance gets there, I dress up nicely and she looks gorgeous, and were ready to go to the dance. The beginning was nice, we got to spend time together, music was kinda shit but it was okay because I was really more there for her. Eventually, the only slow dance of night comes on, and she and I go out to the dance floor after she shows me how to slow dance (first time, it was sweet). Ed Sheeran's 'Perfect' is playing so the mood is romantic. Were staring at eachother, not focusing on anything else, and then she strikes. E decides it would be appropriate to take pictures of us. What she didnt understand, was that generally, when people are having a moment, you dont take pictures three feet away WITH YOUR FLASH ON. And that's exactly what she did. To make it better, she was screaming stuff like 'TOO CUTE' 'OTP' 'MY SHIP HAS SAILED' in the highest pitch you've ever heard in public while its QUIET. The mood was ruined, and somewhat along with it the night. And to top it all off, all of the pictures were shit. Blurry  weird angles, and I can practically her screeches every time I look at them.\n\nSince then she and I have decided that next year when we all move to senior high, we're going to try and ditch her as quickly as possible. My dilemma however, is I feel mean for it. They were close, and E being weird may not totally be her fault. She has ADHD, anxiety, and seems to be mentally 'on the spectrum' (if you know what I'm saying). We're probably gonna ditch her anyway, but I'd love to know if I'm being overly dramatic or if there genuinely is a problem here that I'm appropriately reacting to.",

No internet, no TV, nothing to do in the city at night (everything closes early), I didn’t bring my laptop because she asked me not to. During the day we go to the beach, and at night we just stay in the house talking. We are like this for three days, and we just had a big fight because I jokingly said I miss my videogame. Now she is super mad at me and said we are going back home first thing in the morning. Am I the Asshole for being bored and wanting to go home?\n\nTLDR: I’m at the beach with my girlfriend for 3 days with absolutely nothing to do and want to go home. ",

      "description": "So little context my gf and I are on spring break rn. A month ago a group of my friends and I rented a small cabin about 5 hours away from where we go to college. My gf made mention that she didn’t feel well at the end of the week, and her sickness got progressively worse over the past 4ish days. Two days ago (the day before we were supposed to leave) my gf kept texting me the entire morning saying how she felt horrible like she’d been hit by a truck. She ended up going to the doctor where they told her she had the flu. \n\nSo I made the decision that she wasn’t going to go with me since she had the flu and going on vacay for a few days wouldn’t help her get better at all. She claimed she didn’t care if I went without her and we got into a little argument, resulting in her saying she didn’t care and that I should “just fucking go.” So I drove all the way there. \n\nShe then texted me very pissed saying that I only left to get drunk with my friends and didn’t care at all about her. It escalated into her bringing up other things and instances in our past that she felt like I had shown that I hadn’t cared about her. \n\nObviously what I did was not intended to make her think I didn’t care about her, I knew that she would have a terrible time if she went with the flu, and quite frankly others didn’t want her there since she was sick. All the people there are my good friends and I wanted to spend time with them. Instead, because she didn’t believe I actually cared about her, I drove 5 hours back to school to show how much I really do care about her. She still thinks that I’m in the wrong and claims I treat her “lower than anything else” So, aita? \n\nTl;dr gf got diagnosed with the flu, told her not to come on vacay with me and my friends for obvious reasons. She now believes I don’t give a shit about her and only wanted to get drunk with friends. So I left and drove back home 5 hours to show how much I care, she still thinks I’m an asshole. ",

      "description": "I have a coworker who is generally friendly and fun to work with, does a good job, and has great customer service (he does treat all customers equally, to the best of my knowledge). However, when he's tired or upset, he'll take out his frustration by making rude comments to us (fellow employees) about how \"he wishes he had a phone number for ICE that he could call whenever he thought one of our customers was an illegal\", and, \"I bet they bought that with food stamps. Psh. I'm the one paying for that!\" and, probably the mildest, \"they should learn English because blah blah blah.\" (Among other similar comments.) These comments are only ever directed toward Hispanic and black customers, I guess is my issue. While he never utters a blatantly racist insult, it is - without exception - only after we've served a Hispanic or black customer. Personally, I don't understand the animosity. I don't think threatening to call the authorities on someone because you THINK (no evidence, note) they MIGHT be illegal because they're of Hispanic descent is appropriate. (Let's not even begin a discussion on the huge waste of tax payer dollars it would be to send ICE agents to investigate every little phone call this guy makes.. while he complains about food stamps costing too much. But I digress.) The fact that he only ever accuses Hispanic and black people of using food stamps (again, with no evidence, as we don't collect payment in our dept) is also kind of inappropriate. \n\nWIBTA for reporting these comments to management? There are no insults, no name calling, and no direct confrontation with the customer (thankfully). But it still feels...wrong. Reporting this to management will most likely end with his termination, as our company has a **strict** zero tolerance policy for racism. As a fellow adult with a family to feed, getting someone fired IS a big deal. It's not something to be taken lightly and can put families in a precarious situation. Are these comments out of line? Or am I making a mountain out of a molehill? Where do we draw the line on this kind of thing.",

Knows we swing and wife likes cum.\n\nHim and GF invite us out. My friend propositions me with partner swap- his whole angle was that his girlfriend has a huge crush on me and he thinks it'll help their relationship if I do her. Doesn't mention wife.\n\nI pity him and agree.\n\nIn the uber I tell wife what we're doing.\n\nAbout to bone... GF says no condom, but don't cum inside. I say \"*looks like we're cumming on some titties*\" to my friend. He grunts agreement.\n\nSex happens... he cums in her hard. She's thrilled. I'm pissed but contain it.\n\nLater, I tell her he just wanted to cum in her because his girlfriend doesn't let him. She looks at me like I'm stupid, duh. I told him to cum on your tits. She doesnt remember. I did.\n\nShe dismissed my feelings instead of working through. Maybe thought I was blaming her and was mad at her about it, says she owns her pussy, that she can't believe *I'M* shaming her, she only did it for me, etc.\n\nTension.\n\nLast night I confronted friend. He admitted planning to cum inside. I told him that was fucked up- He said and didn't think of it that way, everything was true, wife said it was okay. Didn't know it was a big deal and apologized genuinely. I accepted.\n\nI was mad because...\n\n**Expectations**: sex-god alpha male, here to fulfill innocent girl's fantasy and save friend's sad boring life + impress w/ wife.\n\n**Reality**: a couple tried swinging\n\n**Result**: suddenly emasculated that I wasn't in complete control. But now I've learned, won't do it again.\n\nTold wife the good news, she got mad. Said if I can't manage expectations, thats my problem, \"It's not fun if I have to worry about you freaking out\". That I had no right to make him feel bad for something he didn't know about and I'm egotistical. Took a lot of trust for her because there was no plan and my reaction I ruined it.\n\nI asked her to do something sexually extreme (service my friend) she wants praise, affection, but I think she's martyring herself here. Never had negativity towards her at all. But I also have a duty to resolve doubts and misunderstandings before they grow into resentment. The idea that I should have shoved my feelings inside and ignore them seems ridiculous.\n\nAm I The Asshole?",

      "description": "So I'm torn between the opinion of my mother and my mother in law. Let me explain the situation. \n\nLast wednesday, my back hurt terribly. I couldn't walk, couldn't sit. I've honestly never experienced that kind of pain in my life (although I had a pretty painfree life, physically). I went to the doctor and he told me that it's a common kind of pain and it'll fix itself in about 6 weeks. He gave me painkillers and sent me home. I live with my family in law (due to college and mental health). \n\nWednesday evening, my great grandfather died peacefully. He was 90+, religious and longed to go 'home' to his wife. He had been sick for a long time, it's a relief for him and for the family.\n\nHere goes: I can barely do anything, the only time I sit is for dinner. I walk a lot, as it is supposed to help the pain. My mom doesn't see this, I call her but she doesn't see the pain I'm in. This morning I thought it was getting better, but I turned around too fast and now the pain is back.\n\nMy mom expects me to go to the funeral. This will be 3 hours by train and another half an hour by car. That's a one way trip, so it would be 7 hours total, without even the funeral itself. The funeral is thursday. I'm afraid it'll do no good, as it hurts me to sit for 15 minutes. My mother in law thinks I shouldn't go, my mom thinks I should.\n\nFamily is important and I wish I could go, only I don't know if me going is a good idea. I didn't know my great grandfather too well, but he was an incredible man. My mom would be go crazy if I couldn't make it. \n\nWould I be the asshole?",

      "description": " So, I'm probably an asshole here, but my wife and I have been long distance for the past 3 years while she gets her degree in Illustration at a no name school. She is driven and one of the most determined people that I know of, and I could never tell her how I feel. I hear about how all these artists come out of school and are unable to find work. She has these dreams of coming out school and being able to say she could support herself if she wanted to doing her art. The thing is... she isn't that good. Our friend group is mainly graduated artists that are so much more talented than she is, have gone to a top 3 art school, and still they can not find work. Most of them are still living with their parents 2-3 years out of college.\n\nLuckily I have a job that can support us both. The problem is, I'm no saint and I get really bitter about it at times. Never to her face. I'm the one who found us a house, got a decent paying job, will pay for both of our student loans, and will pretty much provide for us while she works for this degree that I believe will only put us in more debt and give us nothing. My fear is that she will come out of this intense years of art school, after putting years of long distance stress on our relationship, with nothing. I try and will always tell her that I support her choices, but watching our debt increase and knowing i'm going to be the one to pay it back is really stressing me out. Especially when I 100% believe she will not be making any substantial amount of money to help pay it back. I know a relationship isnt all about money, but its hard being the only one making sure we arent destroying our lives financially.",

      "description": "Okay so here’s the gist: My boyfriend (18 M) and I (19 F) have been together for 8 months. I love him very much and we were friends for a while before we started dating, so that set up a good foundation for us.\n\nFinancially, we are very different. His parents help him with the majority of all his payments and I’ve also been on my own with pretty much anything I wanted to purchase. I don’t resent him nor my parents for this, it’s just how it is.\n\nMoving on, because of this college and life has been pretty hard. I still have no vehicle (I’m saving up for one) and paying for books and stuff has not been very easy. Not to mention my eyes suck, so paying for contacts kicked me in the butt.\n\nAnyway yesterday my boyfriend came over and was excited to talk to me about us actually going to prom, although preciously we ruled it out and made the executive decision not to go.\n\nI wasn’t upset by this, because he said his parents were going to help him pay and I do love dancing. He then proceeded to ask if I was going to pay for my ticket, as they were only chipping in partially.\n\nI’m not upset by this either. It’s amazing that his parents would even offer to help pay, let alone him help me pay for my dress.\n\nHowever, money is really really really tight and I told him that I wouldn’t go if I had to pay because it just wasn’t an option for me right now. It’s not that I didn’t want to go, I just couldn’t.\n\nOf course this upset him and he was also peeved that I felt so strongly about it. We fought about it for a bit, but still are in the same standing position right now. Prom is also on our 10 month anniversary, and he told me he was planning on asking me in a big gesture as well. So yeah, he’s pretty upset. He has a right to feel this way, but now I just kinda feel like an asshole. \n\nSo AITA? What should I do here. I feel as though I’m in the wrong but I don’t really have another choice. ",

Now before I get called cheap by you guys:\n\n* I'm not cheap, I'm the type of person who refuse to enter another person's home unless I brought them gifts. But I do draw the line on knowing what kind of prices we can afford\n* The two seniors in their home are especially sweet to our family, and love seafood, so my husband feels the need to give them \"the best seafood they've ever ate\"\n* I didn't even want to spend $1k on a new laptop, yet this one dinner will basically mean my laptop budget's out the door\n* I have no problem taking them out to dinner at a slightly more reasonable price, say $300 (which I think is already a luxurious dinner)\n\nGonna change the wording here, am I the cheapskate here for thinking going way above budget is required to maintain relationship with relatives?",

At round 1:30 I went outside for a smoke, and started talking to a friend of mine working at the cashier, where you have to pay your entry fee.\nIt wasn't very crowded outside, so I didn't really pay a lot of attention to my surrounding. While talking, and holding my cigarette in the left hand, some girl bumped into my arm, and into the cigarette.\nSince I wasn't too drunk yet I reacted fairly instant, and put out the ashes that got caught up in her jacket.\nI then apologized, and started talking to my friend again, not really giving it another thought.\nSuddenly the girl started getting really upset about a small burn mark on her jacket, asking me what I can do to make it up to her.\nSince I really didn't move when she bumped into me, I told her she should've paid more attention, and I couldn't see my fault just for holding a cigarette in the smoking area (everything outside was the smoking area, but whatever).\nSince she didn't stop complaining about it, I gave her my number, and asked her to write me the next day, since we both had a few drinks, and stuff like that should be handled sober. \n\nThe next morning I woke up to 8 messages from her, showing me pictures of a really tiny hole in her jacket (0.3cm at max), and asking me to pay her the full price of it.\nAfter a bit of back and forth I kinda agreed to take this to my insurance, so she can get a new one. At this point everything would've been fine for her, but she just had to add, that I should pay more attention while smoking, implying I was still at fault.\nI then decided to go, 'fuck it, if you want anything from me go contact a lawyer', because she was never any thankful for me taking the damage she inflicted.\n\nDamn that got longer than expected, and I could still add tons of details, but I hope it's enough for you to decide...\nSooo, am I the asshole?

His brother used to apologise if him and my bf spoke to eachother in their native tongue while driving with me, which I found polite. Bf never apologises, neither does his mom. \n\nSo we were invited to my bf's brother's wife's birhday today (I will refer to her as bf's sister-in-law from now on for shorter). We went out to have a nice dinner and drinks. The place of choice was a brazillian steakhouse which functions like a buffet. They said they hoped I would find something to eat there, as I do not eat red meat. \nFirstly, only two of the waiters spoke english to us, the rest only spoke portuguese, which was awkward because I had to communicate through headshaking for no and nodding for yes when they brought the different types of meats 'round the tables. Second and foremost, my bf, his brother and mother went full on portuguese amongst themselves and the waiters. For the most part me, bf's sister-in-law and her child just sat there eating, while the three of them seemed to be having a jolly ol' time, laughing and speaking in their native tongue. On her birthday dinner. She didn't look like she was enjoying herself very much and tbh neither was I. \nTo top it all off, they all had drinks, and the designated driver had the most. They were coctails, but still. Driving back with a child in the car. \n\nI wanted to talk about this as soon as we got home, but bf was sleepy and went straight to bed so I didn't bring it up. \nStill not sure if I have the right to assume how bf's sister-in-law felt as like I said I am the newest addition to the family, since his mother calls me her daughter-in-law aswell, while the sister-in-law has been with his brother for 7 years or something.\nWorth mentioning that the Christmas of 2017 was the first time I met his family officially and they were a bit more considerate, but this does seem to be a theme, as they do it at home too. \n\nAm I in the wrong? WIBTA if I tell him I don't enjoy spending time with his family? \n\nAlso a little bit of side info - I have some serious social anxiety so I definitely don't want a ton of attention, just not to feel like I am just brought there to be fed. Frankly wouldn't even mind if they never spoke to me directly, so long as the convo was still in english when there are non-portuguese people present. \n\nSorry for the rant. ",

      "description": "AITA for expecting my husband to turn off the television whenever our baby is awake &amp; denying him from sharing his favourite hobby with our son for many years? I strongly believe that screen time is unhealthy for infant brain development (the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend zero screen time before 18 months) and want to make all possible efforts to avoid exposing our 4month old until he is 2 and then only to quality programs. My husband doesn't feel it's that big of a deal, but has agreed.\n\nHowever, I keep catching my husband playing videogames while our son is in the room if I'm not around and he will keep playing if I'm in the living room with our son and just expect me to keep him distracted. I know our son will happily and quietly watch Daddy's game and actively entertaining a baby is exhausting (boy, do I know!) but this doesn't change my expectations. To be clear:\n\nA. I'm not anti-gaming - it's a valid hobby that I know helps my husband unwind. The games are child appropriate Nintendo games that I'd be happy for them to play together if our baby was a 5yo.\n\nB. We live in a very small house and the only TV and only baby play area is in the living room. We have a study with a PC but my husband is enjoying playing nostalgia games on the Switch on the TV at the moment.\n\nC. I'm not perfect in that I'll browse my phone if our baby is busy playing, or behind his back while breastfeeding but I'll put it down as soon as I notice he's looking at me, and I don't look at things that would fire up a baby's reward centre (no sound or video).\n\nSo, AITA?

      "description": "So I have two dogs. have had the oldest since 2011. the youngest since 2014. I've lived in my house since 2009. the house next door to me has two dogs they got as puppies this summer. they moved in back somewhere around the first of the year (it's a rental property). I've never had a problem with either of my dog getting out of my yard. Starting around August, the neighbor's dogs have managed to get into my yard on multiple occasions. All by going under the fence (we share a fence between us.) I've gone and knocked on their door multiple times asking them to come get their dogs. I've been kind about it. I get it, puppies take some work to grow into functioning adult dogs. But, they seem to be content leaving their dogs out all day, and only come get their dogs if i say something, or if they are leaving and find them in my yard (at least when I've been home to witness it). Once they went darting after my smaller dog (a Shih Tsu) while he was trying to pee. Another time, they had my larger dog (Lab/Pyrenees mix) trapped in the corner of the yard. i had to go chase them off so she could run to the house. Tonight, I get home from work and they're already in my yard. Meaning i can't let my own dogs out until they get their dogs out of my yard. While i was trying to shoo them out of my yard. The neighbor comes out of his house yelling at his dogs. I'm tired of feeling like my dogs can't even go out without me making sure my own yard is clear. WIBTA if I just called the police next time I have this issue?",

      "description": "I've known my roommate for over a decade, and we don't always mesh personality-wise. He is the type of person who very much enjoys having long drawn out hypothetical arguments about random things. I do not enjoy this. I find arguments, especially hypothetical ones, exhausting.\nFast forward to today. I did some yard work this morning. After work, he commented that the yard looked good, and noticed I was curled up on the couch. I told him I was tired. He said \"Yeah, you look it.\" He then tells me a little bit about his day, we share some brief small talk, he walks away.\n\n\nA few minutes later he comes back in the room and he says \"So... Imagine you wake up in the woods. What's the first thing that you do? Now, it's an earth-like planet and you have nothing with you but your clothes. How soon do you think you could make metal tools?\"\nHuh? I ask him what he's talking about, and he makes it clear it's some hypothetical scenario he had been thinking about. I engage him for a bit, we have a back and forth. But frankly, I don't care about this conversation.\n\n\nThe other thing you should know about my roommate is that when he's thinking hard about something, it takes him forever to get to the point of a sentence. It's hard to convey accurately in writing, but it's something like this: \"So, let's say that it's an Earth-like... well, not exactly Earth because it's another planet, but it has Earth-like flora and fauna.. you know, like deer and rabbits.. not specifically that, but something similar. The climate and atmosphere is similar.. well, it could be a different season. Imagine that it's spring, but not like too hot or too cold...\"\nI admit that I get extremely impatient. I already don't have a good idea of what we're talking about, and I'm not really in the mood to be having some deep, analytical conversation. So after about 10 minutes of this conversation, he's in the middle of another rambling sentence that I've lost the point of, and I sigh.\n\n\nHe gets upset and asks why I'm annoyed. I say it's because he's taking so long to get to the point and I'm not sure what he's taking about anymore (a comment I've made in other contexts countless times before. This is not a new thing). He gets pissy, says \"Well sorry I don't speak a mile a minute like you! I'm trying to think this through!\" And he storms out of the room. A few minutes later, he says he's upset with me for getting impatient when it was supposed to be a \"fun\" conversation.\n\n\nMy feeling is that I never expressed interest in having this conversation. It's clear from my answers that I'm not thinking this scenario through as thoroughly as he is. And I certainly did not seem like I was having fun. I can't help but feel that he is unfairly upset with me because I didn't find this weird, rambling, and unexpected conversation as fun as he wanted me to. AITA?",

      "description": "(16)\n\nI have some issue for some reason where the sound of chewing from just about everyone causes serious anxiety for me. I get tense, I sweat, I shake, I can't even think about anything if there are some sounds like that going on around me. It's been happening for around 7 years: I'm on the verge of a panic attack on average 5 times per day for 7 years now. Sometimes I can remove myself from the source. I can put on some earbuds, maybe leave the room, but not always, and usually I don't have that option when it is my mother. She knows that this affects me, and has done nothing to help; her sounds still are particularly bad. If she's eating or chewing, I have no way to get away because she doesn't want me to. She makes me stay at the dinner table until we're all done eating before I can leave. OR she'll put some gum in when she's driving. Every time, hearing the sounds triggers as usual, but then she still goes on to ask EVERY FLIPPING TIME (in a very accusatory tone) \"Is something wrong?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I really have no option but to say \"nothing, i'm fine\". In the past, if I tell her what really is going on, she gets personally offended and starts weeping or shouting or some outrageous emotional response that solves nothing, and only makes both of us feel worse, so I don't do that anymore. I just stay there, feeling trapped, incredibly anxious, and  angry that she hasn't figured it out after 7 years. ",

      "description": "I posted this the other day without a response, so I hope it's okay to try again.\n\nMy brother-in-law (wife's brother) is deployed overseas. His wife works every weekend in addition to having classes during the week. So what's the problem? Neither one of them can keep their son, my nephew, on the weekend, sometimes even during the week as well. So guess who keeps him? Family.\n\nMy brother-in-law has said the money he makes while deployed is more than enough to pay for everything. In fact, he expects to make a big dent in their debt while he's gone (he's put a new truck, motorcycle, guns, video, games, and other electronics on credit in addition to his student loans). So why does the mother work if they don't require the income? From her own mouth, she told me she doesn't want to lose her tenure at her job. Instead she wants to work there until she finishes school, then she'll get another job based on her new degree within the same company. I admit, that wouldn't be a bad reason if the world revolved around them. Currently she drops her son off with a baby sitter Monday-Friday during the day, so she sees him at night during the week. During the weekend, she often won't see him at all until Sunday afternoon, but then only to take him to her mother's so she can work or study. Then the cycle starts again. Meanwhile, she constantly tells my wife how much she misses him and loves him. Okay, let's assume that's genuine since I can't read her mind.\n\nReview time. Dad is out of the picture but brings home plenty of money for the family to live. Mother is going to school and working every weekend even though she doesn't have to do either.\n\nIf the wife insists on working, why can't she stop school and work a regular shift during the week, freeing up her weekend to be with her son? Because they don't like that idea.\n\nOne last layer to complete the crap cake: my wife adores her family and jumps at the chance to keep our nephew. She adamantly defends them all, saying her brother's wife works very hard and her brother is depressed because he's forced to be away from his family. But I don't care, they're adults and they can suffer the consequences to their actions like the rest of us. Then my wife comes at me with something hurtful: even if I have problems with the parents, why would I take it out on our nephew by not caring for him? He's innocent and needs help no matter the situation. She also is saying I would break her family apart if I tell them any of this. She's expressed that my frustration and unwillingness to continue this situation is hurting her immensely. She says I'm forcing her to choose between me and her family.\n\nNow we're supposed to keep him this weekend, and I'm predictably upset.\n\nSo here's the question: AITA for not sucking it up for my wife's sake and accepting the situation for now? It may only be for a few more months, and we may only need to keep him once each month. I need some outside perspective.",

      "description": "This was 5 years ago and the effects of the incident have made a huge impact on several lives. I was over for dinner at my buddy bob’s house. I had known bob for about a year and we hung out every now and then because we worked together and our wives got along and our kids were the same age. We both had girls who were 17 at the time. \n\nI was over for dinner and we were drinking and talking in the kitchen  it was about 1 in the morning. I went to take a leak and afterwards got to wandering around a few hallways I had never walked down before in his house. His house was huge and I was just mucking around when I stumbled upon a dark room from which muffled sex noises were emanating. The room was really dim but I saw bobs daughter clearly being raped by her boyfriend. I say raped because she was 17 years old and I happened to know her boyfriend was 18. \n\nSo I called the police and reported the rape. I don’t know why I did it before talking to bob.that was stupid I know it now. Maybe calling the cops was stupid too I still dont know. I was more than a little buzzed at the time. \n\nSo I awkwardly told bob and things got super awkward. When the cops show up he gets super pissed and tells me to gtfo. The cops talked to me and I told them what I saw. The guy and bobs daughter appear and are questioned by the cops. The cops insist on doing a rape kit because it is a statutory case. The kids end up admitting to having sex anyways. Everyone is in tears. Bob is looking at me with the wrath of satan. \n\nLong story short. The boyfriend gets charged with statutory rape and gets thrown in prison for 5 years. Bob has made it clear that he wants to extinguish me from the face of the earth and gets me fired, but that’s another story. \n\nSo who is the asshole here? Please put my mind at ease. ",

      "description": "So this is a pretty short and simple issue but I'm feeling confused and I'm rethinking my actions in trying to solve an issue in my group of friends.\n\nBasically, I have 2 good friends who I have both known for a long time. One of them is more problematic than the other. (Friend A) He's a nice guy and he's smart but I don't think he's very emotionally sensitive, nor does he take cues well. He has a history of saying and doing dumb shit. Recently, he made a joke/insult to another friend of mine who is transgender (Friend B), referring to their identity. While the joke was not transphobic it was still very insensitive and understandably offensive, particularly because friend A had come out not too long ago and was sort of finding themselves. Friend B is also very nice and often tries to avoid drama. (This all happened on a group chat)\n\nAnyways friend B was pissed and immediately kicked friend A from the server. Initially, this was an understandable reaction, and the friend who was kicked immediately began to apologize. We didn't really listen for a week or so, but then my group of friends started thinking about it. Friend B was extremely stubborn in letting him back to the server, but that eventually happened. Since then, friend A has repeatedly tried to talk about it and has really wanted to come to common terms, and has been ignored as far as I know by everyone but me.\n\nOver the past few weeks I'd been talking to friend B but I'd not made any ground.\n (For clarification, this happened almost exclusely online because the offending friend goes to a different school)\n\nAnyways, friend B has been running a Minecraft realm and we have a lot of fun on it. At this point, friend A was on the fence about buying minecraft but eventually did so he could play with us, which was when friend B started making some thin excuses about not letting him on. This could have been done before he spent the money. I privately confront her and she explains she's not comfortable being around him. After much deliberation, its clear that friend A has wasted his money, which he's mad about.\n\nFriend A gets increasingly desperate to explain himself but is pretty much ghosted by everyone except me. \nHowever, when he goes on to complain about his situation, everyone attacks him for trying to justify his shitty personality. This gets to the point where they call him out for every mundane or casual use of a somehow insensitive word, such as \"retarded\" and stuff, which is undeniably hypocritical and is blatant cherrypicking. Also, friend A always apologizes and sometimes explains that he didn't realize what he was saying. His statements are genuine and while he's certainly insensitive, part of that is a very strong honesty.\n\nIn my opinion this is unfair treatment.\n\nSo, I call everyone out for this whole thing in what may have been a rather frank announcement, and I point out how unfair it is. My argument is that he's more than capable of improving himself, he's just being attacked and then ghosted over and over. Nobody replied to my statement.\n\nMy trans friend says she's sick of this, leaves the server, and has since ceased all communication.\n\nTLDR a friend makes an insensitive joke, which gets him in a cycle of ghosting and harrassment. I call it out in a way that might have been inappropriate\n",

      "description": "My uncle has been a nuisance in our household ever since he started staying with us in June, this is kind of long so please bear with me. I'm going to give some backstory prior to the event for better understanding.\n\nBackstory:\nMy uncle has a personal protection order against him from his wife, and this prevented him from being able to live in his house, which is no longer his since the divorce. He never really asked us if he could stay, he just decided to come inside and sit down on our couch and has been sleeping on the couch ever since.\n\nSomething to understand about him is that he is a high functioning severe alcoholic, when he's sober he's one of my best friends, but when he's drunk he becomes irrational, unpredictable, and verbally abusive. He has taken to verbally attacking me particularly, even going as far as threatening my life because I caught him smoking inside of our house.\n\nWe gave him notice in early January that he needed to find himself a place to live. But a couple weeks ago we gave him one week to gather his things and leave after he was caught drunkenly dirtying our kitchen, and smoking in our house and he pissed on the floor, which was discovered by my mother who had to clean it up. That one week was stretched into two and a half.\n\nWe didn't want to send him out in the middle of the winter cold without some form of transportation, he had his truck towed from his house down to ours on december 14th because it had an exploded tire. From early December we fought with him to get his truck in working order. It wasn't until January 3rd that my mom finally cracked and made him start getting his truck working. \n\nHe had his license suspended from an unpaid ticket, so that was the first thing he needed to get done. Every time that we would try and get him to do something it would take at least an entire week or longer for him to finally get it done. We discovered very quickly that he was intentionally stalling by getting drunk so he didn't have to do it.\n\n\nYesterday:\nYesterday he finally got his truck up and running, after getting his license unsuspended, his license tabs renewed, and his insurance, he finally called to have it towed to the shop to have new tires put on. I had to repeatedly get after him about his truck yesterday in order for him to finally call.\n\nHe finally returns home from the shop, and immediately starts drinking, it's pretty obvious at this point he's blackout drunk. He then decides to get up, stumble out the door, and get inside of his truck to go grab more alcohol. On his way out of our driveway he got stuck at the end of our driveway and couldn't get his truck out. He then decided to walk to our local convenience store to get his fix.\n\nIt was at this moment that I had had enough, and I was tired of waiting for my mother to make the final decision to kick him out. She continued to stall with kicking him out, because she's an empathetic person with a big heart. She was skiing with her sister when I decided to take action.\n\nI went into the living room where he was staying, and started bagging up all of his stuff, I grab the blankets and pillows we provided for him and packed those too. Everything including all of his clothes, supplies, and food that he had bought was sitting on the front porch waiting for him when he came back.\n\nThe first words I said to him was \"hey, I'm sorry to do this so suddenly, but we're kicking you out tonight.\" After an exchange of words he called me and asshole and then my mom and her sister pulled in the driveway which stopped the altercation. He was not happy but the moment that he saw that there were two other people there he decided that it wasn't worth it and left.\n\nMy aunt has called me and asshole for doing this so suddenly without my mother's approval, but my mother is actually thankful that I had done this because she is not one for confrontation. So AITA?\n\n\nP.S. I'll be posting pictures if some of you wish.",

      "description": "So I don't date. Like almost never. Since high school I've had two girlfriends and maybe a dozen first dates. All of them end in disinterest from either her or me. From my perspective the women that I attract are not the highest caliber or class. So here I am at 40 and my life resembles a Steve Carrell movie. \n\nSo when I start talking to a girl on OKCupid my expectations were low. We flirt and her lifestyle as a submissive is not appealing to me but she's actually a great conversation. Let's call her S.\n\nAs we text and flirt she sends me pics that get progressively dirty. She even sent them while I was at work and my boss saw one over my shoulder and dropped his laptop.\n\nEventually she found herself a \"Joker to her Harley\" as she put it and the texts and pics tapped off. She moves in with him. But, the J &amp; H relationship was wholly unstable like its namesake and collapsed quickly.\n\nShe ran to me for comfort and solace. And to her ex husband for the \"craving for a master\" as well as a place to live.\n\nShe loses her job as a hotel maid unnessecarily having walked away from being groped instead of reporting the guy. When she finally does they fire him but since she walked without explanation they would give her job back.\n\nBeing unemployed she falls back on her masseuse career and gets busted for having her license expired. She needs $200 to renew or she's completely out of options.\n\nI meet her for the very first time and give her the cash to help her out. When she showed up she's so nervous that when I handed her the bills she was worried that she would be arrested. I asked, why? No one cares. I tell her it's not a loan and there are no strings attached just use it to get on her feet. (I really had no designs on her)\n\nShe gets back to her massage business and starts making some good money. \n\nThe Joker returned and swept her off her feet again. She moved back in with him. This lasted even less time than before, when she breaks again she can't move in with her ex husband because he found himself another submissive. The two do not want her there. On top of that while trying to earn a little more she took a job as a personal assistant to a disabled person that turned out to be a fraud. He'd made her deposit a payroll check that she had deposited into her bank, withdrawing that money and depositing it into his account. By the time the $5k xheck bounced the guy was gone. The bank was going to press charges on her if the funds were not returned.\n\nI had a vacant room and offered her a place rent free to get her on her feet. I even build a bed for her out of spare 2x4s.\n\nWhile living here she and I would talk, flirt. She had no qualms about nudity and once just for punctuation to a conversation she dropped every article of clothing in two seconds flat. While she is far from being unattractive physically she still lacked the one and only thing I look for in a woman.\n\nSo months go by and she finds another guy and another guy. Dating both at the same time. Both end fairly quickly and after six months she's still not working. I floated the idea of finding her own place after she finds a job at a weed dispensary. \n\nThat's when she tells me she's pregnant and she doesnt know whose it is. She can't even find one of them. She would much rather stay here since she feels it's a safe place.\n\nMy other roommate at the time, let's call him D, had become friends with S and smokes out front together just outside the downstairs bathroom. Shortly after saying she pregnant I did not mean to eavesdrop, I just had to go to the bathroom. I overhear D ask what she's going to do with the baby. S replies, \"I'm not pregnant but he won't kick me out if he thinks i am\"\n\nI kicked her out. She claimed I was heartless, she had nowhere to go but didnt budge. I never let on that I knew she was not pregnant. I just knew that if she didn't go then she would never go. She left. Blocked me on FB and began spreading lies about me in her posts.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA Using \"You\" Incorrectly, Checking out in the middle of a conversation",
      "description": "I was in conversation with my partner, and we got to the talking point about the Midwest, United States. What started the argument was when I said: \"When you decolonize your education, the Midwest is a lot more interesting than what we are told in school.\" To their reply, they said that \"Why are you blaming me?\" To that point, I realize that I messed up my grammar. I used the wrong pronoun. I should have said \"one\" or rephrased the statement to be a bit more general. Using \"you\" made it more of an attack than a generality. When I tried to explain this, they said \"You do this a lot though,\" and then pulled out their phone and basically left the conversation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey shut down like this a lot. My first attempt to backtrack and explain myself just fell on deaf ears. It felt like I basically had to beg them to get a response for some kind of feedback about what I said. After one more attempt, I got them to open up about this pattern in my behaviour. They went on to say how there are a few types of speech (academic, business, etc.) and that when we are not aware of how we are speaking, it really comes out to be attacking, especially when I used \"you\" in the first statement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realized that yeah, I probably just did come off as attacking. My conundrum here is whether I am the asshole because I put no forethought into how I said what I said, whether it was just of them to shut down in the middle of the conversation because I said something rude (and they don't owe me an answer), or whether shutting down is a ploy to just bait me into being in the wrong while I try and defend myself in terms they established. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brain hurts thinking about this tbh. Going over this interaction hurts because I feel like I do not have the energy or mental ability to see all angles. They shut down so often in somewhat serious conservations that I feel I cannot state my case without being a bit bias. I could really use some help. Thank you for your time in reading my troubles btw ",

      "description": "I recently downloaded Tinder to see what all the hype was about. I wasn’t really seeking a deep, meaningful relationship. In all honesty, I was just bored and wanted to see if I could meet someone interesting on the off chance that I hit it off with someone. \n\nI wasn’t aware that females are supposedly very in demand on the app. Within minutes, I had a bunch of likes which kind of overwhelmed me. I swiped right on maybe 5 guys and had a conversation with 3. We exchanged numbers/social media in order to converse and I guess get to know each other better? I deleted the app right this. \n\nAll of them want to meet up with me sometime this week, but I honestly don’t feel a connection with any of them. I don’t click with any of them, and I simply don’t think I’d be a good match for any of the guys I spoke to. They all seem very nice, and all my messages to them were also polite and friendly. I didn’t flirt or give the impression of wanting to meet up/have a relationship. However, the fact that I was on tinder maybe have conveyed a different message? \n\nI feel like I’m really awkward when it comes to turning people down. So I’ve just resorted to ignoring their messages. I feel kind of shitty about it, but I figured I don’t owe them anything. I know I agreed to meet up initially, but only because I didn’t know how to say no. I don’t want to waste their time or mine by going to a date, having them spend any amount of money, only to not have anything come of it. \n\nI’m considering just blocking them all, but would that make me an asshole?

      "description": "I'll start by saying I (23f) already feel like an asshole, but maybe you guys can set me straight. Last night (friday night) my bf (21) played a bar show, he's a lead guitar player and he absolutely nailed it, it was a great show- everyone had a lovely time and we both got inebriated enough to where we couldn't drive home. We got to my house at about 12:30 fooled around for a little bit and then I went to bed  sometime around 1:15. I was drunk and tired and I had also worked that day I wanted to go to sleep and he wanted to play Apex with his friend on my PS4, fine by me! I let him play my PS4 whenever he wants to. Since Apex came out, he plays a lot. Every time he is at my house which is  very often  he plays at least 4 to 6 hours worth of Apex. Almost every night that he stays at my house he's up till at least 2am but usually three or four. I can't stay up that late. So anyway I'm asleep and he's in the room right next to me maybe 7 feet away talking in a normal conversation tone with his buddy online. the room next to me doesn't have a full wall dividing it so I can hear him as if he's in the same room next to me. I've adapted to sleep through him talking but if I'm being honest I never sleep that great. I am a light sleeper by Nature. So here's where I need your help. Last night I wake up in what I think is the middle of the night but I look at my phone and it's 5 in the morning. I have to be at work at 9 in the morning. My first thought is that he doesn't know how late it actually is. He doesn't usually stay up that late. So I get out of bed and walk over to him. I'm half drunk and half hungover, I have a headache and in general I don't feel that great. He's having a great time laughing and being very animated with his friend. I asked him if he knows that it's 5 a.m.( he later tells me that he did know) and I tell him that he should come to bed. He can't answer me because his friend is on the other side of the mic so I go back into my bed. He tells his friend to hang on and he comes over to me and I reiterate what I said once again. He agrees and then goes and turns off the PS4 without even saying goodbye to his friend. This is when I felt like I had done something wrong. I wanted him to come to bed but I wasn't requesting he get off the PS4 immediately. I usually snuggle him in bed but I just felt in general shitty and we both just fell asleep after that. I got the feeling that he was disappointed and I hated the feeling of being like his mom. He's still sleeping and he probably will be until about one or two p.m. \n\nDid I make an unreasonable request,? Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "For context we both drove home from our shared apartment in another state because one of his family members are on their deathbed. I'm saying at my parents house and we drove in his car, but he rented a car when he got here with his family. I've been home this morning/afternoon because he said we would watch the shows we usually watch together every week over skype. Apparently he had to get his glasses fixed so he said he'd be ready in an hour. Then this happened. \n\nBasically this is what occurred over text \n\n&gt;Him: hey do you want to go to this Japanese supermarket for valentines day in FarTown(a town that's an hour north of us)\n&gt;Me: ok!\n&gt;Me: wait that's so far away why in FarTown?\n&gt;Him: a large number of interests converge there lol, I wanted to go there for food but I also left my headphone at Jack's house so I need to pick them up, and I also have a secret valentines day reason...but if you don't wanna go I can do all that tomorrow or something lol\n&gt;Me: what did you have in mind?\n&gt;Him: nvm I'll just go by myself probably\n&gt;Me: ok\n&gt;Him:I mean if you wanna tag along you are free too *funny emoji*\n&gt;Me: I mean I do wanna spend time with you but I don't know what saying yes to these plans means which is why I asked\n\nThis city is right next to NYC so I wasn't sure if these secret plans were going to be **surprise! we're going to the city!** or **surprise! we're hanging out with my friend**\n\n&gt;Me: Just cause if I'm picking you up it's an hour to your house and an hour back to mine\n\nI'm trying to work on building my self-esteem right now so I mentioned my thoughts here because I felt like he might not be considering how any trip might be magnified by this distance. I felt bad about it though because he is the reason I'm here in the first place, but also I feel like my time is valuable too. \n\n&gt;Him: I mean if it's too inconvenient for u I can just go by myself it's ok *shrug emoji*\n\nI got nervous here because he used the word *inconvenient* which seemed loaded since I've been telling him I wanna be there for him through this grieving process\n\n&gt;Me: Ok I'm not gonna go then. It's not inconvenient I just don't like saying yes when I don't know what we're gonna do lol. Are you gonna be busy on Valentines Day then though or just gonna do it tomorrow? Cause I do wanna spend time with u on valentines day *heart emoji*\n\n&gt;Him: For the japanese supermarket I was gonna take you to the chocolate shop embedded in the store but I'll just get something when I'm there since you apparently don't trust me enough with surprises\n\n&gt;Me: Ok I mean I trust you it's just ambiguous I was like if we're going to the city I'd wanna take out cash. Since it's a far ride I wanted to know if it was farther lol\n\n&gt;Him: you can watch (show out of the 3 that i care most about) if you want I'll catch up some other time\n&gt;Me: what about (the two other shows he's more into)\n&gt;Him: they can wait till I'm in a better mood\n&gt;me: ok\n\nLike I said before I'm trying to work on my self-esteem and I don't know if saying no was the right thing here or if that made me an asshole. If he asks again I'm probably gonna stick with not going because I've already changed my answer to no in the text. I tried to show him that I care and wanna hang out for valentines day. I want to know if I'm the asshole because I'm trying to learn the line and how to say no to people. \n",

I always replace what I eat but then the cycle repeats.\n\nI've asked my roommate to just find other places to keep his junk food so I'm not tempted. And he tells me rather condescendingly to just learn to control myself.\n\nI'm trying. I've stopped grabbing junk food at the impulse racks by the register at the store, and I've gotten really good at only buying the things on my grocery list. But in the late night when the sugar cravings hit if I know there are sweets in the house my willpower fails me.\n\nI don't think I'm even asking too much of him to just start storing his junk food in his own room instead of the communal cupboards. We don't have bug problems or anything that would limit where things can be stored.\n\nMost recently I just replaced a package of cookies I inhaled and he yelled at me to stop eating his food.\n\nAITA here?

However though, I’m a bit concerned. I’m Arab, and I’ve lived in Arab countries, and even gone to Abu Dhabi myself. People there are not accepting. They are absolutely against the LGBTQ+ community. They arrest gay couples. Just so holding hands with a person of the same sex can get you dirty looks, and with boys,  it can get you attacked. Aside from the discrimination, the country is really beautiful, and the experience is great. He sounds really excited about the trip, and I don’t want his experience to be ruined. \n\nWIBTA if I warned him and told him to be a little discreet about his sexuality during his time there? Would I sound homophobic? \n\nI just want him to be careful. ",

From the moment he walked in he gave me a weird vibe. \n\nAnyways, at the time my phone had a corner “popping out” if that makes any sense, like I needed to take it somewhere to fix it so the screen would be even. I made a comment about it to me neighbor and this guy went “I can fix that!” Takes my phone and presses on it HARD, aaand my screen shattered (and mind you Im a broken college student living at home) he just gave it back to me “I tried” I was LIVID. His aunt was completely horrified. At this point Im like “leave it, dont make a scene at their house, we’ll have to deal with it later”. We sat at the table and his aunt goes “you know you have a job and should help her pay for the screen you shattered” he looked straight at me and went “yea, maybe in her dreams” WTF? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? I didnt even ask for help! At the end I just left after dinner and was able to save some money and fix it myself. My family wasnt happy about it but we’re thankful I wasn’t rude to anybody. They simply asked me to be friendly to the guy for our neighbors.\n\nEver since, he messages me on fb or instagram at least once every couple of months. For the last 4 YEARS, he tries to get me to come to NYC, or his “art shows” in miami, etc. I never reply and he is always trying to play nice “hey I just wanna know how you’re doing” My neighbor is always saying he does that cuz they know he is attracted to me and feels guilty about what happened... and is not used to girls avoiding him. \n\nMy friend thinks I should be civil and need to move on from what happened. But I just dont want to talk to him? I wont even go to my neighbor’s if he’s there. And my family dont want me to block him to avoid issues with his family. I told him years ago I probably would never attend one of his art shows, not interested but he is still messaging me. (Some people want to tell me he is just being friendly or that Im being childish for not going to their house when he is there but I dont see it that way)\n\nAITA for ignoring him and not move on from the 2015 incident? Last month I got 3 messages from him and audio begging to talk to me and catch up, but honeslty I just dont want anything to do with him. ",

I ask why, she answers that the other friend lied (she didn’t). I try to talk reasonably with her to no avail. \nIn the end she cut ties with me on the basis that I was “being cold” to her, even though I wanted to be supportive of ALL of my friends.\n\nI [16f] met a girl [22f] on Amino after me and another person [17m] became friends in a public chat (which is now closed), me and him promised her to ‘protect’ the chat so it wouldn’t be banned off of the community. \n\nShe hit me up in PM about various stuff she wanted me to do and also complimented me on my amazing work on her chat room, we often discussed about our personal lives and mental struggles, you know, the usual stuff.\nShe had in that time confessed to me about her mental struggles with BPD. \n\nIt is a condition which one cannot control their emotions very well, to say the least.\n\nI assured her that it wouldn’t affect our friendship and in turn I confessed with my own struggles with depression and anxiety.\n\nAfter some time of everything being normal, for the most part, I started to notice how clingy and sensitive she was being. On multiple occasions she had thrown away friendships like they meant nothing to her, then would come straight to me about it, of course. I would ask why she did that and try to rationalize with her, but she never listened.\n\nThe time after this was just so depressing for me, she’d on every conversation we’d ever had since then was about how she wanted to die and how she wasn’t deserving of being loved, I always told her otherwise.\n\nAfter being absent from our chat and PMs for a while she told me she’d taken a bunch of pills, was planning on ODing. I tried to help her get to the hospital or get her help, but to no avail. She ended up, to my relief, surviving though.\n\nI was relieved beyond belief, however, she wasn’t the same after that. She was cold and, as I would describe it, heartless.\n\nI’ll skip until the REAL event.\n\nI got told by another friend [14f] that my suicidal friend had cut ties with her because she had accused her of lying about her schedule, pretty childish for a grown woman. So I cautiously approached her and asked her about it.\n\nOf course, she also now accused ME of being cold to HER, just as she had been to me for the past weeks. I cannot deny that I indeed had been a bit rude to her on the basis that she had shoved multiple amazing friends out of her life, then expected me to do the same with them.\n \nLong story short, we aren’t friends anymore after sending me a whole novel about how disappointed she was in me and  how she regretted my friendship with me. \nI sent one back, it was something along the lines of:\n“I loved our relationship and I would have done anything for you, but you were cold to me, lied to me, and excepted too much. I’m sorry you ever felt unwanted, because you weren’t. Goodbye.”\n\nThat’s pretty much it, but I do have to add that this was over the course of a few months and she had made several blogs on what happened in her life. \nOn two or more occasions she had used my whole name for everyone to see, without my consent as well as others’ , I refrained from ever releasing anyone’s name over the course of these months.\n\nI now have her blocked.\n\nAm I the asshole for letting her end the friendship.",

      "description": "Me and my close knit friend group of four other people have a discord server where we discuss pretty much everything. Lately we’ve all been drifting apart slowly and not posting as much as we used to, this is mostly because we now all go to different schools. \n\nWe’ll call everyone involved H, E, F and D. \n\nMe and F are the admins of the server, we can change roles and nicknames and basically everything. The others can’t do shit. Since discord servers can be easily customized with nickname changing of members and channel names it has become a little bit of a tradition to change up themes for the server every now and then. \n\nThese two guys, E and H are learning Japanese and at times discuss it in the group chat. I saw the opportunity and took it. I made an announcement asking people to vote yes or no on banning serious discussion of the Japanese language. The vote was determined by reacting on the message with emojis. \n\nThree people voted, E, H and I. They both voted for “no” and I for yes. I decided to meme it up a little and change the emojis around so Japanese was now banned. I set up the roles and nicknames to reference a type of authoritarian regime where discussing Japanese is forbidden. \n\nE gets mad at me and starts DMing me. The conversation can basically be summed up as him thinking that it’s fucked up that some people are admin and others aren’t in a group chat meant for friends. I can kinda agree with him there. \n\nI was in a voice call with D while this was happening and he came up with the brilliant idea that I should type “honestly I want everyone to be admin except D”. I say that and that I hate D very much. E goes “where tf did that come from” and when I tell him it’s a joke he says “this is not the right time to meme”. \n\nTHIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO MEME\n\nHe’s mad at me and goes on to tell me that he feels that I’ve been abusing my power as an admin with the theme changes and everything. He says that he finds it “totally confusing” and that he feels powerless. \n\nIn short he’s mad that 2/5 people in the friend group have admin powers and the rest don’t. He has complained about this before but never the theme changes. He complains about all this to me and never mentions the other admin and he tells me that “if anyone should be admin it really shouldn’t be you”. \n\nI feel like he has a couple of points but mostly I feel like he’s overreacting extremely. He seems angry and frustrated over what is, yes, the main form of communication between our friend group but also just a huge shitpost. Am I The Asshole?",

A and I talk over a small app because she doesn’t have a phone, and B and I text, so I sometimes exchange messages from A to B. \n\nOne day A was crying about something and told me to text B to get on the small app so they can talk. I asked her what’s wrong and she said, “You won’t understand because you’re not Christian.” I personally don’t believe EVERYTHING Christians do, but belief and understanding something are different.\n\nSo I give an “ok.” And told B to get on because A needed her. B got on and thought I was mad because A didn’t want me to talk to about the situation. So B asked me if I was mad and I said no. A and B I’m guessing talked about what A was sad about, and A messaged me apologizing for “not telling me”. I didn’t care and I told her it was her life and her choice, and that I’ll leave her alone to talk about her “Christian Thing” with B.\n\nThis was somehow offensive to her, and she told me that I ruined her day and that I was a brotherly friend but not anymore because I was rude and offensive. B then messages me harassing me for the same reasons as A.\n\nThey both blocked me and I’m still in shock because I honestly thought it wasn’t offensive, and that it was a stupid reason to be mad about.\n\nThey both mean a lot to me, so people of Reddit, am I an Asshole?",

      "description": "So my gf’s great grandfather has been in a nursing home for roughly 10 years now. He has sever dementia/Alzheimer’s, and is essentially a shell of a person. He can’t talk, he can’t eat, his mouth just stays open. There’s been no sign of any consciousness for years now. \n\nHe’s finally “dying” and her family has seen him 3x in the past week. She sent me a picture (1) of him the other day, basically just laying there with his mouth open. I feel bad for him, but in my eyes she was just showing me him.\n\nToday she sent me a few (3) pictures of her and him, then her, her grandpa, and him. Them smiling or whatever, him, obviously just laying there not even knowing they’re taking a picture.\n\nI said something to her along the lines of, “If we grow old together, I hope you don’t let that happen to me. That is absolutely awful, no one wants to wither away like that. I think it’s fucked up you’re taking pictures with him, because if it were me, I would not wish to be remembered like that. I wouldn’t want pictures of my dead brain inside my dying body, period. Stop sending me pictures of you guys it’s fucking despicable.” \n\nI know I could’ve been nicer about the way I worded it, I just think it’s disgusting he’s layed in that bed now for years without a conscious thought, and they’re all taking pictures together. I wouldn’t want to even be seen like that, and I think his wishes would’ve been similar.\n\nAITA?",

EVER spoken negatively about my wifes physical appearance. Not once. I am (was?) the luckiest man on earth in that department. Hands down.\n\nI have ALWAYS been self conscious about my looks.

      "description": "A little bit of a long post I'm sorry! TLDR at bottom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was visiting my local tabletop/boardgame store in our town with my ex (we're still good friends - were together for 3 years, known eachother for 6+ and broken up almost 2 - 3 months now) because there was a MTG tournament and thought we'd drop by for a moment to say hello. \n\nImmediately as we walked in we got greeted by a lot of people we all know, and proceeded to sit next to some friends who were playing. One of our mutual friends was playing against R, my ex already knew R and is sort of friends with him (the kind of friend you see at lot at gatherings with other mutual friends). We started up a conversation during their match because it was nothing too serious and they can play very well while holding a conversation. \n\nR asked in a little bit of a condescending tone \"oh hey so RJ (ex), this is your girlfriend right?\". My ex and I looked at eachother and I said \"it's a long story\" and he filled in with \"we're exes now, but still good friends\". R immediately responded with \"oh that's even better for me, that means I have a chance!\" with the creepiest smile ever on his face. I laughed it of and tried to turn the conversation in a whole other direction. \n\nAfter only half a minute or so my ex and I switched over to another table to \"annoy\" other people during their match, we weren't planning on staying for longer than 10 minutes anyway, just having some smalltalk. My ex eventually held a conversation with someone for a little time (talking about the trip to england they're on now for a MTG tournament) and I just looked at the match from another table. R thought it was a good idea to (literally) corner me and start a conversation, I already had some creepy vibes from him but the way he talked to me was so rude. \n\nA little bit of information: I fucking HATE playing magic the gathering, I've tried it, didn't like it, I'm a sore loser, it's all on me but I really HATE playing this fucking game, but I do like watching in and people can talk about how much they love it to me and I will listen to you for HOURS!\n\nDuring the \"conversation\" between R and I, the only thing he said was \"oh hey do you wanna play MTG sometime? Can I show you how to play MTG sometime? Can I give you some MTG cards then? \\[these are not the cheap cards mind you\\] Don't you want to play a quick game right now then, it'll only be 20 minutes!? When are you visiting the store again? do you come here often\" I (kindly) declined everything and told him I don't visit that often, only when I need painting supplies for warhammer and started fidgeting a little with my phone. He just kept going on, eventually I wiggled my way closer to my ex because I feel very safe near him and hoped he'd join into this conversation. \n\nMy ex is quite oblivious to signals btw. I tried signalling him that I really wanted someone to join this conversation, and eventually my ex and his conversation partner joined into our conversation. When they did, R just left?!? When my ex and his conversation partner started talking without me again R came back with.....  A WHOLE FUCKING DECK OF MAGIC THE GATHERING CARDS ?!?! Appearantly he went to the counter of the store and got one for me, even though I told him that 1) I didn't like playing magic the gathering. Heck even my ex and his conversation partner told him so (they've tried several times already)! 2) wasn't interested in learning magic the gathering more 3) don't want another hobby/game to play!\n\nWhen the conversation (finally) ended after I told my ex to his face several times \"hey RJ I really want to go, we should get going, we have more stuff to do this afternoon, we're running a bit late\" we still ended up 2 or 3 more minutes in the store. I told my ex that I was really uncomfortable talking with R (I almost whispered while saying this to him) and that he should've picked up all the signals I was giving him. He told me he was sorry that he didn't pick up on any signal. I said it was okay, but told him that \"R is really sending me some nice guy vibes and it's creeping me out a lot, I really want to go home\" , not knowing I said this a little bit louder than intended. R wasn't standing right next to us but could've heard us maybe. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for calling R a niceguy?   \n\n\nTL;DR : went to a local tabletop/boardgame store, started up a conversation person kept pressuring me into a conversation without other people and got me a MTG deck whilst I told him several times I wasn't interested in playing the game AITA?",

      "description": "My work provides free coffee. Bless. We brew it ourselves out of those pre-measured packets, have a variety of flavors and roasts, etc. It’s not the best coffee, but I’m not complaining about free. \n\nWe typically have 3-4 carafes out at once, each with a different roast and we leave the empty coffee bag in front to indicate what’s inside. I have my preference but will drink almost any of them. The thing is, the VAST majority of people making coffee will only use one packet when, if you read the instructions and apply a tad bit of common sense, you should actually use two. I thought it was just awful coffee for short while before I discovered most people just used one packet. \n\nSo, when I come in to get coffee, there is almost always an empty carafe, and I will take that one and brew coffee the correct way. I leave both bags out in front of the carrafe to indicate that it’s a stronger coffee so no one is taken by surprise. \n\nThe thing is, every so often, maybe one out of 10-12 times, all carafes are pretty much full, so I will take one and dump out the weak coffee, and replace it with the coffee I made. There are 300 of us drinking this coffee, so we go through a lot, so in my mind one dumped carafe isn’t that much of a waste, especially since they made it with only one bag.\n\nAITA for wasting bad coffee?",

      "description": "Boyfriend and I have been together 8 months. He was broken up with the ex for like a month before he and I became official. \n\nMy boyfriend and the ex don’t talk, as far as I know. But she’s still on his Netflix account.\n\nMy thing is, I feel like if you’re no longer in a relationship, you’d probably cut ties like this. \n\nMy boyfriend gave me the Netflix  password as well. But sometimes I get locked out of his Netflix because there can only be two screens going at a time. So my boyfriend, the ex, and I can’t all use it separately at once. That’s how I first found out she’s still on it. \n\nI asked my boyfriend why he doesn’t change his password and he sort of brushed it off and said he felt bad or something. \n\nI’m honestly annoyed. I can afford my own Netflix but it’s the principle, for me. It sort of bothers me that he would want to pay for someone who he’s not dating anymore. And he acts as if this girl was so awful to him as well, so it’s not like it ended on good terms.\n\nAm I wrong for pushing him to boot her out??",

      "description": "So there’s this girl who I used to be friends with, let’s call her G. For the past two years, this girl has been going out of her way to stalk and harass me. Some of the things she has done include showing up to my work and trying to get me fired, copying all of my outfits, down to my socks, following all my friends on Instagram and trying to turn them against me, and making fake accounts on Snapchat and Instagram to send me harassing messages under the hopes that it will make me depressed or something.  (They say things like “goodbye maowang99” and “why doesn’t she just die already”) I’m unsure of her motive exactly (and I’ve been to the police but they won’t do anything)\n\nThe issue I’m writing about is that she recently followed one of my friends on Instagram and has been liking and commenting on all her photos. This friend does NOT KNOW G at all and told me about this. I recommend she block G and she did for about 24 hours. The next day, they were following each other and liking each other’s posts again and making plans in my friends comment section to hang out sometime. I know I can’t dictate who someone is friends with, but I’ve talked to my friend about my feelings and how G’s reached out to other friends the same way and they ended up blocking me for unknown reasons and never talking to me again. My friend says I’m overreacting, and that it shouldn’t matter if she’s friends with G or not because nothing is going to happen. I ended up blocking my friend on everything, but a part of me feels like maybe I am overreacting. AITA for not trusting my friend?",

      "description": "So I (30 F) have been seeing Derek (26 M) on and off for about 6 years. We’ve never been in a committed relationship during this time. We’ve just been in a bit of a cycle of seeing each other for a short time and then things falling apart with me ultimately ending things or even worse just ghosting (I feel just disgusting about that behaviour, and definitely ATA for the majority of the time I’ve known Derek- this is important to the current state of affairs). \n\nA few months ago we started talking again and I really wanted to try and make something more than the weird quasi-relationship we’d always fallen into. So now, being fully aware of how shitty I was in the past, I have tried to make it clear that I am sorry for how I behaved, that I want to try for something more, and that I would not repeat my past actions. \n\nHe had agreed that he wants more but then really hasn’t made any effort to even see me outside of casual hangouts at his place. I’ve stressed that I need and want more than a sexual relationship, which again he  agreed he wanted as well. \n\nBad timing there, as he had a vacation planned and was away for a few weeks and he didn’t have time to see me in the few days before he left. So everything was put on hold. But, now that he’s been back in town for about a week he hasn’t made any effort to see me other than an offer to have me come over since I’d mentioned I was in his area on a jog (I declined this offer). \n\nI’ve been feeling like he’s just not that into me,  but when we talk about it he says that’s not the case. I recently pressed harder on it and he revealed that he has been very hurt by my actions and doesn’t really trust me but that he wants to and needs me to be more consistent for that to happen. I promised again that I was not going to repeat past behaviour. \n\nBut in our exchanges since this conversation I feel like he is being very dismissive and passive aggressive with me, snapping at me and making mean spirited jokes at my expense. I can’t shake the feeling that something just isn’t right. My gut is saying he just wants to even the score a little and that he is probably at least casually seeing someone else (I have no evidence of this other than me driving myself crazy). All of this has me feeling alone, rejected, sad and confused. \n\nSo that’s it then, AITA for wanting to walk away one final time because my feelings are hurt, even though I literally just promised I wouldn’t do exactly that? Help. ",

      "description": "Throwaway bc personal life. &amp; sorry for the long story..\n\nI am the oldest of 5 children. My middle brother (22m) recently admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital for drug use after a friend of his threatened to turn him in if he didn’t seek help for his addictions. Prior to this, he was staying with me, my husband &amp; my child for a little over 4 months, 3 of which he was unemployed, basically just mooching until I told him he HAD to get a job. Also, while he was staying with us, he stole from my kids piggy bank &amp; my husbands cash stash. He wasn’t aware that these existed until he searched through our rooms while we weren’t home. He has stolen from our parents and my other siblings on multiple occasions. \nAt first I was really proud of him for seeking help. I realize that the thievery May have had a lot to do with his drug problem; however since entering rehab he has continuously demanded that he be provided with unnecessary items for his stay at an inpatient rehab. And refused to contribute to a work program offered by the facility. The costs are reaching $10,000 for out of pocket expenses not covered by my parents insurance. \n\nMy dad has refused to hand over money for the treatment, suggesting selling what little assets my brother has to pay for his treatment. His thought process is that if getting well means that much to him, he will want to contribute in some way. \n\nMy mom on the other hand has resorted to guilting my other two siblings, 23 &amp; 19, who still live at home, into handing over their savings which they earned on through their own means. The 23 yo is saving money to move out on her own and the 19yo was recently released from prison &amp; is working his ass off to turn his life around and purchase his own car.  \n\nThe kicker is that this isn’t a loan type situation. She expects and they feel obligated to just hand it over without being paid back. I have talked to then both &amp; this isn’t what they want to do, they just feel like they have to.\n\nI told my mom how I feel about it, and she believes that I’m turning my back on him. I love him and want him to have successful and fulfilling life, but I don’t agree with the others having to pay for it. \n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I'm terrible in arguments. Palms sweaty, knees weak, puking spaghetti, whatever you get it. I'm trying to piece it together. \n\nMy brother's 27 and still lives at home. He's totally capable of moving out, he just likes saving the money. Fair enough, I guess. His gf has been telling him she wishes he'd move out, which he's ok with as long as she splits with him. She's still in college. She's 21, unable to pitch in much so she'll have to ask her parents for help. This is only important because he's brought it up to me 3-4 times, signaling that it bothers him. He always ends his complaints with something along the lines of \"if she won't do the hard thing and ask her parents for help then I don't have to do the hard thing and pay for my own place.\"\n\nJump to this argument. He was complaining again. I was just listening. Not my circus, not my monkeys. Complain all you want, friend. Except, he noticed I was quiet. I explained that he didn't ask for my opinion, so it's not my job to give it. \n\nThen he asks for my opinion. \n\nI told him he was 27, financially responsible and capable, and it was probably time to move out. It was probably time years ago. I think it's stagnating his maturity. It's a little weird he's still at home at this point, honestly. I told him all this, and the harshness of it was probably where I went wrong. He did ask for my opinion, so I gave it--that doesn't excuse being a dick if I was one (was I? I don't know...). \n\nHe got defensive. Went on a rant about how life isn't a checklist, how it's weird that I don't have a gf (had a really rough breakup a few months ago. Shit, you can dig through my post history if you want some background info), it's weird that I owe mom money for car repairs. He was trying to make a point (edit: the point that life isn't a checklist, and if it were I'd be weird too), but damn he didn't need to attack me. He claimed he was defending himself, but hmm ouch didn't sign up for that. \n\nHe was emotional. So was I. I tried to leave it at this: he clearly has a lot of emotion tied up in this and he has to figure out why. Further, I was hurt by his attacks (he insisted he wasn't attacking, but I felt attacked so what's the deal?) when he just asked for my opinion. \n\nIf you're asking me, he should've either respected my opinion or not asked in the first place. I feel he owes me an apology but I'm often wrong about these things. \n\nTl;dr:\nBrother (27) still lives at home, though he is more than capable of moving out (could buy a small house cash if he wanted to). He asked my opinion. I told him it was weird that he lived at home still. He got defensive, brought up my extremely painful breakup. It got messy. \n\nWas I too harsh to tell him it's weird or does he owe me an apology? Maybe both? ",

      "description": "I’m 17 years old and currently staying at my grandmother’s house temporarily. I’ve been in New York for 5 months and I was with my dad, but a CPS case was opened against him and I no longer feel comfortable there. My mom is a narcissist and pretty certifiably insane so my grandma is what I got right now. \n\nThe house has me, my aunt, grandma, and grandfather. I have to say, even though I’m not getting choked or called names here, it’s still fucking MISERABLE to deal with. \n\nMy grandmother, although very loving towards me, is the most neurotic person in the world and I have a hard time handling it. She’s not just annoying to me, she’s just annoying to people in general. She’s very neurotic as a person and easily worried and bothered. Almost everything becomes a lecture. I try my best to be the most patient about it, but she takes any request to be left alone as a personal slight against her. She’s very rigid in her thinking and has a thing with boundaries. If she doesn’t see me do something, it’s a lecture. Even if I did do it. If I don’t do something at the time she thinks I should do it EXACTLY THEN it’s a lecture. Like taking a shower. She weirdly times when she thinks I should take a shower.\n\nToday I went job hunting at the mall and she lectured me because she didn’t like that my shoes were a little dirty. This is when I was already out of the house so I couldn’t really do anything about it. I told her, in the softest way I could muster, “grandma can you please just leave me alone.” And instantly she took it as a personal attack and started lecturing. I ended up yelling myself out of just... frustration. Some due to her, some due to everything that’s been happening in my life. Even at the mall she’d constantly nitpick why I wasn’t dressed like the other girls there or every 3 seconds she’d try and tell me to hurry up eating. \n\nI love her. And I’m grateful I’m in a safe place now, but I can’t do this for too much longer. I don’t want her to know I hate living with her, but it’s just a lot to deal with every day. Especially with the other shit going on in my life. I feel guilty for feeling how I feel, but I absolutely can’t stand it. ",

      "description": "I have a relative ( 30F) who I used to be close to. Until I noticed she only contacted or visited me when she needed something  (most of the time money). She  has lost about 5 jobs in the past 2 years and therefore her resident permit has been revoked.\n\n There are steps you can take over here to get a proper permit but for some reason she doesn't want to take those steps, or is inconsistent in following the procedures to get through the process of getting a permit. \n\nHer siblings have tried to help her get through the procedure,  but she doesn't like their approach, their rules of living with them ( she is quite lazy and constantly on her phone during her stay there. She lacks the common sense to help with simple household chores for the sake of just helping out, while her siblings work full time,  so after work they come back to a dirty house and empty fridge) .  So they have kicked her out.\nAs of today she is with her third sibling where she will probably meet the same fate.\n\nGod knows I have tried to help her with everything possible to get through the procedure, and some basic information on how to keep a job, help with chores, behave when living rent free with someone else etc. I got sick and tired of it so I stopped having her over. (She behaves the same at my place).\n\nLast week I called to check on her about 10 in the morning. She was still in bed. During the call she received another call and put me on hold. When she came back on she told me that it was a lady from the organisation that is supposed to help her with her permit, a job and in the meantime some money to feed etc. She had forgotten about the appointment and was not dressed so she decided to call the lady back whenever she was available!  I was baffled!\n\nAfter the call I received a message from her if I could borrow her about 100 dollars because her prepaid electricity and gas were finished and she had no more food left. The house was cold because it's winter and there utilities were cut off.\n\nIn the past 3 years I have borrowed her a total of about 3000 dollars and never received a penny back. \n\nI forgot to mention that she bought the pastor of her mega church 2 smart tv's on a loan last year, each about 1500 dollars. She kept 'sowing seeds' in church because pastor said it will help her get a husband who will take care of her needs. When she decided to buy the tv's I advised against it because why would the pastor need someone else to do that for him while he has such a big congregation? She went ahead anyway. Pastor eventually refused to pay her back. I then advised her to get her tv's back and sell them to get at least some money to pay the loan back. She refused because it was the house of God. \n\nAnyway. To cut things short; I refused to give her money. I said no. \n\nNow I keep wondering if I did the wrong thing, because above all I had the money and according to her she was in the cold, and dark, without heater and food. I am just sick and tired of her getting into shit and then have others clean it up.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My birthday is coming up soon and we are currently in Las Vegas for spring break, home to some of the best steakhouses in the world.  Because I really enjoy steak, I picked out a first restaraunt to eat at.  However, when my mom found out I had picked a steak house with no alternative dishes, she got very angry, as she claims she cannot eat steak (she's not vegetarian, she just follows a strict diet).  I then changed the venue to a much nicer and more expensive steakhouse at the Wynn, but with vegetarian options for her.  I thought she would be happy, but she was extremrly mad again, this time complaining about the price.  Now, this steakhouse os definitely very pricey, with an 8oz filet costing $70.  However, we rarely go to these kind of restaraunts (last time we went to a resraraunt like this was last summer, and even then it was nearly 40% cheaper).  Money is not a problem in our family either.  Anyways though, I got sick of my mom rejecting restaraunts for my own birthday dinner so I basically told her that she can just stay home if she doesn't want to go.  currently, my dad and I have a reservation for two.  My mom has been yelling at me all afternoon for not accomodating her and being selfish.  AITA?",

      "description": "Over the years I've gotten closer to my coworker as we both progressed through our careers. She is extremely smart and always willing to help whenever I was \"stuck\", so I built up a dependency on her as we progressed together. Late last year we began meeting on the weekends to play tennis as she was always looking for a partner to play with, and we'd go to lunch afterwards and just generally hang out; that is when I started developing feelings for her and wanting to see her more. I didn't want to complicate our close work relationship; but I couldn't control how I felt, either.\n\nI decided to stop being so available since I wanted these feelings to go away, but she kept persisting asking if everything was okay. I finally decided that I needed to know where she stood but ultimately found out that the feelings were not reciprocated :(. In a sense I felt a lot of relief because it meant I could move away from this emotional attachment I had towards her, but I also wanted some real distance away in all aspects (ie. weekend meets, work emails/messages, text, etc.) to facilitate that removal. She wanted to continue the friendship and tried in the beginning to talk like nothing happened, but it was sometimes difficult for me since the feelings lingered, so I ultimately stopped responding in the supporting way that she was used to. That caused a snowball effect where she stopped responding as well and it has now deteriorated our once close friendship to now of just purely coworkers who talk only about work and only when necessary. We no longer just \"check in\" to see how the other is doing, and any conversation lacks the emotional depth and support it once had. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still think she has a heart of gold and is an overall great person, but towards me she is cold and indifferent and I probably deserve that in someway for causing all this in the first place. I never told her I wanted the distance since she seemed really persistent in not talking about my feelings, so I just never got the chance to explain my perspective.

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. When we met, his recent hook up body had faked a pregnancy and miscarriage after he tried to break things off. It was a bad situation, and he really tried to do the right thing and take her word for it. Indisputably, it came out that she was lying. Fast forward 3 months and he and I are dating and I discover I’m pregnant. He and I are really into each other and want to date but it’s still veeeery early in that process. I also believe my recent transition to a new pill was the culprit and feel responsible for the situation. I’m on a medication that would really fuck up a pregnancy so I’ve also been clear that I wouldn’t follow through with an accidental pregnancy. He and I also had that conversation, that we both would choose an abortion. \n\nSo I consider telling him but the lying ex still feels very fresh at that point. It just feels like a cosmic joke that I’m now pregnant. So I make an appointment for an abortion and tell him I’m just getting an iud put in (which I do) which explains why I’m tired and sore when I see him that week. \n\nOk fast forward 3 years and we are probably about to break up. It’s sad and hard but we had a good run and it’s just normal break up shit. But, I still have never told him about the abortion. It just always seemed like the wrong time, like I’d be fishing for sympathy. And now it would really feel that way since we are breaking up and I am probably the more broken up about it one. \n\nI suspect I should be ruled an asshole for never telling something he had a right to know. But now I’m not sure if I’d be more of an asshole for bringing it up just before he goes off and starts a clean slate.\n\nTldr: I got an abortion very early in my long term relationship and didn’t tell my boyfriend. We are now likely parting ways, AITA for not telling him even now? ",

I may be biased because my dad is well, my dad, so I want an outside perspective. I'm not asking if my dad's the asshole, I'm asking if I am for being on his side. \n\n Today he got into a stupid argument with a woman working in a small boutique shop selling different products. He picked up some rye bread and tried to read how much rye was in it, but couldn't find the info. He asked the woman and she said she didn't know. He then got annoyed and said \"that's cheating\" about the bread (talking about how lots of breads are advertised as rye but it's just sugar and wheat). The cashier said \"you can call the company and ask yourself\" \n\nAt this point my dad started using a pretty confrontational/rude tone and told her she could call the company and ask. He didn't SAY anything rude, but his tone was. She got pissed and told him he shouldn't be so rude. Then she walked away and my dad said he just tried to ask a question. \n\nI got pissed at her too because I don't think that's how you should treat a customer. I've worked in customer service and she should've either told him she unfortunately couldn't do it. Instead she accused my dad of being rude. That's so unprofessional that I started talking behind her back (she could probably still hear me) about how she could get fired for treating a customer like that. She didn't even have any other customers. I feel for her but also I wish she would've not insulted my dad. \n\nAITA for taking his side and talking badly about her? ",

      "description": "To preface: I'm a guy, 17. My friend, X, is 18.   \n\n\nSo I've been friends with this X for about three years, but we don't see very much of each other because she dropped out of high-school at the beginning of the year, about six months after she enrolled at my school. We've hung out a couple times, and once she brought one of her friends with. I was fine with this, and we all went to the theme park together. Now, X doesn't live at home anymore - teenage grievances with her mother, who I'm on good terms with. Her mother, takes buys these tickets for us, partly because she just wants to see her daughter more often, and because she wants to make sure she's got some friends like me - the kind my grandmother would call \"the good sort.\"  \n\n\nSo the theme park was fun and all, but her X's friend is kind of upset that I'm there, and she thinks I'm a bit of a downer since I didn't want to smoke. She kind of put a dampener on the night to be honest. All in all, however, it was fun and I talked to X about how she was going and all that, gave her some advice and went home, but I didn't really like her friend.  \n\n\nWe decided to hang out tonight at Timezone, and we've got plans to get some food and just walk the city - it's Schoolies time here on the Gold Coast, with all the year 12 kids who've finished school drinking and partying, among other things.  \n\n\nShe texts me, about half an hour ago, and asks if she could bring \"J\".  \nSo I explain to her that when she brings her friends I kinda feel like a third wheel, you know? She says she understands and it's okay, because he's just gonna play some games.  \n\n\nI tell her I'm not sure, and ask who he is.  \n\n\n\"Ahaha my boyfriend.\" ^(oh boy)  \n\n\nNow, I know what some of you are thinking - I admit that I \\*do\\* like her, but I don't really think she's the right girl for me. ^(That's all I've got to say about that.)  \n\n\nI tell her that I think I'm gonna give it a miss, but she says that he won't come then.  \nI tell her not to let me stop you, and to have fun.  \n\n\nI think that she's now under the impression that I want to be more serious with her, you know? I just think that it would be like before if she was bringing a friend, and it would be even worse if it was her boyfriend.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

My bf made a passing observation to the effect of, “you’re working on your little project huh?” I told him that calling them my “little” projects felt a bit demeaning and tried to explain asking how if i asked him the same thing about his “little research paper” he may not appreciate it. He said that this was unfair because it is in fact a “small” project. \n\nSituation/example 2: My boyfriend likes to throw his dirty boxers at me. He knows this grosses me out and i think thats why he continues to do it. Today i couldn’t find our car key and he was joking about how he hid them at the bottom of the dirty clothes bin. He got a big kick out of picturing me rooting around in the dirty clothes looking for them. I asked him why he gets such a big kick out of doing this to me and imagining such a scenario and let him know if felt degrading. He immediately turned quiet and then went on to say we each do things to each other that we dont like for fun and saying its degrading is harsh.\n\nAITA for bringing these feelings up?",

      "title": "AITA for not being happy by being surprised with a non-running, junk yard car for Christmas?",
      "description": "Hello. So this just happened and I'm feeling very conflicted. I feel terrible, but at the same time justified, so I need an outside opinion.\n\nI got a call from my boyfriend of three years this morning. He told me he had a surprise for me, that my Christmas gift came early! I was excited because I told him that I want a tattoo for Christmas, that was **all** I wanted and asked for - nothing else. I was thinking that he had set up an early tattoo appointment for me and was about to tell me the time and day. Instead, he told me that he bought me a car.\n\nIt came from a junk yard auction, he got it for only $800. He said it does not run, and he doesn't know the exact condition of it, nor does he know the history of it (whether it's been crashed before, mechanical history, ect.). Basically, he doesn't know anything about the car other than it's a 2000 Rio. He is good at fixing mechanical issues with cars - however he already has three other broken down vehicles that he's trying to fix at the moment. After telling me all about it, he asks \"are you happy? Isn't this great?!\"\n\nHowever, I'm not happy. And it isn't great. Because the thing is, I don't even have a driver's license. I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE! I'm planning on getting my license in a couple months, but what use would a broken down car bring me? Other than taking up a spot in the driveway? I don't have the time, resources, or knowledge to fix a car. And neither does he! However, even if I **did** have a license - he told me that he wouldn't feel comfortable with me driving it! That he would drive it for me, to places I need to get to. So, not only does it not run, but if it did I wouldn't be allowed to drive it. Further, my parents are the ones who want to buy me my first car. That's a memory they and I want to share together. I feel like it's going to rob me of a milestone memory with my parents. So not only am I disappointed, but I feel my parents are going to too.\n\nOne last thing, is that I absolutely hate people buying things for me. My mind is wired weird, in that if someone (or even myself) buys something for me, I get **extreme** feelings of remorse and dread. I can't sleep at night because my mind is raging with thoughts of disappointment. That is also why I asked for a tattoo, since it's not a tangible thing and something I will actually cherish for life, I don't feel dread or remorse. But now I'm feeling**so** terrible, because I don't want to and (mentally) can't accept this gift of a car. I'm going to dread it and hate it, even though it's such a thoughtful gift. I'm not sure what I'll do. I told him I will accept it, but he said he is just going to go and ram his truck into it and he is going to stop trying to do anything nice for me ever again.\n\nOh, and a good thing to add. This isn't the first time he has done this. Ever single Christmas or birthday, he asks his parents for a couple hundred bucks to buy me a present. He then goes and buys a present that is intended for me, but in all reality, it's for him. Like my most recent birthday, he went and bought me a gun. Not only am I underage to own that particular type of gun, but I'm deathly afraid of guns and never want to be around one, hold one, or shoot one. He however is a gun fanatic! (It just turns out that my present was the exact gun he had been wanting too). He's also bought me a guitar, the one **he** wanted, even though I don't play and don't have a want to learn. Everything he has bought me just goes straight back to him. This is just another one of those things, I feel.\n\nI know I probably hurt him by not being excited, but I cannot fathom why in the world he would buy me a car. I've told him numerous times that I do not want him to buy me a car (since he's tried this numerous times before). I want to buy one along with my parents. A car I actually like, and one I can trust too! I don't want some random beater car, that I would be scared to drive, and be disappointed in. \n\nSo, AITA for not being happy getting a junkyard, non-running car? Or is HTA for buying me a gift I told him numerous times not to get me, ignoring the gift I actually wanted, and expecting me to be excited and want it?",

Shes a 10/10, not even exaggerating she could be a model if she wanted, shes from brazil and is studying to be a teacher like me.\n\nMy friend is a cool guy, known him for years. But hes also a womanizer. He frequently \"dates\" girls just to dump them after a few months when hes bored. He is also a cheater, both on his girlfriends and with other guys girls. Hes had \"conflict\" with several boyfriends because of this and ive had to bail him out at least once.\n\nSo anyway im trying to get with this girl, we flirt everyday after class and eat lunch together, its going good. My friend sees us in the campus cafeteria and approaches us. He sees this girl and sits with us, and he starts doing his bullshit. I can already tell.\n\nShe and him laugh a bit but then he leaves after i give him the evil eye. After he leaves the girl asks how long we've been friends and I just instinctively say:\n\n\"We met a long time ago in highschool. He was bullied a lot by other kids for being gay and I stuck up for him. We've been friends ever since.\"\n\n\"Hes gay? Thats so sweet of you for helping him though. Youre a good friend.\"\n\n\"Ha, yeah hes a good guy. Its nothing, i just cant stand bullies.\"\n\nSo yeah im full of shit but we've now been on two dates. I told my friend that i told her he was gay and he was pissed. My reply is that you wouldve just done your thing and moved on. He says now he feels awkward around her. Hes not gonna tell her i lied (if he did my plan is to say hes still in the closet and that hes lying) because we're bros but he thinks im an asshole.\n\nI figured, hey, at least i now have a relationship with her.

      "description": "I've worked at a bar for several years now. Recently, the staff there have started to notice the management were not pulling their weight. For each shift, there is only one duty manager, but we have multiple managers working each day. They all frequently disappear and give themselves easy roles during busy shifts.\n\nAfter seeing this re-occurring over multiple shifts, I raised it with a manager during a shift. Explaining to them what had happened using examples from that shift. They then organised a meeting with the boss. I explained to him that even the new staff had reached the consensus that the managers weren't pulling their weight. He called me a liar, said that I had an attitude problem and that I was being negative.\n\nThe next day, the boss came up to me in front of another staff member and snarled \"Good luck paying your rent with no shifts!\" I am seriously thinking of finding a new job.",

We get around, save good money and all is well financially.\n\n(Oh and I have a masters degree and she a bachelors)\n\nNow the issue is that her job is incredibly boring, we’re talking stare at the wall for 8 hours a day boring and sometimes she has to answer a phonecall. She’s definitely showing signs of a boreout and has been repeatedly ordered to stay home by her doctor to combat the stress and anxiety. \n\nNow obviously this is an unworkable situation and she’s got to find a better job. It probably won’t even be difficult to find a similar paying one.\n\nHowever the last couple of months she’s been very interested in make-up, and she’s going to follow a course on this next week (no previous experience).\n\nNow she’s got it into her head that being a beautician is the most magical job in the world and she feels like she won’t be happy doing anything else, despite it being equivalent to throwing away 12 years of hard work and her degree. \n\nI can’t seem to reason with her that taking a giant paycut and massive loss of stability (beauticians are dime a dozen in these parts and are treated as highly expendable) isn’t exactly acceptable to me. \n\nI’ve tried to give her friendly nudges in different directions but to no avail, she’s got this utopia in her head and that’s it.\n\nTL;DR\nAm I the asshole for standing in the way of what my gf wants to do even if it might highly compromise our financial stability.",

      "description": "So I've lived in my apartment for 9 months now. It's absolutely perfect except for one thing: my neighbor's barking dog.\n\nMy neighbor lives in the building next to me, but our buildings are connected and we share a wall on our kitchens, dining rooms (although I use mine as an office), bathrooms, and bedrooms. Their dog barks nonstop in their kitchen and dining room when they're not home, and as a consequence I have a hard time focusing on my homework when I get home from class. If I make the slighest noise in my kitchen, the dog goes off for hours after so I feel like I'm walking on eggshells in my own home because of their dog.\n\nI left a note for them for the first time a few months after I moved in. It was after 10pm and the dog just wouldn't stop barking which I felt was ridiculous. The note wasn't aggressive, I even suggested the dog might just be bored. I said I know it's hard to know what your dog does when you're not home so I cut them some slack, but I did remind them about the quiet enjoyment provision in our leases (and I'm in MD so this means landlords have the duty to control their tenants' noise).\n\nAfter about a month, nothing had changed so I put in a complaint with the landlord and the barking stopped for about a week. Then it started back up again. I put up with this for a few more months, and I put in another complaint with the landlord because it was obvious they weren't taking any steps to solve the issue. Everyone got a letter from the landlord that said the next time they get a complaint about the dog, the person whose dog it is gets a 30 notice to evict. I found this odd since I told them specifically what apartment it was coming from so I don't know why every apartment got a letter.\n\nThe dog never stopped. I don't want to get these people evicted because of their dog, so I left another note for them. Non-threatening, basically the same as the first note. But I again told them I'm going to have to complain to the landlord if it doesn't stop. \n\nThe dog stopped for about a week again, but now it's back to the usual. I've put up with this for so long I don't know what else to do. I don't want them to get evicted, but they clearly don't care about the noise their dog makes.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I put in another complaint with my landlord possibly resulting in their eviction?",

      "description": "Now I'm not a particularly passive person, if I see something I think is wrong I tend to point it out. Stand up for what I think is right and all. Now when this young girl started working with us I wasn't sure where I stood with her. We have a small workforce, only about six people, so I work in a close environment with her most of the day. She can be moody and very rude and negative unless you catch her on a good day. \n\nNow she's about nineteen and some of her behaviour I put down to her being very immature for her age. She seems to want people to see her as this badass, edgy, straight talking person who doesn't care what anyone thinks of her. I suspect she cares. And I've learned after getting to know her better that her home life is not the best, I have reasons to believe there may be some level of abuse. She told her her mother once threw an ashtray at her and punched her hard enough her face bruised, then giggled about it. I told her it wasn't alright for anyone to lay hands on her and she started crying. So I hugged her and told her if she ever felt unsafe then she could call me and I'd open my spare room to her. Since this incident I've been trying to be understanding of her sour moods and have been paying closer attention to her good qualities. She's very funny for a start, though I like blunt and sometimes harsh humour - as does everyone else in the workplace. She can be kind, when she's not trying to act macho, and she's a hard worker too. \n\nWell we were having a cheerful debate at work over something unrelated and this girl steps in saying we should debate other things. Then, in an act I can't help think is designed just to draw attention, flatly states that she's a racist and we should debate about that. We ask questions, obviously, and she comes away with things like \"I hate Pakis. If there's a Paki on my bus I'll get off at the next stop and catch a different one.\" and \"If one started working here I'd quit.\". She also takes the time to clarify that by \"Paki\" (I'm sorry about the slur, I'm just quoting her) she didn't mean specifically anyone from Pakistan, but actually meant \"anyone brown\", namely Middle Eastern and Indian people. The first thing I said is that I think that's disgusting behaviour. She defends her opinion saying that when she was young her uncle said if she misbehaved he'd put her in a black hood and send her away to them. I argued that, though that's disturbing, it doesn't justify her words or actions. \n\nBut everyone else was quiet and my manager tried to diffuse the situation by sort of going along with her. Basically telling her 'yeah, we know you don't give a fuck. Your opinion's your opinion, it's whatever'. She tried a few times to encourage conversation about it, saying that she doesn't care if we think she's an asshole and that she's not going to lie about what she thinks. But after a while nobody said anything, it was awkward. And again, I'm not convinced that she doesn't care what people think and part of me wonders if this is some weird, pathetic trick she's got to try and seem edgy. Either to get attention, bad or good, or to push people away. \n\nI can't exactly psychoanalyse her so I won't know exactly what's behind it. But it bothers me that work is just going on as normal and that everyone is joking around as normal. I've remained civil but I feel bad about laughing when she tells jokes. And the other day she was standing in the rain waiting for the place to open so I let her sit in my car with me until our boss arrived. I had to attend our works' Christmas night out and she danced with me on the floor. On one level I worry about her situation and have started getting along with her, but one part of me wants to completely disassociate from her and only speak regarding work. I already voiced my opinion, I'm not sure what else to do. \n\nSo am I being an asshole here? Could I be doing more?",

It really made me hate going home sometimes.\n\nMore important background information: my EX and my GF both share one experience in their upbringing, their moms (stay at home moms) took full care of the dogs and all the kids had to worry about the dogs was playing and loving them enough.\n\n\nnow the situations im wondering about:\n\nwith my EX:I had dated and lived with my ex a while back and one of the sore spots was the dogs we had. Before we moved in together I made a point to tell her that I would not live with any pet that didnt live in a cage i.e hamsters, fish, whatever; that means no dogs, no cats, no capybaras, none of that. she agreed to my condition to not have any and we moved in together. flash forward a year and she starts chaffing at the idea of not having a dog. she starts trying to convince me to consent to get a dog, it goes on for a year before we start having heated discussions over having a dog. i finally say \"Fine get a dog but its all your responsibility, I will not help at all with its care and if it starts affecting our apartment then youll have to get rid of it\" she agrees to this and a day later we have two terriers. She starts off great, taking them to vet appointments, walking them, cleaning up after them, playing with them, all that. Then grad school starts, her job starts giving her more responsibilities, and all of a sudden the dogs arent being taken care of. I mean poop in the kitchen, pee in the carpets, barking out of boredom and ripping up stuff. I point it out to her and she asks me for help. I just reply with i told you so and tell her its not what i consented to. This continues all the way to the end of our relationship with a fight over getting rid of the dogs thrown in.\n\n\nwith my GF: I gave the same pet conditions to my current GF as I did with my ex and she agreed. So far we have lived together 2 years and no hiccups. Then last year it repeats itself with my current GF, almost exactly the same situation as my ex. I finally get sick of \"talking\" about how its not fair she doesnt have a dog; I consent only if she takes full responsibility for the dog, and I dont have to deal with it; she fails to do so and asks for help; I tell her I told you so, and she gets angry about my not helping her.\n\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for uninviting my son and granddaughter to Thanksgiving dinner because he couldn't commit to arriving by a certain time?",
      "description": "I have a 32 year old son and a 4 year old granddaughter. We live in the same town. He is a 10-15 minute drive away. Even though this is true I see my son maybe once a month (or even less sometimes) and my granddaughter on the same or lesser frequency. So obviously getting together on Thanksgiving was important to everyone. It's something we do every year almost without fail.\n\nHis mother also lives here and he spends a lot of time with her. My son is no longer \"with\" the mother of his daughter, but they share custody and spend quite a bit of time together as well. Her entire family lives in the area or surrounding area too.\n\nFor the week before Thanksgiving I had asked my son what his plans were for the holiday. He said he wanted to come over for dinner, but wasn't sure what time he'd be able to arrive. I told him we'd eat around 6:00 or 6:30. Whenever the Dallas Cowboy football game had ended. Other guests included my wife's son and daughter and two graduate students from the university I work at. Nobody else.\n\nHis plans for the day consisted of picking up his \"baby mama\" from work (she doesn't have a car) around 2:00 or 2:30, getting his daughter and her other children from her grandmother's house, going to his mother's house where they'd eat a meal, driving everyone back to the baby mama's grandmother's house after dinner, potentially stepping inside to eat some of her food, then maybe even driving the baby mama back to her own apartment. *Then* come to my house.\n\nI sent him a text saying Happy Thanksgiving and to arrive before 6pm. He texted back \"Not making any promises. Thanks for being flexible.\" followed by another text saying \"Would you rather not see me at all?\" and more words about how he had told me several times already his day was super packed. He said he'd try and be on time, but wasn't sure if he would or not.\n\nAfter some deliberation I replied that my wife and I would like to see him and his daughter on another day. His reaction was to call me a prick and go on and on about how wrong it was for me to take back our invitation just because he couldn't commit to being there before 6pm. I told him I didn't want our dinner interrupted by him and his daughter walking in mid-meal. He was really upset and I haven't talked to him since.\n\nAm I the asshole for doing this? Is he an asshole for not committing to being there by a certain time?",

      "description": "I (26F) have 2 main groups of friends, a group that I've been friends with since high school (call group A) and a group of friends that I've known since I was 19 (call group B), and I have one best friend who is part of both groups with me. We do many things with both groups of friends, but it's always been seperate, simply because both groups don't really know each other that well, and wouldn't really mix with each other and a few girls out of each group don't really get along. \n\nQuite a while ago, a girl out of Group B planned a night of drinking at hers, unfortunately my partner was out and I couldn't find anyone to look after my children that particular night so I had to decline. The day it was planned for came up and a girl out of group A messaged us all and asked if we wanted to meet up that night but same as above applied and I had to decline, another girl had suggested they could come to mine instead so I said you're more than welcome, so some of group A came to mine for a couple of hours for a mini catch up.\n\nSomehow, the people from group B found out and they are not happy one bit that they didn't get an invite. It's not that I purposely missed them out, but it's how its always been that we always do things seperately with each group, and as far as I assumed they had plans anyway. Things was said, and I explained sometimes them lot do things and don't invite us but we're adults and that's what happens. \n\nI feel like I've been sucked back into high school times, and feel like its 15 year old me and something daft.\n\nAm I the asshole?

      "description": "So last night my boyfriend and I went to dinner and then had a walk around the park. While on that walk a stray dog run up on us and my boyfriend kicked it. Yes the dog was aggressive and would have probably bit us. But he kicked it right in the head, at full force. It all happened so fast too. But the more I thought about it the more it pissed me off. Because I live dogs, and that kicked could have severely damaged that dogs brain. \n\nSo by the end of the night I was angry and my boyfriend sensed it. I told him off and told him he was a jerk for that. He could have pushed the dog away or just scared it off. He didn't have to kick it like a goddam soccer ball! I told him I wanted space and would order myself an uber. He walked away confused and upset. I texted him this morning but he hasn't responded. That's not like him at all. Did I go to far \n",

I spent my childhood visiting his family, but never felt accepted and always felt like the outcast. \n\n\nAll that to say that I never had a stable family environment and I think that led to me not having any real strong bond with family, including my sister. \n\nI don't even care to be there immediately after she has the baby, or really be involved in anyway. \n\nDo I have any obligation to care? \n\n\n",

I apologized profusely and said I would tell our building manager that it was my fault, because he was worried about getting kicked out.

      "description": "So my gf was out of the house for a few hours today and I decided to surprise her by tidying up and doing some laundry. \n\n\nI almost a had enough bath towels for a full load but decided to throw in a few kitchen towels (used mainly to dry dishes after rinsing) to complete the load. \n\n\nNow here's the thing, I know she washes her kitchen towels separately when she does laundry, and often will not have enough even for small load. To me this is inefficient and wasteful but she insists it is unhygenic to mix them with the other towels (even though I wash them on hot with plenty of detergent).\n\n\nI know she can be a little ~~anal~~ ~~ocd~~ structured about these types of things, but I honestly didn't think it would be that big of deal. Boy was I wrong. Instead of being happy to come home to a clean house as I had expected, she was really upset with me bc I mixed the towels, saying that I know that's not how she does it, and how now she has to do them over again. \n\n\nUnfortunately this is a common dynamic in our relationship, where instead of appreciating that I helped out with something, she gets upset that I didn't do it her way. As a result I feel unappreciated and she probably feels that I don't care enough to always do things to her exact specifications or preferences. \n\n\nEdit: I'm not sure it makes a difference but I am diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD and I suspect she has at least some level of OCD as she tends to be a control freak. Other than when my impulsive behavior clashes with her need for structure, we get along fine. \n\n",

      "description": "So for the past week i've been dealing with depression and anxiety. I take medication for my anxiety but not my depression and i feel like the intervals between depression is too large to warrant me getting medication for it. -\n\nBecause of our work schedules (me working night shift at a factory and her working 8am-5pm at a gas station most of the time) we don't get to talk or see each other much other than on weekends. We sit in a call with me on my bluetooth ear peice all night but she's a sleep for all of it except to say goodnight. -\n\nI've been feeling really lonely because of my depression and missing her as usual. So i asked her if we could have one night on the phone (Wednesday) to help me feel better. I'd get up early at 4:30 or 5pm and we be on video call to talk and just be with each other even if it's not in person. She said yes she would. -\n\nWednesday came around. We got on the phone. We were on the phone for maybe 30 minutes when she said she was going out to eat with her mother. (That plan was already set) and she said we would call me back when she got home. I said okay and have a good dinner. We said our goodbyes. -\n\nAt some point she asked her friend to meet her and her mother there. And her friend did. Then they decided to go out to a bar. Then got really drunk and decided to take a 2 hour one-way trip to go to a hookah bar. And then to another bar to drink some more. -\n\nThat upset me because she said we could have one night during just that week to help me feel better and she decided to go get drunk with her friend instead. I feel like it hurt even worse because i've been depressed. -\n\nWhen I brought it up to her (over text that same night while she was in the car on her way to the hookah bar) right after the 4th time she kept telling me to go get meds or a therapist (which she knows that i've looking into my mental health and agrees on a normal, not drunk, day that i don't need them), she told me that she can't help me as much as i want her to (which one night on the phone was the one and only thing that i asked for her help with, that she agreed to do) -\n\nWhen i just came out with it and made my point as clear as possible that she said she would do the one and only thing i asked for her help with and she decided to go out drinking and hookahing with her friend and how that hurt me. She asked me why i'm trying to make her feel bad and that she does care about me. -\n\nThat made me mad because i feel like she says that more than not when i state how i feel about anything that she does or says that hurts or upsets me. -\n\nIt was at this point that I gave up. She didn't (and still doesn't) think she did anything wrong. I didnt even get an apology. (I brought it up again friday but that's when she gave an apology, after I mentioned that she didn't even do that. That night i just derailed the convo with the small talk like how are you and stuff and just stopped texting her when i got to work. \n\nTell me.. AITA? Do i have any right to be upset/mad? ",

She always has some drama with a different family member and has kept my cousins away from all of us, growing up. \n\n\nEvery holiday or special day in our lives, have been basically celebrated separately because she causes huge fights between us all and she’s just a negative vibe in general. My cousins, sister and myself have left it to ourselves to become close now that we’re all adults and they don’t let their mother dictate their lives anymore (well as much). So we are very close and love each other very much and see each other as much as we can. \n\n\n4 years ago I got into a serious relationship with the love of my life, my aunt hated him instantaneously just because she’s always hated me. He’s been the most amazing person and all my family loves him except for her. He proposed to me yesterday in Aruba (I know I know he’s just so romantical, I’m very lucky). Now of course naturally I tell my family, including my cousins and they all cry with me of joy. But the thing is that now that I’m going to get married, I refuse to let her come to my wedding and try to ruin it with her hatred and negativity but I really want my cousins to be my bridesmaids. AITA if I don’t invite her but have my cousins as my bridesmaids ? She might just even try to ruin it by stopping my cousins from being my bridesmaids and try to be evil even if I don’t invite her.",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nA bit of backstory: My friend, I’ll call him Fred, would hang out with this girl, we’ll call her Wilma, in high school during junior and senior year. He’d spend way more time with this girl than with his guy friends, even though they weren’t even dating. She sibling-zoned him (essentially a friend zone but treating him like part of the family, “you’re like a brother to me” kind of thing) super hard but he wanted a relationship. He put up with being on the hook for a long time and would even regularly ask us for advice of what he should do. We all told him to end it and get over her because she was treating him like shit. Fred didn’t take our advice (a trend with him). Anyway, summer break of junior year happened. We come back after break and she has a boyfriend, even though she explicitly told Fred that she wasn’t ready for a relationship. Still, Fred continued to hang out Wilma despite that and our advice. \n\nWhen prom rolled around, Wilma took her boyfriend and Fred took Wilma’s little sister (kinda weird). My friends and I never saw him that night even though the rest of us were hanging out with each other and our dates. But he wasn’t part of our group. For our senior trip, Fred was always with Wilma and, again, never hung out with us. A whole week-long trip and we never really saw or hung out with him. That was the norm anytime they could be together, but he eventually stopped talking to her and they went to different colleges. Cool beans.\n\nFast forward 4 years and they start talking again. This was \\~8 months ago. I think she contacted him and they hit it off. She was finally ready for a relationship and he hadn’t ever really gotten over her, I don’t think. So they start dating right before college graduation and that’s great. Good for them. But over the last 7-8 months that they’ve been dating, my other close friend and I have only seen Fred like 8 times (all of us live no more than 15 minutes apart from each other), and most of those times are for scheduled events, like weddings or parties that mutual friends have thrown. Even though we try to do stuff with him (he always declines), he never makes an effort to hang out with us. Or if he does, he never follows through with his own plans. We’re kind of pissed off now, because one of our best friends for the past 7 years is hardly a friend anymore, and we’re pretty sure it’s indirectly Wilma's fault. Wilma is cool with us, so I don't think she's actively discouraging him from hanging out with us, but she's the main reason he's not.\n\nAnyway, he’s popping the question tomorrow and I’m assuming she’s going to say yes. He’s asked me twice now if I want to be in his wedding, and I’ve just said, “Uhh, maybe. I haven’t made up my mind yet.” He’s fully aware that we’re not the biggest fans of Wilma and that we think that them dating for 8 months isn’t enough. He’s still proposing. My friend and I have had siblings do very similar things that ended up in separations/divorces so we're worried about him, but Fred doesn’t like taking our advice or even entertaining it. \n\nSorry for such a long post, but AITA for not really wanting to be in my friend’s wedding given all that?\n\nTL;DR Best friend got friendzoned by a girl in highschool. 4 years later they start dating. My friends and I never see best friend and we don’t really care for the girl. After 8 months of dating, he’s proposing and has already asked me twice if I’ll be a groomsman. I’ve said “idk, maybe,” hinting to him that I don’t really want to be in his wedding. AITA?",

Now I've never been a huge fan of Christmas, ever since I was young. It just has so much pressure on it to be magical and wonderful when it never has been in the past. I've told my dad that I'm not big on Christmas in the past and he's dismissed me as being \"too cynical\". \n\nThis year was no different. I enjoyed my presents but I wasn't giving everyone a hug everytime I opened one like my little brother was. One of the presents I got is a sweatshirt with someone on it that conflicts with my political views (I won't say who it is  or why I dislike them, to avoid any political arguments). I tried to smile and thank him, but I think the smile came off as rather fake. \n\nHe asked me about it later and I admitted that I didn't like said politician all that much, but I did like every other gift he got me. He got very upset about it and tried to argue that I believe exactly what he does, which I disagreed with. We moved on. \n\nToday, I thought I might try to show him what I believe in politically, since he tends to be interested in that sort of thing. He, however, took it as a personal attack (I promise, I was as nice as possible when I brought it up) and screamed at me that he already knows everything about said political views. I disagreed and tried to give him a source, but he insisted that he knew more than any \"stupid source I dug up\". He then started rehashing old arguments that we've gotten into and said that because I'm so much younger than him, he knows more than I do about everything. I \"don't know anything about anything\", according to him. \n\nAs someone who does research in the areas we were talking about, I was hurt. My research is supposed to be published in a scientific journal within the next two years, so saying I don't know anything really hurt. \n\nI talked to my mom and fiance for a while and put some thought into it. I have clinical depression so my dad yelling at me and calling me worthless made me feel very worthless and unloved. I felt like killing myself, which is something I haven't thought about in a while. \n\nI found a plane ticket online for $600 and plan on leaving Saturday, only one week before I was originally supposed to leave. He is very mad and screamed at me for that. \n\nAITA for wanting to leave early? I feel bad, but I am honestly worried that I may injure myself if I stay longer. I am very depressed right now and would like to be with my mom, who makes a clear effort to value and respect me. \n\nTL;DR: my dad and I got into a huge argument and he called me stupid and worthless. I want to leave his house a week early, which makes him furious. ",

She feels exhausted every day and feels she cannot even put any effort into our relationship because of this.\n\nI made the comment and she agreed to set up her mother with SSI because she is physically and mentally disabled now.

      "description": "I’m a graduate student with an internship in the public sector. Yesterday I found out that my boss had called my department head and said I’d been doing good work, but I had excessive absences and tardiness. Here are all the instances of me being absent or tardy this semester:\n\nJan 14: I bought a parking pass for school and I had to go to the office the first day of classes and pick it up. This was the only day I could do it because I was working or in class 9-5 every day when the school’s offices were open. \n\nJan 18: I forgot my badge and key at home, so I went back and picked it up. This is the only time this has happened, and I’m now diligent about keeping my badge and key in my purse and checking before I leave. \n\nFeb 4 &amp; 5: I had a cold that was bad enough that I went to the doctor to make sure I didn’t have the flu. \n\nFeb 12: I was six minutes late to work. No excuses, I’d slept through my alarm. I have trouble sleeping and I scheduled an appointment with a sleep doctor March 1 to make sure this doesnt happen again. \n\nThats it. I’ve known she’s very strict on time—she once told me “if you’re eight minutes late, if you’re two minutes late, you’re late.” But I’ve worked my ass off for this internship, turned everything in on time and I’ve gone above and beyond on the work. Each time I was late, I stayed late to make up the time. I’m actually ahead on my hours. \n\nMy biggest fear in life is being a disappointment and to hear that she called my department head and he had to talk with me about it sent me into a panic attack. I was very apologetic, took responsibility, but I do wonder if this was really enough to call my department head over?",

      "description": "So work with this guy who I cannot stand. I have been stuck sitting in the cubicle next to hm for almost two years now. For context, we are both guys. I’m 28 and he is a few years younger. He is very annoying. He has this super smug personality and is constantly trying to prove to everyone how smart he is. He is constantly telling awkward jokes that only he thinks are funny. He doesn’t pick up on social cues and often makes people around him feel very uncomfortable with comments he makes. I just generally don’t really like him.\n\nTo keep things civil at work and because I am forced to sit next to him, I’ve always been somewhat kind to him, but not overly friendly. He is also the type that is so desperate for people to like him and makes many people in the office uncomfortable by trying to force them into a friendship with him.\n\nPart of me feels bad for him because I know he is probably just insecure and lonely, but every time I try and give him a chance I am just reminded by how much he annoys me and how little I enjoy his company.\n\nSo last year on my birthday I come in to work and this kid had gone out and bought me a cake, a card, balloons, and a $50 gift card. It was way too much and I tried to give the gift card back but he wouldn’t accept it. I knew he was only giving it to me so he could later try and blackmail me into hanging out with him.\n\nSure enough he has been trying to convince me to hang out  after work like every week for a drink and I really don’t want to and I say no every time. It’s really awkward because he just won’t take the hint. He is relentless. \n\nThen he starts buying me lunch all the time. Like he asks me if I want to order food and I tell him I don’t want anything. Then he just orders me something anyway and leaves it on my desk. When I try to give him money for it he refuses. \n\nI just hate feeling like I owe this guy something when I don’t want any of this stuff he is giving to me, let alone his friendship.\n\nSo his birthday is coming up in a couple weeks and he literally came up to me yesterday and asked me to plan his birthday party. He told me he wants to go out after work with a bunch of co workers and he wants me to plan everything and get everyone together\n\nI told him no. I said trust me you do not want to give me this responsibility, you will only be disappointed. \n\nHe took this very poorly...like I thought he was almost going to start crying. Then I remembered all the stuff he did for me on my birthday and I am starting to wonder if I’m just being a dick. Am I the asshole?",

So  yesterday, he messages me to help me with his account while I'm playing with my main friend, so after I finish a game I message him back. He wanted to play with me, so after a brief attempt at trying again, I obliged so he could stop asking me.\n\nSo I told my main friend I ahve to go do something, but he was confused at why I suddenly had to go, so I made an excuse to go. After an hour of playing with the other friend, I said I had to go. I then played with my main friend for around an hour or 2 before I went to bed. \n\nThe next day, the other friend tells my friend about how we played togetther for a bit (us three go to the same school and they are in the same class), and now he's angry that I lied to him. I've tried to tell him I only did it so I could play with him, as he knows we always play together and he rarely plays with the other friend too (mainly because he doesn't like him after the other friend called his team crap).\n\nI was intending to tell the other friend that I can't play for a while since I have to concentrate on exams and revise so I can play a bit more with the other friend, but after telling the main friend the reason he won't listen to me.\n\nI know I should've been honest, but If I had told him the reason he would have been angry a bit for ditching him.\n\nSo AITA in this situation?

      "description": "Let me preface this by saying that I'm not a computer or IT professional. I just know my way around a computer.\n\nSo about a week ago I was asked by my brother's gf to help find a laptop for university. I was given a list of specs and a budget. The laptops that the university recommended were under spec'd and over priced and from my experience, sometimes buying second hand or demo models give you better specs, quality and value. \n\nSo the university recommended spending roughly 1800 USD ( I'm not from USA), which was more than she was willing to spend. I was asked to find something at around the 1200 USD price point, and so I started to check around.\n\nI sent several options that were way better spec'd and closer to the 1000 USD price, but received no response. \n\nFast forward to this week, I was sent a picture of the new laptop. Under spec'd and coming in at the 700 USD price point. \n\nNow I feel like they've gotten the impression that I was trying to mislead them by recommending a higher priced laptop even though it was had better specs than what was required and was lower than their budget amount. Kinda bummed out about it.\n\nTL;DR was asked to find 1200 USD laptop, I recommended a good option at 1000 USD, they found a terrible one at 700 USD and may have the impression I was trying to mislead them.\n\n",

The Waze folks, I get paid via the app, the others just Venmo me a few dollars per ride. \n\nI’m up from with them that I’m doing it mostly to get the HOV lane for the drive home, but the extra money covers gas, for which I’m thankful.  \n\nOne of the regular riders asked if a coworker could join us, and offered to have her pay the regular rate.

      "description": "I started my Erasmus experience in October 2018. I met 2 guys and a girl of my same country but from different cities (they are all from the same city expect from me that I live far away from them) and we became friends. Especially with the girl, we just clicked, you know when you meet someone that thinks like you and you don't even have to finish a sentence because they are thinking the same? It was our case. Soon enough I got intimate with her. The problem was the she had a boyfriend. She cheated on him for 2 months with me, she never told him anything. After a while she began to tell me that she loved me and wondering how she would have done without me when the Erasmus would have been over. During the 2 months I always told her that I couldn't see her as a possible girlfriend because she never told her boyfriend the truth and I could never trust her in a relationship, especially in a long distance one. During the winter break we both came home for Christmas and although what she said to me she had no problem sleeping with him and posting stories on Instagram with him. It was at this moment that I realized that I was in love with her and I was suffering a lot. After the winter break she told me that she chose to stay with his boyfriend and this crushed me, I could barely go to the same class with her but after a week I accepted it and managed to be friendly with her. But after a week or two we became intimate again. I told her that I accepted the fact that we couldn't be together because we want different things anyway, she wants to get married and have children in 2 years, she is 24 and I'm 22 and thinking about these things is just too early for me. I told her that I would be happy if she found someone to start a family with but that I couldn't be her friend if she did that with her current boyfriend. Yesterday she met him (she has a long distance relationship with him) and today she told me that she didn't leave him so I basically said goodbye to her and to never text me again, the reason is that I'm scared of what she could do to me, a \"friend\", after what I saw her doing to her boyfriend for months, I told her that I don't have friends that I don't trust and of course there are still feelings involved because I'm not over her yet. Another thing is that her bf started to suspect about me and I just don't want to encourage this enormous lie, I tend to be as honest as possible in my life and I think that it's not possible to have a healthy friendship with her anymore. \nSo am I the asshole for cutting her off? I didn't block her or whatever, I just told her to never text or call me in any case, even if someday she had to leave her bf because she already made a choice and I told her months ago that I would have done this.\nThoughts?\n",

      "title": "AITA for calling a gay guy out for using his sexuality as an excuse to say vulgar things?",
      "description": "This happened about 4 years ago but my life hasn't been the same since. It has kept me from going to the bar that had been my only social outlet for years. This is because the guy in question is one of the very high status bartenders there.\n\nIt was the early evening. Only me, the bartender I had a crush on, and the gay guy, also a bartender there but not working at the time, and on the patron side of the bar. I had been bumming cigarettes from the bartender. Eventually she asks me if I would walk across the street to buy her a pack. I was going to, but acting like I wasn't too thrilled.\n\nThen I see the off the clock bartender start to walk up. I had already noticed from prior interactions with him and mutual friends that he liked to say vulgar over the top things to his girl friends. It was his gimmick. And he would always make a show out of it.  And they seemed to enjoy it. \n\nAs he was walking towards us, I knew it was coming. Something vulgar. Something only he could say.  I could tell he knew the situation. \n\n\"Oh you should totally buy her a pack of smokes! She can blow smoke rings out of her pussy!\" \n\nThere it was. True to form. She playfully agreed with his sentiment. I said there you again with your get out of jail free card. He said, aw are you mad. I didn't say anything. He said, aw he's mad! Then he did something that I thought was a show off of his social status and meant to humiliate anyone who did not like him. Something meant to infantilize me. \n\nHe pulled out his phone saying, he's mad! Snapchat! It looked like he was taking pictures of me to post on his snapchat. I was very taken aback. I said what are you doing?? Please don't take pictures of me. He said, aw he's madder!  It seemed like he was enjoying how he could take additional pictures of me more upset. \n\nAfter he eventually put his phone away, I just stared at him in disbelief for a couple minutes as he sat at the bar a few chairs away. The bartender was washing dishes with her back turned I think.  I later end up walking with the bartender to the gas station across the street and buy her a pack of smokes.  I expressed how mad I was that the guy took pictures of me like he did. She, like all his girl friends, found his vulgar gimmick endearing. She said, aw he just wanted to be seen with me. \n\nI return to the bar a few days later. This time he's behind the bar. I sit down next to some regulars I'm friendly with. I ask for a beer. It ends up being a beer with a card suit underneath the cap, which if I guessed what it was, the beer would be free. I only knew this because the regulars I was sitting next to told me as he was opening bottle.  So I made a guess.\n\nWhatever it was I don't remember, but I do remember him making a show of my incorrect guess. He loudly said, Nope! And then slam dunked the cap into the trash next to him. The regulars I was friendly with laughed. I said, there you go, being an asshole to me again. He said, no sir, you were the asshole. I said what?? You took pictures of me saying oh he's mad! The girl sitting next me chimed in and said she didn't see any pictures of me posted on his snapchat, which did relieve me.\n\n I then ask that he bring me my credit card receipt for the one beer I got, obviously saying I don't plan to order any more. I say to him and the regulars sitting by me I don't feel welcome here. He brings me my credit card receipt. I just sign it and leave, feeling completely rejected and shunned by the place that I loved. No one said anything as I left. His social status was and still is sky high.  It was like they were on his side by default. \n\nMy social life never recovered. I deleted my Facebook about 2 years ago. Most of my friends on there I met at that bar.  What hurt the most was my best friend who I met there and hung out with outside the bar eventually stopped calling to hang out. \n\nFor years now, when I get home from work, I drink a tall can of high alcohol 8 percent beer and take either melatonin or sleeping pills. I think I might as well, I no longer have a social life.  I feel like that guy established I was the asshole and made all the bar patrons shun me. The handful of times I go back since this all happened about 4 years ago, I don't feel welcome.  \n\nAITA?",

The first time was just weeks after my boyfriend and I got together, when she texted him saying she missed him and the old times. He told her he wasnt interested. This happens over and over, she texts him, she confesses she still loves him, he rejects her, he blocks her number, she gets a new number. Again and again for three years. \n\nFinally, my boyfriend just changes his number. Things go silent for a year, but last week she added him on linked in and sent a flirty message. I think the problem is he is too nice when he rejects her, just saying that he loves me and would like her to accept that. I have never gotten upset with him about this, because I know he's not cheating. However, I think enough is enough and I want to respond to her on linked in and politely but firmly explain that she needs to get over a relationship that ended 10 years ago and never contact my boyfriend again.

I realised that this feeling about my parents wasn’t particularly meaningful, and I would get over it after sleeping on it, but my girlfriend then got upset that she wasn’t able to successfully comfort me enough to stop me from being grumpy.\n\nWe end up getting into a minor argument because she had exhausted her efforts to try and cheer me up but I remain to be in a generally melancholic mood. My argument is that I feel I just need time to get over it and be cheery again, I can’t simply snap out of feeling a bit down. I suppose she might feel either like she is failing in what she might see as her role as my girlfriend to cheer me up, or perhaps she feels unappreciated herself by me and got frustrated. But I don’t think I can just decide to start being cheerful and forget about being upset with my parents. And I don’t want to just effectively lie to her and pretend that yes I am now all better even when I don’t feel it myself.\n\nI can understand why she’d be frustrated, but AITA for not being able to just cheer up?\n",

      "description": "Sorry about the click-baity title, but it's a fair assessment of my intentions. Brace yourselves, it's a long one.\n\nSo last year, I finally built up enough funds to be able to buy a condo. I started looking, and I found a place. I made an offer above the listing price in cash, it was accepted immediately, and I called my lawyer, wrote a check, and thought that was that. But, I soon got a call from the seller (a woman who's in her mid 60s), telling me that someone else had shown interest in the place, and had made an offer above mine, and that she hadn't signed the contract yet, so I needed to make a higher offer if I still wanted the place. I backed out, and wished her luck, as I do not want to be in a bidding war, and hung up. Immediately, she called back, and confessed that she had made the whole thing up in an attempt to get a bit of extra money out of me, and begged me to come back. So I agreed, on the condition that she include the furniture with the condo, which she agreed to.\n\nAnd then, she started requesting that she could keep a few select pieces. Just a few things here and there, and I agreed to each one. And then more. And then more. Finally, I'm left with literally just a pair of custom made barstools. But I'm still going for the condo because at this point, I've sunk too much money into my lawyer to amend the contract about a dozen times for her additional amendments, and I just want to move asap. \n\nAt this point, a full month has passed. This is important because there is currently a tenant in the place, paying about $2k a month- rent that would go into my pocket as soon as I own the place. Meaning, I've already lost $3k because of the seller's procrastination, plus the additional losses of the furniture promised, and the lawyer fees. One of the reasons the seller had such trouble selling was because she has a tenant in the place now, and no one wanted to take on the lease- luckily, I manage an apartment complex, so this was the opposite of a problem for me. However, the rent was why she kept delaying, and delaying; she wanted to milk as much money out of the deal as possible. (The tenant is awesome, in fact he's a friend of friends, so he's nothing to do with all of this- it's only the seller with whom I have an issue.)\n\nMy lawyer contacted the seller's lawyer, asking the seller to provide the seller's disclosure, which is standard procedure, especially since I wasn't asking for an inspection, as she had promised to provide one upon our initial agreement with the place- I had that in writing. She adamantly refused, so I backed out, again. She then provided the seller's disclosure, but I only came back in on the condition that I could have an inspection, since this behavior made me think she might be hiding something. The inspection set me back a bit, and revealed that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the place; same with the seller's disclosure. I don't know why she made me waste this additional money, although I suspect it was another way to waste time; at this point, it's been 2 months, so I'm effectively out that $4k that I expected in rent.\n\nNow, we're in the final dregs, and I'm excited to go ahead and move my stuff in. I ask seller when she'll get her stuff out- and she doesn't want to take it out until March, 2 months after our expected contract signing. Now, that's fine by me, as long as she pays rent for the space that she's occupying (I said I'd be fine with like $100, seemed comparable to storage units in the area), as she would no longer own the property, and I would be liable for any damages caused by her stuff. She vehemently refuses to pay any rent, and told me that I had it wrong- that I would have to pay her rent for her to keep her stuff in my place... Yeah, I don't follow that logic either. Anyways, I told her to move her stuff out before we sign the contract, and she pulled the ultimate card: her mother is ill, bedridden, and seller cannot leave her mother's side. I said ok, fine, you can keep your shit in the place that I own, for free, for two months, preventing me from moving into my own place in a timely manner. She'd get her stuff out at the same time as the tenant would move out, so it didn't inconvenience me too much. It just added another half a month to the contract time. I'm out $5k, now. \n\nOh, and apparently, the master deed was written wrong- an issue that she was required by law to fix before listing the place for sale, or for rent. So, I had to get the deed amended, and purchase hella expensive title insurance. Please note- she refused to fix the issue herself, despite the fact that she could not legally sell the place as it was. Cost me another half month. $6k.\n\nI then ask my lawyer when we're going to sign the contract. He gives me a date, in 2 weeks time. I ask why it can't be now. He tells me, and I quote, \"Seller has left the country on vacation for two weeks\". I ask where her mother is- you know, the bedridden mother whose side she could not leave for 2 hours to clear her shit out of my place. Apparently, the mom has been in hospice care this whole time. Ok. Great.\n\nSo, it's finally time to sign the contract. I'm sipping coffee with my lawyer, signing the papers, laughing about the crazy bitch, and then, we get a call. The seller wants my lawyer to draft an addendum to the contract- that she had already signed the day before- that I would not take her stupid barstools, and that I would not steal any of her furniture. Now, remember, my lawyer has done all of the work for all of the amendments to the contract, costing me way too much money; I have made all of the concessions- hers has yet to do anything, and she has yet to make a single concession. So my lawyer politely tells her to do it herself, and she finally does, and I sign it, because I'm done. I ask my lawyer about the keys, and he tells me that the seller will give them to me herself, according to the contract.\n\nThe money has already left my account. I own the condo, woohoo.\n\nI contact the seller as soon as I'm out of the office, and she informs me that since she lives a few hours away, she can't give me the keys immediately. I tell her I'm actually headed that way this afternoon, for work, as the apartments I manage are in the area. She informs me that she has actually lost the keys to the condo, and as for the garage, the opener is programmed into her car- she doesn't have a fob. So, I cannot get in to the place that I own. I tell her to get a new fob programmed, and to find the keys. She tells me she doesn't know how, because she's just a helpless little old lady. I tell her I'm going to get a locksmith to put new keys in the place, and she tells me that's illegal- I kindly inform her that I own the goddamn place now, so it's very much legal. I told her that I would need her to come to the complex and open up the garage door, so that I could have somebody else program a fob for me, and she tells me she can't, until March, because of her mother (lol that again). I ask her what her plan was for giving the new owners access to the place that they would own when she listed the apartment, and she hung up on me.\n\nI went to the tenant, to inform him I'd bought the place. He happily gives me a copy of his key and congratulates me on the apartment, but then tells me that seller had asked him to pay his rent for February early, and had told him that she was no longer going forward with the sale. I don't blame him for being a responsible tenant and listening to his former landlord, so I ask him to call her, and get the check back. Instead, she offers to- and I'm not joking- cash the check, and give me the cash, minus a 'processing fee'. I inform her that that would be against the contract, as that rent payment does not belong to her, despite her request for him to pay her early, as she is no longer the landlord. She starts screaming at me, telling me that I'm accusing her of stealing- I kindly remind her that she made me sign a paper saying I wouldn't steal from her as a last minute addition to the contract, and that she was using the space of MY condo that I OWN for free, and that her delays had cost me $7k in rent that I would have gotten from the tenant, and that I had just given her a gigantic check, that she had just cashed. She hung up on me. \n\nThe seller is going to come on March 1 to the condo, to move all of her stuff out. She won't come before then, and according to the contract, she cannot come after then- as of midnight, anything left in the condo or garage will be mine. So, my plan is to show up at about 6 AM that day at the condo, with my breakfast, lunch, and dinner packed and prepped. Then, I will wait until she shows up, and I will follow her around relentlessly, never letting her out of my sight. Hell, I might even wear a diaper so I don't have to take any bathroom breaks. I do not trust this woman one iota, and do not want to leave her alone in my condo for even one second. \n\nI will stalk her, basically, following her around as long as she is at the condo complex, and especially while she is on my property. I want to be 100% sure that she doesn't trash my place, or damage anything while she's moving her furniture out, and that she doesn't do anything else crazy, and that she actually leaves the garage door open so that I can get it reprogrammed.\n\nI don't think there's anything wrong with this, since a) I own the place, b) I need any keys she has, c) she needs to leave the garage open, and d) she has literally tried to steal from me in the past (February's rent) and has lied about several things. However, most of my friends and family seem to think that I'm overreacting. This is my first place, so I concede that I might be overreacting. Additionally, they dismiss her actions as just being senility, or something, because she's old- they don't",

She started to see me as the enemy, the one who is keeping her boyfriend away from her. So for the past 3 weeks everytime we spend some time together, she calls him crying and telling him he’s not giving her attentions and that he prefers me over her. This always ends up with him canceling plans or leaving me in the middle of our activities. She also started to say I’m gay and that I like him. \n\nTwo weeks ago me and bestfriend had a huge fight because i said i was sick of all this and that she was immoral and a bitch. He told me that it’s selfish and silly that I’m asking to not listen to his girlfriend, or to not leaving me or canceling everytime if she cries, or that he can’t choose between me and his girlfriend (never asked that btw). \n\nThings got worse a couple of days ago, she was insulting me on the phone while talking to his boyfriend when he was with me, she called me fag and i said out loud “you’re a fucking instable mentally ill whore” (it’s translated).\nMy bestfriend got really mad, said he can’t forgive me, and now he is ignoring me and said our friendship may be over. He also said that if one day he wants to talk to me again he’s gonna call me and the only thing i can do now is wait.\n\nI really miss him, i even apologized to him and her, but honestly i don’t regret it.

      "description": "Backstory :My parents and youngest sister moved abroad and I live with my 19 year old sister in our old apartment. Ever since we were left alone my grandparents have felt more inclined to know more about our lives and talk to us more than ever before. \n\nLook I'm a student(21M), I study computer science and am currently in the progress of getting a job/ internship which has made current times really work-heavy and stressful.\n\n\nThis past month I have been hanging around with my family a lot due to a lot of birthdays being around this time(Basically every week of March its someone's birthday) and I don't mind seeing them at all, however lately they have been starting to pressure me more in terms of visiting, sending messages such as \"When can we see you next and when are you coming.\" Even if we saw eachother just 3 days ago. They would keep sending me  messages or call and expect me to show up on their doorstep. My grandparents are absolutely lovely people with the exception that my grandma can get quite a bit out of hand in social situations(has a tendency to interrupt everyone and talk herself), but other than that I do have a great relationship with them.\n\nBut I'm sorry but I don't really have the time and it's a real hassle to visit them since I don't own the car(We have decent public transport here where I live) and it takes me 30 mins to get from uni to their house and if i want to get home it takes me about an hour on my own. Additionally I have long commutes(2h every day minimum) which leaves me little time for school, exercise,what little social life I have left once im done in uni. I have tried politely telling them this, but they don't seem to listen and I feel like an asshole if i start saying no I can't come. Whenever they need me(IT related questions and I help my granddad with heavier lifting from time to time) Im always there for them the first chance I get. \n\nBut lately I have had a tough time in school since there is a lot to do, but they don't seem to understand...\n\nI just want to tell them to stop pressuring me all the time. I will surely visit and see them when I have more time, but make sure to see them minimally once a month, but I can't keep up with the pace they want me to.\n\nAITA for feeling this way and WIBTA if I told them how I feel?",

      "description": "AITA for saying that?\nOk, I don't really know what happened here... Me and my boyfriend of 3 years are going to college and I still live at home because the campus is really close to my parents house and we don't have a lot of money.\nMy bf spends most of the nights at our house because he lives an hour away, and it has been that way for a while. I recently got another room to use right next to my bedroom (which is really small, only a bed for the two of us and a cupboard with tv on it), so today I put some nice chairs and my tv and gaming consoles in the new room.\n\nWhen my bf came home today after playing Pokémon Go! all day, he was not impressed when he saw the bedroom. Said my room looked more chaotic than before and now we couldn't watch tv in bed no more. He then refused to even look at the other room and went to the kitchen to make some noodles for him and I was kind of pissed because I really put in some effort to make this a nice place for us to live... so I told him to go home if he wants to act like that when he was at the foot of the stairs and he just was like \"ok\" and ran me over (I was standing on the stairs) so that I landed on my butt, and it was not especially violent, but it still hurt, and I started to cry a little and went into another room so he wouldn't see and next thing I know he drives off without saying another word, not even saying goodbye to my parents. (He almost never drives anywhere because he doesn't have money for gas, so this is kind of weird for him to do just because he didn't want to look at the room...) (We are both adults.......)\n\nI mean.. I don't even know what happened here.\nUsually I am the one who takes a step in his direction in situations like this because he tried to kill himmself in 2017 and I'm always worried that I am too mean to him... But I am sick of always being the one to rekindle. I have depression too and getting up and trying to improve our living circumstances in any way is not something i can achieve every day. I probably should not have told him to go home, but this is not his home after all and he could have just taken a look inte the room and said \"looks ok\" or something...\n\nI know that if I don't text him first he probably won't talk to me for days but I have a feeling that I am NTA here...

He always says something along the lines of that he was taught not to burden others with his own problems, but here's the thing, he does talk to L about it, he says that he feels he can because she's a girl, but here's the problem, he's not getting any better, he just seems to get worse and worse and I can't seem to do anything about it, he won't see a professional about it and I'm worried what'll happen if he continues on like this, but all my other friends I talk to about it either think he should just \"get over it\" or I should leave him alone and stop bringing it up, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I apologize if this is a bit long, as I want to add enough detail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am fifteen years old, and my friend group that I normally hang out with is also made up of 15 and 16 years olds. We like to hang out a lot outside of school, and usually, our parents are okay with leaving us to it, as long we're safe about it.\n\n  \nBefore we leave though, they always give us one rule (that we all agree with): STAY TOGETHER!\n\nThis rule isn't a problem for us, as we usually hang out until late and we always want to make sure we know where everyone is (when we're out together) and to stick together, especially at night, to stay safe.  \n\n\nOne of my best friends (15 years old), who is also in my friend group, has some trouble with it though. Sometimes she will wander off without telling us where she is going or she will urge us to go on to the next store or wherever without her even though we tell her that we want to stick together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne time, while we were in the middle of Publix at night buying groceries for a sleepover, she got a phone call and stepped back. Assuming that she would only be a few feet away, we turned back and let her talk. Unfortunately, this was not the case, and when we turned around a few minutes earlier she was gone. I panicked a little, because A) I didn't know where she was and B) my dad told us to always stick together before he dropped us off.\n\n  \nEventually, we found her walking around and talking on the phone a few aisles over, and when she saw us walking towards her, she started to walk away. The second time, we tried to ask her to tell us where she was going next time/ask if she was okay but she ignored/waved us off and walked away again. This happened about two more times, but eventually, she stopped walking far off. She also seemed a little anxious and figured that whatever was on the phone was important, so we let her be. When she came back she just explained that it was her boyfriend calling to tell her about his day and nothing important. We asked her to tell us where she is going next time, but she just replied with, \"I was just over there.\" I let it slide that time since the store was kind of small anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother example was last night when we (Her, another friend, and I) were at the bookstore. It was about 9:35 pm and my friend (I'll just call her G) wanted to check out the candy store across the street that closed at 10 pm, but it was fairly dark outside and we didn't want to leave each other alone at that time of the night.\n\n While G was paying, I went and asked her if she wanted to go, and she replied that she wanted to keep looking around and we could go without her. I explained that no, we didn't want to just leave her at the bookstore alone and that we wanted to stick together, but she said again that it was alright for us to leave her there. Eventually, G and I just decided to wait for her, and thankfully the candy store hadn't closed the time we had left, but I was still kind of annoyed that she wasn't understanding that we wanted to stick together.\n\n  \nReally, I am not mad at her for wanting us to go on without her, but I am kind of annoyed that she is not understanding why we want to stay together to stay safe, but at the same time, I feel kind of guilty for being annoyed because she feels bad about keeping us behind a lot. AITA? Do I have a right to be annoyed? Am I overreacting/ making the whole \"stick together\" thing hard on her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My (15F) best friend sometimes strays away from the group/insists that we leave her behind even though we want to stick together for safety. AITA for being annoyed?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I'm gonna try to explain this whole situation as best as I can.\n\nTwo years ago I got braces. When I had to get them tightened, my mom would drive me to the a local clinic, not too far away from my home. Then, after few months the dentist told me, that she cannot come to my town anymore, because her own clinic is in the capital, about 3 hours away, and it costs her too much to come to my town. My mom told the dentist, that we wouldn't have any problems going on a trip once every few months for my braces, so that's what we did.\n\nThe thing is, that my stepdad doesn't want my mom to drive around, so whenever my whole family goes on a trip, he always drives. My mom is a pretty good driver, and she admitted, that she does want to drive around more to not loose her skill, but she doesn't want to argue with my stepdad.\n\nThe first year we went on these trips for my braces, we went to these big malls. I really liked going to them, but now my stepdad won't go there, because he doesn't like them. He would rather stop in a smaller town, in a smaller store on the way home. And even if we do stop to shop around, he rushes everyone because he is tired and wants to go home. \n\nAnd my younger brother isn't that easy to deal with either - we always get in fights, he doesn't like big stores that much. \n\nI begged my mom for months, I asked her many times if my brother and stepdad could stay home. She says, that she is a bit afraid to drive in a bigger city and she wants us all to go as a family, because it's unfair to my bro and stepdad. \n\nNow I have my braces off, but since I am wearing retainers, I still need to go for a checkup every few months. My next checkup is in a few weeks, and my birthday is a week before the checkup. My mom asked me:\n\nWhat do you want for your birthday?\n\nAnd I said:\n\nI want to go to the checkup only with you, without my bro or stepdad.\n\n(this is not the first time I asked her this for my b-day)\n\nShe looked uncomfortable and changed the subject. She told me the same things :\nShe doesn't feel that comfortable driving in 'the big city' (even though the clinic is not that far to the entrance of the city), and it's unfair.\n\nMy mom does know the road there, and she's a good driver so I don't get the problem here.\n\nI asked her many times for this, and even if she promised it, on the trip day my bro and stepdad would just get up and go with us. My mom did apologised for it. \n\nI just want for once to go to a big mall without my stepdad nagging on my shoulder that I'm taking too long looking and clothes and etc. I want a nice, calm car trip, just for once! Is this too much to ask? \n\nAm I the asshole? ",

I am one these “guides” and because of that I also signed a contract saying that I won’t be intimate with the freshmen until a certain date.\n\nBut anyways, the first day we met the freshmen it was obvious that this one girl was very interested in me. I recently broke up with my ex-girlfriend so this attention was pretty nice and I flirted back. She flirted a lot, laughed at my jokes and pretty much just followed me around which I had no problem with, she was nice, pretty and we had great chemistry.As I wasn’t allowed to do anything with her, I held back and dodged her kisses and attempts when she was drunk.\n\nBut then after a month or so it was officially okay for me get intimate with her and we started kissing at social events and stuff. We were kind of a lowkey unofficial “thing” and we also had sex twice. The last time we had sex she talked about how much she liked me and how I was the nicest person she knew, which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. She didn’t say she had feeling for me, but I felt that what she said was pretty much the same thing.\n\nI felt like it was moving towards a relationship and I kinda panicked because I knew that I wasn’t interested in her as much as she was in me.\n\nI kissed some other girls at some parties where she was also present which I later felt was kind of a dick move, but at least she found out that I wasn’t falling for her. I then decided that I would stop doing anything with her because I felt that was the nicest thing to do if I didn’t want her to get feelings for me.\n\nWe still saw each other at social stuff and we still had a great time, but I stopped flirting and we didn’t do anything for about a month.\n\nUntil this weekend where I got drunk and had sex with her and also made out with her the next day at another party.\n\nMy friend thinks IATA because I am playing with her feelings and leading her on.\n\nI don’t how these things work, if I know I don’t want anything serious am I then being selfish if I think she may have feelings for me?\n\nI’m 22 btw and she is 23.\n\nSorry if my English is shitty.",

      "description": "   I'm an athiest. My deeply religious mother isn't aware of this as far as I know, but my father is, so he may have told her at some time. Yesterday, my mother wanted me to go to a Christian band concert a half-hour's drive from where I live. She purchased the tickets for us without asking if I was interested in going with her about a month ago, and the time for it had finally come yesterday evening. I, however, was not interested in going with her at all. She wouldn't have been alone if I hadn't have gone with her, as she already had her best friend going. I'm under 18, so I still live with my parents and live by their rules, so of course I can't decide for myself not to go. I had school the next day, so I had to wash my clothes and get ready for it in the morning, in addition to a couple of hours worth of homework left to do. I believe I had valid reason to stay home while she went with her friend.\n   It almost came time to leave for the concert, and I asked my mother if I could stay home and do the things I needed to. It was at this point that she blew up on me, shouting that I needed to get ready and that the matter was \"not up for discussion!\". So I asked, \"Why isn't it up for discussion?\". I was responded to in the same way as before: that I needed to get ready and it was not up for discussion. I told her that we would likely not get back until late, and that I did have school work to finish that night, but she didn't seem to care. She never gave a reason for wanting me to go, despite me asking quite a few times.\n   I did end up having to go to the concert, and it was no more enjoyable for me than I had imagined. My mother spoke no words to me from the time we had gotten into the car to head there until we had gotten back home. I honestly do not believe she actually wanted me there. By that point, I think she was simply trying to prove that she had the power to force me to go, for reasons unknown. The concert ended over an hour later than I had expected, and I ended up working on school work until past 1:00 a.m. I did not get to sleep until perhaps 3:00. Had my mother allowed me to stay home, I would have been perfectly on schedule and would not have nearly fallen asleep in my classes this morning. \n   My mother and I have spoken very little since last night, but she did tell me that she would be willing to listen to me if I could apologize to her, and \"mean it\". I, however, don't feel that I should have to apologize to her. I don't feel bad about it at all. I had things to do that I saw as more important than this event that I cared nothing about, and I think she should have allowed me to do them. Not once did I raise my voice at her. I saw nothing to gain from me going to this concert, for either one of us.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Here's a little background: I've been with my SO for 4 years and we have a 2 year old and another on the way. He's been working at a place that he doesn't hate, it just isn't incredible pay but we're getting by with some extra money at the end of the month.\n\nBefore we met, like two years prior, he'd gotten fired from this place where he had his dream job. Recently, we'd visited this place to say hello to his old friend that works there and he informed my SO that his dream job opened back up. He's entertained the idea because the pay is slightly higher but it's not necessarily closer to our home than his current position. I am extremely uncomfortable with the idea and he knows it.\n\nHere's why I'm uncomfortable: he (in addition to his friends) told me that that this woman, M - who was/and still is the overall manager of the place- got him fired with no warning or reason other than the fact that he wouldn't fuck her. In fact, she tried to get the barely legal young women in the workplace to allege sexual harassment against him but they didn't hold up under scrutiny. He still lost the job. My SO asked his friend if she was still a bitch and he said \"she's calmed down because she's hanging out with a black priestess now\" whatever that means. Upon returning home, he said \"Oh I know you'd be extremely uncomfortable with me working there\" then why pursue it? \n\nI DO NOT want him to go to an environment where this kind of thing has happened. Of course, I sound like the asshole when I say \"hey I know it's your dream job that pays a few bucks more an hour but why can't you just ask your current boss for a raise\". This is his third job since I've known him, why give up 2.5 years of history instead of just asking for his deserved raise and promotion? At this point, I don't know if it's about me trusting him. Furthermore, the location of this place is somewhere where he gets physically ill and he said \"I wonder if there's something I could do to make it bearable\" uh, or just look for a different job/transfer to the location of your current employer near our home/one of their subsidiaries. There is no way I can broach this topic without him saying \"Oh you don't trust me, you don't want me to live my dream\" but living his dream means he'll constantly be gone more than he is now and instead of being off at 3pm, he'll be working late into the night. \"oh but everyone knows me there and I'm a part of the community\" but none of these people have reached out to him individually in the entire time I've known him so I don't think he holds that position now.\n\nMy last issue is he wants to move back to this town when I've explicitly stated that if I move again, I want to be closer to my daughter from my previous marriage and I'll never move back to that town - nothing there for me. \n\nAm I the asshole/would I be if I told him he should look elsewhere? What's the non asshole way of approaching this?\n\nTl;dr - my SO wants his dream job despite knowing that I'm uncomfortable and it not being the most logical option for our growing family",

      "description": "Hello people,\n\nI went on a vacation to my other country. I wanted a wooden box to store a silver plated 1911, so I asked my uncle if he knew someone who could do that for me. He said to me \"I know a guy he's a friend and he does great work\". I said great let's go see him.\n\nWe got to his shop and I gave him the dimensions and the specifics like the color of the varnish (I wanted a brown finish) and the lock on the box (I noticed the locks on the box he had where put upside down), I told the guy to put the lock in the correct position for my box. \n\nI know for a fact that in this country you should never give any money until you have the finished product in hand. Otherwise you might not get what you paid for. So I left the shop without giving any money.\n\n2 weeks later I ask my uncle to ask the guy if it's almost done. He said it just needed a lock and it was difficult to find. I said okay but my plane leaves in 3 weeks. I kept calling every week and same answer until the final week where my uncle took the initiative to go get it for me. I saw the box it was absolutely not what I ordered:\n\n\\-Lock put upside down\n\n\\-No varnish on the box. The box was yellowish\n\nI was leaving in a few days and told my uncle that I'm not paying for that and I will return it. He got really upset and the following discussion took place.\n\nHim: Take it anyway.\n\nMe: No, the guy didn't follow any of my instructions, he can keep his box.\n\nHim: But the box is already paid for!\n\nMe: What? When?\n\nHim: The day you placed the order.\n\nMe: Then no wonder he kept jerking me around with that stupid lock! Why did you do that?\n\nHim: Because he's my friend!\n\nMe: You should never have paid him, and especially not behind my back when you know how bad they are at doing business in this country. I'm not taking the box looking like that.\n\nHim: Fine I'll keep it for myself but you're an asshole! Don't ever ask me if I know a guy for anything ever!\n\nI was really disappointed to see that box I was waiting for all this time, and even more at my uncle for doing that. It was not the same between him and me for the remaining days. He acted like I was 100% at fault which I think I'm not. This is why I want an outside opinion.\n\nAITA?",

Basically my roommate and my ex are currently dating (so there’s tension that has built up from that) but that’s only part of what this story is about. At my college there is a place where people who can’t afford groceries for the week can go to get a few of the necessities things like bread, noodles, toothpaste etc. For the past few months I noticed they get back to the apartment and they have all this food with them and told they got it from said program. I know for a fact they both have decent paying job and can obviously afford their own groceries, and it doesn’t sit well with me because I felt they were abusing a system that is trying to help people in need. After expressing my concern they tell me “well it’s not our fault they just give this away, plus it’s an easy way to save money.” This went on for about a few months and eventually enough was enough. Wanting a bit of revenge for my roommate dating my ex I went to where the program is and told them that my ex and roommate were taking stuff because it was free and not for necessity and talked about how they were abusing the system. The person that’s in charge the program asks for their names, looks them up on the school data base and social media and this confirms I was telling the truth. Currently their pictures are on the outside of where the program is and they’re banned from going inside. They claim that I’m an asshole because I “ruined their vacation plan” because now they have to pay for their own groceries instead of using a system that’s supposed to help people that need it. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Sorry for the massive wall a text to truly understand what’s going on you’ll need some context\n\nWhen I was growing up my parents separated when I was like 1ish and they had a agreement that I would see my dad every other week end. \n\nSo at one point my dad got married to my step mother which she is a total piece of garbage. Every early memory of her she’s doing everything she can to make me feel like I was garbage. She would consistently tell me that I was going to break the scale or be on the biggest loser. Or things like that I’m going to be called stinky in school and she would just plug her nose every time I would walk by her. Also my dad didn’t do anything to stop it. (On a side note I wasn’t even overweight nor did I smell bad)\n\nThis go on till I’m about 12ish and then this week I was staying over there for like a weekish because summer was here and I didn’t have school. We would be constantly going outside to play basketball and shit like that. Then one of the days I had a idea to just ware the same shirt I did the day before since I was just going to get it dirty anyways. I didn’t think anything about it. \n\nBut when I got back home to my mother not even a day later we have child protective services at our door wanting to do an investigation because my dad called saying my mom doesn’t take care of me or clean any of my clothes. After the lady came in and investigated she was confused why she was even there. Our house was not dirty and my mom took a lot better care of me then my dad and step mom ever did. \n\nSo after that I didn’t have to see him anymore and honestly I was perfectly happy not seeing them anymore it was miserable. This went on for maybe like 4 to 5 years ish. I decided to reach out to him because he made zero attempts to contact me. \n\nSo when I met up with him again he just acted like it was all my moms fault that he tried calling but she wouldn’t let him. Which is a lie he never tried calling. I then maybe saw him 2 or 3 times after that between then and now which I’m 20 now and I was probably like 15 or 16 when we reconnected for the first time after he called for that investigation. \n\nAt this point he’s told me so many different reasons on why that happened that I just decided that I don’t want him part of my life it’s always so negative when I talk to him and nothing is ever his fault. He even had the nerve to call me child ish for not texting him back and just ignoring him. \n\nSo I just want to know if I’m really being a asshole for not wanting anything to do with him anymore. \n\nAlso the only reason I’m using a throw away is there are people that follow my main account that know who I am and I don’t want them to know all this. \n\n",

He violates my safe words, intentionally cums in me when I asked him not to, and coerces sex.  I have bruises and injuries against my wishes.  However, I'm not going to report him as long as he stays away and never comes to my house.  \n\nSome more backstory:  I'm a sex addict and have a pattern of unconsciously seeking out abusers.  I think abuse is \"hot sex\" and get caught up in it.  I'm kinky and don't want to report this for two reasons:  \n\n1.  I am a terrible plaintiff. \n2.  I don't want to ruin his life.  He said he was madly in love with me and wanted to force me to have his baby.\n\nI sent him text messages explaining why it was sexual assault when he came in me repeatedly when I told him I didn't want that and he agreed to pull out.  So he knows and is educated.  We actually had a conversation where he admitted violating a safe word like he did with me could get him in real big trouble.  He also told me about a famous person who stealthed and was sued for it:  before he came in me on purpose knowing I didn't want that.   \n\nSick and Twisted as it is:  AITA for not reporting him to save other women?

I liked their significant other (SO). I thought that their relationship progressed very quickly, and soon my friend really stopped seeing and communicating with other mutual friends and their family. I saw this and communicated my thoughts that they were moving fast and they disregarded me. oh well. \n\nIt should be noted that this friend has treated me fairly poorly in the past, but I wanted to move past it, things like leaving their house to go shopping while i am driving over and making me wait outside for an hour until they got home, discluding me from mutual friend activities, and not telling me that they were moving in with our mutual best friend, when I had communicated that I was interested in living together. \n\nI learned from mutual friend that Friend and SO had secretly married. (Note: they married because SO is from out of the country and would have had to move back to home country after graduating college, and married in Dec. 2018) So Friend and SO had a secret wedding where mutual friend and one of SO's friends and friends parents were there and were all told not to tell anyone. \n\nI learned from Friend's dad that they had married, and from mutual friend that they had this \"weird, secret marriage\" (MF's words).\nMy initial reaction was absolute heartbreak. I felt that Friend didn't trust me or love me enough to share this news with me, possibly because I was apprehensive about the progression of the relationship. Mutual friend agrees that this was the wrong move.\n\nI've been reflecting, and I also feel that I made their happy thing about me.

      "description": "My mother passed earlier in the year after a long bout with breast cancer. For about the last 8 or so months I decided to leave my job and partially move in with her to take care of her. I have a house with my husband but I spent half the time there (usually nights I'll sleep at home and during the day stay with her with my husband and daughter as company sometimes). I was the one who found my mother. I was a teacher for 4 years when I resigned, to note is that finding a teaching position local is extremely prohibitive. I knew this beforehand.\n\nAfter her mortgage was paid off with the estate as well as outstanding debts, I learned the remainder was left to breast cancer charity. Additionally, in her will were instructions to sell her house and pay that money forward to charity, too. Nothing was left to my family or anyone else for that matter.

      "title": "AITA for being fwb with a mutual friend of an ex if the ex is fine with it?",
      "description": "I(34F) was with my ex(32M) for 11 years and lived with him for the majority of that time. We broke up more or less a year ago. It was an extremely amicable break up (initiated by me, but was one he clearly also wanted and we had near-breakup talks leading up to it some of which initiated by him). We're still really good friends, and both really happy about that, especially since we have nearly all the same friends and the main group we hang out with is equally both of our friends who we've each hung out with for the last 12+ years.\n\nRecently, I started having a friends-with-benefits kind of relationship with one of these friends. We've decided not to broadcast it for non-ex related reasons, so very few of our friends know.\n\nNow, I know my ex really well and we have really open and honest communication. I *know* how he would feel about this, and am sure he would not be upset. I've dated a bit since we broke up, he was completely fine with it. He's definitely of the opinion that once people break up that they don't really owe anything to each other in regards to who they date. He's also specifically said that he would be fine with me dating mutual friends. It isn't him I'm worried about.\n\nBut some of our friends tend to still treat us like we're a couple. It's been a year since we broke up so I'm annoyed with it, but I also kind of get it. The people I dated since never got to a very serious point, and he's not dated anyone since AFAIK so no one has had much exposure to us being in relationships with others. We'll often go to parties together because I don't have a car, I live in the neighbouring apartment complex to him and everyone else lives rather far so it makes sense for him to drive me and he wants to. Yesterday, we went out for dinner with 4 of our friends, two sets of couples and then us. When it came time for the bills, a waitress came over and asked how we wanted to divide the bills and one of the friends gestured and explained a desire to split the bill into three bills, lumping me and ex together. I had to jump in and explain that me and ex would be separate. There have been other subtle hints of stuff like this from this friend and a few others.\n\nSince then I've gotten increasingly worried that if people found out about the friends-with-benefits thing, they might be angry on exes behalf, and even if he didn't care they might think he is just not sticking up for himself. Remember, they don't really have the context that I have that says that he'd be fine with it or that I knew previous to starting this thing that he'd be fine with it. I'm known to be a good person in the group, and haven't ever done anything that anyone thought was wrong before, so I'm hoping that reputation holds up.\n\nIf you were my friends, would you think IATA?",

      "description": "I’m 4 years out of high school and there are several friends I’ve somewhat kept in touch with. We go to school across the state from each other but they come to visit often and we occasionally text/call each other. \n\nWhen we started college, my best friend and I ended up at the same school and had a rather brutal falling out. Long story short she completely cut me out of her life and tried to manipulate me because she didn’t like that I had become friends with her roommate. She said and did some really hurtful things and I kind of expected our friends to support me during this. They both said she was being horrible and seemed to side with me but never really stood up for me. Which is fine. It’s not quite fair for me to ask them to choose me over my ex-friend. But it didn’t leave me feeling very supported or like my friends cared about me. \n\nNow they come to visit our school and if I want to see them I have to endure this whole group of people I’m not too fond of as well as my ex friend and often her roommate I was forbidden from talking to. I always end up feeling horrible and upset after these visits- partially because I have to endure ex-friend but also because I always feel like an after thought. There have been several times where they didn’t tell me they were going to dinner or hanging out as a group and I’ve been completely left out of plans. \n\nWe still talk on occasion but I don’t feel nearly as close to them as before (which I think is normal after high school in some cases). None of them even remembered my birthday. But I still feel obligated to be a part of their visits when they invite me because they were my only friends before college. \n\nSo AITA if I stop making an effort to see them when they travel across the state to be with this group?\n\nTLDR: feeling like I’ve grown apart from friends from high school- want to stop seeing them but feel obligated after they travel across the state to my school",

But whenever I would explain this, I’d always get the look like I’m an ass and would be told that it’s the special needs kids and to do the right thing.

      "description": "Context: I'm a junior in college. I have a partial meal plan on campus that I use to get lunch with my friends in the dining halls from time to time. In the dining hall it's usually a student employee who's swiping people in/ manning the cash register. For a student, it's not really a fun job but it's a lax work environment so they can usually do homework or whatever busywork they need to do. \n\nWhen I go to grab lunch, there's a certain student employee who always asks random themed questions to the people he's swiping in. People enjoy it and answer but I'm never in a mood to. So I just hand him my card, ignore the question, and thank him to be on my way. I was swiping in with my friend a few weeks ago and he called me out for being a dick by not answering. It's been on my mind and I just wanted some thoughts. ",

      "description": "I'm going to be attending a party for New Years where there will be alcohol present. I have already decided that I am not going to get drunk at this party, as I cannot stay the night. However, I also figured one Seagrams, if drank when I first arrived, couldn't hurt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I told my girlfriend about this, she flipped out, saying I was stupid and that drinking and driving was going to get me killed. It even got to the point where she is now saying I can't go to any parties with drinking involved without her, because she doesn't trust me to not drink and drive, for even suggesting this. She says it's because she was in a previous relationship where someone drank and drove, but this is hardly the same thing, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I really an asshole for wanting to have one Seagrams, a beverage with the alcoholic content of water, and still driving home? I'm sorry if this seems like one of those \"fishing for karma\" posts, I'm just really confused how she can flip out like this and it's making me wonder if I really am the asshole in this situation; if not, can anyone give me some insight into her POV?",

About 90% of the games we play he calls someone out for hacking that is certainly not hacking and simply hit a lucky shot. Today, we came across someone in a game that was hitting some insane shots and always knew where we were. At first, I was a bit skeptical of them, but I didn't want to call the alleged hacker for sure. Though my former friend, after the first round was already accusing. Every other time he does this, I stay quiet though it does bother me. Today, I finally said something about it. A bunch of people in our Discord were talking, so I talked over them to talk to my former friend about it, though it came across as me yelling at him. Though to his credit, the guy was actually hacking. He later team-killed me and abandoned the game. \n\nWe started talking in Steam DMs, with the summary being this:\n\n  \nMe: I find it pretty annoying when you are constantly calling people out for hacks.\n\nHim: I don;t care. Whenever I do something small you turn into a hypocrite and get mad at me and its annoying. Also you treat me like an autist. \n\nMe: How is me getting mad  at you for constantly calling people out for hacking hypocritical? Also, I was yelling because everyone else was yelling. Also, you get mad at me for breaking something on the map that you never use, yet causes an inconvenience to other people. \n\nHe now refuses to speak to me. \n\nWe ended up with similar friends in custom matches where he refuses to unmute me \n\nWhenever he has a problem, he refuses to communicate anything.

In order to do well I need to prepare far in advance, but considering the amount of work we had to do, we couldn’t put the presentation together until the day before. \n\nSo we do the presentation and it’s fine, we get a lot of great feedback after. My professor sent us an excel sheet with comments from other people in the room, including grad students, fellow classmates, and faculty advisors. One of the comments was “considering English as their first language I guess. Presentation should have been way better.” I’m the only person in my group with an ethnic name. I just feel like the comment was inappropriate and I told my professor and asked him to tell whoever made the comment to keep their feedback relevant to the presentation. I don’t mind critique I just think this comment was uncalled for. AITA??",

Eventually with enough peristance she'll admit it was me not being able to hear her that made her upset, but even with the admition she never works on controlling that anger or saying that it's wrong. Finally today I blew my lid and said something to the effect of \"When you can't hear me I repeat myself without a problem, but god forbid I misshear you. I get to be worried when ever my phone happens to drop the last word of your sentence. Maybe its because you get over angry when that happens and you need to fix it.\" Now before I get the obviously YTA, yes I understand my behavier was not proper. What i'm asking is if I have a right to be upset by her behavier when I can't hear her. \n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend gets mad when I can't hear her, and I feel like its unjustified\n\nSorry for the giant wall of text",

That's when everything changed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't open up to me about the events until a couple months afterwards when the worst of it had passed. Apparently Liz wasn't coping well with any of it, and was spiraling into a hole. A lot of things weren't working well for her, but this was the thing that set her over the edge. She was making some questionable choices, which I kept warning her not to do. And of course she did them anyways, and came crawling back to me crying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe told me that she couldn't talk to anyone about her deepest fears and depression, which lead her to obsess about the same details and her constant facetime calls (half of which I ignored because I was dealing with my own stress/being annoyed of her). I'll admit that she was getting a little bit better about not calling me everytime she was having hysteria, but she was always so depressing everytime I'd see her. Yes, she would apologize after obsessing about her issues with me, and She'd ask me if there was anything in life that was bothering me. Her exact words were \"I don't want to make every conversation about me, you can talk about your issues too if there's anything you're stressed about\". But I didn't want to steal her spotlight since she was having her hysteria.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll admit that I was a little annoyed by the fact that she couldn't move past some issues. And I'd lowkey drop some hints like \"Maybe you should just forget about it\". I think that might have been why she did what she did later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months later, and that's when I started having anxiety because of her. I would text her over the course of two months to casually chat with her, but she would take ages to respond to my messages. And I began to suspect that she might have been using me this entire time! Only chatting with me whenever she needed someone to rant to. This went on until I couldn't take it anymore and I asked to meet up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI confronted her in person about her slow responses and how I thought she was using me, but she said that she was just busier than usual dealing with some other things and would just simply respond faster. And I argued that actions speak louder than words, to which she countered by calling me out for purposely evading her facetime calls earlier. At this point, I was so annoyed with her drama that I told her I wanted out of this friendship, and I ranted how she would never think about if I was going through things of my own. Oh, and to top it off, she couldn't even see why I was angry/hurt that she could say something like \"Oh, we're just really different people now\". Maybe if she could sense when something was wrong with me, things wouldn't have ended.",

      "description": "I have a lot to unpack here, so let me start with the basics. My husband and I have been legally married for 8.5 years. We have not actually been living together, or living any semblance of a married lifestyle for the majority of the time. We did not work together as a couple so we parted ways. We have a 6 year old kid together. We get along great, probably mostly for the sake of our kid, but we still consider each other really good friends. \nMy husband is adopted. He was adopted at around a month old so he had no memories or knowledge of his bio parents because it was a closed adoption. His parents have always supported him and let him know if he ever wanted to look into his bio parents, they’d have his back and pay for all the legal costs. He never showed too much interest and just accepted that we wouldn’t have a lot of info in terms of hereditary health problems, mental problems, etc. in regards to our child.\nLike I stated before, we aren’t really “together.” Only in terms of legal marriage, but he has his personal life, I have mine. However, a year or so ago he decided to impregnate a woman who is married (long story, her husband supposedly agreed, and it’s a polyamorous thing I really don’t understand but that’s not my business and I’m not here to judge it). What really annoys me is that all of the sudden now that she’s had this baby, his bio family is SO important to him. His other baby-mama stalked out his bio-mom on facebook and now he’s pretty much in touch with everyone in his biological family. \nThis is great and all, but now it comes to the part where I question if I’m an asshole. I legitimately don’t care about any of this. He called me tonight as he was in a parking lot of a bar waiting to meet his bio dad for the first time. I never pushed him into this, and I know he’s only doing this because his other baby-mama basically forced him to get answers about his bio family after he impregnated her. I’ve listened to him talk about it, and even went to Christmas dinner at his bio-mom’s brother’s house after feeling guilted into it.  He never gave a shit about all of these biological things when our daughter was born, never made an effort to search for them even if it was for medical reasons only, until he had this second kid. Point blank, AITA for being done giving a shit about him meeting all these new people who have no impact on my life and are only around because his other baby-mama felt compelled to facebook stalk and track his bio-family down?",

      "description": "My father in law has had cancer for about a decade. Now he has developed a Xanax (not prescribed) addiction and keeps passing out. He likes to sneak 8 bars at a time. He and I have never been close because long before he met me, he decided he’s dying and shouldn’t start new relationships with anyone. He is very religious, however, and has always been pushy for us to have kids throughout our marriage (3 years). I’ve always felt more like a walking womb to him than a person. \n\nMy husband’s mother is diagnosed but untreated bipolar and can be very mean spirited at the wrong times. She keeps no secrets and gossip is her favorite past time. For example, when I confided in her that I wanted to ask her daughter to be a bridesmaid, she told her before I could ask and talked shit about it. She told me she’d always wished she could have married my husband (it’s weird and a lot to unpack)...\n\nMy husband is now insisting we tell his parents about my pregnancy because of his father’s constant fainting. I just got to 12 weeks and I haven’t even had my NIPT yet (chromosomal abnormality test). I have a history of miscarriage and inability to get pregnant. It sucks. Also, telling people about miscarriage is more awkward than most can imagine and it’s a pretty personal affair. At the moment, my body is going pretty nuts and I’d rather not talk about the common symptoms with my in laws unless I’m sure I get to have this baby. Does his dad’s cancer override my medical privacy? AITA? ",

I often visit my grandmother 3 times a week on average for 1.5 hours each time and am the only family member besides my mother and aunt who visit, who sees my grandmother on a regular basis, none of the other grandchildren really bother. \n\nAs of today, my mother has suggested that I start to spend every second Saturday with her and my grandmother so I can help with taking my grandmother out for the afternoon and keeping her entertained. My mother and grandmother usually go these outings just the two of them and it's never been raised as an issue until today. My mum says she sometimes finds it difficult to keep my gran entertained when out and about or at home for a few hours as my gran will either get bored, sleepy or cranky. \n\nI love my grandmother dearly, but my issue is that I'm a full time student and work part-time so Saturday is the only full day off I have to spend time with my boyfriend, see friends or do activities so I usually like to have some plans.\n\nIt also has to be said, throughout this year, I have been by my grandmother's bedside for hours every day whilst she was in the hospital and spent several weeks and months watching and caring for her whilst she was living with us, so it's not like i've not been helping out.\n\nI feel like after bringing this up, my parents are trying to guilt trip me and back me into a corner and making demands like \"you will be doing it\" and \"your grandmother looked after you when you were young\" and how shocked and appalled they are at my hesitance.\n\nAITA for being unhappy about this and WIBTA for potentially saying no to this arrangement?

      "description": "Throwaway account because these two friends know my Reddit account.\n\nSo I (16M) am friends with two other people (15M, 16F). Everything is purely platonic, and we enjoy spending time together.\n\nSome context: Two weeks ago, I had a pretty big argument with M about something completely unrelated. Name-calling, shouting, etc. We got over it within a few days, but things are still wobbly.\n\nTwo months ago, I had a smaller argument with F. It went something along the lines of me saying, 'You never tell me anything,' and her responding, 'Yeah, because you wouldn't listen, and you don't try in our friendship.'. I apologised later that day.\n\nFor a while, I've noticed the two of them spending a lot of time together without inviting me along. Conversations about schoolwork, homework, banal stuff, but excluding me nonetheless. Sometimes it's whispering behind my back, gossiping about anything under the sun. Other times they're just having a laugh while I try to figure out what's so funny.\n\nIt certainly doesn't help that they have the same tastes in music, are in the same classes for almost everything, are assigned to group projects all the time, and are applying for the same summer programs this coming June.\n\nWhenever I try to insert myself into one of their conversations, they either ignore me or dismiss me with one sentence before resuming their riveting exchange. I guess I just feel taken for granted, like they only keep me around for comedic relief or for homework help.\n\nHere's the part I think I'll get criticised for saying: I feel like F only interacts with M over me, because he is much better-looking than me. I'm not trying to be a 'niceguy'----I genuinely feel that if only I was more attractive, maybe she'd start talking to me as well as M. Keep in mind, there's zero romance involved.\n\nI mean, I don't think I'm being jealous. M *is* handsome, and he works out a lot. He's funny, and is pretty cool. But as far as other traits go, he's had a reputation for being a bit of an asshole, for being a bully to students he doesn't like, and especially for having an inferiority complex. He and I compete in everything, from maths to language to sciences.\n\nAs for me, I'm confident, I get top grades, I make F laugh, I'd say I'm fun to hang out with. But based on her behaviour, I'm guessing that purely on the grounds that I'm not as appealing to look at as M, she prefers him to hang out with over me.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "A little background: My dad married my stepmom when I was 4 years old. My stepmom has a daughter that is 2 months younger than me (now 28). My bio mom and her bio dad were out of the picture  for most of our lives. I also have a younger full bio blood sister that I was raised with. I am very close with my bio sister but have always struggled with with my step sister. Throughout my childhood and teenage years my stepsister continually bullied my sister and I and frequently spread rumors about us at school. She was just in general a complete terror to live with (full blown temper tantrums into adulthood, only calls when she needs something, threw my dog at me once while calling ME a bitch, etc.). Around age 18 she ran away with an older boyfriend (stoner Dale Gribble) of 2 weeks after being caught seeking him into my parents' house. Since she left my parents' house I didn't hear from her a whole lot except when she wanted something. She didn't speak to our parents for years and spent many years where she stopped calling father dad and started refusing to him by his first name. This had to be super hurtful to him as my dad raised her and her bio dad was never in the picture. A year and a half ago my dad took his own life after a lengthy illness. It was very painful and unexpected. Since then my step sister has been around a lot more due to moving back to the area and my dad not being around to curb my stepmom's spending on my step sister. My step sister is now pregnant by the same boyfriend she ran away with at 18 for the 4th time unexpectedly, 3rd pregnancy she has decided to to keep. She just had a baby last April and this one is due in May. My stepmom is really pushing me to go to the baby shower to \"support\" my \"sister\" but I REALLY do not want to go. On top of my step sister being one of the most toxic people in my family she also constantly feels the need give me advice on how to get pregnant and how to be a good parent. This is coming from a woman who lives in a tiny apartment with soon to be three kids, three cats, some fish and a stoner version of Dale Gribble baby daddy (SDGBD). I could deal with all the dumb advice if my husband and I didn't keep lose pregnancies, one of which was topic and nearly killed me about a year ago. SDGBD also has a habit of saying inappropriate things about my pregnancies losses such as asking if they had to \"cut my baby out\" in front of my 6 year old nephew (bio sister's kiddo) causing him to be sad that I'm a \"mommy without a baby.\" Stoner Dale has also informed my 5 year old niece (his daughter) of my pregnancies apparently because she enjoys giggling to people at the dinner table that I \"killed my babies and let them die.\" My husband has told me I shouldn't go and I'm NTA but I know my stepmom will play the dead dad card and make me feel like shit.

      "description": "Backstory: My husband and I have been married over 3 years and together for 7. I’m 8 months pregnant with our first child. I just finished my bachelors in accounting this month. \n\nInfo that pertains to the story: My old brother missed our wedding due to him getting the reception and ceremony times mixed up. We got married about 45 minutes from where we live. \n\nMy in laws are really awesome people. They are supportive and never guilt us over anything. We take vacations with them for several reasons. They plan vacations 2 years in advance. Most of the time we just have to pay for flights. Which for someone that is paying for their last semesters of school, it’s really helpful.\n\nWe were planning on taking a vacation with my family in January. My parents knew we were trying and told them we would go if we didn’t get pregnant too fast. We got pregnant really fast and couldn’t go.\n\nMy husband and sister had a huge falling out. My sister was 15 at the time &amp; slept over at our house. I went to work at 6 am. They were hanging out. My husband told my sister she needed to put on a bra, because he could see things that made him uncomfortable. She then acted as if he was hitting on her. \n\nI was abused by my step grandpa from a very young age. My husband has been my rock. I can’t count the times he’s gone to therapy with me to help me through everything. I don’t by for a second that my husband hit on my sister. I have 4 other sisters whom I’ve asked if he ever made them uncomfortable, never. I’ve had two really close friends that lived with us. I asked them if he’s even hit on them or made them uncomfortable, never. This caused a huge rift in my family as I sided with my husband.\n\nNow my family acts as if this didn’t happen.\n\n\nOn to the actually story:\n\nMy 18 year old sister (the one who had an issue with my husband) is getting married. In October, on a cruise. We had two trips already planned for this year. First is a family reunion with my husbands family. Again, we only have to pay for flights. Been planned for over two years. My family has a cabin in Alaska. We really wanted to go last year but I couldn’t as I was taking summer school classes. We planned on going this year. My in laws really wanted to go with us. We bring friends so this isn’t an issue. We only have to pay for flights, food to share, and any fishing trips we’d like to do. \n\nMy husband and I both make pretty good money, but we just remodeled our house due to the baby coming. We pay a mortgage and have two car payments. \n\nOn to the cruise, we have to pay for my 9 month old baby to go as a full person. This means we have to put down a deposit of $750 before the 28th of December. We have to pay to fly down to the state of the cruise. We have to pay for a rental car to drive at least another hour. And probably have to pay for a motel for the night. I’m total over $3,000 at least.\n\nI told my parents that I was really nervous draining my savings to put this deposit down for a cruise right before our first child. My dad called and was really upset. He said that we have shunned their family. (We haven’t. We still visit and hang out.) That we only go on vacations with my in laws. That the only reason we were going to Alaska was because my in laws were going. He offered to pay for my baby to go on the cruise, but I already owe them thousands for my car. Which I pay them $500 each month for. I don’t want to have them pay for my baby or owe them more money. They said we needed to drop the thing that happened with my sister (now it’s just a misunderstanding). But it makes my husband uncomfortable. I would be uncomfortable hanging out with someone that accused me of pretty much being a pedophile. \n\nMy step mom text me this morning that I should take my dads offer. That they didn’t think that I would act this way after my brother missed my wedding. (He’s a 25 year old that has no kids that had to drive 45 minutes. I wasn’t even upset with my brother. He was already upset enough at himself)\n\nIt’s not that we don’t want to go, I’m just trying to go what’s best for my family. My husband is upset that my family is guilt tripping me and that they upset me. I’ve been crying most of the day yesterday as I’m a huge tender heart and am very susceptible to guilt. \n\nI’m not sure what to do. I’ve had such bad anxiety today and feel terrible. We are having Christmas Eve dinner at their house tonight and I don’t know what to do or say. I just don’t know if I’m the asshole here. ",

      "description": "Hi all, first post here.  As you can tell from this username, I no longer partake in the smoking of cannabis, but I've been thinking about this incident that occurred about 10 years ago.\n\nI had recently moved to a new area and was at a crowded outdoor reggae concert by myself.  I brought a small bag of joints to share and had maybe smoked one when a cute girl approached and started talking to me.  After a minute she turned and ran away, I immediately checked my pockets and realized someone had stolen the bag.  \nAfter a few minutes of searching, I see the girl sitting next to a dirty looking guy in the open field behind the crowd.  I quickly walked through the crowd getting as close to them as possible, at this point I can see him holding the bag laughing and talking to the girl.  \nBy the time he saw me and started to stand, I was right there and just hit him once, hard, across the jaw.  He went down quick, bag still in hand.  I grabbed the joints and just walked back into the crowd as the girl screamed at the top of her lungs.  I ended up just leaving since I really dont like to fight, but I don't regret taking back what was mine.",

      "description": "Gotta admit there's more to it than the title says.\n\nLast semester a new girl (lets call her Sarah) joined our school and she was pretty alone which is why i brought her into my friends circle. I've had a girlfriend at that time and noticed that the new girl was crushing on me. She kept a lowkey flirty attitude and said it was all fun and games (i played along sometimes). Throughout the semester we got really close and helped each other out a lot and talked more.\n\nMidway through my gf cheated on me and broke up, told the new girl about it and she spend a lot of time with me trying to get through this etc.\nA week later Sarah confessed her feelings to me but i rejected her since i was still having heart ache from my last relationship. She took it cool and nothing really changed and we kept talking, sometimes pretty flirty. This went on for 2 more months till the semester was over. At the last day of school we went into a nice bar and spend about 4 hours just talking on and on. Sarah eventually asked me if i could imagine being in a relationship with her but i took quite some time to think of what to say. She rephrased her question and asked if i want to move our relationship into more of a friend level or into a closer one. I told her that i would rather be friends for now since I'm still pretty fucked up from my last relationship. Although it looked like she died a bit on the inside, she was still happy to talk to me and nothing really changed. \n\nWe had a week of holidays in which we still texted each other but never really managed to meet. The first two weeks of school she even helped me to make my own schedule and she helped me with some other school stuff as well. A few weeks later on a weekend i was out with friends and met a new girl(lets call her Kate), it was more or less love on first sight but i couldn't bring myself to tell Sarah about her. \n\nI was at Kate's place and got to know her parents and we eventually got together, Sarah didnt know anything about it and we still kept talking. A week ago on Monday i went to school with a bunch of love bites on my throat/neck and Sarah noticed, quite visible sad but didn't say anything. We still talked but she seemed rather depressed whenever she saw me. On Wednesday we stood outside and another friend of mine came and asked me about Kate while i was standing next to Sarah. Sarah just walked away and i haven't spoken to her in about a week and dont really know what to do. Am i the asshole?\n\nSorry for the textwall and for my grammar. ",

      "description": "Sorry for format if anything, on mobile, I'll try and make this short. \n\nSome backstory - While I can say my parents love me, they definitely weren't nicest tbh. My mother would psychology abuse me and my dad never payed attention to me when it came to my emotions, telling me to just man up. Both had a rough past cause my dad used to drink and hit my mom and me (I have 2 older sisters, but as far as Ik he didnt do anything to them.) And as I said, is bad with emotions, thinking they aren't necessary.\n\nI'm sorry if some info seems useless, just thought it helps. So, in sophomore year of high school, my mother started to talk to other men online on Facebook. My mother told my sisters who in turn told me and we were very upset with ourselves. What made us feel shitty is that we said to ourselves if it was the other way around, we'd tell our mom straight up. But here we are keeping it a secret from our father. It got to the point where I actually helped my mother see one of the men she was talking to. She even pleaded with me to keep it a secret from my dad and sisters that I was doing that. Now, in senior year of high school, I come to see my parents cuddling on the couch and looking sad. They said it was nothing but I knew what happened. My dad found one of the messages my mom sent to one of the men, and obviously shit hit the fan. But after all that, they came to terms with each other and then worked on their relationship. But I learned that he found out about 1 of the men and she never told him it was multiple other guys, to this day she still never told the truth. He still believes it was only 1 guy, and my sisters eventually let go of the situation, saying they didnt care anymore. Also, after my dad found out, he started to become a bit more open, hes still a bit of an ass but I can see he's trying.  I may not like my father but I do believe he deserves this truth, it's only right. It's been 3 years since the \"truth\" came out and we're all still lying to him. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n",

      "description": "First time poster, and I’m on mobile, so please bare with me. \n\nA little background detail:\n\nI started school a few months ago and have a carpool arrangement with one of my classmates. This was supposed to make things easier on both of us financially. We had agreed to split gas 50/50 and, because I know he has 3 kids at home, and I’m too nice of a person to start a confrontational discussion, I have been very lenient about him missing payments. He’s now more than $400 behind. My boyfriend and family wanted me to cut off the arrangement a while ago, but I didn’t want to leave my classmate stranded. \n\nNow for the accident:\n\nWe were on our way out of town in my truck (we always take my truck because his car doesn’t have winter tires, and I always drive because he only has a learners permit) when we hit a patch of ice and started fishtailing. We crossed the highway, hit the ditch, and the truck rolled over twice. We are both ok, just some minor bumps and bruises, but the truck did great at protecting us while we rolled. We were both taken to the hospital in an ambulance, and the last I saw him, I was being wheeled into emergency. He was discharged before I was. \n\nUpon being released, I tried calling his girlfriend (his phone was lost in the accident) and she then proceeded to message me reaming me out about the accident. She publicly tried to accuse me of being on my phone (my screen time and history prove that I wasn’t) and said that I intentionally put her boyfriends life in danger, along with a slue of other insults and nasty language. It is important to note that she was not in the car with us, and was not there to know exactly what happened. \n\nNow, I’ve decided that I do not want to drive him anymore, and I don’t care if he doesn’t have another way to get around. I feel as though his girlfriend verbally attacked me for something that was in no way my fault, and if he’s not feeding her false information, he’s perpetuating it by not correcting her. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I just cut off our arrangement and don’t pick him up for school next week?\n\nTL;DR - My classmate and I got into an accident, and his girlfriend verbally attacked me after. AITA if I cut off our driving arrangement and leave it to him to figure out?",

      "description": "When I met my wife, she was pursuing a career as a stand-up comedian. She was constantly going to open mics, writing, and doing shows. She was given a highly sought after but unpaid position at our city's biggest comedy club opening for the touring headlining comic. At the time she was making 2-3k year with comedy and had no other income other than child support from an ex. She wasn't making much money but was ambitious and we loved each other, and my 60k job was enough to get us by so we got married.  After that she cut back on her writing/performing and took time to be 'happy.' After a year or so of this I asked her if she really wanted to be a comedian, she said yes, and I proposed a 6 month period to get her comedy career back on track and on a trajectory to make a full time adult income. If that didn't work, she would pursue another more predictably successful career. She agreed and kept track of hours spent on comedy. It was 14hrs/week during that period and she hadn't achieved the needed success so comedy was turned into a hobby and do a new career it was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe wanted to go to school to become an on-air radio personality. I shot it down b/c its another profession where there are a handful of people making enough to pay a mortgage and endless people trying to get that job and making no money. She gave me a lot of flak for this. She wanted to respond to a craigslist ad for a 26k receptionist job, but as a very intelligent woman with a BA in journalism, I knew she was capable of establishing herself in a career that would eventually pay at least 50k and set that as a minimum salary for careers to consider. She says that that is insane, and that no reasonable person would ever put an actual number, especially one so ludicrously high on an expected salary from their spouse and that before we were married, I never let her know I would have this expectation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI now make much more $, so money isn't really the issue, I just didn't sign up for a sugar daddy situation and expect my wife to achieve her professional potential.

My mom is an accountant, and her former client is the elderly woman in this story. I have never met this woman before in my life (my sister has met her ONCE), and I don’t even know her name. For the sake of this, I will refer to her as EF. \n\nEF calls my sister out of the blue today. She immediately starts in and asks my sister to come over and help her. When asked about what she needs help with, EF says she needs help with everything. Doing dishes, unloading the dishwasher, laundry, helping her changed, helping her in the bath, etc. Also, due to her allergies, we need to be entirely fragrance free and to wash our clothes in only baking powder to remove any fragrances. \n\nApparently she is infamous for doing this with people. She gets them to help her with small stuff, then ends up committing them to hours of unpaid labor. I am also not trained at all in medical care in any sort, so I am not comfortable helping somebody with those sorts of tasks. \n\nAITA for not wanting to help her, even though it sounds like she needs it?",

But I believe deep down she genuinely cares its just that her constant fluctuation between funny and mad makes most people hate her. \n\nSo i tell my friend who’s in drama club that I like her, just for comedic effect (like,,, joking about me and my dysfunctional state around this teacher is funny) but then the next day my teacher goes a bit mad and screams at my friend for a full hour and kinda pulls her parents into it, and when asked why she took so long by school staff says my friend had some emotional issues (well,,, she couldn’t have said that she had weird life lessons to teach could she) so now my friend hates her. \n\nActually a handful of my friends hate her because of how she’s practically mad and her mood swings are horrendous, but I still like her a lot and I try not to defend her too much because I do find her annoying sometimes, but ultimately I find her mix of sadistic and caring really cute (yeah I know its weird but just,,, I’m 17 and weak please forgive me)\n\nSo AITA for liking a teacher that is so rude to my friends?

We've since started using condoms. \nI got the abortion pills (which we'd agreed I'd take if it ever came to that) and took them at home this weekend.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after I took the pills, my boyfriend headed out to the gym. He asked me if I wanted to come as he was leaving, so I texted asking if he seriously thought I should work out while miscarrying, and he responded that he had forgotten. It bothered me a little that he didn't think to stay with me, but I figured I'd handle it on my own, so I didn't ask.\n\nLess than a half hour later, I was in horrible pain, uncontrollably puking all over the bed, so I called him and asked him to come back. He came right away and put the sheets in the laundry, and everything else in the bathtub (I washed them the next day). He asked me if he could go back to the gym, but then seemed to feel bad (I was curled up in agony at this point) and said forget it. \n\nHe stayed home for the rest of the night and got me water and ice packs whenever I needed them, which I really appreciate. \n\nBut I was in horrible pain for hours, and I kept asking him to talk to me to distract me, and he would say like a sentance, and then go back to reading on his phone, until I reminded him to talk again. He kept saying he couldn't think of anything to say, but.  \nA- he's a massively talkative person who I've spent hours listening to when he's on long winded rants, and now suddenly when I need him to say literally anything to keep me distracted, he's speechless.   \nB- I asked if he'd read me a book, and he kept changing the subject when I'd suggest it.\n\nI get not wanting to entertain someone for hours, but considering this pregnancy was both our responsibilities, yet I was the one going through the hell of the abortion, I feel like it's a fair ask that he at least read me a book while I sit in pain for the both of us.\n\nI told him that I feel like he spent his time wishing he was anywhere but there, and he pointed out that he helped a lot and I wasn't being appreciative.\n\nI'm grateful that he gave me physical support for what I couldn't get on my own, but I feel like he dropped the ball on emtional support, which I really needed.\n\nAITA for being mad at the lack of emotional support?

      "description": "Okay so, this is a very long story, but I'll try and make it as short as possible (it's still really long)\n \nNearly 3 years ago, one of my doctors noticed that I always brought a handheld game system into the office while I waited. He outright asked me if I wanted some of his video games. He told me that, and I quote, he \"lives in excess\" and has \"multiples of pretty much every game console\" in his house. So he said it'd be no big deal to give me one or two of his consoles and some games. Again, *he* asked *me* if I wanted them. I was *not* the one to beg to him in the first place. \n \nAt the time, he asked me to write down a list of what consoles and games I'd be most interested in, bring it in to him next time I came in, and he'd try and throw something together before the following appointment. So I did.  \n \nHowever, when I came in for the following appointment, there was no box of games. He told me something came up and he didn't have the chance to do it. Okay, fine. I'm in no hurry. No big deal. But he said next time, for sure, he'd have something for me. \n \nIf the title of this thread was any indication... \"next time\" never seemed to come... \n \nI go to his office just about every month. I've been going there for nearly 3 years now. And every time I saw him, I was met with a \"Sorry, something came up. But I promise I'll have it for you next time.\" \n \nEventually, I outright said to him \"Look, if you can't do it for some reason, I understand. Just... tell me you can't do it and I'll stop asking.\", but no, he insists that he will TOTALLY have something for me \"next time\". \n \nDuring all of this time, I've also been talking to his son who works in the office (he's not a doctor, he just works in the office doing office things) about various things, including all of the promises his dad keeps making. He has also insisted that he'll try and help throw something together for me. I've also told him as well that if he can't, just tell me he can't and I'll drop it... but just like his dad, he insists that he'll have something for me next time, every time. \n \nSo this has been going on for a long time now. Nowadays, the doctor in question doesn't even really work in that office anymore (he has multiple offices that he owns) and I usually see one of the other doctors there. The doctor's son however still works there, and he still insists that he's totally gonna get some games together for me. \n \nFast forward to the beginning of January 2019. It was the first Friday of the month, and I once again ran into the doctor's son. He **outright says to me** \"Good news! My dad finally got together a box of games for you! So this weekend I'll go pick it up and have it here for you by Monday. I'll call you to let you know when to pick it up!\"  \n \nWanna guess what happened? \n \nMonday came and I heard nothing. By Friday that week, I still heard nothing. So I called the office and asked to speak with him. The person answering the phone told me that he was in a meeting and he would call me back ASAP. Never heard from him. \n \nSo the following Monday, I called again. Same thing. Called again on Friday. Same thing. No return call whatsoever. \n \nFast forward to February 1st (Friday), I had another appointment there. So I walked into the office and asked to speak with him. After a few minutes, he came out and told me that he'd been busy and hadn't had the chance to go to his dad's place and get the box of games, but that he was, *absolutely* going to his dad's house that weekend, would pick up the box of games and would bring it in on Monday, for sure, 100%, he insisted as hard as a person can possibly insist that something is, for sure, going to happen. \n \nGuess what didn't happen!  \n \nMonday comes and nothing. Friday comes and nothing. So I called this Monday morning and once again asked to speak with him. Was told that he wasn't in yet, and that they would send him a message and mark it as high priority. \n \nIt is now Wednesday and I am still yet to hear from him and am getting increasingly irritated at repeatedly being told \"soon\" even though \"soon\" never seems to come. \n \nAITA for pestering him to follow through with his promise that he and his father have continued to insist is going to happen? \n \n**tl;dr: Doctor and his son insist that they're going to give me a box containing some of their video game consoles, but haven't delivered nearly 3 years later and refuse to tell me that they can't do it. Also of note is that THEY offered it to ME, I was not the one to inquire in the first place.**",

      "description": "I was a in High School. I really didn’t have any friends that year, but I found a “friend group” who I usually hung out with. Here are some examples of who they really were. \n\nMajor event one: I gave a ride to one of my “friends” to one of our other friends show. I agreed, and she came along with my folks who also wanted to go. She was grateful. Fast forward and I didn’t have a ride to a party. I asked anyone in the group chat for a ride if they could, and that girl automatically tells me to stop being needy and makes me feel like shit. Note this was the only time I ever asked for anything in that group. \n\nMajor event two: they threw a party and sent info to the chat. I asked where it was. No response. I had a vague idea of where it was cuz of the neighborhood so my mum took me. Two hours go by and I see a snap chat of everyone having a good time and another couple hours later still no response, I got my mom to pick me up from where I was, cried my eyes out, and told my mom I have no friends no one cares about me (side note: I love my mom, and I can tell even yelling that to her made her upset)\n\nLastly the big one: I told someone who I trusted that I thought that group was fake and they weren’t real friends. One day out of the bloom one person said that “Hey why does (my name) say we’re fake?” I had a moment, breathed in, and told them they were fake. They were complete assholes to me, and I don’t know why I considered them friends. They all felt like I was an asshole for saying that, and I left that group saying that they were all fake. \n\nI have many more of these to tell, because I feel like an asshole for being mean, but question am I really after looking at the whole picture and seeing what other people did. \n\nTL;DR Group of “friends” made me feel bad, called them out, never spoke to them again ",

      "description": "My husband is a veteran, who enjoys everything that has to do with guns. During the week he goes to the range with his friends around 1-3 times. On the weekends he’ll usually be hunting or participating in his rifle association. He also suffers from PTSD, insomnia, and depression so I try to let him do the things he enjoys to help him with his hardships.\n\nFast forward to the present, I have never hosted a event for my family as I have always been super busy with work. My nephew, who I love very dearly was about to turn 2, so I decided to offer to host the party for my sister since I know her house is extremely messy since she has to take care of a infant.\n\nOnce I started cleaning I realized how unsuitable our home might appear to guests, we have many flags, medals, and guns mounted everywhere around the house. I decided that the biggest thing that needed to be addressed were the weapons, so I asked if we could temporarily take them down.\n\nHe agreed to take them all down except for one, which is located right above our fireplace. His reason being that his very close friend died literally by his side in battle, and something he had always promised was to keep and honor all of his memorabilia, as he doesn’t have a wife or children. \n\nHe believes removing his weapon from the mantle would be a dishonor to his friend, and thinks that he is already being accommodating enough by removing the rest of the weapons. \n\nI’m not that satisfied on one hand I do empathize for my husband, on the other I don’t want parents to be uncomfortable with a weapon in their view, especially with kids around.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, if you have any questions feel free to ask. I’m getting ready for work currently so I might not be able to reply quickly but I will definitely get around to it.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "A couple of months ago I [24M] started developing feelings toward my friend [24F] who happened to have a boyfriend at that time. It turned out that she also liked me and their relationship was going downhill for some time.\n\nFinally, she broke up with him (after a 5-year relationship) and we started dating. He never knew about my existence and she didn't tell him that I was the reason for the breakup. As far as I knew, he still loved her and wanted to be with her, but she didn't feel anything toward him anymore.\n\nAfter dating for three months we started to have some disagreements. Basically, I became very involved and wanted her to be my full-time girlfriend, while she wanted to stay in a more loose, friends-with-benefits kind of relationship (but remain faithful to each other). I became frustrated, because I was the only one initiating contact and meetings and she never wrote me first. Shortly before Christmas we decided to have a break and stop seeing each other for some time.\n\nAt a New Year's Eve party (that she didn't attend), our mutual friend who has very good contact with her told me that she started seeing her ex.\n\nI was heartbroken (and drunk). I did a very stupid thing. I wrote to him that I was the reason for the breakup and that we dated and she wanted to come back to him because it didn't work out well with me.\n\nHe thanked me and immediately told her about it. Needless to say, she hates me now.\n\nIt turned out that they only met to talk. Our mutual friend portrayed it like she definitely wanted to get back to him, which turned out not to be true.\n\nI feel like I did a good thing for him telling him the truth. But I broke her trust and probably destroyed my relationship with her (and i still love her). I am also very angry at myself because I was drunk and misinformed and wouldn't do it in other circumstances. AITA?",

      "description": "In every wedding reception I've experienced there's always a Curious George waiting for me as I take photos. Usually 4 or 5 years old, follows me around everywhere because I'm doing something cool, unlike the adults who are sitting.\nI'm usually really friendly with them, when I get a chance I'll pop in a cheap lens and let them fiddle with the controls and make it do things. I'll sit down on the floor with them and let them pretend to be a photographer while I get my bearings on the crowd and check other stuff. \n\nHowever, this particular Curious George liked to drop and throw things. Pretty purposefully it seemed, I think they just liked comparing dropping different masses of objects..I don't know, but when I sat down with them and they tried to throw my camera (still attached to my body via sling) he was automatically fired. Picked him up, said loudly \"no. You do not throw other people's stuff\" and pulled the camera from his hands. He began wailing and screaming until the mother came up and started shouting at me for making her kid cry.\nI said he tried to throw my camera and first she asked why on Earth I'd give him my camera like she's never played with her kid, and then said it could handle it and I should have gotten her first.\n\nThe groom, also my friend, said I upset a large portion of his now wife's family and they don't want to see me again and don't want him to pay me. \nAm I the asshole in this?",

      "description": "Let me start off by saying that I'm not good at being a direct person. I have social anxiety and never have been good at telling people how I feel. So, lets get started. It might be long. I (19F) live with my S/O (21M) and our roommate (21M). the roommate, who we'll call Daniel, is my bfs best friend. They went to middle school and high school together, and we all attended the same high school. For some background info on how Daniel came to be my roommate, is that after me and my bf moved across the country and were living together for a few months, Daniel came to visit. He never got a ride back, and we just decided to let him move in. \n\"How cool will that be? Help around the house, rent spit in 3rds, and a cool friend to hang out with,\" We thought at first. But after a while, things didn't really go that way. \nHe got a job at a big name chain retailer when he first moved in. He worked almost every single day for maybe, three months? Until one day he said he got fired for reporting racism in the work place. Now, Daniel likes to lie, so we don't know whether to believe that or not. \nSo shortly after, he said he was joining the army. Months later, he never did. \nThen he said he was joining Americorps. He submitted an application and got an interview! Daniel put down my bf's dad as a reference. My bf's dad called me and my bf one day and said, \"Hey did you know Daniel doesn't have a driver's license?\" Because Americorps called him and was asking about Daniel. We had no idea. \nWe asked him about it, to which he responded, \"don't know. Just never got one.\" Keep in mind that he doesn't have a car. He drives me and my bf's cars, and at the time we didn't know he didn't have a driver's license. \nHe never got the job at Americorps. \nMonths pass and he doesn't apply for any jobs. Every morning I wake up and go into the shared space of the living room, and he's playing my ps3 that was my Christmas gift many years ago. And then I work full time, over fourty hours a week, to come home to see him playing my ps3 more. Every single day that's all he does. He has his own xbox one in his room, but he never plays it. \nMe and my boyfriend are getting sick and tired of him doing nothing but playing video games, when my bf and I are working our asses off full time. I feel like it's unfair, and that he's using our house as a frat vacation home. \nMy boyfriend is getting really annoyed, but he's afraid to tell him. He doesn't know how to tell someone his own age to, \"man up and get a job,\" and we know that if we even try to start a conversation he'll go lock himself in his room and have a douchey attitude, because that's what Daniel has always done. On top of that, my bf is just like me: he hates confrontations and is scared to bring stuff up. But he's told be before how much he hates waking up to see Daniel play video games, and then to work, come home, and watch Daniel play more video games. \nDaniel is home literally all the time, but never cleaned up his messes at all. We had to initiate a chore chart to get him to clean. All he does is play my console. \nThe other day I got the idea to take my ps3 and move it into my room, but it took me a few days to actually do it because I knew how petty it was. But after a few more days of thinking it over and getting more and more frustrated with Daniel, I decided enough was enough. I unplugged my system and took it into my room.\nDaniel has bought games for the ps3, as well as two controllers. I left those out for him, as they're his property. But the system is not. \nI told my boyfriend that I'll let his friend play my system--IF he gets a job. But we haven't told Daniel. Me and my boyfriend need to learn to talk about things, I know. \nI did it because I was hoping that having some time with nothing to do would make him realize he needs to get a job. I will admit I also did it to be petty, because it's my system, and he doesn't deserve it if he doesn't even have a job or a driver's license as a 21 year old. \nSo: AITA in this situation? \nAnd as a side note, I'm new on reddit and also on mobile, so I apologize for any weird formatting or misused terms. \nEDIT (update): thank you all for your comments and judgment. Daniel has been applying for jobs, and is getting his lisence soon. I moved the console back into the living room, because he is now making an effort. ",

      "description": "This happened about a week ago and I'm still kinda pissed about it, sorry for length.\n\nSorry for any formatting issues (I'm on mobile) and spelling/grammar mistakes (im just stupid).\n\nI had a snack in my room and the empty bowl was still on my bed, for some reason i had my contact case and $13 inside of it. My grandmother went downstairs (my room is in the basement) to turn my tv off after i went to school and took the bowl back up with her on her way out. She realized what was inside when she was already upstairs and since she was on her way out for work, she put it on the bathroom sink next to my tooth brush (im the only one who uses the downstairs bathroom to brush my teeth cause it's closer).\n\nMy mom was doing laundry or something and found saw the money on the counter. She then decided to take it for gas money, most likely fully aware that it was mine cause it was with my stuff. She didn't ask me and i probably would've given it to her if she did.\n\nLater that night, i realized my money was gone and asked about it at dinner. She told me she took it and said she'd pay me back but i was still a little mad because she has an awful track record of paying me back and probably still owes me money from before to this day. She didn't even apologize and i was visibly slightly pissed off.\n\nShe and my step dad went to wawa to get my money from the atm later that night. I asked for a smoothie (that shit is like crack to me lol). It was the least she could do for taking my money and not even apologizing and she said maybe.\n\nShe comes back with drinks for herself and my step dad and i ask her for my money and if she got me a smoothie. She hands me $8 and tells me the other $5 is in her jacket downstairs. However, she didn't get me the smoothie so i was a little upset. \n\nI go downstairs to get the other $5 and my grandmother is in the kitchen so i tell her I'm a bit upset and she told me she was about to buy it but my mother said no cause she didn't like my attitude at dinner. SHE STOLE MY MONEY.  I also asked her why she put my money upstairs in the first place and she explained.\n\nMy mother overheard me and came storming down the stairs, yelling at me for \"obsessing\" over $8 (she spent $8 but took all $13). There's no winning an argument with my mom so i apologized and asked if i could go take a walk to blow off some steam. \n\nI grabbed my phone, jacket, lighter, and cigarettes and leave my neighborhood in the freezing cold to get away from her (she has been physically abusive in the past so i was a little scared). Meanwhile, im texting my friend because he said i could crash at his house for the night. I knew i would get in trouble if i just went so i called my dad to see if he would cover for me (staying at his house was also an option but he was bartending and i wanted to see my friend). \n\nMy dad says he's not comfortable with covering for me but he'd leave work to pick me up and take me to his house.\n\nI then sat in a Marshall's bathroom until he picked me up cause i was afraid of what my mother would do if i went home. She called me and started giving me shit for leaving the neighborhood and calling my dad and all i could say was \"i didn't wanna spend the night at home.\"\n\nAITA for leaving? The argument got pretty heated and i could take staying in the same house as her that night.\n\nI think its kinda fucked up for a 42yo woman to take money from her 15yo son without asking or having the common decency to apologize but i kinda feel like an asshole for being so upset\n\nTL;dr: my mother took some money from me and didn't apologize, the argument got heated, and i left to stay with my dad for the night\n",

In the email, FF brown-nosed in every possible way. They complimented me 3 times in the first sentence. They referred to a very specific thing we discussed in a really artificial way, clearly following some formula that says \"refer back to conversational points so they know you listened/so they remember you.\" It was something like \"I really enjoyed hearing that story about the time 3.5 years ago that your pencil broke in an exam and you had to ask for another one but the teacher gave you a pen instead and then you finished the exam!\"\n\nWIBTA if I give FF some gentle constructive criticism about their email style? On the one hand, it was cringeworthy and artificial and someone should tell them to relax and speak naturally. On the other hand, I tried to write a response in 10 different ways and every version came out like a backhanded insult.\n\nOr WIBTA if I don't say anything?",

The people below her at work have been doing the wrong thing for 7 months and she just found out (it's not her fault at all). But now she has to fix it somehow. Later when I leave work I talk to her on the way home and she tells me she has a head ache. I get home she is already working. So we have short cauasel conversation. I play a video game, meditate, clean cat throw up, clean the Roomba and just chill. We have some more short conversation, I think we are on the same page. Then she tells me she isn't really hungry and we should order take out. I agree and then she says she not even hungry. She said it was my fault because I was annoying her while she worked. She tells me to go get food by myself. So I walk out to my car and go attempt to get food. I just sat in parking lot with her screaming at me on the phone on how horrible I make her life( I got a smoothie). I apparently have an attitude and act like an asshole every single day when I come home from work. \n\nThis is where I genuinely understand that some days I am an asshole like my father was an asshole to my family. The most days I genuinely try to act nice and trying to uplift her day cuz I know a day of teaching is worse than my day. I feel as if something may be mentally wrong with me because I don't realize I have a bad attitude.",

      "description": "This happened a few weeks ago:\n\nI have not had much luck with online dating. Guys on apps are either creepy right off the bat or slowly become creepy as the conversation gets deeper. \n\n\nSo, in comes this guy, let's call him Jackson. I matched with him and we spoke for several days and he seemed to be the only dude that was not strange. Kind of took me by surprise because at any point I expected things like \"so do you want to hook up?\" like I've received from guys before. But Jackson was very different and actually asked me about my day, discussed my hobbies and I really enjoyed talking to him. He also mentioned that he hadn't had much luck with online dating as well so I was able to relate to him on that too. \n\n\nAfter a few days, he was the only one I had been actively talking to and moved onto texting instead of being on the app. When he had asked me to meet up for a lunch date, I instantly said that I would do my best to request the day off from work. I immediately scheduled for the day off and it got approved but when I had entered the messages again, I noticed he said “but wait, before you do that, are you okay with me being in a wheelchair?” I told him “that’s totally fine” but that was more of a knee-jerk response because I actually wasn’t fine. I was glad he was upfront with me about that before we went on the date, rather than finding out when I got there. \n\n\nSo, the day before the date, I texted him “Sorry, they called me in so I have to go to work.” I had actually just cancelled the day off and went to work anyways. He replied “no problem, we’ll schedule for another time then.” A few days passed and we hadn’t talked and he sent a final message saying “I’m sorry” and he then proceeded to un-match me on the dating app too. A part of me feels that I was deceived into liking him because he wasn’t in a wheelchair in any of his pictures. But I also feel sad because I had made good conversation with him but in the end could not see myself dating him. \n\nAITA?    ",

I'd tell her to remember since it isn't our job to clean up after her, but it was pretty much every other weekend this was happening so I started being nice in asking her to clean her shit up but ended up being blunt and saying she shouldn't go to his house if she can't remember to do her chores before she leaves. \n\nThen she had him over for a 2 week period, where he didn't work, he was alone in the house (I was super uncomfortable with that) she gave him her house key which he lost. L didn't buy food to replace what he ate, pay for the utilities he used while he was there and never cooked, or cleaned up after himself. The rental agreement was that we couldn't have anyone over who didn't live there for more than 4 days in a week. \n\nMy bf and I confronted By and L and said this had to stop because it wasn't fair. They responded with \"L should move in since he's here so often\" \nWe shut that down. \n\nThere's a lot more to it but that's the main issue we had that she couldn't admit that she wasn't doing her chores enough and had L over when he shouldn't have been.

      "description": "\nMe (23) and my partner (26) of 6months have been planning a weekend away to his parents holiday home for a while. We do not get to spend any time together in the week because of his job, and rarely for long at all on weekends because of both of our social schedules. I often get frustrated by this but he doesn’t see it as an issue. When I do see him we end up staying in because he’s tired or hungover. When I’ve tried to plan holidays before he can never get the time off, so this weekend and a chance to spend quality time for once was really important to me. \n\nRecently he told me his mum would also be at the house that weekend which I was fine with because yay, meeting the parents, relationship progression!  \n\nHe then decided to invite his friend and his new fling to the weekend trip away. I’ve met this friend once and it was quite awkward, I felt like a massive third wheel. Thought it’ll be okay I’ll get to know him, and we could all do cute double date coupley things all weekend. \n\nThe girlfriend broke things off with him yesterday, but the friend still wants to come. My boyfriend also was very reluctant to say no to this, under the impression that it would be a really fun time. I suggested that he could just go to see his friend on the Sunday evening when we get back if he were still in a bad way but this was ignored. \n\nPersonally, I don’t want to spend what was supposed to be a romantic weekend away worrying if I’m being insensitive by being cute and cuddly with my boyfriend in front of his heartbroken friend. I don’t really want to be the third wheel in what was supposed to be my first weekend of quality time in months. \n\nI get that he obviously wants to be there for his friend, but does the friend not have other (single) friends he can rely on for this, especially this weekend? If I were in this situation, I would not want to be around another couple.\n\nReddit, AITA?",

      "description": "Hey guys. \n\nBit of context... i'm 23 M and so are my 3 room mates. We're all really good pals from HS and have stayed really solid friends since, even though we all went elsewhere for college. In HS we conveniently all had girlfriends from the same friend group - so we chilled with that friend group all the time doing stupid shit... partying, late nights, mostly getting fucked up really, typical high school shit.  Since HS we have all broken up moved on etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've really moved away from the party life, i work for a consulting firm and have a second job with a tech startup and really just dont have time anymore, nor do my buddies (okay we still get drunk together on a saturday but hey, fuck it). My pals have interesting lifes, we have inspiring conversations, it's all good. The group of girls on the other hand really has not done anything, they are all kinda spoiled AF and still party all the time (nothing wrong with that i guess). Point being i dont really chill with these people anymore because we don't have anything in common, nothing interesting to talk about, just getting drunk, yet they keep trying to pull my buddies and i back in (to chill with them and our exs), this time for a friendsgiving. We've had parties like this before and it usually ends up with my and my pals cooking some nice meat and buying alcohol to have no food support or help cleaning. Last time i had a party with them i literally had to use a toothbrush to scrape a red vine off some grainy-tile in my house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bailed, and so did my roommates,and they're guilt tripping us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm i an asshole for just not wanting to spend my Friday with a group of people who i just don't really have much interest in or respect for, even though we were once close? I feel bad because I don't want to hurt any feelings but at the same time i dont like how they keep trying to pull me in by a loose thread and i gotta keep making excuses (pick up the darn cues!) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow does one move away from a friend group?

      "description": "Hi first time posting on this sub. English is not my first language so please go easy on me.\n\n1. A = business person 1\n\n2. B = business person 2\n\nI own a small local cafe. On the first week when I start out the cafe, I was approached by B saying he wants to buy the business. I decline since I was just starting out, but he insisted that I contact him if I ever consider selling.\n\n5 years later, I want to sell my cafe, in which I was contact by A. A is my ex-employee (and a distance friend), he is also a good worker. A’s wife is recently pregnant (4 months) so A wants to build a family and own a cafe. He offered to pay me by 12 instalments.\n\nI was also approached by B, who had owned a cafe before, he wants to buy the cafe for $5000 more than A over 12 instalments. He needs to take the loan from his sister. I was determined to sell to B at this point, but I didn’t say it to him. Then he went on radio silent, probably waiting for the loan.\n\nI got restless because of the radio silent, I contacted A if he is still interested. A is interested so we began discussing about how to run the business (who is the suppliers etc). I will need to train him for 2 weeks after the sale to get him started. Things are looking like I will sell it to A, although I didn’t expressly say it. A and his wife quit their jobs because they thought they are going to get the cafe.\n\nHowever, yesterday he asked for $2000 off on the first instalment, and he will reimburse in later instalments. Not a big problem since the money will be the same. Everything is set (except contract and payment) and A will own the cafe. I still had not expressly said that I will sell to him, all we did was discussing how business operates.\n\nOne day B randomly came by and with the money. This surprised me since there was no communication prior. B has money to pay the first instalment and everything else, he is ready to buy. I told him that I already talked to A and that I don’t want to break my word. B asked if A paid the first instalment yet, which he has not, so B paid me 25% of the first instalment. He too already quit his job. I told him to slow down.\n\nThat evening, A rushed to the cafe (very angry). He ask how could I do this and cried. B is chill, so he isn’t visibly upset but he clearly wants the cafe.\n\nHere are summary of info:\n\n1. B will run the cafe with his family of 5, which means he does not need to hire employees (big save). A only has his wife, so they need employees. This affects their prospect of paying the instalments.\n\n2. B owned a cafe before, so he knows how to operate one. A only worked for me and has left for the past 3 years. A’s wife is also pregnant so idk how long she can work.\n\n3. A is emotionally weak so he will not be able to hold his temper if he doesn’t get the cafe. B is emotionally strong.\n\n4. B is paying more for the cafe and the first instalment.\n\n5. It will break my heart for A, but I do want to sell to B because it’s practical.\n\nWIBTA if I sell to B?",

      "description": "I know this sounds like one of those, \"you know your NTA,\" post but I'm genuinely mixed about the situation and need to see what people think. If I get what I want, I'll delete this post.\n\nFor background history, my first memory is being woken up and told that my father is dead. I was not aware that he was dying. Maybe due to this, last words have always held importance to me. \n\nI was around 14 years old, possibly about to hit 15, when I learned that my grandfather went into the hospital for complications from a disease and that he wasn't expected to make it. He's the Grandpa on my father's side, and during my younger years I saw him as a father figure. He started traveling a ton in the years before his death, so I hadn't seen him for 4 or 5 years. I begged my mother to take me to see him. She said that we would. I reminded her multiple times and each time she said that we would. \n\nShe never took me. She said, and I quote, \"I didn't expect him to die.\" Keep in mind, we were told from the very beginning that he was on his deathbed. Afterwards I just couldn't stop thinking about how similar the situation was to my fathers death. Especially during my Grandpa's funeral.\n\nI've always had a bit of rocky relationship with her, but that was the first time I thought that I hated my mother. I'm 16 now, and I've been attempting to actually talk to my mom more and develop a better relationship with her, but I just can't get over my grudge. I confronted her about it the other day. She denied that I ever told her we should see him, that alone made me mad as it's a plain lie. Then when I told her that, she says, \"Sorry son, but you can't change the past.\" I'm not at all a crier, but that almost brought me to tears. How can you even say that?\n\nNow here's the part where I wonder if I'm the asshole. I'm being light in the title when I say I despise my mother. I don't want to speak to her ever again after I turn 18. The real reason I'm trying to talk to her more is so I won't leave on a bad note, and just maybe, I could actually understand some of her actions. No luck so far. There's plenty of reasons to not like her, my grandfather was just the beginning. Even when I'm actually having a good conversation and we're laughing, I can't get it out of my head. I don't care about her at all and when she's old, I won't be there to take care of her. Despite that, I still wonder if I'm just being immature about the whole thing.",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. My friend has a 5 month old baby and just found out she's pregnant again with her second but she's acting like it's her first pregnancy and the 5 month old doesn't even exist.\n\nBit of background: when her baby was born, let's call the baby summer, she didn't bond very well and didn't even hold the baby for the first 12 hours because she \"didn't know how\" her boyfriend, let's call him Jim, who is not the biological father, held the baby first, dressed her did her first nappy and bottle feed etc. (Biological father is out of the picture entirely) This of course led to post natal depression but she's never got help with it or admitted it to anyone but me and her boyfriend. She told her boyfriend a few months ago (I only just found this out) to take summer away because she can't cope and she's struggling and it's obvious she has not bonded at all. He said no he's not even her dad and never wants to be called dad etc he will always be Jim. She puts summer in a high chair in front of the TV or lays her on the floor and that's pretty much it, when she cries but isn't hungry she gives her Calpol to get her to go to sleep. As soon as Jim is home from work he is on full baby duty. Jim is from a town a few hours away and quite frequently he takes the baby to his parents and stays there for a few days while the mum stays at home by herself. This first happened when the baby was 5 days old. Jim's parents look after the baby while he goes out and has fun with his mates. \n\nNow she's pregnant again with Jim's baby this time and she says she's so excited to have a 'new baby' because new babies are cute. She also said because she's pregnant she needs to find something to do for the next 9 months while waiting for the baby because she's got nothing to do. Her period is literally only 2 days late and only just had a positive test, she's already thinking about the birth, telling her manager and parents etc. It's crazy. For anyone who doesn't know the first 12 weeks are sadly really high risk of losing the baby anything can happen. She's literally forgotten the 5 month old even exists of course she's got things to do for the next 9 months and that's raising the baby she's already got! I'm concerned for summer and the mum because the mum can't cope with the one she's got, let alone having 2 under 2, but won't seek help, I've told her to get help before but she just says she's better now and its only this current age she can't cope with. She's solely focused on being pregnant it's ALL she talks about.\n\nI'm really concerned so would I be the asshole for saying she needs to slow down, not solely focus on the new one until after 12 weeks and get some professional help with bonding with summer before anything else? \n\nTL;DR: my friend has a 5 month old baby who she can't cope with and is 1 month pregnant again already and acting like it's her first.",

      "description": "My sister (35 y.o), Anna, and me (23 y.o.) are not very close. But over the years I tried to have a relationship with her. She's lost many friends and family along the way and does not have a job. She stays home all day and chastises my parents, even though my parents have provided so much for her.\n\nWe did not grow up rich and my family has had some financial troubles. My parents have done their best by working multiple jobs to provide for us. However, my sister does not see it this way and thinks they're horrible for putting work above their children. Ironically, my sister is very spoiled and has gotten everything she's demanded. Let's just say my parents are one of the reasons why Anna is not a good person and for enabling her, but that's a different story. \n\nAs a result, Anna absolutely loathes my mom and talks crap about her and my mom is one of the reasons why I believe Anna may have depression. Now I know my mom is not a saint, but she's trying her best. My mom does love all of us deeply, and she really does want to help Anna. \n\nAnna has made numerous negative comments about my mom, and I don't like hearing them. I'll listen to her rants, but the rants become shouts, and it goes on for hours and is very tiring. I've told her to not be so consumed with hatred and to not waste energy being so hateful. I've told her to focus that energy elsewhere and to keep herself occupied with hobbies. All of our hangouts have just been one-sided conversations about how our mom sucks and thinks I'm siding with my mom and ignorant of everything because I won't join in the rants. I do not want to feed into her negativity. \n\nI've also offered to help her find a job,but she LOATHES working. I don't think her depression is preventing her from wanting to get a job, but rather she does not believe in working for money. She had an ex-bf who paid for everything and she's made comments to me such as, \"You can live the rest of your life comfortably now that you've worked full time for a couple years with the money you saved up. Just get a part-time job and rely on the government to pay for your rent and mortgage.\" She's so delusional and is very closed-minded, so convincing her otherwise is not worth the time. \n\nAnyway, I understand that maybe her going to work is going too fast, and I think professional help is the best option for her right now. I've suggested Anna to see a counselor but she is hesitant. There have been times that Anna has been open about seeing a counselor, but Anna said that she doesn't have enough money. I've offered to pay for her sessions, cause I genuinely want to help her out, but Anna refuses to take my money. But Anna doesn't believe in working, so it's a vicious loop...\n\nAITA for wanting to give up on Anna? Anna does not show any signs of wanting to help herself, so I can't force her to get help. I want to help her, but she's such a toxic person and I feel like my mental health is declining every time I'm around her.",

      "description": "I am American, husband is not. We had our Legal Marriage (LM) in spring '17, and our Wedding Reception (WR) when we began living together in Fall '17.\n\nI applied for his green card after our LM.\n\nAfter the wedding it was revealed that he was completely broke, after having told me he was well off. My parents gave him over $10k during the wedding reception (traditionally how it's done) and the day after our WR he revealed he had $1,500 left out of the 10k and he had given the $1,500 to his mother who was at the wedding &amp; did not need it. He asked to borrow 10k from me to support us until his work permit came in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHusband insisted he didn't want me to work and we had a big fight about that. Once his work permit arrived, he got a job in another state and told me I should stay with my parents while he worked for at least 3 months so that he could pay off his debts. Debts he never told me about before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finally got to the new state, we didn't talk much. He would go to work, come back, take a nap, wake up, eat dinner alone (if I made dinner, he would sometimes say, \"I feel like eating x\" and walk out without asking me if I wanted to go with him), then go back to sleep. On the weekends he spent half a day playing soccer, the other half napping it off, then would want to relax and be left alone. We barely spoke, no matter how often or how much I tried.\n\nHe got his green card in September and immediately went to visit his family back home, without me. When he came back, he was even worse. I set up a mediation with my dad and uncle, who flew to our home to speak to us. He got belligerent and said we should separate for two months.\n\nI left 9 days later and sent him a text asking for us to set a date to meet again. He never responded to this text. My dad called his dad over the next two months to ask about when we would meet again &amp; got a vague \"I'll talk to him and call you back\" but never heard back.\n\nWe got a family friend involved managed to talk to husband. Husband was furious and said \"How dare they act like they want to reconcile after they've talked to lawyers and my wife made me leave the house with no care about where I was staying for a whole week!\"\n\nWe \\*had\\* talked to lawyers, because husband had completely stopped communicating with me or my family and we had no idea whether he was ever going to come back or not.\n\nI, also, had not made him leave, he had been the one to insist on me leaving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I send this letter, chances are high he will get deported. My moral dilemma is twofold:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I have no idea whether he married me for a green card. It sure seems that way, but I'm not God and do not know what his intentions were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. All I want is for his green card to be revoked because he got that through me. However, his green card being revoked is inseparable from him being deported, which seems overly mean because he came here on his own. ",

      "description": "I am currently in the process of looking for a new job and have begun very early conversations with a prospective employer. They are a smallish company (about a hundred employees or so), and are currently hiring for a role (this would be the first of its type in the company as they have only recently grown to a size where the business need has come up) that would be reporting directly to a manager who is looking to start a new team. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, I am planning to start trying for my first child this year. This would mean a timeline where I join the company for about half a year to a year or so, then be out of the office on maternity leave for 3-5 months afterwards. I do not intend to tell the company about my family plans. I understand that the company is not legally allowed to ask about this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband however believes that if he were me, he would not be comfortable with this decision and would prefer to let the company know of my plans once I get later into the hiring process. His reasoning is that while I have no legal obligation to let the company know in advance that I intend to get pregnant, going out of office for a few months less than half a year into a new job would be extremely disruptive to any team, and especially so given the size of the company and the fact that I am being hired as the first member of a new team. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that if the company is interested in my skills and willing to hire me, they should also be accepting of the fact that I plan to take time off to pursue a personal goal that is very important to me. He says that from the perspective of the hiring manager, what I am doing is no different from someone who joins the company for half a year and decides to go on a 5 month vacation to travel. The only difference is that in this case, my absence from work would be legally protected and that while I am allowed to do this, it would strain the relationship with my manager significantly and would result in an uncomfortable work environment upon my return.

Ever since he moved out person A has been blackmailing us with the idea of her leaving the house, leaving us with the remainder of the rent to pay (which is too much for the remaining three of us)\n\n The main reason she threatens us with this idea is because someone was watching tv just outside of person A's room ( this is where the living room is located).

      "description": "Alright, first off, I might make a few mistakes while writing this, that I'll attempt to remedy later.\n\nSo I was dating this girl for 9+ months, Started January-ish of 2018, and it \"ended\" around November-ish. Should mention I've never been abusive towards her in any way and I always tried to be the best boyfriend I could, and what happened was that I ended up getting hammered with work with the start of this school year, and because of that I wasn't as attentive, as I should have been. I tried to be there when I could, I was there when she needed a shoulder to lean on and I tried to do whatever I could while maintaining my Academics and everything. The Circumstances of us breaking up was essentially that her father was getting deployed again (U.S. Military) and she was going through a lot emotionally and our relationship ended up being one of the things she needed to break off to keep herself alright emotionally, and I completely understood and even said, that completely fine, and that I'd stay loyal to her even through this rough patch in her life. I stopped talking to her for a few weeks, with the thought I'd stay loyal to her in my head. A month or so passes, and she snapchats me about something (She blocked me that day because she couldn't have something I said in our chats, it was something about how she was depressed. Ect.) After that all happened, I said whatever cool, she'll add me back when her parents check her phone. It's whatever. This was one of the first time I've been so wrong about something in my entire life. Two weeks after this, it's now today, and I iMessage her, asking when she's going to unblock me and she said that \"Idk, I have a boyfriend now\" and this just hit me with a wave of shock since I cared about her, and I really tried to do all I could in that relationship, it's the first relationship I was in with a girl, and I wanted to really go somewhere with it. My entire love life has been really hard for me and I, I don't know what I expected honestly. I've hit so many brick walls this feels like another one, but I can't pin what's different about this. I guess I'm asking if me being depressed about her dating another guy is a \"reasonable\" reply to it. I, guess I'm going on a bit of a rant right now and I just can't really collect myself. Maybe I'm just destined for everything I do to fail. \n\n\nThis probably wasn't the right sub to post to was it?",

      "description": "This was a couple years ago, with a former roommate, F. We lived in an apartment that did not allow pets, as per the lease. Several cats wandered around the complex, and my roommate ended up taking a liking to a kitten. F would take the kitten inside, feed him, and otherwise care for him any time F was home. He was cute, as all kittens are, but I was always begrudgingly opposed to taking him in, on account of it being a lease violation that could cost us the apartment. F didn't care, and dug in further, getting proper cat supplies, and getting the kitten fixed. He let the kitten out when he was at work and keep him inside otherwise. \n\nAfter a few weeks of this, the kitten was attacked by some of the older cats and his stitches from the fixing were torn on top of other severe injuries. F told me that his finances were wiped out from the cat supplies and getting him fixed, and asked me to cover the ~$300 operation, or the kitten would have to be put down due to the injuries. I ended up deciding to decline, as he already owed me a lot of money from backed up bills and I had been opposed to taking in the adorable lease violation in the first place. Without my money, he had to have the kitten put down. This understandably tanked our relationship for the remaining 7 months we lived together.\n\nI bring this up now because I've since moved out and became a cat dad myself, in an apartment that allows it. I grew up with pets, but this is the first one that's actually my own. It's given me a lot more context into his feelings at the time, since it was the first pet he'd ever had in his life, and the pain I caused him as a result of my decision. Was I the asshole after all in this situation?",

      "title": "AITA for not leaving the dog park when my puppy jumped on a toddler?",
      "description": "I bring my 7 month Irish Setter puppy to a local dog park at least once a week. This one location is essentially two large fenced in areas, one for dogs under 25 pounds and one for larger dogs. There is also a climbing structure and swing set for children outside of the dog park fences. My boy is 50 pounds at 7 months and very tall, as is typical of the breed.\n\nWe have been working on training, but I do admit that the stimulation of the park usually makes most of what I tell him go in one ear and out the other. It’s also important to note that I fully admit to not having full control over him jumping on people yet.\n\nThe other day, a family brought their bulldog into the park. The family consisted of a mother, father, and 2 or 3 year old child. My dog mostly ignored the people and played with all of the dogs, until the little girl started picking up loose tennis balls and trying to throw them. My dog jumped up and knocked her over in an attempt to get the ball. She fell backwards into dirt and started crying. I ran over, lightly scolded my dog, and apologized while saying that he was just a puppy and didn’t know how to control his body. (I actually work as a teacher for kids around this girl’s presumed age and figured such language would help explain that holding a tennis ball up might cause confusion for a puppy).\n\nThe parents seemed understanding at first, but the exact same thing happened again less than ten minutes later. I again pulled the dog away, even though he wasn’t actively going after the kid anymore.  He only wanted the ball. The parents did nothing but comfort the little girl. I could see where this was going but didn’t know what else I could do. Ten minutes later, my pup is chasing the kid around the inner perimeter of the fence with a frisbee in her hand. He didn’t even jump on her when she ran screaming crying to her parents. He anxiously waited for her to throw the toy.\n\nThis is when the mother started huffing and puffing that she “guessed [they] have to leave!” She was visibly agitated and made no effort to remove her child from the situation by picking her kid up, telling her to stop trying to play with a dog double her size, or have one of the adults take the kid to the adjoining playground outside of the dog area gates. The father quietly gathered their dog and its things, while the mom hurried the child to their car with a scowl on her face.\n\nI don’t really know how to train my dog not to jump for toys other people are holding. I personally turn my back on him when he jumps until he’s calm/sitting before throwing anything. In my opinion, dog parks are for dogs to socialize, not children, and I did nothing wrong. However, the glares I got from the family and another park patron made me think I might be wrong. So, Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "The title is an exaggeration, but my (22F) roommate’s (23F) boyfriend (23M) is always here, and I’m super tired of it!\n\nIt used to be much worse — boyfriend was here at least 5 nights a week, and he and roommate effectively took over the common areas (bc we live in a super tiny apartment) every night. It was hard to so much as cook dinner at home, because they were in the kitchen for an hour or so every night right after I got home late from work. They also often neglect to take out the trash in the kitchen, which I don’t contribute to since I never cook here. They also always play music (not terribly loudly, but certainly not quietly) when they’re in the common areas, even if I’m also there and clearly trying to work. I know I should address these things but I just don’t want to come across as an asshole.\n\nI asked for a no-guests policy three nights a week, and roommate has very much respected that, but boyfriend is still here every other night, and it’s just so very annoying, especially because he doesn’t contribute monetarily to rent or utilities. It’s annoying when I’m trying to get ready in the morning and he’s in the bathroom, or when he comes out of roommate’s room post-sex (which is all the time, and I mean good for her, but it’s a bit much) just wearing a towel. I’m a fairly private person, so it’s getting difficult for me.\n\nI just don’t know if these are reasonable grievances or not! I’d convinced myself they were, but then someone else in another subreddit told me it just seemed like I’m not a person who lives well with others... so AITA?",

At first things were going well, then he got distant and eventually cut me off. Eventually we got to talking again and he acted like nothing was wrong. It was like he didn't notice how his abrupt cutting me off affected me.\n\nThis cycle would go on for a few years, him not talking to me for months, and my \"What's up\" texts piling up to the point where I would be convinced I was bothering him and he didn't want to talk to me anymore, and then we'd meet in person and it would be like nothing changed. Like we were still friends. And then back to nothing.\n\nI feel like I have put in so much work into this friendship, and he just doesn't care. I've talked to mutual friends about it, and they've said he is just weird about friendships. But I see him making plans with friends, friends talk about hanging out with him or making plans with him. And this is fairly regularly. I'm just not convinced that he is \"weird about friendship\". I think he just doesn't care about me.\n\nSo about two months ago I heard from mutual friends that he is in a relationship. They were happy for him, and of course I was happy to hear he was happy. But there was a certain fatigue I felr to. This is where I get to the AITA. I found myself slightly apathetic to this news. I've been doing some self searching and just feel that I put in 90% of the effort in the friendship, and got little in return. Fair enough if he doesn't want to be friends anymore. But am I the asshole if I just don't care about this relationship he's in. Or really anything he's doing anymore. I just feel a mixture of sadness, fatigue, and apathy when it comes to this friendship. The cycle of him not giving anything and then suddenly acting like we're buddies has gone on for so long. I feel like I'm lying to myself because I hate losing friends.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "I’m a bi guy and I recently got my heart broken by another bi guy because he left me for my best friend. It’s been rough of course, but luckily my friend group has for the most part had my back. One girl in particular has. \n\nOne night, she texted me asking if I’d like to hook up. I asked if she wanted to just have sex or date as well and she said she just wanted sex. I agreed and about a week later asked her about when she wanted to do it. At this point though she changed her mind and decided she’d like to have something more serious. I was fine with that. I certainly like her as a friend but typically I have this gut feeling about someone if I know we’re a good fit together which I didn’t have with her, but I figured a date or two couldn’t hurt and maybe I would feel that. \n\nWe went on two dates, both of which went well but she still didn’t really excite me as I like someone to. A few nights ago she told me the next date she wanted to have sex. After each date she was very pushy asking me if there’d be another, which is a bit of a turn off for me. But mainly, I still could not see myself falling in love with her and I’m still not completely over that guy. \n\nLast night I called her and told her how I felt. She said it was alright and didn’t seem upset at all. I figured since she seemed so not affected, she had asked to have sex, and she initially wanted to “just have sex”, I’d ask if she was okay with hooking up ever. If she didn’t seem like she wanted to have sex as bad as she did then I wouldn’t have even asked. I certainly wished I had waited longer than the night after ending it. She said yes, but her best friend who I’m also friends with said it was an asshole move. \n\nI can see how on the surface it seems that way, but she seemed like she really wants to fuck, and she asked me to WITHOUT dating so I figured in her eyes that wasn’t a necessary piece to the puzzle. Not to mention she is apparently planning on sleeping with another guy that she recently dated then ended things with. I definitely think I should have waited longer, but otherwise I don’t get why what I did was an “asshole move”.",

      "description": "So here's a little backstory for context. My dad lives about two blocks from me, and for a long time we were really close. We would snapchat, text, or call at least daily, and visit or go on outings about once a week.\nOne day earlier last year, about April/May, he suddenly stopped responding to text messages.  He had previously asked me to check on him if I didn't hear from him, in case he fell down the stairs or had any other sort of accident/medical emergency. A reasonable request; after the silence started I went over to check on him. He was, er, with his girlfriend, so I left him alone after I saw he was ok but we didn't talk because it was embarrassing. \nLater he called me and told me he would no longer answer text messages because he wanted to have \"more interactive and face to face relationships\", in his words. He then told me if I wanted to contact him to leave a voicemail and he'd call me back \nSo, since that was bullshit, I stopped calling and texting. I saw him several times in June because his birthday/father's day /rest of the family was in town. I had a panic attack at his house during this time and left abruptly. No one in my family who saw me break down and leave bothered to check on me afterwards, including him. \nHe's made little to no attempt to contact me in the months since. We talked on my birthday im September, but I suspect he called out of obligation. He mentioned I've been distant, but I told him I live right down the road and he can call me anytime. \nHe did not invite me over for Thanksgiving. I went over Christmas, but I asked if I could--the only reason I did was because two of my siblings who live out of state were in town visiting for the holiday (which they didn't tell me about, much to my despair). He didn't get me a Christmas gift, either (a first in my life, he has ALWAYS gotten me something, even if it's just an Amazon gift card). \nI feel like I've made a show of effort over Christmas by arranging a visit. I asked him to keep in touch, which he has not done.  I don't want to put in effort if he won't. Does that make me the asshole? \n",

      "description": "I work in a family owned seasonal high volume restaurant which is massive. During the summer there are both inside and outside bars and dining areas but during off season we are only serving indoors. We also do most of out hiring and training during our off season so by the time we are in full swing everyone is on the same page. We have always tried to keep our bars sports related so we have always our 6 TVs programmed with whatever live sports that are being played or sport center or similar programming. Recently we hired a young man that refuses to put anything on the TV except for news channels. I get you want to be informed on what's going in the world but our clientele is too diverse and broad to have the talking point in the bar be political or religious or something that we know is going to be a catalyst for someone to be insensitive or ignorant. I have tried to be polite about it and approach it sensitively by stating that we should keep the TVs on sports or something light just to avoid it all together because it always ends horribly but now I have gotten to the point to where I just change them without saying anything anymore. Our other coworkers have tried to express their feelings about it as well and tell him that they aren't trying to have conversations about the news or politics either with our bar guests because we know that not all of us are going to agree with one another but not everyone handles other peoples opinions well so why even go there in the first place. When alcohol and strong opinions mix things tend to get a little intense. Am I the asshole for wanting to keep things neutral and light? ",

      "description": "So I'm in a prestatistics class with my friend Emma. \n\nWe've known each other since childhood, live like 5 minutes away from each other, but haven't really hung out much except when our third friend Annie moved back to town.\n\nOver group text we had made so many plans about all the girl's nights and outings we'd do when Annie moved back. Emma and I flew to Annie's twice for vacation. We were all in a wedding together, went to Annie's graduation together.\n\nAnnie moved back this past July. She lives 5 minutes away from me in the other direction.\n\nWell, around Christmas Annie and I realized that the three of us had only hung out maybe 4 or 5 times, and that's because Emma was always canceling, switching what days she was available to hang out to the point where we gave up, or just flat out telling us that she was working. She would ignore texts, just stuff like that.\n\nSo we decided that we'd just start doing stuff together, and not worry about Emma anymore. We didn't mention it to Emma because we didn't want to rub her face in it.\n\nA lot of stuff happened, drawn out drama where Emma told everyone we were mean for treating her the way she treated us- not initiating texts and not trying to make plans. \n\nIn the course of everything we found out that Emma has been lying to us about a lot of stuff. She's not the person we thought she was. And she makes me very uncomfortable now. \n\nI don't want to associate with her anymore, but we're stuck taking this class together and will be in the same statistics class in the fall, so I have decided to try and stay pleasant. \n\nWell, I always do my homework. It's challenging, so I start early and go work at the math lab with tutors if I need help. I've invited Emma before, but she cancels at the last minute. \n\nWell, we had one section due this morning at 8. It really didn't take that long, just like 2 1/2 hours instead of 6. \n\nAt 7 am Emma texted me for the answers. I delayed answering her and then just gave her directions about how to do the work. She then asked for screenshots.\n\nI waited until I knew she'd be driving and then sent it. So she wasn't able to turn her homework in. \n\nAt break she made it sound like I had all the luxury of devoting hours to the homework (I get up at 5 and go do it at Starbucks while it's quiet). \n\nShe lives 4 blocks away from the town library. \nThey stay open until 9, she could walk over and put in a few hours. I don't know why she doesn't make time, but she thought it was unfair that I get to spend hours working on it. \n\nAnyway, AITA for deliberately waiting until it's too late and sending the answers? \n\n",

I know if I take the days off, I won't be spending them convalescent, I'll be playing video games all day.\n\nBut I fucking hate getting sick, and it feels like I'm in a plague house right now. I also am sympathetic to coworkers who did not take sick days and came in sick. a lot of then have kids, who also get sick, and have to take sick days to look after them.\n\nSo I want to take my sick days I have accrued and use them to get out of here for a few days, and miss most of the worst from my sick co workers, and hopefully dodge being sick.\n\nI understand that people shouldn't use sick days as extra vacation days, as that leaves you with no options when you do get sick, and you can infect co workers. I also understand that the difference between using sick days for vacation, and what I intend to use them for is so subtle to the point of being non existent\n\nSo in short, am I the Asshole for wanting to take time off from being around my plague bearing co workers?\n\n",

      "description": "So here’s a little background: I’m the middle child (19) and I have two brothers (23, 15.) My older brother was raised very strictly and was given almost no freedom. As a result he grew up to be very isolated and and has difficulties with social situations. As a result he pushed for me to have more freedom once I got to high school. I became very involved with drugs(weed mainly) and barely even graduated high school (currently in college), BTW  me and my siblings are first generation Americans.\n\n\nThis morning I woke up to my younger brother and my mom yelling about parent teacher conference. (Neglected to update them with an exact date). This reminded me of the times I used to argue with her over the same thing. He’s in high school and is given similar freedoms that I was given. I told my mom that her and my dad need more involvement in his school if they want him to do better and that he needs guidance to accompany his freedom so he doesnt make the same mistakes I made. This criticism was not taken well and sparked a very heated conversation right before she left work leaving both of us very emotional. In her defense I did use very poor wording and came off as if I was blaming her and my dad for all our problems (language barrier did not help either). I feel bad for bombarding her with these criticisms as she was busy getting ready for work but I think it was necessary for her to hear. \n\nFor the record my parents have been amazing parents as they have sacrificed plenty to provide for us and give us the best despite our rocky relationship.",

Taking care of things fell on my shoulders.  Not, like, \"Diggy, you must take care of XYZ\" but more like \"Diggy, just make sure Mom's okay.\"\n\nCourt date came for this guy.  Everyone had returned back East, so I went.  It was super quick, over in like ten minutes.  The judge sentenced him to probation, license suspension, and Cal-Trans work.  (road work on the freeway.)  \n\nAfter court, I followed him outside.  To this day, I don't know why.  I said, 'Hey.  Do you know who I am?\"  He turned around and said yes, and he got silent and then said \"I'm sorry for your Dad.”  I talked to him for maybe 10 seconds, then I hugged him.  (I feel SO CRINGY thinking about this now)  I told him it's okay, I forgive you, and that was that.  \n\nMy family was FURIOUS.  How could I do that?  You were representing the FAMILY!  We all agreed at the funeral we were going to make this bastard pay!  I told them it was the only thing I could think of.  It was too much, and didn't want to hate anyone, I was too tired.  Their reactions ranged from anger to disappointment.  Not one family member was on my side.\n\nMy grandfather gave my wife and I $5,000 after the funeral in response to a letter I wrote telling him how dad's death made my life struggle even worse.  This  triggered my family.  I’m a greedy bastard. I was under obligation to share it.  That was not your money, its OUR money.  Grandpa died shortly after the funeral, and it was assumed as the 'last of the family line' that I would distribute it. \n\nTrying to do the right thing, I went through dad’s mail, found out his bank account info, and accessed it online.  I then did some sleuthing how to get the money out, full intentions of giving it to mom.  I didn't go so far as to contact probate lawyers which was the next step.\n\nWhen I told mom what I was doing, \"that is not your goddamned money, you are a thief and a disgraceful child and are disgracing your father's name\" along with accompanying hate from my sisters.\n\nMy contact with my family now is so formal to the point of sarcastic, and no amount of explaining or apologizing has made a bit of difference.\n\nIf I'm the asshole here, so be it.

She told me that she already spent it on lunch, and her reasoning is that that is how Christmas works, that \"we use the things that other gives us to make their experiences better.\" I thought that sounded like bullshit, and after consulting my friends, they agreed that it was bullshit and I should steal my money back.

      "description": "So a bit of background, my GF and I have known each other and been good friends since we were 10. I've know her mom for almost as long and we get along incredibly well. GF and her mom are pretty much best friends, and as a result, they tell each other pretty much everything. GF is still somewhat dependent on her mom, as she pays her car insurance, phone bill, medical stuff, etc etc. \n\nWe started dating about a year ago after we graduated college, and are about to move in together! We already have an apartment where she is staying ~30 minutes from me, while I'm still living in my current apartment until the end of the month. \n\nIn general, things are great. But one of my biggest annoyances is that her mom is always involved with everything. Traveling? Mom can help us get plane tickets with her credit card miles. Getting furniture for the apartment? Mom can help get us something. We had an argument? Mom has this to say about it.\n\nPart of the reason I'm making this post is because we got into a fight last night. I got home from work and had a little too much vodka to drink. Girlfriend texts me saying the internet is out and asks if she can stay the night, to which I reply yes. While on her way, I guess I passed out and she ended up knocking on the door, windows, and ringing the doorbell for an hour and half until my apartment mate let her in. She came in sobbing and I wake up confused as hell and still drunk, and then I realized I fucked up. Asshole for that for sure, I know. But this morning she tells me I need to apologize to her mom because she called her while she was stuck outside... What in the actual fuck? I got pissed and told her I'm not apologizing to her mom for shit, I'm not dating her and she shouldn't have even been involved since she lives 500 miles away.\n\nI love the fact that they're close and the mom and I get along extremely well, I just am tired of everything involving her. I want us to be able to be independent, I don't want her hearing about all of our fights, especially since she only hears my GF's side of things. But I also don't want to be controlling or abusive in any way by isolating her from her mom.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I've recently gotten back to dating after a serious life-changing event (lost my arm above elbow in 2017). I've met a really cute girl recently and I'm guessing since it's winter and I had my cosmetic prosthesis and gloves on, she didn't notice there was anything wrong with my arm. A week later I gathered the courage to call her up and we chatted for 2 hours straight, after which we agreed to meet for a date. It's always awkward for me to bring up the subject out of the blue and it just never came up in our conversation. When we met for the date I explained what's wrong with my arm and although she was taken aback by it, she seemed positive about it and said encouraging things. However, at the end of the evening she said that although she's generally ok with people with disabilities and it's not a showstopper for her in terms of a partner, I should have been more open and honest and let her know before the date. I immediately felt bad and agreed with her. But when I thought about it after, I'm not sure if I did anything wrong. Her tone sounded as if I intentionally lied or deceived her in some way, but am I obligated to reveal such problems upfront? AITA?",

      "description": "I'm in a high school dormitory. I'm a year above the guy who decided to leave piss in the bathroom in the morning. Let's call him Piss-boi (17y/o). He's the second party.\n\nSo I see him walking out of our bathroom and was instantly alerted because his bathroom was on the other wing, so I peek into his stall to see that the lid was closed. Already suspecting the worst, I lift it, and I'm somewhat relieved that it was only urine. Still pissed me off enough to call him back before he left the bathroom entirely.\n\n\"Hey, [Piss-boi].\"\n\nHe turned around nonchalantly. \"What?\"\n\n\"Come back,\" I replied simply, gesturing at the toilet. He did come back. He lifted the lid and went \"oh\" all dumb-like.\n\nI asked him why he didn't flush. He said that the button required a hard press, and he pressed too softly. I asked him why he didn't hear the flush and he told me some shit about how there were too many people showering. I let him go with a warning, telling him that the next time he'd pull that shit, I'd expose him during evening registration.\n\nCome evening registration, I bump into him by accident and apologize quickly. He tells me to watch where I'm fucking going. I look him dead in the eyes and ask him \"you want me to say it?\"\n\nHe goes \"Oh, that time I didn't flush the toilet?\" Mind you, he asked that while everyone was still talking, so nobody really heard him.\n\nI nodded. \"Yeah, that time. You sure, dude?\"\n\n\"Yeah, totally.\"\n\nOur dorm-parent takes registration, goes on about some shit or other, then goes \"Does anyone have any announcements to make?\"\n\nBy the way, I convened with a dormmate of mine who shared bathrooms on the same wing as me and he told me to go ahead. Emboldened, I went ahead.\n\nI am met with instant vitriol. The guy didn't actually expect me to say anything, but I did. After registration, I'm approached by these guys telling me that what I did was bad and that you should have talked to him.\n\nI simply responded with \"It's not my fucking job to teach a seventeen-year-old to flush a toilet and it never will be.\"\n\nSaid seventeen-year-old goes petty and tries to engage me in some sort of diss-duel which he promptly loses, and before he can escalate, I walk out because I've got exactly seventy-nine things to do that are more important than trying to come up with some come-back to an infantile defence to why what he did wasn't so bad.\n\nMaybe I shouldn't have reacted so strongly by exposing him when I let him off with a warning, but he was being flagrant about it in front of me, so what choice did I have? Leave him be, have him understand that it's something he can get away with and do it again? This has been a huge fucking issue in our dormitory, and people leave stuff worse than pee (shit, pubes to name a few) in those bowls. I'd love if we could take it more seriously, but the amount of people that jumped to his defence tells me one thing only: I'm one of the few people that takes bathroom hygiene seriously.\n\nTell me, Reddit.

He said it’s partly my fault that I have to sit out since I went to the doctor. And while I agree that it’s my fault that I broke my toe, and think it’s unbelievable that he’s saying that I chose to go to the doctor. Of course I told my dad my toe hurt, and that it was bruised black and blue to all hell.\n\nI guess I just feel like maybe he’s partly right, and that I am being dramatic.

      "description": "I'm a freshman, and at the beginning of the year, I was a completely different person: shy, bo friends, could not talk to girls, overly jealous of people, etc. At this time, among other clubs/sports, i joined mock trial. Being a freshman, I was automatically sent to the jv team. At the end of every year, the JV team has tryouts to see if you're good enough to make varsity. Another girl on the jv team was this girl, let's call her Morgan, who's a junior. My first thought upon seeing her is that, hey, she's pretty cute. But being my shy self, I really kept my feelings to myself. Plus, shes's a junior and I'm a freshman.\n\nBut as the school year went on, I became more confident. This was due to playing sports, making new friends through these sports, and learned to talk to girls.\n\nSo by this point in the year, I was pretty confident. And last week, it just suddenly hit me: hey, I can talk to Morgan now! So what's the problem? Last week was literally the last meeting for mock trial. So that meant I'd have to wait till next year before flirting with her. But during the meeting, the president mentioned, we have tryouts for next year in three weeks- we try out now instead of, say, the beginning of next year, since mock trial is fresh in our mind. This sparked an idea in my mind: I had so many opportunities to talk to Morgan- which I didn't take, since I was shy- because we were on the same team: we confer twice a week during meetings, meet up every weekend, and such. And next year, I wanted those same opportunities so I can flirt with her. *But*, I only really have these opportunities if we're both on the same team. I know that 95% I was going to make varsity (people on varsity told me), but Morgan had a pretty bad showing and was most likely going to stay on jv. And that's bad: if I'm varsity and she's jv, no meetings, no meetups outside school, and far fewer opportunities in general. So, my idea was this: if I met up every weekend, I could coach her so she might do well in the tryouts and make it to varsity. I think it's an overall win-win situation: 1) we help each other- I help her practice for the tryouts, and she (although to a lesser extent) helps me 2) I help her get into varsity, which means more chances to flirt next year and 3) if I feel like it, I might even have chances to flirt with her during our meetups on the weekend.\n\nOur first meeting went well, and I flirted with her a little. I mentioned this to my friend, but he seemed upset I wasn't helping her out of the goodness of my heart. I just replied, whether I'm doing it for a good reason or not (and I think good here is subjective), I'm still helping her. So since I'm really not hurting her, and am instead helping her, I'm in the right here. He didn't seem to agree. \n\nIs he right?",

      "description": "I am married with a 5 year old and a toddler. I am always the one to get up with the kids in the morning. This has been the case for their entire lives. These days the kids are up 6:30-7 most days. My weekday routine is to get up at 5, sneak out to the gym, get back home around 6:30 for a very quick shower, then get the kids out of bed and dressed, play, make breakfast, etc. my wife is usually up 7:30-7:45. She generally helps get them out the door and I drive them to separate preschools at 8:15. On the weekends I again am up first with the kids. Occasionally I will workout only if it can be done during their nap time. The point is I am always the one to be with the kids in the morning, I take care of a lot of parental duties, and I fit my exercise around everyone else’s schedule. \n\nI think it is also worth mentioning that I work and my wife does not. We go to bed at the same time.\n\nA fairly new friend who lives nearby has repeatedly invited me to workout with him in his gym. Over a few months this has never come together, but finally this week we settled on 5:30 Friday morning. Thursday he texted that he could not make the Friday time and asked about doing it at 7am Saturday. I said yes without discussing it with my wife. \n\nShe is very grumpy and annoyed at the prospect of me leaving the house just before 7 and her having to wake up to take care of the kids. I do think it was a bit of a misstep to make plans without discussing things with her. However, I don’t think she has much of a right to be very upset. Taking care of you own fucking kids once in a while isn’t so bad, she won’t have to get up that early, and she has such an easy ride the vast majority of the time she should just deal with one mildly inconvenient morning. \n\n",

This is gonna be kinda long but i'd really appreciate it if you read it.\n\nI used to have a really good relationship with my parents but now things are really shitty. I'll start with my dad. He's been cheating on my mom for a while now on POF. I found out about 2-4 years ago and nothing has been the same since. He is also very sexist as he has openly told me multiple times about how he favours my younger brother just because he's a boy. My dad also caused me to have an anxiety attack a few months ago and laughed during it. He's homophobic and transphobic and this scares the shit out of me as i'm pansexual and i'm questioning my gender right now.\n\nMy mom is worse. When i was 13 i seriously considered suicide because of her. She didn't abuse me or anything but she stressed me out so much and gave me such bad anxiety that i found it hard to cope and stay positive. I'm doing alot better now though. She has also never believed that i have anxiety despite how obvious it is. I have almost passed out because of my anxiety and when it's really bad i can't even speak to my friends. I don't know why she thinks i'm lying because it fucking sucks. I didn't ask to be like this. She's also why i have trust issues as she constantly makes promises and never keeps them. \n\nMy mom is also extremely controlling because i'm not even allowed to leave my street without permission even though i'm obviously old enough. I feel like i don't have any freedom. She even put a tracking device or something on my phone so she knows where i am at all times. This is completely ridiculous as we live in a very safe area. She looks down on people that aren't as fortunate as us and i fucking hate that. It's not like we're rolling in cash, we barely have enough money to fix our goddamned car. She calls people she doesn't know \"rough\" or \"hooligans\" when there's probably nothing wrong with them. She has ruined my friendship with one of my best friends because we did something stupid years ago. We haven't been allowed to have sleepovers in over a year (our only chance to see each other) and our friendship will never recover. I actually connected really well with them which never happens and i really miss them.\n\nDespite all of this they have given me a place to live, food and a good education. They spoil me (which i hate, i want love not clothes and etc.) and i know people with worse relationships with their parents. I feel shitty about disliking them because we are family and they have done good things for me. AITA? \n",

      "description": "Hi! A few months ago, I moved into a new apartment with a roommate whom I didn't really know very well before moving. From the beginning, we wouldn't get along, as she would constantly complain about literally any noise in our house (e.g. me making breakfast or some child crying on the other end of the street). Knowing that she's very sensitive to sounds, I try to make my best - like not moving around house at nights and similar.\n\nAt the same time, my roommate would occasionally throw parties with 8-10 people without even notifying me in advance. What makes it worse, is that I know some of the people she's inviting, but I don't get invited to these parties. Sometimes I return home from work, and there are 10 people running around our apartment, music and so on. When confronted about parties, she said that it's not a big deal, as those are not parties but just friends gathering and I shouldn't be angry at all.\n\nSo am I an asshole for being angry about this whole situation and considering moving out?",

      "description": "I work as a line cook at a fairly popular restaurant. One of my coworkers is a woman who is for the most part a nice, productive employee, but has an extremely annoying habit: when asked a question, she’ll almost always provide an answer that’s incorrect, and follow it up with a grin and a “just kidding”, and the correct answer. For example, if asked “Do we have any apples left in the pantry?”, she’ll respond, “Yes, three dozen,” grin, and then say, “Nope, just kidding. We don’t.” Or “Is the chef in?” “No, you just missed him! Nope, just kidding, he’s still here.” Additionally, if she sees someone combing through different sections of the freezer or cabinets, she’ll often say, “What are you doing in there? You can’t be in there,”; and when the person stops and turns around, perplexed, she’ll grin and say, “Just kidding.”\n\nThe entire time I’ve worked there with her, she has done this almost every time she’s asked a question, and it **really** annoys me a lot. And I’m not an easily angered person or someone who tends to get into conflicts with coworkers. Up until last week, I never called her out on doing it; I would just give a half-hearted smile and keep my thoughts to myself.\n\nThe other week, I was in the midst of working a long shift and was tired, hungry and in a cranky mood. My coworker provided a joke answer to something I asked her, and finally, I snapped and confronted her. I didn’t do so in a hotheaded or dramatic manner, but I was **extremely** stern, serious and blunt in a way none of my coworkers had ever before seen me. \n\nI told her that her behavior is unprofessional, unfunny, and that there’s a word for giving answers that aren’t true: lying. I told her how I have no respect for liars, described how toxic lying is to a workplace, and stated that I don’t trust a word that comes out of her mouth as she has lied so much over such trivial things. When she responded she’s just been trying to be funny and that it’s part of her general joking nature, I responded, “you call it funny and joking. Well I call it dishonest, despicable, and **extremely** disrespectful.” I finished by telling her if she can’t behave in an honest, professional manner, I will have no problem reporting her to the head chef, and getting her a much-deserved write-up; and by looking her straight in the eye and telling her, “I will **NOT** tolerate being lied to”, before walking off.\n\nThe rest of the day, she seemed kind of “off”; her eyes were big, she was very quiet, and seemed kind of embarrassed. I ended the shift by telling her that I’m not mad at her, that I think she’s a terrific employee otherwise and that my confrontation was just meant as constructive criticism. She accepted this, but the past week since has been barely speaking with me at all; and has been extremely serious and reserved with me (different from her usual joking manner). Did I go too far, and should I apologize further?",

      "description": "Last month, my temporary boss's daughter had a baby. It was the first grandchild on both sides so it was kind of a Big Deal. My boss asked me to help her plan the shower during my work day, which was fine. For clarification, I am her assistant in the business that she owns and runs so I was not collecting a paycheck from someone else while planning this for her on company time. This company has 3 employees including herself, and one has been on mat leave for the last year and just got back Monday, which means I'm done on Friday.\n\nLast summer, she offered my mom and I the chance to go anywhere on a list of approved resorts, and she would use her points to pay for the accommodations. We just had to pay for travel expenses and obviously activities. So we went to a very popular tourist destination over the New Year. While there, I picked up a really cute baby outfit for her upcoming granddaughter. I had been planning to just wrap it and deliver it to the mom through my boss.\n\nI mentioned to my boss's sister-in-law (who had been working closely with my boss as they're in the same industry) that I bought a present for the baby while I was in Florida. She passed the info to my boss, who then said I could come to the shower at the end of March if I wanted to. I could tell she was mostly inviting me out of obligation, although she tried to hide it. I mostly accepted out of obligation, but I was also kind of excited. I thought it would be a fun time.\n\nFast forward to last week. My boss asked me on Thursday if I was willing to be the photographer for the shower, which was on Saturday. I said sure, why not?\n\nAt the shower, there was a photobooth (it was my job to take photos of this as well as the rest of the shower), a time capsule, a few games, and a table where they put 3 babygros and some markers for everyone to sign. Because everyone was doing it, I signed the babygro. Just something like \"you're so cute!\" and my name. I did that about halfway through the shower.\n\nCloser to the end of the shower, when they pulled out the time capsule, there was a line on the sheet that said \"I am your mom/dad's ____________\". I realized that I was nothing to the mom or dad. That as a temporary employee who was gone in a week, this kid won't have a clue who I am in 18 years. I'm not close with anyone in the family (the other assistant's kids call them gramma and grampa). I was basically just someone that they hired off the internet after meeting twice and sorta liked. So I didn't put anything in the time capsule.\n\nAfter that, I felt really guilty about having signed the babygro and taken part in one of the other activities where stuff was kept (the advice for the parents thing). I remembered my earlier feelings of having only been invited out of obligation. And realized that although my boss tried to hide it, that really is all it was.\n\nSo, AITA for participating in the baby shower activities?",

TLDR in comments.\n\nEssentially my old roommate Janet (fake names will be used) moved out of my apartment (U.S.) in December and moved to Europe to be with her partner.\n\nIn an effort to find her replacement for the lease and also get rid of her furniture, Mary (second roommate) and I thought it’d be helpful for Janet to rent the room furnished. We didn’t really discuss what that would entail. I honestly don’t have experience with this type of stuff. I’m the youngest tenant in the apartment and the primary lease-holder for the first time in my life.\n\nAnyway, I made it abundantly clear that the room would be rented for $1500 as soon as Janet left. The room itself is 700+ sq ft in a 2000 sq ft apartment in a major city. I calculated pricing on based on square footage. \n\nWhen the time came around to ironing out the details, Janet told me and Mary that we would be taking $200 out of our rent per month to cover the cost of the furniture she’s leaving behind with the total being $1200.\n\nAt first, we were confused and weren’t really understanding why we had to pay for the furniture, but she insisted that the new tenant, Kate, wouldn’t move in unless it was furnished. \n\nSide note: Janet has a history of manipulating situations, talking down to me, teaming up on me, being controlling etc.\n\nSo at this point, Mary and I don’t want to have a blow out fight again, so we reluctantly agree to pay her $1200 for the furniture she left behind, but here’s the caveat - we don’t get to keep it.\n\nWhile discussing the agreement with Kate a couple months later, it clicks that I’m paying for furniture that was given to Kate for free. Based on a sublease agreement we all signed that I stupidly didn’t go over with a legal advisor or parent, Kate gets to keep the furniture in the room if she lives in the apartment until May. Weird. I know. \n\nOn top of that, Janet grossly overcharged us for furniture that was broken and used. Like $125 for a rug with stains on it.\n\nJanet also withheld one important detail: Kate offered to bring down her own furniture and help Janet sell her furniture, but Janet insisted that the she can keep the furniture so it wasn’t necessary.\n\nThis is likely because she was getting top dollar and putting in no work by getting Mary and I to pay for it.\n\nI sent Janet a non-emotional email detailing all the facts about our arrangement, and how I feel that she was taking advantage of Mary and me. I explained that any sort of agreement we had to pay her for the furniture is null because we’re not keeping it. I told her she can keep the money we already sent and explained I’m not open to discussion. \n\nShe responded stating that she’s not surprised Im being selfish, that I will never learn to be a good person and care for other people’s feelings.\n\nSo, AITA for stopping payment on furniture I don’t get to keep even though I initially did agree to this arrangement albeit naively?",

      "description": "So, I lived with this girl for close to year and we were pretty good friends. This is one of those situations where living with your friend really ends up ruining the friendship. She was incredibly messy, threw a lot of parties (with really sketchy substances – I’m fine with weed), was generally loud and uncaring. And the cracks in our friendship really began to show. I ended up moving out a month early, paying rent at two places, and she had the entire apartment to herself (agreeing to pay an extra $50 that month because she would have the entire space).  I offered to come back on moveout day to do a deep clean, and she told me to get lost. I cleaned well before we moved out and I’m the only one who knew how to scrub and use bleach the entire time we lived there. \nAbout two months pass and I’m having trouble getting a hold of our super scummy leasing company. The apartment was horrible when we lived there: termites in the walls, roaches everywhere, really thin stained carpet, we literally lived behind a toxic waste dump (which I could see from my windows). But I still had $500/$1000 on the line for my half of the deposit. I finally find out the leasing company gave the entire return deposit to my ex-roommate, it was only $300 and I couldn’t dispute it because she signed a form saying she would not dispute it (why wouldn’t she dispute it???). I get in touch with her, and she essentially tells me to fuck off and the money is hers. I mention small claims court. Another month passes and she sends me a message apologizing and that she’d send me my half. Another month passes… no money (she had my address, mutual friends it could be passed through, my zelle pay, my cash app, my venmo, everything). I contact her again – nothing. Admittedly, I’m starting to get kind of pissed off. Sure the money would be nice, but it’s not enough to REALLY hurt me. But it’s the principle of the thing – you know? So I send a letter of intent to her “You have 30 days to pay, blah blah, or I will file a suit with small claims court”. The day she presumably gets the letter, she immediately wires me the money and starts sending a lot of nasty stuff.  You’re over dramatic, why are you such a bitch, it’s only 100, fuck you, suing is childish etc. All I say is, thanks for sending me my half, glad we don’t have to go to court, you cant just withhold money from people. But some mutual friends told me I was being kinda harsh and mean and that I should have just let the whole thing go. Am I the asshole here? We’re both kind of poor so I know the 150 is probably a good chunk of her savings/paycheck – but I really believe the money was mine to begin with.\n",

      "description": "Some context: I'm 27, my brother is 25. We're not close, I hadn't seen or spoken to him in five years. My wife and I have a house, my brother couch surfs from place to place, he \"moves\" maybe 5-6 times a year. I have newborn twins.\n\nMy brother contacted me three weeks ago asking if he could spend a couple of weeks with me. He lives in City A, I live in City B, and a Friend he's to move in with lives in City C; I'm halfway between them but it's a good few hours from A to C. He's waiting for Friend's roommates to leave their lease so my brother can move in. Essentially, between Dec 17 and Jan 2, my brother is homeless, hence him reaching out. It might be important to note my brother has no car.\n\nWe have a guest room, so I agreed. He'd chip in $50/week for food but he has to leave Jan 2. I didn't set ground rules or anything other than keep the volume to a minimum due to the newborns.\n\nThe first couple of days he's here, things are fine. He keeps to himself more or less. Then on the 19th he decides to invite four people over. He doesn't have friends in the area, they're friends of friends of friends or whatever. He invited them over without asking me. I pulled him aside and told him they need to leave, you can't just invite strangers into my house, and he said \"I'm a tenant, I'm allowed to have guests over\". Never mind he's not a tenant as he's not paying any rent or have any kind of document saying he's a tenant, these people I don't know! He doesn't even really know them! \n\nI'm incredibly uncomfortable with what's going on so I tell the group of people they need to leave. They refuse. I tell my brother to get them out or I'm calling police and getting them all, including him, removed. He swore off at me and slammed the door, so that's exactly what I did.\n\nPolice show up 25min later and I tell them the situation. They tell them to leave and they do, but I make sure my brother has to leave, too. Pleading and begging, they give my brother time to pack up the few things he has and off he is. He starts walking down the block and that's really it. No phone call, no nothing. I don't know where he went, nor do I really care to be honest.\n\nAITA for kicking my brother out with nowhere else to turn to?",

      "description": "Some background information about me and my situation currently, obvious throwaway\n\nSo I have a long history of academic dishonesty and laziness because I don't know how to push past obstacles and actually succeeding, and instead taking the short way out and half assing everything or simply getting the answer from somewhere else, and only really putting effort into useless classes or hobbies.\n\nThis has caused me to fail a programming class because I couldn't finish everything in a short time and simply copy answers from other places, barely pass multiple math classes with Cs because I didn't want to do the homework and just winged it, even though I knew I could do better because I'm 3 years faster from the normal student path, and just spend my time on useless things like learning about stupid things like old computers and hardware modding. I also took his credit card without his permission and spend about $200 on things. I did pay him back later though. \n\nI've been trying to put myself back on the right track by biking and transporting myself to work during the break without any help from my parents, not going on vacations voluntarily to stay at home and work and take care of my dog, so I could learn to mature, but that failed and I'm back on my self destructive path.\n\nMy father is a very hardworking person, having come from a village in Asia to North America, and now works at a top tech company in the North America. However, because of the type of upbringing he has as the youngest in the family by quite a bit and all, he doesn't exactly have the best anger management. If he gets angry, people are going to get hurt/cry or things are going to get destroyed. He doesn't exactly have a life outside of work, and comes home tired and emotionally drained every day. He tries to get the best for me, even moving to a new neighborhood for the schooling opportunities there.\n\nOver the course of my indolence and dishonesty, I have many of my things destroyed due to my actions. Laptops, Monitors, GPUs, etc. He says that it is because of my disobedience that those things are gone, culminating with today, where because I plagiarized some solutions to homework that he threw away my monitor, my eGPU case, my GPU, controller, and everything that can connect to a computer that was in my room, all of which I purchased with my money during my summer and winter break jobs. I am saddened by his actions, but I would like to know if what he did was the right thing, to destroy my things, and if in here that I am the asshole and I should change since I brought it on myself, or he is",

      "description": "So to start, I guess I need the obligatory “I’m on mobile,” statement. \n\nNow that that’s said, let’s get into the point. So in my English class, we’re reading To Kill a Mockingbird. And my teacher assigned us groups to present a little thing on 2-3 chapters. Tomorrow is when my friend an I are presenting ours. Out presentation needs to include 6 different points. I won’t bore you with all of the topics, but all you need to know is one is theme. \n\nSo my friend and I agreed that I would do chapters 17 and 19, and she would do chapter 18 and make the presentation. She also said that she wanted to do the theme of chapter 17, so she’s also doing that. \n\nBut here’s the thing - I’m absolutely terrible at theme. Since I want us to get a good grade, I asked her to do the theme for 19 too. I thought that since I was doing both 17 and 19, then it would kinda spread out the work more evenly. \n\nButttttttt that’s not how it played out. So far she hasn’t responded to my texts (I sent them ~3 hours ago,) and I feel like she’s mad at me. So AITA? I’m sorry if it wasn’t super detailed, if anyone needs it I can add more info about my project or anything. ",

      "description": "So I’ll preface by saying I’ve gotten mixed reactions from friends and my SO so I’m settling this with a majority rule thanks to Reddit (you guys) I can see both sides of the potential argument, but naturally I think I’m right. Moving forward:\n\nSo there’s this mutual friend I have that hangs around my friends dorm every now and then. We’re all seniors in college with me being 21, my friend being 22 and mutual friend being 22.\n\nMutual friend is a tiny bit of a wreck but nothing too crazy. He struggles a lot with socializing and his grades are tipping and stuff. His mom offers to buy him the on campus therapy meetings but he doesn’t go cause he says he doesn’t see a point.  And I mean, I do feel bad for him.\n\nHowever, all these issues he blames on something that happened 8 years ago that he constantly cites as the root of all his issues. Basically, when he was fourteen, he got a TWELVE year old pregnant and she ended up getting a non surgical abortion pill, understandably. \n\nWell this guy paints this girl as this evil villain in his life who destroyed his life for “getting an abortion without asking” and to this day he says how much he hates her for “making” him struggle in school, or “giving” him anxiety. And he brings it up about every other time we see him. \n\nHonestly the toxic behavior started to get to me. The constant lamenting and fury against this girl is ridiculous. He even stalks her social media saying she doesn’t “deserve to be happy” and constantly relays to us the things he sees and how it’s “bullshit” she’s traveling and succeeding in college and such. \n\nSo yeah, I got fed up and said something. I told him to his face that he can no longer blame this girl for his problems. He has the tools to make himself function be he doesn’t choose to work with it. He doesn’t acknowledge how supportive his friends and family is towards him. All he does is spit anti-abortion, women are whores rhetoric and talk about how he apparently can’t do anything all because of this chick.\n\nI’m not gonna lie. I did go a bit far cause then I started insulting him and calling him a prick for being mad that a 12 year old didn’t carry a kid to term for him and stuff. But other than that, I don’t see where I’m wrong here. I guess it technically isn’t my business or my position to say how he should feel, but how he was acting was getting ridiculous and intolerable.\n\nTL;DR: 22 year old blames all his current problems on the fact the 12 year old he got pregnant 8 years ago had an abortion. I called him out for being a sap.\n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "I used to have this friend named Anna that I had known for years. We were very close, to the point that I considered her my best friend, and platonic soulmate. We supported each other through some very tough times. She suffered from severe depression and family issues; there were times when I stayed on the phone with her all night for fear that she would do something drastic otherwise. She in turn supported me through an intense battle with an eating disorder. But I don't want to make it seem like our friendship revolved around our issues. Most of the time we had normal conversations, we'd go out drinking, karaoke, etc. She was my best friend and I loved her to pieces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, she stopped responding to my texts, and blocked me on all social media. I was afraid something had happened to her but I saw she was still commenting on mutual friends' posts. I had no idea what I'd done - I reached out to her to ask if I had done something wrong, and to let me know so I can apologize for whatever it was, but no reply. It really hurt me to not know what had happened. I went over it again and again in my mind, trying to figure out what I had done. I felt wretched, like I was going through a breakup. I had a recurring dream that she would reach out and explain what had happened. It was not a fun time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime passed.... almost a year later she reached out and asked if we could meet up. I agreed and we had lunch. I've always been scared of confrontation, so I was too afraid to ask her what had happened, and she didn't offer an explanation. But things went back to normal, and I had my best friend back, so that was all that mattered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, maybe a year or so later, she ghosted me again. I went through the same process, but began to realize, you know what, fuck that. I tried my best to be a good friend and I don't deserve any of this. I didn't hear from her for two years after that. I never really got over it, but in time I think I realized that it wasn't my fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis year on my birthday, she sent me a message on Instagram to wish me happy birthday, and said she wanted to meet up for coffee. I sent a response which said, *\"Thanks for reaching out. I hope you're doing well. I've really missed you but honestly being ignored for two years without knowing why was really not good for my mental well-being. I'm not here to be your friend only when you want me to be your friend. So I don't think it's a good idea. Wishing you the best.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt pretty proud for standing up for myself. A lot of my friends agreed with me and said it was the right thing to do. But recently one of my friends said I had been cruel, and that given her history with mental illness, she was probably working through some intense stuff, and that I should've been more understanding. It made me second-guess myself a little. So Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So my best freind lets call her 'Alice' who i have know for some years, and who has helped me with many tough patches in my life has been feeling really down ( and i mean **REALLY** down). I don't know what it's from or how to help her becuase she generally has problems with communicating with people. Right now i keep asking her if shes ok or if she wants anything but she generally just brushes it off and says shes fine and doesn't need anything. \n\nMe and many close freinds know somethings off and, even her teachers have started noticing (which is pretty big because shes  the kid who no one really knows is there). We've come to the conclusion that it has something to do with her other freinds ( Camp friends) and something must have happened. So after school we tried asking her about it but she got really angry. Now this is a **very big suprise** because generally she never gets angry and is more of the pacifist than anything else.\n\nNow me and everyone else is still in shock because generally Alice doesn't lash out. A few minutes pass and no one can understand her because of her thick accent (shes Czech) . She then storms off to who knows were. So the next day we try not to confront her or ask about the whole ordeal but the damage was done and shes even more silent than she was before. A few days later she comes to us and tells us shes sorry for lashing out and that she was in the wrong, but now iv'e been trying to remember any time Alice has opened up to us or admitted anything and I could only count those heartfelt moments on one hand. Even some odd quirks and things that iv'e realized about her have been more apparent recently. \n\nLike how when she asks us a question or points something out like for example \" ooh what kind of pokemon type would you be i think that \\_\\_\\_ would be rock and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ would be fairy ( a stupid example I know)\" but she would never ask what she would be. So iv'e been looking at her ( creepy I know) and started realizing her hands shake it's not that notable but it's there. She's also super bipolar I think a good example was during Christmas, one moment she was really happy and the next she was fucking pissed to all high hell. Shes also un-remorsful when it comes to other *people* ( not animals i'm actually convinced that if she had to choose between saving herself or my dogs life she would choose my Dog).  I don't know i feel like a shitty freind for not noticing this before, but i also feel like Alice just dosn't care about us but i'm not sure. \n\nI hope this was enough info and thank you for anyone reading.\n\nSo AITA, is Alice the Asshole, are we both assholes or was it miscommunication from one or both sides?",

      "description": "My sister(23f) and her fiance(22m) are going to be in my city for a wedding in a couple weeks and asked if they could stay the night with me to save costs. I actually have a wedding to go to that same weekend, but in a different state. I told her that it should be fine to stay in my room while I'm gone, but I'll double-check with my roommate L. \n\nL and I have been roommates for a few months and everything has been pretty good so far, save for a couple obstacles: I talked to her about getting a cat before I signed a lease and she said she was down for it...a couple months later, the opportunity arises to rescue a kitten and she vetoes the idea based off the fact I'm out of town 1-3 days a month. Fair enough, I understand her concern, even though my boyfriend said he would be willing to come by while I was gone so she didn't have to care for it. Speaking of boyfriends, she doesn't really allow him in our apartment. We don't do overnights(personal beliefs), but she doesn't like him to hang out at our place so we usually go to his. It's become increasingly frustrating, but whatever. Other than that and the fact that I feel like she isn't the best at picking up after herself, it's really not so bad. We're still friendly and I generally like her. \n\nNow, I ask L about having my sis and her fiance stay there. They'd get there late Friday night, have the wedding most of the day Saturday, stay the night again, and leave early Sunday morning. She says she's not comfortable with him staying overnight. While I want to respect her wishes, I also feel like it's kind of ridiculous because that's MY apartment too. The bedrooms have locks, they'll be there for maybe 16 hours total(all sleeping hours), and she can always stay at her mom's place which is 3 miles down the road. \n\nSo Reddit WIBTA if I tell my roommate that I'm allowing my sis and her SO to stay anyways?

      "title": "AITA for getting married in a private ceremony with no friends or family?",
      "description": "Husband and I (Female) got engaged in July of this year. We live together and own a home together. After a few weeks of half-assed wedding planning, we decided we would rather just have an intimate private ceremony with just the two of us on a beach vacation we had already planned. We hate attention and we're also really frugal, so combining the wedding and honeymoon seemed like a great option.\n\nSome context: My Mother in Law has always been a somewhat dramatic presence in our lives. She had an inappropriate codependent relationship with Husband when he was a kid, but since he's been an adult he's worked hard on setting healthy boundaries while still trying to be a good son. It's taken a lot of therapy and has been a constant effort for him (and me, since I started dating him) to maintain these boundaries, but we do a pretty good job of managing things without caving in to her demands or letting her stress us out. Husband does most of the decision-making in communicating with her when the drama strikes, I try to stay out of it and just be pleasant and kind and patient whenever it's going on. For the past few months we thought things were going well with her and there has been very little drama. Hanging out with her has been, for the most part, fun and pleasant with no major breakdowns or guilt trips. We genuinely make an effort to have a relationship with her -- we take her out to meals, we help her with things around her house, we invite her to celebrate holidays with us, we text and call her, we remember her birthday and get her gifts, etc. We also see her a lot more than my side of the family, since my family lives in another state. We love her, but I expect the relationship will always be fraught. She is estranged from almost everyone in her family, so we always have to be careful not to invite any of Husband's aunts/uncles or grandparents to events where she will also be present.\n\nSo, back to our decision to \"elope\", or basically just have a private wedding ceremony. We told our parents about our desires, and they expressed some sadness and disappointment but were ultimately supportive and understood our reasoning. MIL had sort of a crying tantrum and we did kind of start to reconsider our plans but then a few days later she gave us her support so we decided to go ahead. Things went totally back to normal, we hung out with her a few times and it was fine, no hints of guilting or anything like that. They wanted to host a small lunch party when we got back where we could celebrate with family and friends, and we agreed and helped with the planning of that party.\n\nMore context: we are quite young (late 20s) but I have actually been married and divorced before (kind of a different story, but basically I married very young for religious reasons to a person who ended up being fairly controlling, I was immature and didn't know how to deal with it, we divorced very quickly).\n\nSo finally, two weeks ago, our trip came around. I wore an $80 white dress from an online boutique, he wore a suit he already owned. We had a bouquet, boutonniere, an officiant, and a photographer. We exchanged super personal, intimate vows by the ocean at sunset, laughed and cried, toasted with champagne, ate cake. We finished the night with an amazing dinner and then lounged in the pool at a resort, being served tropical drinks all night and talking about our future. It was beautiful and relaxing and special and CHEAP.\n\nThe day after our ceremony, we sent our parents some selfies in our wedding attire with a message that said some stuff about how happy we were and that we love them. They responded with congratulations and standard heart emojis.\n\nAbout a week after we returned from our vacation, after making phone calls and announcing to close family and friends, we decided to announce that we were married on social media. We posted a photo in our wedding attire with a caption announcing that we got married in a private ceremony while we were on vacation. We got lots of congratulations and positivity and support from our friends and family. We also sent out the invitations for the lunch party we had planned for later this month. (To clarify, this is NOT a \"gift grab\" party, the invites say \"bring just your company and your appetite\", it's just to catch up with everyone and celebrate the occasion.)\n\nSo here's where things get interesting. A week after returning from our trip, MIL started texting me about how she has been an emotional wreck ever since seeing our wedding picture, she's been sobbing uncontrollably, she doesn't understand why we hate her so much that we purposely excluded her from our day, she doesn't know if she can even do our lunch party (she was supposed to host it at her house), all her friends think it's \"horrifying\" that we had a wedding and didn't invite her, etc. Her life has been so hard (she listed a bunch of stuff that has gone wrong in her life) and she doesn't have anything and anyone and she worked so hard to raise Husband etc, and basically being at our wedding is the one thing she could have had in her life. She also made a comment about how of course \\_my\\_ parents didn't care because it was my second wedding, but for her she would have only seen her son get married once (very rude imo, this is already a sensitive subject for me). I kept it together pretty well but the conversation got a little out of hand and it stressed me out, I basically lost a whole day of productivity at work worrying about it.\n\nI'm feeling a lot of different things. Part of me feels guilty, like I betrayed family and broke the heart of my emotionally fragile MIL. Part of me just feels bewildered, I wasn't expecting this severe reaction. Part of me wants to justify and defend our decision to \"elope\", but I know that isn't going to be productive. Part of me is just super annoyed that she is causing drama once again, as usual, and that this is a great example of one of the reasons we wanted a private wedding in the first place. Part of me is pissed and offended, especially that she took a small jab at me for being a second-time bride. \n\nI totally get that as a parent, not being present at a child's wedding is tough. Eloping is a selfish thing to do. People are absolutely entitled to feel however they feel about it. We really tried to be kind about it and keep our families in the loop with our desires the whole time, and explain our reasons for wanting a private destination ceremony, before pulling the trigger. I totally get that when you do stuff like this, you have to be willing to deal with whatever reaction you get. I guess I just wasn't expecting it to be this dramatic. I know it will all blow over and things will go back to normal as it always does after the drama with her, but I guess I just want to get an objective opinion: am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So I’m trying to keep this short as I want to meet the 3G # guideline but this is a very complex story so if anyone needs clarification on anything feel free to ask questions in the comment section &amp; I’ll be happy to answer what i can.TL;DR at bottom\nSo my bf A &amp; I agreed years ago that if I were ever accidentally pregnant we would adopt if we weren’t in the right place to keep it. But the moment I found out I was a few weeks ago (at 6 weeks) my mind suddenly changed. I can’t explain the love I have for this tiny being I just found out about but I knew I didn’t want to give them up if I didn’t have to. My bf didn’t agree.\nI’m a believer in equality &amp; while i know the world isn’t big on equality I do believe we should work towards creating it. This includes fathers. If mom decides she doesn’t want the baby because she wants to travel it doesn’t matter how much the father begs he’s just a monster enforcing the patriarchy. But if it’s the mother who wants to keep the baby &amp; the father wants to abort (for the same reasons as the mother in the first scenario) he’s a monster &amp; a dead beat. I don’t think that’s right &amp; given A’s family (filthy rich dad) I certainly didn’t want my love for A to be misconstrued into a plot to get money. I made it clear if I decide to keep the baby I will not go after A for child support should he not want to be a father. All I want is for him to be on the birth certificate and to still exist in our lives even if not in a fatherly role. This lead to many problems (him kicking me out of our home &amp; then bringing me back). Things have been better but..idk. I’m currently going behind his back &amp; looking at a small two bedroom apartment. He believes that I’ve resigned to adopting but I haven’t fully made a decision. I told him I deleted the shopping list of baby items but that isn’t true either, I simply saved it &amp; am now setting aside money to potentially buy these things in the coming future. I will offer to let him come with me to the new apartment should that be my final choice (I have to choose by August as that’s when our lease is up) but I’m terrified of losing him. I can’t tell him sooner or he might kick me out again and if this is what I plan to do I logically can’t afford this hit nor could I emotionally. Either way my heart will be broken if he doesn’t change his mind as I’ll either lose him or my baby. I know I’m the one who went against the plan and started all this.. Am I the a** for wanting to keep my baby despite the plans we made years ago? And am I wrong for having a plan b without telling him? \n\nLet me know your honest opinions, please no sugar coating. You can ask questions if you like I’ll do my best to answer them all.\n\nTL;DR accidentally pregnant with bf and now want to change plan we agreed on ages ago. This lead to fights, getting kicked out, brought back in and now life is back to normal and we are happy... but I’m going behind his back and still planning on potentially keeping the baby. Am I the a**?",

      "description": "So he’s not the type of person that apologizes. We had plans to spend the weekend together but he ended up asking me to leave right after getting intimate which I thought was disrespectful. I hear from him the next day and he said he didn’t do anything wrong. We argue for a little while and I asked if we needed time apart for self reflection he says no. \n\nTwo days later, I express how hurt I still was by the situation and would like to talk, he says not then, he’s be ready in 2 days and I said I wasn’t myself and needed him, he said no and two days later, he comes over, dumps me while guilt tripping me saying I ruined his life and he was a bad person for having mental illness. Nothing made sense. I asked if I could get my belongings from his house since we had broken up he said not yet.\n\n2 weeks prior to, he had asked me to be supportive during break ups and not give up on him. So I send texts on two different days. And somewhat ask for my belongings cause I needed them. He responds the next day and says I was never the right one for him. I said, I’m doing everything you asked me to and I’m trying. \n\nHe says he’ll drop my stuff off, but never does. When I asked if I could go get them he said he had plans. He’ll let me know when he’s available. At that point I’m filled with rage. So I lose it and call him out on his behavior he says, I’d rather end things on amicable terms I said are you kidding me? I call him out on using his problems as an excuse and always blaming me for everything. I said why try manipulate and control my life when we could’ve had a clean break up? \n\nNext day he posted on fb how he was taking a break cause he’s going through some things and that if anyone needed him to check on him. So I called him selfish, ungrateful and such. I had been there for him through the worst of times. I was practically his caretaker. But I felt like bad for getting angry afterwards. \n\nAlso, I had said you’re obviously never going to give my stuff back so if it feels better to just toss them out I guess you can do that, he said no. I’m happy to give them back, I said then please do. I say just leave them at my front door whenever cause I don’t want to see you anymore. I never get anything back. I ask a friend to reach out months later, he responds bragging about throwing them out. Saying you told me to! ",

We have 2 young kids and in a typical week get through around 6 loads of washing, about 3 of them are purely my SOs clothes. My main issue is he absolutely refuses to put his dirty clothes in the hamper, he just piles up dirty clothes on our bedroom floor, but then he moans at me for days that he has no clothes that are clean for work or a certain top or pair of trousers aren't clean. \nI have no issue doing all the housework and looking after our kids while he wants to have some time to relax after work but it often turns into the whole evening and I don't feel like him washing his own clothes (or even just 1 wash a week when he's low on his work clothes) is a huge deal. The down side is we can only air dry as we don't have a dryer so this time of year it takes a couple days for everything to dry. \nI've mentioned in the past I'd like him to stop snapping at me about his washing and if he's low on certain clothes he can do his own but after a week I get sick of not seeing the floor through his dirty work clothes (They are filthy he works in a manual job meaning he often comes home covered in oil or mud). He has called me when I'm out previously to ask how to wash clothes but he's only done about 2 washes in 6 years and it makes me feel like his mother.\nSo AITA for wanting my mid 20s SO to wash his own clothes?",

      "description": "I had this friend for a for a while, it went really well until he told me that he liked me in a romantic way, not a platonic one. anyway, I had kind of felt the same, but I told him no anyways due to the fact that I had no friends and I'd rather have a friend than a boyfriend. that, and I couldn't decide whether I liked him because I was lonely or if my feelings were genuine. This caused a few bumps in the road.as you can probably tell, I have a lot of problems of my own. \n\nhe started texting me whenever he would have a problem. usually, I'm fine with occasional rants, but he would discuss topics such as serious mental health problems; all the time. and as someone whos trying to get better, its really hard to be around that subject. It got to the point where he would have a problem everyday and he'd spam me about it while I was out and about. one specific time that I remember is when I went to LA with my dad. We don't go out all that often and so I was really looking forward to it however, my friend kept texting me about his problems while I was out, and he was expecting me to answer and be his therapist for a couple of minutes.\n\nI would often suggest he get professional help. He'd say he would use the resources I provided him but then he would come to me about two days later with issues again. At some point, I kind of just stopped replying all that much. this started the posts and spam messages. he would constantly send out posts about being so depressed, anxious, how he was good for nothing, etc. then when I wouldn't answer, he'd text me stuff like:\n\n\"hey, it's been awhile, are you okay?\" note: I wouldn't be gone for long; about two days or maybe 6. I can't remember an instance where he left me alone for entire week this past year. He would then follow up with those messages with extremely passive aggressive things, \"how hard is it to get a text back\", \"text me as soon as possible.\"\n\nNow, going back to how he mentioned he liked me in a romantic way. I followed one of his spam accounts and when I did, I realized he had posts about me. Lots of them. like, 4-6 posts with a caption consisting about 5 paragraphs about me. This just made me feel even worse, on top of the guilt trips he'd already make me endure. He obviously knew I followed that account, as he had to accept my follow request. At this point, I started feeling super queasy and paranoid. He was just so obsessive, manipulative and all around a bad presence now.\n\nI finally had enough. After hoping that my absence would make him look for some other stimulation, or make him realize that the friendship had run its course, I told him that I don't want to continue the friendship anymore. I told him I'm glad a few things are getting better and that I hope we could still be cordial towards one another. He didn't respond.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "Essentially what happened was that my friend recently got his Nintendo Switch, to which he earlier called me to play with after school. I replied with a, \"Maybe.\"\n\nAs school ended, we went to McDonald's to hang around for a while. Then at one point he asked me if I wanted to play with him on his Nintendo Switch, to which I initially said, \"No.\" He started begging until I had to make up a lie saying I was busy and had to go. Honestly, I just didn't want to/felt like playing with him. Eventually, he stopped begging and started giving me the cold shoulder.\n\nWe exited McDonald's and by some luck he found another friend. He straight up left me as soon as he saw the other friend, without returning a goodbye when I instinctively said it.\n\nFast-forward a few hours and he publicly ranted on his Instagram story. I relented, but in my private account. He was saying how much of an 'ass' and 'uncooperative' I was. I replied back about how 'trivial' the matter was and it wasn't worth the problem we're currently in and he had to accept that. But he instead made fun about how I was being a 'fancy person' by using 'trivial' in a sentence and started calling me a 'hypocrite' (which kinda came out of nowhere). I was just borderline annoyed afterwards and took it upon myself to just not reply anymore.\n\nWe haven't talked for almost a year now and this incident kept resurfacing in my mind from time to time. I was wondering if I should've apologized or if I was in the wrong in the first place. \n\nTLDR; I didn't want to interact, my friend got annoyed, he started ranting and I ignored him thereafter, thus title.\n\nP.S. If it makes things clearer, we were both 14 when this happened, hence the triviality in the situation.",

      "description": "Ok... so I’m going to try to explain this as best I can. My mom and I have an incredibly rocky relationship. She’s been emotionally manipulative to me for a lot of years and I’m only just now realizing it through therapy and moving away from her to another state.  But to her I’m just kind of a dick and hurting her because she’s ‘only ever loved me and wanted the best for me’ in hers and my dads minds. So, as a result of all this, I’ve been trying to draw boundaries between us so she can’t manipulate me and we can try to fix our relationship. (And no, I’m not oblivious, she is not the whole problem, I have my own issues in regards to being the problem here) \n\nNow.... one thing my mother has done is she will comment on my social media posts with her opinions I.e “I thought we agreed you’d never post your relationships on social media!” (After I, a twenty year old, posts a picture of her and her boyfriend of eight months on Instagram. After a school function.... On a date....)  \n\nOr\n\n“I can tell by your Instagram you’re not the same person I thought you were and it’s just really sad to me... (insert more reasons it’s sad to her)...” \n\nAnd so I blocked her. I didn’t want her to interact with my posts one way on social media (positive) and a different way to me (negative and judgey). I just didn’t want her to say that stuff to me anymore and I didn’t want her to know my life like that, as I know how much of a helicopter parent she can be.  \n\nAbout a day ago my dad calls me and chews me out harder than he ever has before. Now, I feel like I have a good relationship with my dad and I’ve never been as angry at him as I was when I got this call. He chews me out for blocking my mother, which ruined her whole day and the family’s by extension, and taking away the ‘only way she can see my life because you I don’t talk to her’ and didn’t even want to hear my reasons as to why. \n\n(Side note: my dad doesn’t use social media. I knew he didn’t use social media, which is why I didn’t block his profile. I wasn’t just picking between the parents, who to block) \n\nBoth my parents think I’m an asshole for blocking my moms “only way to keep up with my life” (I’m not the kind of person to call just to update someone about my life... never have been. I’ve been in college away from y’all for almost three years now but it still isn’t clear???). \n\nSo reddit, from you, AITA? ",

When we got back to the city where we live he asked me if I could pick up a friend of his. He started talking to this girl on some dating site and he really wanted to meet her. I told him no and that I didn't want to meet anyone. I was extremely depressed and he knew this. I almost started crying and he asked me if I was okay. He was telling her that I'm depressed and she told him that she is depressed too and that we can drive around, smoke, listen to music and that she would make me feel beautiful. I kept telling him no and he is like \"it will be good karma and you can make a new friend\" if I went and picked her up. I told him I don't want friends. I drove to his house and said he could get out and he's like \"can I say no?\" I kept trying to get him to leave but he wouldn't. Finally after a while of trying to convince me to pick her up he finally got out of the car and I went home. Am I the bad person? Apparently he had another friend of his pick her up and I guess she asked him why I didn't want to meet her and that she really wanted to meet me. Am I the bad friend?

      "description": "I will try and post screenshots of our conversation this morning.\nMy mom and I haven't gotten along for years. We both have mental health issues and tend to take things out on each other, we both recognize that. But lately things have gotten really bad. I went through a traumatic event in december, and when she came with me to the doctor to simply support me, she couldn't even hold back some snarky comments about me making bad decisions. I told her to leave the room.\nA few days ago, my car was in the shop getting fixed, and she asked if I would need a ride to work. I said yes please, and asked if she could pick me up from the gym. No problem.\nWe got in a fight in the car. I don't remember what started it, but the usual \"you need to be nicer to me\" argument came up (her saying this) and turned into her telling me that my entire family thinks I'm a bitch and they side with my mom on this.\nYesterday, she tells me that some girl (doesn't know who) told my stepsister that people are talking shit about me. I'm 28 y/o JFYI, so why that still happens at my age is beyond me. However, she told me this in hopes that \"I could figure out who the person was, apologize, and start being nicer\". This seems like a huge coincidence to me and hurt my feelings. She doesn't understand that all that did was making me more upset, as I am constantly battling intrusive thoughts that everybody hates me, which she clearly is confirming to be true.\nThis morning she texts me to tell me how my stepsister and stepdad are mad at her for saying that to me, and that obviously I am mad at her too, but she still thinks i need to \"work on my anger and my weight before you need [gastric bypass] surgery \"and that she loves me. Obviously that little blow got me upset. (My stepsister literally just had that surgery done maybe 2 days ago, as she's been 300+ pounds for years. She decided to do this herself.)\nObviously I am upset by this. I asked her (not very calmly, i'll admit) how she expected me to react to my mother telling me something like that. She proceeds to tell me to stop being a selfish bitch, and that YES i AM fat and I do nothing about it.\n\n[Screenshots from our conversation](https://imgur.com/gallery/1gohJBU)",

      "description": "My 21 year old sister struggles with depression. This is something I've dealt with myself so the last thing I want is to make things worse, which is why I'm asking this. Bear in mind the things I mention in this post have been going on for YEARS and it's only getting worse.\n\nAs a result of her depression, my sister isolates herself to the extreme. From the moment she wakes up to the moment she goes to bed, she shuts herself in the computer room playing video games. Whenever my mom and I offer her to come and eat with us/watch tv/etc, a blunt \"no\" is usually the answer. \n\nShe also generally ignores other family members who reach out to her, including our father, who is always extremely worried about her and always asking me about her because she ignores his phone calls 90% of the time and never sees him (this is a result of her self isolation, they don't have a bad relationship or anything).\n\nThe only time my sister voluntarily interacts with any of us (mainly only my mom) is when her mood plummets extremely low and she needs a shoulder to cry on. The reason for her low moods/depression is always loneliness/not having any friends/never going out. I understand that she struggles socially, but it's frustrating to hear someone complain about being lonely when their family is constantly reaching out to them and all they do is push us away.\n\nI myself have sat down with my sister countless times and tried to give her advice whenever I have the opportunity, I've also offered to hang out with her if she ever wants to get out of the house, but she never does.\n\nUsually she doesn't even open the door of the computer room when my mom knocks. My mom will knock and ask if she's ok/if she wants dinner yet/etc. My sister usually just gives a one syllable answer or ignores her. This really annoys me because it just seems rude and disrespectful to my mom.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that my mom is very supportive, empathetic and has always done her best for both of us. However, she can also be kind of passive and avoids conflict, particularly in regards to my sister. This (in my eyes) is contributing to these problems.\n\nSo recently I've been saying to my mom that this isn't ok. I'm constantly trying to get through to her that my sisters behavior is not only disrespectful, but it's also ultimately harmful to herself &amp; isn't helping her situation. My mom sees nothing wrong with it however. Sometimes she says she's going to talk to my sister and try and get her to open up more, but it never happens.\n\nIt's at the point now where my mom and I are getting in arguments sometimes, because whenever I point these things out to my mom she says I'm attacking my sister.\n\nI'm worried that I'm potentially TA here because maybe I'm being unsympathetic to someone who's already having a hard enough time. And maybe it's not my place to be telling my mom how to deal with her own daughter. I really don't know, so an outside perspective would be appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The city is an hour commute there and an hour home. I’m extremely tired with the commute. I can’t have friends over or guys over. I’m also the “lame one” with my friends because I always have to leave parties and other things extremely early because I know my commute is bad and even dangerous late at night. \n\nI mentioned moving out to an apartment near the city and they both got upset. They need help with some of the more physical jobs around the house like gardening, shoveling the driveway, etc., as well as taking care of the pets and doing shopping and other things. They were thinking that since I have a job now, I will be contributing to paying property taxes and utility bills. I also know my mom in particular would really miss me and be sad if I left.\n\nI feel like the asshole for wanting to leave and that I’m favoring little things over taking care of them. They are upset at the idea. If I move out, will I be the asshole here? \n",

      "description": "So this happened about 6 months ago and isn't a huge deal anymore, but it occasionally comes up and i think about it from time to time wondering if i really am an a-hole for it.  Story goes that it was my gf's birthday so i went over to her house so we could celebrate.  As soon as i walked into her room i noticed an opened condom wrapper on the floor.  It couldn't have been one from me because we had never had sex at that point.  I showed it to her and asked why it was there.  She, of course, denied cheating on me and said it probably was an old one that came from under her bed (she has a cat that could have found it and started to play with it).\n\nI wasnt completely convinced and knew i needed to check the trash to be sure there wasnt a condom in there.  She left the room to go do something so i decided i would check.  She was using a plastic bag hung up on her closet door as a trash bag.  So i looked inside and, without having to dig through any trash, i saw a used condom in it.\n\nI was beyond pissed, absolutely sure that she had cheated on me.  I grabbed the condom (a bit gross i know but i was angry and didn't really care) and went downstairs to confront her with it.  She lives at her grandmothers house, along with her sister and her sisters bf.  Her sisters bf ended up coming up the stairs as i was going down and saw the condom i was holding.  He was unsurprisingly confused as to why i was holding a condom and asked who's it was, so i told him \"well it isn't mine\".  He got that \"oh shit\" look on his face and went upstairs.  I caught up with my gf and showed her the condom and we ended up going back upstairs to argue about it.\n\nShe was mad at me for going through her trash, saying it was a breach of her privacy.  I was mad because i had just found a used condom wrapper on her floor and a used condom in her trash.  She continued denying that she cheated on me and said that it was an old bag that she found in her closet that she decided to use for trash, and that she must have thrown that condom in there as trash the last time she had sex.  I didn't believe her as the chances of finding a used wrapper and condom was too small for me to think it was just coincidence.  Eventually her sister came up and helped us talk through it, telling me that she believed my gf was telling the truth and could tell when she was lying.  So i decided id listen to her and trust in my gf.  But my gf was still mad that i didn't trust her immediately, had went through her trash, and embarrassed her by 'showing' the condom to 'everyone', on her birthday nonetheless.\n\nWe moved on from it, as we're still together, but i still wonder if i was an a-hole for what i did or if it was appropriate that i believed she had cheated on me.  My gf has also done some other shitty things that still make me unsure sometimes whether i ever should have believed her or trust her now.",

      "title": "AITA, for smacking the car that almost ran me over?",
      "description": "I was walking into Target yesterday to grab some coffee and then household items. Outside the front doors I waited to let someone drive past, then I started walking up to the entrance. Some young guy coming from the opposite direction who I assumed saw me since he had PLENTY of time before he reached me, apparently didn't see me, or didn't care. So he just kept cruising, I had to stop abruptly and step back to not get hit. He just cruised inches in front of me, with some douche smile on his face. Some guys standing outside Target getting signatures for something saw, and said something like \"wow what a jerk\" and shook their heads. So I smacked his taillight with the back of my hand and said: \"watch out fucker\". Then I continued walking inside. Moments later I hear someone shouting behind me, \"Hey bitch, what's up? WHats up nigga? Come back, bitch. Why you touch my car, nigga? Hey, pussy come back!\".\n\nI kept walking. Ignored him, didn't engage. Went about my business. He gave up, or so I thought. I did a lap around the store, trying to remember the items I needed, as I was distracted now of course. Then I remembered I needed coffee. So I circle back to the front area to go to the Starbucks stand. As I do, I see him walking in, fast, towards me. We stop, face to face. He asks why I hit his car. I tell him, \"because you almost ran me over.\" he argues, \"no I didn't, bitch\". I replied \"yes, you did. People saw, it was clear as day.\" He just says whatever, and steps so close we had maybe an inch between our faces. His breath was fucking awful. He whispers to me if I wanna fight, and if I wanna swing on him. I reply, \"why are you so close to me? I don't wanna kiss you, bro.\" And I sidestep around him, but keep him in my peripheral. He stays close, daring me to swing on him. I tell him I'm not about to get in a fight in a fucking Target. So logically, he offers to take it outside. I tell him he's just a ghetto idiot starting shit over nothing, and start walking towards starbucks. He follows, ranting about how I'm a pussy/fag/bitch/gay, etc. By now the entire store is stopped and watching us. Super awkward and weird.  I just keep dismissing him, as I get in line at starbucks. I'm saying back to him stuff like \"just fuck off, you look like trash to everyone here, coming in here yelling and trying to fight someone over your own mistake. You're ghetto and dumb, get out of here before someone calls the cops on you.\" and he says \"ya you would call the cops cuz you a bitch\". \n\nHe continues to threaten me, so I turn to a Target employee and say \"do you have security or what?\", as I'm shocked that after all this no one has stepped in at all. This snapped her out of whatever trance she was in, so he goes \"ya, that's enough. Both of you.\" She points to him, and tells him to leave, points to me and tells me to go the other way. He just talks more shit and knocks over some shopping kart on his way out the door. \n\nSo I'm left wondering a variety of things the rest of the day. Like, should I have fought him? Should I have not let him ridicule me in public, and \"swung on him\" as he invited? Or am I truly the bigger person for dismissing him and \"backing down\" from the fight? \n\nAnd of course, am I the asshole for smacking his taillight in the first place? ",

      "description": "I feel very conflicted about this. I’m a bit of an introvert but have always been quite socially/self aware. I feel like I go out of the way to check up on people and get to know them. Being an introvert, I find this very emotionally draining so as of recent, I’ve slowly started to cut away friends who I feel do not do the same for me. \n\nA few example of what has bothered me: chatting with someone and the conversation revolves around them; asking how someone is doing but they never reciprocate (I’m not expecting their concern or anything, but it brings the conversation to an awkward halt once I stop asking questions; sitting in silence if I do not initiate the conversation; they don’t acknowledge me until I greet them first\n\nHere is my dilemma: I don’t think these people are being intentionally rude. I live in a city and work in a field that exposes me to lots of talented people who may be on the spectrum or just not very socially experienced. Of course, there’s also people who are experiencing something difficult in their lives who may be consumed by their problems. I feel guilty when thinking that I might be their only lifeline or that I’m turning my back on them when others probably already have. But then it doesn’t seem like a healthy friendship. \n\nSo, AITA for cutting these people out?",

      "description": "I have been working at a corporation for 12 months in a contract position. My manager offered to make me a salaried employee in the same role with a salary jump and the applicable benefits. She asked for a verbal commitment from me to stay in the position for 18 months. I was really uncomfortable with the idea since I had already been working there a year and they had previously offered me salary 6 months into the job which I declined out of respect to them since I had thought at the time I was going to be returning to school within a year, which did not work out.\n\nI was afraid my manager would not offer me the position if I declined her ultimatum so I agreed knowing realistically I probably wouldn’t be able to honour it. I found another job within the company and applied for it within a few months, now my manager is pissed saying I had given her my word to stay for 18 months.

      "description": "This happened years ago and I have always wondered if I was the asshole. Among my friends and the few who witnessed it the verdict is split. \n\nI'm at a tradeshow one day, a fairly busy one, and a girl with one leg goes by on crutches. Sure enough just a few feet from me, she falls. She was in decent shape, young (i'd guess 20's) and more than capable of getting back up. Nonetheless about half a dozen people go running over, asking if shes ok, trying to help her up, picking her crutches up from the ground, etc. But not me. I just stayed where I was even though I was the closest to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy co-worker comes over after the fuss dies down and just rips into me. How could I just stand there? Why wouldn't I help her? What the Hell is wrong with me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy reasoning: I thought she would be more embarrassed by everyone running over there to help her up, something she could clearly do on her own, than she would be if people simply asked if she was ok and moved on. In my mind the act of falling wasn't that big of a deal but all the attention drawn to it was a little humiliating. I still think from the way her face reddened at all the attention that I had the right approach. It's not like she was struggling to get up and I ignored that, I just wanted to avoid embarrassing her further. My co-workers disagreed, my friends are split. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

I let my mom borrow my car and I would have to take public transit to get there.” I decline again with, “Yeah I try to avoid last minute plans at all costs. :/ Have fun if u end up going!!” I know a bigger person would feel inclined to let her stay but saying yes would require that I stop what I was doing, change my own plans, and rush around to clean my apt last minute to suit her plans. I would gladly do this for a close friend but a close friend would have enough respect for my time and the courtesy to make plans ahead of time.

      "title": "WIBTA If I stopped being friends with someone, partly because of her depression?",
      "description": "I'm still at school, and I've been friends with this girl for a few years now. Anyway, she told me she has depression. I know, not from experience however, that mental disorders are very difficult to get through and it helps to have someone there to be with you. That is what I'm trying to do, seeing as I'm her friend and all. During this post, I'll call her F (random letter).\n\n\nHowever, at the moment if feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her. From early on in the friendship, she has gone into these moods where she doesn't talk to anyone, and seems to be angry at everyone. She is allowed to take a friend in past the queue at lunchtimes because of her diabetes (unrelated), but sometimes we sit there not talking at all, or she's just complaining about everything I say/do. For example:\n\nMe- *spills food accidently*\n\nF- *rolls eyes*. \n\nOr:\n\nMe- what lesson have you got next?\n\nF- physics. With Mr randomteacher, who doesn't like me.\n\nMe- why? \n\nF- *rolling eyes* I come in late every day because I need to check my blood sugar.\n\nMe- He won't hate you for that, he knows why you're late.\n\nF- *rolls eyes again, gives yes/no or silent answers for rest of day*. \n\nOne time, she blatantly ignored me all day. The reason? \"I didn't feel like talking\". \n\n\nI'm quite shy, so I struggle to make friends, but I am quite bubbly when I feel comfortable with someone, aka my good friends. So I happen to have another few friends, who aren't my best friends, but I can chat and have a laugh with them. We share a pe class. F is also in my pe class. If I go over to them for a couple minutes, and laugh with them, I get death glares off F for the rest of the day, which triggers a mood. Sometimes I feel like I can't be around those people if she's nearby, but I don't want to sit and mope with her during pe. \n\n\nMy phone is shit. Sometimes texts do not go through, the WiFi cuts out during a WhatsApp conversation, and I go offline. Sometimes it can take ages until everything's working again. It takes ages sometimes to post a simple comment on reddit. One time, I was asked by F to send her the notes from a lesson she missed due to an absence, and I said I'll try to get them to you via WhatsApp. She doesn't have Facebook messenger or anything other than WhatsApp, and my phone charges me for pictures over normal SMS. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the photos over due to having to do my homework, have my dinner and go out shopping with my mam, all after school. When I returned home, my phone broke again. I explained this to her the next day, and she started ranting about how I never reply to her. I've explained the issue.\n\n\nOne day in pe, she was whispering to another girl about something. I get on with this other girl, and she basically told me it's personal between F and her, but she wanted F to tell me and asked me to talk to her. F had seemed distant, so I asked her, and basically said I wouldn't ever judge her if there was a secret she was hiding from me. Then I was told by F that I would be ok if I went to leave her during lunch to use the computers. I had no homework to do, F knew this, and she was hinting at me to go away. \n\nI got a text later on that night, with F asking me exactly when she seemed distant, and why I was asking her about it. \nIn summary of the 10pm conversation:\nMe- You've seemed distant for a while. \n\nF- What about last Wednesday? Was I not distant then? Why are you asking me now?\n\nI got upset, as I felt like I had to ask her every time she seemed upset, but if I do that it's wrong, because she'll roll her eyes.\n\nToday: what made me want to post this. \nI went out during the weekend to meet a friend. It was a school-type event so lots of people from school would be there and I texted F and another friend if they wanted to come the same day, but I would understand if they couldn't, as it was spontaneous. Remember the phone situation? Only one message went through, as I sent them individually and locked the screen as F's message was going through, so hers didn't get through without me knowing until today, when my other friend told me why she couldn't come, and F glared at me. I suddenly realised that she may not have received the message, and I apologised and told her that my phone was still acting up. She was silent, whenever I said hi all day she'd storm past me. Now I think she was talking crap about me because she was whispering with this boy in my class, and glancing at me, trying to be subtle. I don't know if this was true, or it was me becoming paranoid after what's happened in the past. I noticed I can't talk to my friends, but she's still talking to who she wants to.\n\nI'm trying my hardest to understand/ not be a jerk about her depression, but it's tough. I feel emotionally drained at this point, as I just want to get through school with good grades, as well as enjoying parts of it, but I feel like F is taking over my life. I want to separate myself from her, but I don't know her experience.\n",

      "description": "I’m Hispanic, female, and 22. That doesn’t sound important but trust me it matters in this case. \n\nMy parents don’t have a lot of money. We live in a low-income type neighborhood. Our house needed a lot of remodeling, which I helped with financially.\n\nIf my parents need it, I always help out with bills and paying off the house. We finally paid it off about a year ago so now there’s extra money for more remodeling. I make good money and tips waitressing and I felt I could finally save up. \n\nI thought I was done helping out with bills but now my mom is guilting me into helping buy new furniture. \n\nShe said if i bought new couches, she’d help me pay for them. I kinda agreed because I didn’t think they’d be too expensive if we split it.\n\nThat was until she showed me the ones she was looking at. They were real leather, compared to the imitation ones we had. And they were hella expensive, even with the split cost. \n\nI backed out of my part of the deal and explained to her that there’s no point because i only have one semester of college left and plan to move out and buy my own furniture. \n\nThat is like saying I’m gonna betray the entire family name in Hispanic mom language. It’s also important to mention my dad has various health problems and i get guilt-tripped into staying for him too. \n\nMy mom became so petty over this saying that I’m acting like I don’t need them anymore and that I’m not even married yet, so I’m not allowed to move out. \n\nI’ve always paid for everything I own. I’ve paid for my braces since I was 16, my car, my phones, clothes, AND college. So yes maybe I don’t need them. \n\nWe got into a big fight and I also told her that this isn’t her generation and I don’t have to be married to live my own life. She kept arguing that it’s a sin to live with my boyfriend and not be married.. HUH?!\n\nI told her my dad doesn’t need me to care for him because he’s married and has a wife to do that for him. Which now I feel made me sound like an asshole but I was so pissed. \n\nAnyways, am I the asshole for not wanting to help with money and care for my dad anymore. \n\n\n",

      "description": "A little backstory: my mom is currently sick and if she smells anything too strong, bad or good, she’ll throw up. Her bedsheets got washed a couple days ago so she’s sleeping on my bed. My dad asked me if when something is being cooked downstairs, I can smell it from my room. I said no, and he said my mom felt the same way. So he told me that until my mom feels better, which probably won’t be for a while, she’ll be staying in my room. Not just sleeping, being there all the time. \n\nWhen he told me this, I kind of just stood there and listened. When he was done telling me, I said ok. Then he got mad at me for not being happy that my mom found a place in the house where she felt comfortable. I didn’t show that I was kind of mad, just that I wasn’t exactly overjoyed. \n\nLooking from my dad’s perspective, he’s been sleeping in the basement because my mom wants to sleep alone, and I’m not even willing to give up my room so my mom can be a bit more comfortable. \n\nI just truly want to know if I’m being an asshole in this situation.

      "description": "Today was the day of my aunt's memorial service. I'm not saying that to garner any pity, just for context of where my head was at today. It was very emotional especially for myself, my sisters, my dad, and our cousins. We all grew up next to each other so it was like losing my other mom. \n\nI've been very good about hiding my grief throughout the process from my boyfriend of 4 years but I made it clear that I was probably going to be emotional today. He was very sweet and doting to me throughout the day which I appreciated. We go over my cousins after the service to hang out and he leaves with the boys while I stay and hang out with my girl cousins and sisters. Fast forward until midnight when they show up and most of them were drunk but my boyfriend was beyond plastered. He can be so hard to handle when hes drunk (loud, obnoxious, stumbling) so I was a little irritated I would have to essentially take care of him on the way home. This isnt an unusual occurrence, and I was glad he had fun - but today was not the day for me. \n\nIt got worse on the way home when he kept making weird comments about his dnd character and my sisters dnd character to the point where we all thought he was insinuating their characters get together. I know he didnt mean it like that but he kept repeating the same things trying to explain it better which made it worse. He wouldnt listen to me when I told him to dial it back and he usually doesnt listen when hes drunk. \n\nBy the time we got home I was throughly embarrassed and pissed off at him. I gave him some food and water before he stumbled up to bed but he also kept asking for sex and why I was mad at him. Whenever he can tell I'm irritated with him he'll say things like \"im just gonna go cry then\" or just generally try and make me feel bad for being mad at him. He can never be the bad guy in the situation or own up to anything and it pisses me off. I love him so much, just not when hes so intoxicated. \n\nAITA??",

After a few more rounds of our game, she wanted to go home, so we did where we argued for a while.

      "description": "For context I'm 16. Like most classes, throughout the world, during high school, ours is divided in smaller groups. Since last year this \"friend\", I will call him Max (not real name), he has been manipulative and annoying. \n\nAs I mentioned my class was divided in groups, and ours was the smallest, it consisted of me, Max, and two other friends, I'll call them Omar and Andrew (again not real names). Max was physically abusive for the five years that I hanged out with him, mostly with me, punching and kicking me. I never really gave it much thought since I barely got hurt, and just tolerated it and took it as a joke. Fast forward to February of last year. I started dating a girl, and he got increasingly jealous, started to insult me and my girlfriend, and became closer \"friends\" with Andrew. Although he wasn't as physically abusive with Andrew he did insult him a lot. \n\nA few months later, during art class, Max got annoyed with Andrew and decided to hit him across the face. As I've heard they had a bit of an argument for a couple of days prior to that. I tried not support either party, but ended up helping Max out a bit because I knew him for longer than Andrew. Until the end of the last school year things got worse and the group started splitting up. \n\nWhen this school year started we were now in different classes, and it was just me, Andrew and Donald (yet again not real name, also he already knew Max and Andrew but not me) hanging out and Max came along most of the time. By now neither me nor Andrew can tolerate Max, and so we started to avoid Max. Max noticed something weird and Donald told him that me and Andrew were avoiding him. Max got mad and confronted Andrew, accusing him of being to blame for all of this. \n\nAndrew is a way better friend than Max, being supportive and never insulted me (except for jokes that I play along with).\n\nI I've know Max for years and feel a bit bad in cutting relations with him, because I know that he is abusive because of a lot of problems he has with parents etc..\n\nAITA for avoiding and ignoring him?",

      "description": "Background: Best friend suffered from anorexia, but began recovering in spring of 2018. I began recovering in fall of 2018. Our friendship has always been supportive, and we never saw our EDs as competition to see who could be thinnest- or so I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI began recovering in October. She cut contact with me in November. Despite knowing how hard it was to start eating again, she stopped speaking to me with no warning or explanation for three months. The one person I thought I could help guide me through the mess of recovering  fucked off to the ends of the earth without a word. But, thankfully, I was so sick and tired of being sick and tired that I didn't let her abandonment affect my recovery process.\n\nFast forward to February 2019. The two of us have begun speaking again, but it's awkward and kind of forced. I'm bigger (NOT fatter, as my psychologist would say ;)), and she's been stable for a few months now. We got into conversation about why she cut me off, and she reluctantly admitted that because my waist was xx inches away from hers despite our height difference, she was triggered and therefore uncomfortable around me. The bad, toxic part of her brain compared her body to mine and she began to feel insecure around food again.\n\nI can understand her reaction, but I'm more hurt than I'd like to admit. Instead of coming to me, my best friend stopped talking to me because of my weight in the middle of my recovery process. I'd been with her through thick and thin, but the moment I needed support, she cut off contact.\n\nI know she's going through her own stuff, but I don't think I can trust her again, and and it's getting hard to contact her on my own volition. For the safety of my mental health and preventing a relapse, a part of me thinks I should cut her off- with an explanation...\n\nAITA for cutting contact just when we've begun talking again?",

      "description": "Hello everyone! I'll be using a throwaway account because I have coworkers that know my regular account.\n\nI work at a local hospital where we have our own staff parking. The gate is opened with a card that we pay for monthly. We also need the card to exit the parking lot. There is no one at the gate, only a speakerphone where you can talk to a security guard when you push a button.\n\nOne particular morning, I forgot my card. It is a 30 minutes drive home so there was no way I was going back for it. I just pushed the buzzer and asked the guard if he could let me in anyway. \n\nAt this point, I was totally prepared to being told no. I would have just accepted my faith, parked in the street and walked but I figured it was worth a try!\n\nSo anyway, I buzzed for the guard and asked. He was very chill about it and let me in without any problem.\n\nAt the end of the day, I get in my car to leave and drive to the gate. I push the buzzer and ask the guard to please open the gate to let me out since I forgot my card. \n\nHe immediatly gets mad at me for forgetting my card. I apologies and tell him I'll be careful next time. He refuses to open the gate, telling me he's not supposed to open if we don't have a card. \n\nAt this point, I think he's confused, thinking I want to get IN the parking lot so I kind of laugh it off, explaining that I'm inside and want to get out. \n\nHe didn't appreciate that at all and tells me that no card is no card, that I need to park my car back inside and go get my card if I want to leave with my car. \n\nLike I mentioned before, it is a 30 minute drive to get home and I have to go pick up my kids at daycare so I'm getting pretty impatient. I tell him that I completely understand the \"no card\" policy, but that I should have never been let in in the first place and if the other guard made a mistake, it didn't give him any right to restrain my car in the parking lot. \n\nHe still refuses to let me out and asks me over and over to park back and come back with a card. \n\nAt this point I flat out told him I would not move, and that there was about 400 employees getting off work in the next 15 minutes, that we'd talk again then. \n\nI buzzed him again every minute or so, updating him on how many cars I was blocking until he finally opened the gate. \n\nWas I an asshole?",

      "description": "I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost a year and I love her to death from earth the the endless sky above, but while talking with her on the phone she mentioned her manager, at the restaurants she works at, she said her manager showed her what Ecstasy looks like, it was her first time seeing what it looks like and her manager said she was gonna go home and try it with her boyfriend and let her know if she should try it. My girlfriend is sweet and innocent and jokes around a lot but she seemed serious to me about highly considering taking this if her manager told her too, she is overly nice which isn’t always bad but she tends to be easily influenced  by people she trust or have known for a while. She was even persuaded to eat a weed cupcake by one of our friends, when months before we said we would never eat anything with weed in it or smoke weed at all. It’s happened before where people have taken advantage of her kindness and it’s happen to me as well so I don’t wanna see anything bad happen to her at all, while on the phone I said in our convo;\n\nMe: I’m sorry but I can’t stay if you decide to take drugs, I won’t come back either cause that’s not something that’s good for either of us at all\n\nHer: it’ll be fine as long as I’m in a controlled environment and with people I trust, like you.\n\nMe: Nope, can’t do it, im sorry I love you and all but I can’t stay and won’t come back if you decide to use drugs I just can’t, that’s not something I want for us\n\nAfter that she went silent for a bit but only until her mom came to pick her up from work, I didn’t really think much about my response until she texted me before going to bed, which made me feel like an ass\n\n“Hey, don't threaten to leave me again. That hurts. I understand if you don't want me to do something but don't threaten to leave an never come back. Please.”\n\nI don’t know if me text response was any good either cause I decided to say this\n\n“Sorry....I just don't want anything to do with drugs at all, no weed or anything like that, I'm sorry but I'm serious, if your on drugs like that I'm not gonna be able to trust it, I just want you far away from it cause that kind of shit can kill people, I don't want you to die just cause your manager said try it, I know it's an asshole thing to say but I can't stay if you gonna let people influence you that easily....I love you to death and I don't wanna have to break up with you over drugs cause that's just dumb, and that's why I didn't eat the weed brownie or muffin or whatever either, cause it can cause addiction just as easy as one time, I don't want that for you either, that's also why when I vape I keep you away from the smoke and try not to hit your face and say to move to the other side of me, I don't want to hurt you with that or see you get hurt all because you were just told to take a drug because it would feel good....I'm sorry but I'm being hurtfully real, if you take drugs I'm not staying”\n\nDid I say the right things or am I just being a dick?\n\n",

Generally a great guy, but my bff keeps screwing him over because she can't settle down. She gave him an excuse to break things off this time, a week before my birthday dinner that he was invited to.

I want to send her a text and say like \"hey I'm gonna make reservations, is (your ex) going to make it?\" and when she tells me I was going to let him know what's up because I like the guy and he deserves it, he loves her to death.

      "description": "I’m at university and am living in halls of residence currently with some of the best people I’ve ever met (I’ll call them A, J, and Z). \n\nMy flat and I went out to a club last night in a large group of about 20 people. It’s Z’s first night out in about a year (in which time she hasn’t had any alcohol for medical reasons), so I’m assigned babysitting duty.\n\nThe night starts out great, everyone is having a good time, we’re dancing, there’s ridiculous hats, just dumb uni stuff basically. \nZ then gets messages from her boyfriend back home calling her “inconsiderate”, “a sociopath”, blah blah because she didn’t stay in to speak with him. -Side note, he is a manipulative scum bag.- \n\nSo it’s about 1:30 and the effects of the alcohol hit Z pretty hard and she’s in a pretty bad emotional state. J, Z and me decide it’s time to leave so we go to get our coats with some others in our group. Z was meant to have the tickets for our coats but says that she can’t find them and that she must have given them to someone else so we begrudgingly leave the club without them. \n\nWhen we get outside Z finds the tickets at the bottom of her purse so J takes them and goes in to get all our coats. In the meantime I carry Z somewhere she can sit down and she starts crying that she’s sure her boyfriends going to dump her, apologising for her state, etc. \n\nA few minutes later J comes back out with our coats and a look of extreme agitation. She doesn’t say a word to us she just throws my coat on the ground and walks off. \n\nThis set Z off in another round of crying about how she (Z) must have ruined everyone’s night and we all hate her. Sufficed to say I was not very happy with J. \n\nThe next morning (the morning of the day this is posted) everyone is back safe but I’m still very angry with J. \nI go to get breakfast and she’s in the kitchen talking about last night with another flat mate. She asks me how my night was and I respond “It was alright until you acted like a massive bitch to me and Z.” She doesn’t say anything, just looks shocked. So I just walk back into my room. \n\nI feel pretty bad now. Although she didn’t seem that drunk, I never actually saw how much she had to drink I just assumed she was sober. Plus I don’t know what happened when she was getting our coats that may have set her off. \n\nTl;dr flat mate got wasted another (drunk) flat mate made the situation worse so I called her a bitch. \n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "I(23f) have been close friends with a guy(21m) for over a year. We get on well enough; 60% of our friendship is going out and drinking. We've had a few spats that have mostly been me questioning why he assumes I am responsible for him and his wellbeing (as in planning and getting him home, or cooking and cleaning for him - even in his own house). He is an only child and has a very passive outlook on life; he's used to things just happening around and for him. My role in my friend groups is always jokingly referred to as \"The Mom\" because I dote on people, but that TLC is always reciprocated.\n\nMy problem is that I'm starting to feel like an emotional ATM; like this dude is just using me to work through his bucket list and keep himself fulfilled and entertained. He gets upset if I don't give him enough of my time/attention, and has tried to adopt all of my friends, and speaks of them as if they are doorways into new scenes instead of human beings. I'm only just starting university, and he offered to help me strategise study plans, and got upset when I did my work instead of hanging out. He then opted to skip a lecture but couldn't go home to his folks, so he sulked and watched my TV from 10am-5pm.\n\nAn annoyance for me is that he works with an ex of mine that was very emotionally abusive, and still spreads terrible things about me. My friend's approach is to \"keep the peace\" which translates into them acting like I don't exist whenever they party together. I've just tried to rise above it.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was yesterday; he kept pushing for me to watch Captain Marvel (so epic!) with him, even though I'm a dirt-broke student, and he said he would cover all costs. So he paid for my ticket, and I went out of my way to pay for our uber. But afterwards he kept pushing to go out, ignoring me when I said no cause I'm broke. He ended up \"compromising\" with me, and we grabbed a few beers. When the bill arrived, he instructed me to contribute, and I put in the last of my money. (I understand my role in consuming something and therefore paying for it; I'm not looking for handouts, and I accept my role in running myself broke).\n\nI think I've just come to realise that this relationship is entirely one-sided, and my feelings, wants and needs don't feature on his radar. He's a kind, gentle person, but he uses people and takes no responsibility for himself. He's putting in minimal effort into his life and uni, while blaming his depression and bad home life. I've gone to great lengths to help him and be there for him, but he seems reluctant to grow or change. He considers me to be his best friend, but I'm honestly so drained; he knows he can call on me for anything, and I've come to realise I can't say the same.\n\nWould I be the asshole for just walking away from this situation, or do I owe it to him to cut him some slack and voice my issues, in hopes he'll listen this time?",

Per my contract 3 months is required as notice. I gave 4. I was told I would be missed and would always be welcome back if I decided I wanted to return. \n\nHere's the problem, the last day my workplace is open before closing for the new year is the 21st so that will be my last day. I was told today my salary will be prorated for the month because even though they aren't open and no one will be there I am leaving so my last day is effectively the 21st not January 1st. \n\nThis means I will be losing money by staying for December after rent and living costs etc are spent. I am considering telling them that they can either pay me for the whole month or I will leave after November and save myself from paying December rent etc. Would this make me an asshole?\n\n I can see how they don't want to pay me for the holiday days since I am coming back but still I was a great employee and brought them a lot of business I also gave excessively long notice and worked as long as the place is open in December. Also every weekend in December is a work weekend meaning I will be working 18 of those 21 days of the month and be losing money or just barely breaking even if I am frugal doing it.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This was made NSFW because of whats in this\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I started off middle school, I had like 2-3 friends, including this one kid (we'll name Hayden). Hayden was really tall and I was really short. He was about 5'7-5'8 and I was 4'9-4'10 (I am a guy so short guys got made fun of a lot.) I was mainly teased for my height and sometimes even got punched and kicked. This led me to have depression during 6th grade and later having suicidal thoughts.\n\nThis was also the time me and Hayden had YouTube channels and would sometimes play Minecraft together (I know, I was cringy). We also started our YouTube channels. I had around 27 and he had about 16. He asked if I could make fake accounts to subscribe to his channel and he'd do so for me. So I did, because I was subscriber-hungry. Later, he had around 52 and i had 67. He then started making me do a lot more. He asked to make **100** accounts and subscribe to his channel. Obviously, I said no because, making accounts was hard, about 5-10 minutes each time (I am NOT wasting up to 15-20 minutes just giving this guy subs). He got mad. He called me short a lot more, sometimes during school.\n\nHe was the first one to bully me for my height and that made more people verbally and physically bully me. This was when I started being depressed. Then, he passed me by subscribers. He thought this was such a big deal to brag about it on every video I made! In my 75 subscriber special, I gained 2 subscribers during it (making it 77.) Hayden then commented \"Oh, you got 2 subscribers. Well, I gained 10 on a livestream.\" We had another friend (we'll name him Mason) who we played online with, and he was a fairly nice guy. Anytime Hayden would say something rude or bully me, Mason would stand up for me.\n\nHe did terrible things to me. He even made a group chat and told them to tell me and my 60 year old grandmother to f--- off\n\nThen one day, when I was asleep, he had this convo with Mason  \n\n\nHayden: OP is being an a\\*\\*  \nMason: Lol\n\nHayden: He is like 4ft,I'm like 6ft. He wants to fight. I told him to kill hisself (which he did)  \n\n\nThis is what gave me suicidal thoughts. I believed this was the way everyone treated me. I thought everyone wanted me to just get erased from this Earth. This is also when I started doing the knife game (mainly with scissors and pencils but I did it once with a pocket knife and hit my pinky). Because I didn't wanna do self-harm, I did this. Luckily they were just scabs so they would be gone by like 3 months.\n\nLuckily, my parents helped me out and even saw the Discord message about him telling me to kill myself. (I had my account on their phone) They screenshotted it and I eventually showed my teacher, who sent it to guidance. I told them about it, crying because of how hurt it made me feel. Luckily I got help.\n\nHe tried to doxx me later by saying what county i lived in.\n\nHe DID try to apologize through minecraft when i was playing with  my cousin (we were bored). I did not accept it because, well, he told me to kill myself and he gave me major depression.\n\n2 years later, I looked through my mom's old phone and found it in the screenshots. I had an idea. How about I show this on Instagram? For revenge? I still have it on my mom's phone but I'm still debating on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTell me reddit, WIBTA if I did this?",

      "title": "AITA for Not Paying a New \"Friend\" to Watch Our Puppy?",
      "description": "Backstory: My husband and I are new (by almost two years) to our area - we moved here so he could attend dental school. He goes to school full time and is an Italian immigrant (relevant). Shortly after moving, we met a woman (50s) in our church who is also originally from Italy and she was delighted to meet, talk and associate with another Italian. She invited us over for dinner twice as she is quite proud of her cooking and hosting. She seemed very friendly and also a bit lonely as she only has one son in college, with whom she is not close, and she has mentioned that she feels the other ladies in the church do not welcome her. The last time we went over, she talked a lot about her dog who is like a child to her - in fact, she spoils him by making him a hot cooked meal of human food every night. She also had a friend over with his dog and so we mentioned our own small puppy. She expressed disappointment that she hadn't told us to bring him and our puppy didn't socialize with the other dogs. She said her dog gets lonely and she would love for the two to have playdates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later we needed to find a sitter for our dog over the weekend before Christmas. For previous trips, we had once asked another family in the church (whose kids loved our dog) and another time a classmate of my husband's - both who watched our puppy for free. However, this time we thought of her, especially with her love of dogs, we thought she would enjoy having extra company over the holidays. When we asked her she seemed enthusiastic and said yes. We coordinated a time to drop him off (and provided all his food, crate, leash) and pick him up 5 days later. When we picked him up, she said everything had gone fine, he's house-trained so no accidents, she just said he was more energy than she was used to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen one week later she messaged my husband saying she \"didn't think she would have to do this\" but telling us we owed her $200 and she would accept payment either by Amazon/Whole Foods gift card, or email. We were shocked. Maybe we were naive but the previous sitters had watched our puppy for free as a favor and we knew them much less well. My husband asked why she expected payment and also hadn't mentioned it earlier. She said that it was obvious that pay would be expected from the work she did and that she had other friends whose pets she had watched and they paid her. For her, a friendly favor is taking out your dog once if you are late coming home and it \"did not cross her mind\" that we would ask this for free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately we told her sorry, we would not pay her as we have previously left our puppy with other friends for free and that was our expectation. She said she was \"disgusted\" by our behavior, that she thought we were \"different people\" and we should be \"ashamed\". But, she never mentioned payment \\*at any time\\* when we were coordinating details, not when we originally asked her, not when we dropped off the pup, and not even when we picked him up and we feel a little manipulated that after the fact she is now demanding this high price, especially as this sort of expense does vary quite a bit. As I mentioned before, my husband is a debt-ridden dental \\*student\\* so we are a little taken aback that she thought our first choice was to drop $200 for dog-sitting without discussing prices beforehand. Honestly, if she had messaged us saying that she thought there would be some compensation and left the price open, we wouldn't mind sending her $70 for her trouble but her first message demanded compensation and even payment details! So AITA for refusing to pay her??",

      "description": "I read stories on Archive of Our Own. For those of you who don't know about this website, it's basically a repository for fan-created content, mostly of an explicit nature. Now there's a subset of content on this website that is about real people, but this is usually limited to celebrities.\n\nI came across this particular story because one of the writers I follow bookmarked it. Basically, the story is about a high school teacher Mr. John Doe, who has dub-con sex with his teenage students Adam Jones, Bill Green, and Carl Smith (names changed for privacy, btw). It was posted in 2017, and last updated a year ago. In their notes, the author says that the story is a fantasy about one of their teachers and the other boys at their school. They claim not to have used their real names in the story.\n\nThe thing is, the names used in the story were quite unusual, and out of curiosity I did some light digging on Facebook. Turns out that there's a John Doe who's a teacher at Anytown High School. And what do you know, Adam Jones, Bill Green, and Carl Smith all happen to be past/present students at Anytown.\n\nWIBTA if I sent an anonymous email to John Doe about this? Normally I would not get involved, but John Doe is a high school teacher. Googling his name puts the tag for this very explicit story as the top result. Considering his line of work, this is something that might have real consequences for him. I don't know if John Doe himself is aware of this, but I feel this is something he should know of, in case he wants to try and get it taken down.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure if this is my place to say anything, considering I don't know any of the people involved. I also feel it's quite untactful to basically tell someone about another person's explicit fantasies about them.",

      "description": "My niece, who is ten, hasn’t been allowed to have gluten since she was six and had a “reaction” to it. I love my sister to death, but she can be incredibly gullible. As far as I know, my niece ate a lot of pasta one night and had a rash the next day. My sister’s friend told her that she probably has a “gluten intolerance,” and my niece hasn’t had gluten since. My sister has never spoken to her daughter’s pediatrician about this, and my niece hasn’t been diagnosed with celiacs or anything like that.\n\nI was babysitting my niece the other day, and we were playing out in the yard when a girl from her neighborhood came out and asked if my niece could play at her house. I said sure and hung out with the girl’s mom while the girls played. At snack time, the girl’s mom got down a jar of cookies and asked my niece if she wanted one. My niece asked me if it was okay, and I didn’t want her to feel left out, so I let her have one.\n\nAbsolutely nothing happened. My nice enjoyed the cookie and then went back to playing with her friend. My sister had no idea when she came home. Then this morning, I was hit by a storm of texts from my sister calling me evil and accusing me of trying to kill her daughter. Apparently, her daughter told her that she’d had a cookie at the neighbor’s, and my sister called to confirm that they weren’t gluten free.\n\nEveryone in my family is mad at me and saying that even though they don’t think my niece really needs to be gluten free, we should respect my sister and her parenting choices. I say that my niece shouldn’t have to miss out on life and experience because of my sister being misinformed and overbearing.",

      "description": "Hi Internet.\n\nI recently found out I'm pregnant, yay! With this comes a barrage of tests and pokes and prods, a nightmare for someone with a severe anxiety, the majority of which is rooted in a phobia of needles \\*coughcough\\* ME \\*coughcough\\*. I have to have a blood test, to make sure my blood type and the baby's are compatible. It's routine. Everyone has to do it. Mine was supposed to be today. My anxiety started to get the better of me and I started to have an attack. The nurse trying to draw my blood seemed to get frustrated with me, even shoving the photos of the ultrasound I'd received minutes before in my face. She brought up my tattoo. She brought up the fact that she has a patient that's a four year old with a kidney transplant who does this easily. (That never worked for me; I'm not a four year old, I'm me!). I devolved into a full blown panic attack. The nurse's solution? Bring in another nurse to hold my right arm down. My mother (she comes along to appointments instead of my husband because he's a Marine), told them to stop, which they did.\n\nI've thought about this a lot, and I'm convinced that if I had been held down and they'd continued, I would have hurt not only myself, but I would have lashed out and possibly hurt some poor nurse that didn't ask to deal with my shit today. Am I the asshole for feeling like the nurse wasn't very compassionate or professional? Or am I looking at this all wrong? I'd love to see this situation from an outsider's perspective.\n\nThanks for listening, Reddit.",

After that I finally asked him to.  “leave and to not come when I have friends over” then he proceeded  to cause a temper tantrum and stormed out the door.\n\nMy parents are telling me that I did the wrong thing because he can’t help it because of his condition but on the other hand he has been very obnoxious to my friends and I.\n\nSo AITA for asking him to stop coming when I have friends over?",

For 3 years it was a running joke because he liked her but slept with me (I was super easy at the time so it didn’t take much). I must also note that in that time, she never had feelings for him.

      "title": "AITA for snapping at my dad after a very stressful past few months",
      "description": "So in November (2 days before my 17th birthday), I ended up finding my brother after an accidental OD (only just got the M.E. report back today, before this the cause was thought to be his sleep apnea and so everyone thought he just rolled over and never woke up). I still remember everything about it, it's buried beneath a lot of shit but the feelings are very noticeable, and can't hardly sleep anymore. I didn't really have a good sleep schedule in the first place, but now I'm not able to actually get to sleep until around 3-4am and have to wake up at 7.\n\n I also have a form of autism, Sensory Processing Disorder(SPD), which makes it so I can't tune things out, and just get filled with Sensory input until I can't take it anymore and have a full on (TRIGGER WARNING I'm exaggerating cause dark/self deprecating humor is one of the ways I get through life anymore TRIGGER WARNING) retard meltdown and lock myself in my room for 3 or 4 hours to mess around on my phone or PC. This SPD thing also makes it extremely hard to actually know what feelings mean what, and how to deal with them. \n\nI also can't really talk about these things with my parents, cause I see/hear them having their own moments everyday, so I don't talk about it with hardly anyone, the only ones outside of my family that know is some people from my church and one of the discord servers im in. They've tried to get me to go to counseling, but since *I* don't even know what's going on inside my head enough for me to understand it, (and I've said this multiple times both in and out of the sessions) idk how they think I'm going to be able to tell them. Which just means I've been keeping all this crap inside my head, with no way to get it out, for the past two months.\n\nThis morning, actually technically now it's yesterday morning but whatever, we got the report back from the medical examiner saying that his death was indeed accidental, but it was not asphyxiation, instead it was \"acute drug toxicity: fentanyl and ethanol combination.\" Which right there kinda sounds like he did try to call it, but he was also completely sober for a good 4/5 months and we didn't have any alcohol in the house at the time.\n\nNow this I have said multiple times in and out of the counseling sessions. The M.E. said they estimated his T.o.D at somewhere between one and four AM. which I have been taking harder even than the fact that he's dead, because I was completely up and awake during that whole time window, my door is always open, and only 6 feet away from his. So even though he always had his door shut, I still have heard various sounds (like him watching his phone, or talking to his friends), and I didn't hear anything at all, he's usually quiet at night anyway but still, I was sitting, not 10 feet from where he just died for the better part of 12 hours (we, and by we I mean me, didn't find him until 2 almost 3 in the afternoon), and didn't even notice. \n\nI understand that both my parents are having their own issues with this, but they also know that literally every inch of my body is in pain 24/7 with nothing anyone can do about it, my shoulder especially since the 911 operater insisted we do cpr on a body that's (TRIGGER WARNING) stiffer than morning wood in no nut November, which WILL fuck you up if you try that, and on a soft bed, which will ALSO fuck you up if you try. So between A. Those two things, and B. My shoulder already locking up on me often, it hurts like a *buttcheek on a stick*. I only make a point of this because LITERALLY EVERY TIME MY DAD GOES TO WAKE ME UP IN THE MORNINGS HE FUCKING POKES AND SHOVES THE MOST FUCKED UP PART OF MY BODY LIKE ITS A FUCKING SLIME BALL. * Ahem * sorry about that. \n\nThis afternoon I was making dinner since I found a recipe I have been wanting to try for a while now, and had to cover a bowl with some tin foil so the meat could marinade without flies or something like that getting into it. I had my dad helping with some stuff, like cutting the onion and the chicken since it was actually a complicated marinade, but anyway, I went to get the foil out and unrolled, but for whatever reason the roll just fell out of the box and on to the floor.\n\nThat: * happens *\nMe: well shit\nDad: WTF YOU JUST THREW ALL THE FOIL ON TO THE FLOOR!!!1!1\nnow mind you he saw that I had the box for the foil *firmly grasped* in my hand, the EXACT same way he does it.\nMom in other room: he didn't just throw it on the ground, he clearly said \"well fuck\" when it fell lol.\nMe: I didn't think it was going to just fall out-\nDad: well you should have been paying attention!!!\nMe: I clearly was paying attention, i only looked away for not even 2 seconds to try and see how much I actually needed.\nDad: YOU CLEARLY WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION OTHERWISE THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED!\nMe: like I said I WAS paying attention, I DIDN'T know this was going to happen, it's not like I did it on purpose.\nDad: YOU CLEARLY WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION OTHERWISE THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED!!!\nat this point I was tired from having babysat a 4year old and a 2month old for 2 days straight, hurting so much for past 15 years, and emotionally exhausted from not being able to get this grief shit out of my head. I also knew that the only thing he was going to say was it was 100% my fault I did it on purpose and I need to pay attention. I still had the box for the foil roll in my hands, so I just chucked it on the floor and went to my room cause otherwise it would've just been me yelling back to try and get him to actually hear what I'm saying, him trying to slap my mouth for \"talking back to him\", me raising my arm to try and block the slap him trying to slap me even harder for trying to block the slap(like im just going to sit here and be harassed and slapped for trying to make my voice loud enough for him to hear sounds coming from my mouth lol)\n\nTL;DR: I've been stressed for the past 2 months cause of death in the family, and pain. Accidentally dropped foil on floor, got yelled at for being a moron, tried to explain it was not on purpose, had to yell to be heard over yelling, went to my room to avoid A. Getting yelled at more, and B. Escalation.",

      "description": "So here's how this story goes:\n\nI'm in the theatre department at my high school, and many of the upperclassmen are pretty rude. They constantly gossip and ignore people that they aren't friend with, despite the fact that we all have to work together. They also pretend to know more than they do, and undermine people just because they're a year older. One of these upperclassmen, let's call her Jaime, is part of this group.\n\nFor context, Jaime and I have never had a conversation, and I think we've talked maybe once. Because there's a lot of downtime in theatre, we tend to sit backstage and talk. At this time, we're in a group of about 6 people, all in different grades. I'm half listening, not contributing, and leaning on one of my friend's shoulders, tired from rehearsals. Somehow we get on to the topic of boys, and I zone out, uninterested. However, I snap back into reality after Jaime, who wants to talk about her crush, looks at me and says in an extremely condescending tone, \"I don't know if I can talk about it around you. I don't think you seem very trustworthy.\" And then just looked at me.\n\nI'm shocked to say the least. We'd never had a conversation, and she didn't, and still doesn't know me at all. I was angry and tired at the time, and now looking back at it I think I seemed rude, but I said, \"What would you know about that? You don't know me.\"\n\nShe did a like shocked laugh, and then rolled her eyes. The conversation continued, but I'm sure she called me a bitch later.\n\nNow, three months later, she REFUSES to look or talk to me, ever. We just wrapped up another show, and the whole three-week production period when we were working together, she acted like I was a literal pest. We'll be in a conversation with the same people, and she'll position herself as far away from me as possible, and never even looks at me, or acknowledges that I'm there. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I'm worried that when we have to work together again, it's going to get worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Title sums it up. For the most part. You see, this classmate in front of me in class (high school) keeps turning around and trying to talk to me, and occasionally will touch my, or somebody else’s arm or things. Most of the time when he does this (to me at least) I try to tell him to stop, and sometimes he does, and sometimes he doesn’t. (I think he has some mild mental illness.)\n\n   Just today, he went down on the floor to pick up a pencil that he tossed in the air and couldn’t catch, which landed right next to me. Once he picked it up, he stayed squatted on the ground next to his desk, talking to the point where it made me sort of uncomfortable. (Like the title says he possibly could be gay.) I try to ask as politely as possible for him to stop, but I can always feel that hint of annoyance in my own voice.\n\n    So my question, (may you all have pity on my soul) is am I the asshole for not playing along and trying to be overly nice to him? I want him to leave me alone personally, but I don’t want to be rude.",

I believe it is a relatonship beyond repair (she told my fiance - first time meeting each other - if we invite my family to the wedding, he will destroy the family [exact words]). She's only called once in the past 8 years and that was for me to buy her something. My friends are fully aware of this situation  but still give me updates on my mum. For instance, sending me pics of her house decorated for chirstmas. This frustrates me and I have expressed this to them that I don't want to hear any more as I couldn't care any more about her life success stories (she is a successful businesswoman with honorary doctorate and she refers to herself as doctor now [cue eye roll]). I think they are just trying to help and wished we put our issues behind. I probably am not an asshole but I feel like one. I can either ignore any mum-related msgs or just completely tell them to stop.\n\n\nThis is probably a poor post for the sub but I really feel frustrated.",

      "description": "I (24f) have been dating my fiancé for two years before he proposed to me last July. We decided to have a year-long engagement and set the wedding date for July 2019.\n\nTwo months ago, my sister (22) met a guy that she really liked and started dating him. This is the first relationship she has ever had. \n\nA week ago, she told me they planned to get engaged next month (after three months of knowing each other!) and married a week or two before me.\n\nSoon after my fiancé and I got my engaged, my parents offered to contribute a certain amount to the wedding (significantly less than what my fiancé, my in-laws, or I am paying) and have only yet contributed a sixth of what they said they would. \n\nMy sister still lives with my parents and has just as poor spending/saving habits as they do. She knows how tight money is right now but expects our parents to pay for half of her wedding. Her and her fiancé do not plan to pay for any of the wedding. \n\nSo why is she making a wedding the same time I am when she knows my parents can’t possibly help with both? \n\nAnother thing, my sister only just met this guy, so why is she rushing into marriage? Beside for the fact that I am worried she is being rash without thinking of the consequences to her own life, I also think she is inconsiderate to steal my spotlight and make the months leading up to my wedding about herself and her wedding. \n\nWhen I asked why she couldn’t make the wedding later in the year, she gave two reasons: 1) she and her boyfriend do not touch for religious reasons and do not want to wait until after my wedding to start touching and 2) my 18 year old brother moved to another country and my sister and mother think it’s unfair to make my parents pay to fly my brother back to the States twice in one year.\n\nMy relatives will not be able to fly in for both weddings if they are so close together. Since her wedding will be before mine, most of my relatives will likely miss my wedding even though mine was announced in July 2018 and hers will likely be announced in March or April of this year.\n\nMy sister does not want to make her wedding directly after mine because my brother must fly back to his new home for visa reasons and she (understandably) does not want him to miss her wedding.  \n\nMy mother and sister are telling me I’m selfish for not wanting her to get married a week or two before me. Am I being selfish and an asshole? Or should she wait a few more months to get married? ",

      "title": "AITA For cutting off contact with my adopted sister because she \"loves\" my rapist like a \"brother\"?",
      "description": "This is a throwaway account. Idk if any relatives use Reddit, so.. yeah.\n\nThis is a long story, and has many details that (I believe) all matter, but it is hard to tell it through such a short amount of text, so bear with me. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI (F20) cut off all contact with my adopted sister (we will call her Rachel) a couple of years ago, and I'm still wondering if I am the asshole in this situation. \n\nSome background:\n\nRachel was adopted into my family when her and I were freshmen in highschool. We had been best friends since 6th grade and after much consideration, based on her home life, my parents took her in.\n\nWe had a typical sister relationship. We got along well, but we also fought occasionally, and more so as our highschool years went on. I could have been a better friend/sister at times, for sure. But other than that, we were good. \n\nOnto the situation:\n\nFreshman year of highschool (I'm 13, she was 15), Rachel and I shared a group of friends. One of our friends was a 21 year old guy from our church youth group. My parents trusted  (let's call him Ron) him because of this, so Rachel and I hung out with him a lot. He would pick us up and take us to the mall or the movies.. the three of us (sometimes others tagged along) had a lot of fun. Rachel became really close with him and started calling him \"brother\", which I thought was weird at first, but since I wanted to be like her in some ways, I occasionally referred to him as our \"brother\", as well.\n\nWell, for my 14th birthday, Ron offered to have a mini party (Me, Rachel, Ron, and 1 other friend of mine) at his apartment, where he would provide alcohol. This was not a red flag to me, since we (me, Rachel, Ron, and others)h ad hung out at his apartment before and had alcohol there. \n\nI agreed to this and made plans with Rachel. She had a softball game the day of the party, but told me that her and our other friend would just meet me at Ron's that evening.\n\nLong story short, she never showed up. I had one drink and passed out, only to wake multiple times throughout the night to witness Ron taking advantage of me. \n\nThe following morning (my actual birthday), I woke up at about 5am with a bad headache and felt sick. I immediately got dressed and Ron drove me home. I told him that I didnt remember saying yes to what had happened that night and he apologized, and left. I went to my room and laid on my bed. Rachel was in her room listening to music, so I went in and asked her why she didnt show up. She told me that she had told Ron that she couldn't make it, that she had spent the night at our friend's, but that she was sorry she couldn't be there. \n\nFF a couple of months, I decided to tell Rachel what had happened, because I began to worry for her safety, as she had still been hanging out with Ron, and now without me (because I stopped altogether after that day). She apologized for what I had gone through, but I had a feeling that she didnt believe my story. She continued to hang out with Ron. \n\nI think this info is critical to her assessment of the situation; I think she doesnt believe me because one time, at one of our previous parties at Ron's, she had walked in on me and Ron kissing. Before she walked in, I had been talking to Ron about truth or dare, and he dared me to kiss him. I was drunk and thought that it would be funny to do that, so I did. And she walked in at the wrong moment and never let me explain what happened. \n\nOkay, so FF to Senior year. \n\nRachel was kicked out by my mother for stealing and doing drugs and some other things (I hadn't seen Ron around for a while at this point. I thought they weren't hanging out anymore). She moved in with her boyfriend and basically stopped talking to me and my family (besides holidays). I would text her occasionally to see how she was doing but that's about it. \n\nShortly after this, I decided to tell my parents about what had happened to me. My dad made me go to the police and make a report, and eventually Ron was informed of the situation. \n\nFF to about a year ago.\n\nRon was killed in a motor vehicle accident. Not knowing if Rachel was aware or not, I texted her and asked if she knew about what happened. She told me that not only did she know, she was in the hospital every day holding his hand for nearly a month. She then said \"I know you don't like him, but I love him, he's like my brother.\" I said, \"Its not that I dont *like* him, it's that he *raped* me. But, you know what? You can love whomever you want.\" (Not exact quote). She said, \"I love you.\" And I didn't respond. \n\nHer Facebook timeline photo is of him. Her bio says \"My brother is an angel, R.I.P.\"\n\n\nShe has recently tried to get in contact with me, but I felt like I would be happier if she wasn't in my life. So I refused to give her my new phone number and have not reached out. \n\nSo, AITA for doing this?\n\nTL;DR: I was raped at 14 by a 21 y/o mutual friend of my adopted sister. I told her about it and I dont think she believed me. After the guy died (and she spent his dying moments with him), I cut contact with her because she keeps saying that she loves him despite of how I feel about him and she calls him her brother.",

As a result of the auto-piloting, I don’t understand what’s happening in class, and because of that I feel stupid. Because I feel stupid, I don’t pay attention in class. \n\nI know that the simple answer to this problem is to pay attention in class, however, that is much easier said than done. A few days ago, I had a panic attack and cried, for the first time in a long time. I spent an hour and a half (or so) in counseling talking about my issues with some (the counselor) for the first time in a long time as well. \n\nEveryone has been super accommodating and encouraging for me which is great, but that doesn’t change the dread that I feel at school. And until I get professional counseling I don’t want to go back to school. I start counseling soon enough but I know that taking that off would be a long time. But I’m thinking about asking my dad if I can stay home soon, I just don’t know if I would be the asshole for doing it.\n\nAll my dad expects from me is to not do stupid things (drink, get arrested, etc) and to not fail classes.

      "description": "Me and this girl (I’m going to call her Sabrina) have been hanging out about every other day and it’s pretty obvious to both of us at this point we like each other based on what we do and what we say but neither of us has made a move to be more than “friends” yet. \n\nThe guy who introduced me to Sabrina (let’s call him Snoopy) was an old friend of hers, and as time went on I learned she was old friends with really about every one of Snoopy’s friends (which is important later) \n\nAnyway we went out tonight and had a good time as usual, talking about whatever when the subject of how we met comes up and we start talking about Snoopy and her friend group. I asked her when’s the last time they all hung out and She told me she hasn’t hung out with this guy (let’s call him Richard) in a while and the conversation ends there.\n\nWe were at Snoopy’s house where all of his (and her) friends were when it began nearing time to take her home. I left her in a room with Richard (remember him?) to talk to Snoopy and the rest of the lads to decide to take a trip to the supermarket for some snacking before I go\n\nAt this point I go back into said room to ask Sabrina if she wants to come with us to the store (it’s pretty clear in hindsight they weren’t sober but he was more drunk than she was), and she says she wants to stay. \n\nI say okay and we dip, and when we come back I find out they had sex while I was gone. I didn’t say anything and acted like I didn’t know but it was pretty obvious to me what had happened but I shrugged it off and waited in the car to take her home. \n\nWe drive home and she’s really quiet the whole ride so I start suspecting she knows I know. I get to her door and she asks me what’s wrong but I don’t say anything, I mean what would you say? \n \nThis is when she starts getting jumpy and desperate with her questions about what’s wrong as she realizes I know. She started to cry and tell me she was sorry and she didn’t mean to do it, that she didn’t mean to throw away her happiness, that she didn’t mean to fuck up so badly but I didn’t say anything in response other than a goodnight \n\nShe is trying to convince me as hard as she can now over text she is sorry, that she regrets it, that she doesn’t want Richard, that she didn’t mean to throw everything away like that, that it was a stupid decision and she wishes she could fix it \n\nI’m ignoring her texts and apologies because I feel like I can’t forgive someone for doing something like that but then again this has never happened before and I don’t know how to handle it. It’s like a slap in the face to tell someone you want to be with them and then turn around and sleep with someone else after being with them for less than an hour. \n\nAITA for breaking off this relationship? I don’t know what to do ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months. Something I am a little concerned about is the topic of me becoming pregnant. This is totally hypothetical as I am not pregnant, and do not plan on getting pregnant any time soon. The only form of contraception we use is birth control, which I take religiously, so the chances of me becoming pregnant are very slim. However, as two adults actively doing the act, the chance of pregnancy is still there, and I think it’s important to discuss the possible consequences. My boyfriend says that if I get pregnant and decide to keep the kid, he will leave. He will not pay child support. He will not be involved. End of discussion. To him, in the off chance I do get pregnant, getting an abortion is the only option if I want to stay with him. I’ve told him that I am in no way ready for kids either, but it is also very off-putting that if the situation did arise, my only choices would be abortion or becoming a single parent. Again, the chances of me becoming pregnant are very slim, but I still don’t like my boyfriend’s attitude towards the situation. So, AITA?",

      "description": "Hey all, as a preface this happened several weeks ago. Anyways let's cut to the chase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been dating my girlfriend for more than a year. We both met while in nursing school and as we have gone on to our clinical years, our relationship has transitioned to long distance as she traveled to the west coast while I stay on the east coast. In all fairness this decision was made before we were in a relationship, and it something we are both happy with and make every effort to keep in touch be it over text, facetime, etc. She is beautiful, talented, incredibly smart and the woman of my dreams. She is the only one I have seriously considered a future with. We both have not dated very many people and one of the features of her last relationship was that her ex betrayed her trust in several ways with lies and deception and it really affected her to the point of being a key part of that relationship's demise. To me this was reprehensible by him, and so one of the features of our relationship that I wanted to focus on was trust and communication. Even before we were dating and just \"seeing eachother\" with no strings attached I strove to make this point clear through my words and my actions. I really like this girl and I was going to make damn sure she knew and that I was serious. There were multiple instances where other people just in the course of conversations would ask me out, flirt with me, or otherwise make advances. Each and every time this happened I politely turned them down or steered the conversation away because to me I didn't want to ruin my chances with this girl who I really thought was special. I did all of this unprompted, without being asked, and went so far as to tell her about every instance because I wanted to show her I had nothing to hide, and was fully invested in a future with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways fast-forward to a party a few weeks ago where myself and my two room-mates (one M, one F) were hosting a party together. F room-mate invited her friends over whom we had never met. I went down and chatted with them for a while, thought nothing of it and went upstairs to my room to get ready; during this F asks me if I was still dating my girlfriend as she hadn't heard anything in awhile, to which I told her yes of course.  I rejoin them about half an hour later when one of F's friends starts talking to me and starts playing a guessing game with me as she was adjusting my costume and I couldn't talk. She asked if I had a girlfriend, I nodded, to which she looked at me and said \"Hmph, shame\" before walking away while still maintaining eye contact. Ah, found the one who was asking. I didn't even want to give her the time of day, said \"mhm\" and the party started a little after that. I wanted nothing to do with her and made it a point to try and avoid her over the night, not because she was a jerk or anything but because I didn't want to create even a semblance of being unfaithful. As with every time before I told my girlfriend about this and she thought it was funny, I should mention too that I had her on facetime in my room as the party was going on and she was studying in the other room; we do this routinely when we're busy just so we can \"be there\" with the other person and I stopped in every half hour or so to say hi and bring in some friends to say hi too. I later found out that this girl had a reputation for breaking up couples and getting other guys to cheat on their girlfriends. I told my girlfriend about this and she immediately wanted me to say to the girl, \"hey, if I didn't have a girlfriend right now I would totally fuck you\" and give her my number (when in reality it was my girlfriend's) so that my girlfriend could fuck with her. Anyways I was immediately off-put by this and it made me uncomfortable, I never wanted to flirt with this girl or any other in the first place; she made me uncomfortable, and it really made me go against what I had been doing with my girlfriend for so long. I even went so far as to tell my close friends who were there that this girl was weirding me out and I was just gonna stick with them for the night. I told my girlfriend no I would not and she got upset and texted her other friends saying that she wanted me to do this, I was saying no, and that she thought I was being lame. Somehow her friend agreed with this. She kept telling me to, this has happened multiple times before where she has called me lame for not doing something she might want me to. She often calls me out for not being interesting enough and while she says this is a joke, sometimes it really digs in. Eventually I agreed to do this, only because I wanted to see my girlfriend happy. This is where I wonder if I may be the asshole. I go up to the girl and deliver the line, I should add that I have an awful short-term memory. I cannot remember a ten-digit phone number to save my life and unfortunately do not have my girlfriend's memorized. I also had a few drinks in me so that only hurt my cause. So when it came time at that moment to give the girl my number, my mind blanked. I could not for the life of me remember my girlfriend's phone number. So we kept talking and I wanted to keep up the act so I could eventually give her the number. Eventually the girl opened up to me and started crying about her \"reputation\" and how it's something she never wanted and how she has regretted the things she has done. We went into another room just the two of us to keep talking and left the door open about a quarter of the way. Her friends came and went and even tried to get her out of there because they \"knew her reputation\" and didn't want her alone with me. We both said it was cool and wrapped up the conversation shortly after. I honestly felt bad for this girl and got her tissues and just listened to her for about an hour. Again I did not give her my girlfriend's number and she ended up staying the night, along with all of F's girlfriends downstairs while I went to bed upstairs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI texted my girlfriend the next morning and she immediately asks me if I had given the other girl my number, I told her I hadn't and without even asking for details starts saying that she's breaking up with me and hangs up facetime. I'm floored by this and immediately try to call her back. This is my worst nightmare and why I wanted to avoid the situation in the first place. She's crying and calling me worthless, scum, and most other kinds of insults. I'm trying my best to explain what happened and nonetheless apologizing profusely. She asked if the other girl was still over and I replied that I didn't know because I was still in my room and hadn't yet gone downstairs. At this point she forbid me from going downstairs, saying that if I so much as left my room we were over. I asked if I may be able to leave to shower, or even eat breakfast as it was noon at this point and I had not eaten since the prior night. She said I could if I wanted to but that we were over if I did. I stayed with her on the phone and on facetime trying to win her back until about 5 that evening at which point my other room-mate texted me to say him and F were going to the hospital because F had abdominal pain that wasn't going away and that he wanted to talk to me about it. I told my girlfriend about this, that my room-mate was about to go to the hospital we work at and if I could go down to see if she was ok as well as talk with M. She immediately starts screaming at me saying \"fuck your room-mate!!\" and hangs up on me. So that was a no. I end up not leaving and telling M and F that I can't make it down; I stayed in my room as she went to the hospital as she was discharged and returned home later that evening. By the end of the day I had not yet left my room and I finally got permission to leave and shower. I should add that I am on a challenging rotation time-wise, weekends are precious for studying and I was unable to get any work done, I was an emotional wreck. My girlfriend had threatened to break up with me several times over the course of our relationship prior to this, but never quite to this magnitude. It's been a few weeks now and she has \"forgotten all about it\", but to me it's still on my mind. Guys, I need to know. Was I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I’m at university doing a course that requires us to be on placement most of the time. We’re paired with partners on our placements.\n\nI have a car and my partner does not. Because of this I give her a lift to placement most days. Over the 10 week placement I would say I average giving her a lift 3-4 days out of 5. \n\nWe are both entitled to claiming back expenses. For things like parking tickets or bus tickets you can claim back the full amount with a valid receipt, whereas for petrol you get a certain amount per mile, which for my car (a small economical model) does not cover all the petrol. I can also claim a small amount extra for having a passenger but it is really a small token amount.\n\nPicking her up and dropping her off adds around 5-6 miles to my journey, and around 20 mins each way depending on traffic. That’s not a lot but it adds up, and equates around a full tank of petrol at least, not accounting for my time or the effort. I cannot claim this extra 5 miles on top of my regular journey. \n\nWhen doing my expenses the extra I get for having a passenger did not even add up to the cost of a tank of petrol, so I asked if she would be able to top the amount up to equate a tank and we’d call it quits. This was about £16 from her for the entire ten week placement. \n\nShe’s saying this is unreasonable as she’s had to spend money on buses the days when I didn’t give her a lift. When I pointed out that she could claim that back she’s stated she doesn’t have the receipts, which I don’t really think is my problem. \n\nI’ve said that going forward it would be best if she either made her way to my house if she wants a lift or she can make her own way and claim it back, which she says isn’t fair and is much more hassle for her.\n\nI don’t know if I’m being really mean here. Getting the bus is a pain which I know as I did it all last year. It’s also expensive and long, but at the same time I pay for the luxury of having my car and she doesn’t, and I feel pretty taken advantage of. She’s also been a pretty judgemental passenger, making comments if I’m a few minutes late etc etc \n\nTL:DR; friend is saying that giving me 1.60 a week for driving her to placement is too much.

      "description": "Throwaway, because I am scared that anyone I know will read this. \n\nI live in a very quiet area and a year ago my neighbors moved in. It's a single mother with two children (a new one is coming this year). \n\nThe children are sweethearts. I often meet them in the backyard. \n\nHowever, my problem starts here: the mom sent them outside without a jacket in winter and they stayed outside for 4 hours (because she got male visitors) She always screams at them for (often) no reason, like the boy touching the dog or stuff. It's very loud, neighbors two blocks away complained already. The mom often throws her trash and dog shit into the backyard - which we by the way share - and the staircase looks a bit like she's a horder. The girl had bruises on her arm and when I asked her she said she bumped her arm on a chair. Her male visitors are very aggressive too, I saw one of them scream at the children too. \n\nI feel like if I don't do anything the kids will get serious problems. I watched them play a game, named \"kill the cat\". We have a stray cat and she often comes to visit us and to get some food. She formerly was a cat of a granny that lived in our neighborhood too and since the granny passed, she strays around the neighborhood. The kids ran after the cat and wanted to catch her (to maybe beat her?). I told the mother and she just shrugged it off and said, that this is none of her business. \n\nNow, why anonymously? Because she got a letter by somebody in the neighborhood telling her not to scream till late nights and she rang the door of that neighbor like a maniac and threatened to beat the sh*t out of him. And I'm not good with confronting people. \n\nSo, AITA if I call CPS on my neighbor anonymously?",

      "description": "So obvious context is needed and this one is going to take a bit.\n\nAnd I'm very sorry if time lines make no sense. after having a talk with my mother about getting him out again she told me she doesn't want her year ruined and she's tiredof hearing about it. \n\nFor names I'll just use letters. (S) is the father of my half sister (hs) and he is a very sketchy. He is an alcoholic who has been arrested many times for it. And is usually under the influence of it.\n\nSo it all started about two years ago. Everyday my brother(B) mother(M) and I would be afraid of what this man would do. (S) would drink himself blind and act like he runs the place and would be reminded the only reason he's allowed here is for his daughter. (S) says so many passive aggressive things and would only actually speak to us when he's absolutely drunk. Other than being drunk this man wouldn't look our way. That is unless he absolutely needed something from one of us. \n\nFast forward sometime about a month or two and he finally gets arrested and is taken away for a year for a dui he was awaiting trial for that whole year. It finally seemed like (S) is gone we don't need to worry about him anymore. Once when we heard he was out we all said don't let him back in. We all know he has no where else to go. So with that in mind I locked all the downstairs windows and the doors. With this peace of mind I go off to work and come back after the shift to see a ladder to the second story and see his car there. The man broke into our house and I said he has to leave. (S) tells me \"I'm just going to live here, you can't get rid of me. This is how it has to be\" so with that I threaten to call the cops and tell my mother about it. He eventually leaves, but like he said he came back. \n\nBut before the year ends one more thing comes from this. This incident here is why I will never look at this man again. (S) doing what he does best and is drunk raging about how things are awful here and how things are going his way. So we tell Him yet again he has no power here since he only has to watch one child when my mother's at work. He walks off and we ask him why hes acting so mad. At this point my brother walks outside to see what's happening and (S) charges at my brother. Thankfully my mother caught him in his tracks and said he needs to leave and he fought all of it. \n\nNow we get into this year and his drinking habits pick up again. But they get worse. Instead of one bottle it's two. Now (S) is on a blind rampage. He starts making fun of everyone for months, talking shit about us to everyone who wasnt us. He isolated himself from us (when I say us I mean mother, brother, and me).  We didn't find this out until what really set everything off. We had a family friend come over one holiday and we told him (S) isn't fun to be around, but with that knowledge he said it's fine. (S) gets power drunk like we all assumed he would. And later that night he said all sorts of nasty shit to our family friend. At about 9:30pm (roughly) I hear him yelling viscious words to this man. Things about how he's a shit father a horrible man to be around and waste of alcoholic space. So I run out there and I see him fuming. I ask him to calm down and what's wrong. He tells me and my family that (S) hates us all and how he hates my brother the most. (He says nasty shit I won't go into unless asked.) and we all just say it's the holiday let it be. We go to sleep and I wake up with no (S) in sight. From what I was told (S) pissed all over our couch and left. \n\n(S) is back and hasn't done anything wrong but he's drinking again and I want to stop it at its core. So with that reddit.. Am I the asshole for trying to get him out of the house. \nI'm aware I shouldn't ask for help but what can I do?\n\nTL;DR My half sisters father is aggressive when drunk and terrorizes my family and I want him out \n\nThanks for the time reddit \n ",

      "description": "So for context I was out with friends at a pub. I had a lot on my mind and I was tired. So I decided to leave to walk to my car because I didn't want to ruin the mood for everyone else and wait for the rest of them because I was doing lifts that night for the ones that were drinking.\n\nSo anyway I'm dropping off all my friends when we get I'm dropping off the last two people. My friend gets out gives me money and leaves. The last person I was dropping off was drunk and leaned over the back seat of the car into the front to ask how I am because she noticed something was up with me. So I hesitated and then started to cry. Then she started to tell me that she was having a rough day because she thought she didn't know if she was pregnant or not and she started to cry. I felt sorry for her and we hugged for a good 30 seconds. I'd didn't want to speak about myself so I asked her to speak to me about the situation. She listed off a bunch of good reasons saying that her parents can't find out, she can't have it because of a money situation and she is too young to have it but she said she is too scared to have an abortion if she found out she was pregnant. I agree with everything she said and I know it's tough for her but i said that she's right but you need to check yourself. I told her that tomorrow she needs to get herself checked and deal with the situation because there's nothing I could do and she stopped crying and then said that it's fine. I said to her it's not and she needs to get it sorted but she just kept repeating that it's fine. So I left and dropped her off and gave her one last hug and told her to get herself checked. Next day I decided to message her around 2pm and asked if she checked and she replied back with \"no I was busy\". I got really pissed off because she was crying in my car saying that she was worried about maybe being pregnant at 18 years old and I told her I was here for her and I told her the solution was to check herself and if she was pregnant go to the doctors. So I decided to ignore her for a week and then a week later we argued and she brought up that I was too harsh against her that night and I was rude to her. I got annoyed because all I did was to help her as she was in need of help and no one else helped her. I then heard from another friend that she was pissed off with me because I was focused too much on her problems and not my own. I never cared about myself so I never really wanted to talk to her about my problems I just wanted to help her about her problem but apparently she got pissed off with me trying to be a good friend and helping her.\n\nAITA for saying all that stuff to her or is there boundaries to that type of stuff that I'm not seeing or something?",

Today, when I reached the crosswalk with the light, I pressed the button and waited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile waiting, I didn't notice the orange hand (stop) turn to the white man (walk) right away. I noticed maybe three seconds later and started walking at a normal relaxed pace (I wasn't in a rush) and the countdown (flashing orange hand) started, with an indicator telling me I had 13 seconds left to finish walking to the other side. I was around halfway, when a car that I noticed had its turn signal flashing in my direction, meaning he wanted to turn onto the street that I was currently crossing. I heard this and started running. When I looked back and the car had gone, the countdown hadn't even ended, meaning I still had time to finish my cross.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings for you to know:\n\n\\- The man had intended to turn right on a red light, which was allowed at this certain crosswalk (However, he probably wouldn't have been allowed to run me over, forcing him to wait for me)\n\n\\- I had pressed the cross button, and waited for permission from the light to go.\n\n\\- I didn't notice I was allowed to go right away.\n\n\\- I walked at a kind of slow pace, even though I knew I would have the time to finish crossing.\n\n\\- I was honked at, even though I had permission to cross.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole?

      "description": "So I normally operate on the basis you don't shit where you eat when it comes to dating. No-one in your friend group, no-one in your class at university, and no-one you work with. I decided to break the latter rule for a guy I work with. \n\nWe get on really well, and had spent time together outside of work on a platonic basis a few times over the last few months. We were becoming good friends as we had similar interests and we live and work in a small village so there aren't many people our age about anyway. I was a few months out of a messy relationship which involved a lot of cheating on my ex-boyfriends part, so it hadn't even crossed my mind that my co-worker was interested in anything more. There is also a slight age gap between us, me (f 25) and him (21), which to me reinforced that he wasn't interested. \n\nAnyway two weeks ago, he invited me to go skiing and I agreed. A few days beforehand he clarified that he was hoping it would be more of a date kind of thing, which I said was fine because he is a nice genuine guy and I thought why not. The date was great, dinner was great, and long story short we slept together not too long after. Which again was totally fine. \n\nThe next day we reverted back to normal, and there was no mention of the date or any future ones. On my end it kind of felt like we were probably better suited to being friends as we lacked sexual chemistry as weird as that is to write. So we eventually had the \"was that a one time thing\" talk, and both agreed that it was probably best that it was given that he didn't want anything serious and I had my reservations anyway. \n\nI thought everything was fine, and when we all went back to work I decided to alleviate the awkwardness, given we have so many mutual friends in a close knit workplace and small community, by just pretending that nothing happened and try to get everything back to normal. By pretending that nothing happened I mean, I treated him the same way I did before the date joking and talking as normal, not ignoring the date in the slightest or denying it when people asked I just downplayed it being a date to avoid it being weird. Or so I thought. \n\nNow however he got a bit drunk last night and messaged me saying I was being cold hearted? and a bitch for pretending like nothing happened? and though I don't disagree that that is a possibility, I also thought that was the best way to handle it? So I guess I am left wondering AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This won’t be a long post and this is my first time posting here so... please, be gentle. OK! So, long story short, I’m in a Long Distance Relationship and I’m actually thinking of getting married with her because I have never felt such a connection with someone. She told me “I know how hard this can be, so... If you cheat on me, I will forgive you, just don’t take advantage of the situation.” I obviously don’t cheat because I don’t even wanna risk an actual happy life over a “culito” you know? But here’s the thing. I was expelled from my last high school and now I’m in a new one for reasons I don’t want to explain, and there’s this girl, basically my first friend in the new high school. Typical shy, artsy girl, sweet person and a beautiful heart. I complemented her drawings and that’s how we started talking, fast forward a few weeks and we are doing art trades and projects with each other like a comic and shit, but stuff is going too good for THIS GUY. The girl starts sending me signals that she is interested in me, you know, being touchy, a lot of romantic drawings of my character and her. I ignore the avances of the girl BECAUSE I’m an absolute pussy and don’t like confrontation. Then one day she decides to outright tell me if I wanted to date her. A lot of thoughts went through my mind like vocal percussions, “if I cheat on my Gf I won’t get caught”, “this is a chance that I won’t get again”, “you waited all your life for this, do it”. And between all the shitty stuff, I panicked and said the first thing to dodge the bullet.\n\n“Sorry.... I’m gay”\n\nShe was obviously affected by this because she starts breathing heavily, the “I can’t cry here” kinda heavy. She tells me don’t worry about it, it was a dumb thing either way. I feel awful because I just broke a girls heart and I actually enjoyed being with her. Then, a few days later I get a text message from her saying how she hates me because I led her on and I used a retarded excuse to not go out with her because I’m a cheating piece of shit. “Don’t talk to me ever again”. And... honestly, I feel terrible. \n\n\nTL;DR I though about cheating on my girlfriend with a friend of mine and I said I was gay at the last second just to not be an asshole, ended up breaking some poor girl’s heart.

There's this other guy at work who has also been making advances towards her, which she says she doesn't like or appreciate in any way and that she is not interested in him. He comes in on days that hes not working to sit up in her office and flirt with her which is upsetting obviously. So I asked her why she doesn't just tell him that she's seeing someone right now if she doesn't want him to flirt with her all the time at work or just tell him that she's not interested in him. She is always telling me to be open with how I feel about things and so when I brought this up I wasn't expecting her to get so upset about it, I get that being jealous and insecure about this is so silly when she's already told me not to worry about it but I can't wrap my head around why she continues to flirt with him if she's not interested.

      "description": "First off, on mobile so sorry for formatting/spelling/grammer\n\nSo last night I was txting my best friend, lets call her K. We currently work together at the same store, but she is an advocate and I a manager. Due to unrelated corporate issues, we are both currently putting in applications elsewhere with the understanding that neither of us is expected to stay at this job for the other. \n\nShe txted me last night because she had found a job listing she was interested in that she thought she might have an in with due to a mutual friend (M). As I am a closer friend to M than K is with M, she asked me to ask for the referral for her. I told her I would be willing to do it, but that while I had no doubt M would follow through if she agreed, another mutual friend (E) (who is also closer to me than K) had applied for the same position and asked M for a referral as well a few tears back and the manager ended up giving E the run around.\n\nK then proceeds to wonder if E would be upset at her applying for the position since he didn’t get it, and I told her that I am 99% sure he wouldn’t mind given how long ago it was, but that if she was worried to txt him to let him know you are applying. \n\nK proceeds to tell me she just won’t tell him at all and goes ahead and applies. Now, this didn’t sit well with me mainly because in the past she had tried to set up E with a mutual friend.....only to sleep with and then start dating the guy she was setting him up with before they had even met a second time. At the time I explained to K that while she is very important to me, that I would not tolerate her acting so underhanded to my friends who are equally important to me, and that she had handled the situation extremely poorly. She understood after I explained it to her and apologies where had and things are (mostly) ok now. \n\nAnyways, due to what happened in the past, the fact that she had expressed that she felt she should ask at least tell him, and then intentionally did not even though I have every confidence it wouldn’t be an issue with E, I flatly told her she was an adult and could what she wanted-but the whole thing felt underhanded. And reminded her she had already fucked over E once. She understood and just shot off a quick txt to him letting him know what she had done, and surprise surprise- he didn’t mind in the least.\n\nNo one has told me I was an asshole in this situation, but I also kind of feel like I overreacted a bit. I can be a bit overprotective of my friends. Also, I feel if she hadn’t specifically said she felt she should tell him and then specifically did not out of fear he would be upset by it that it wouldn’t even be an issue.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my friend I won't be best man at his wedding a week before.",
      "description": "Hello reddit! My name is Kyle / Dabstep, and this is a story about the standards of friends and how I believe you should never let people treat you however they like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere we go! I have had this friend since high school (best friend, even). He is 26 and I am 25. We have been through some thick and some thin, including school jobs and drugs. We have quite the history, but this last year he has proven to me that he is less than a friend to me now. He has asked me to be his best man at his wedding recently, where he is marrying his stripper girlfriend of 8 months. I don't necessarily believe in the wedding based on the number of times they have broken up in that 8 months, but I agreed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started off this year unfortunately moving into my parents house after breaking up with my girlfriend and not being able to move into a place on my own. I would go to his house quite often during this time to play games and hang out because being around my parents is pretty much the worst. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRyan lives with his Dad in the basement, where he hasn't had a stable last him a month for almost three years at this point. He survives because his Dad and his girlfriend (stripper) buy him everything he needs and makes it so he doesn't have to me motivated to do anything. I don't care about this too much as it doesn't effect me, but I can see how its changing him over the years. He hasn't tried to get a job in a very long time, and any job that he gets, he find a reason to quit it right away. The dude couldn't even deliver pizza because \"the job was bs\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSix months into living at my parents again, the arguing has taken a turn for the worst and I am debating living in my car because it sounds better than that. I tell him about this and he agrees to move me in at 300 dollars a month for at least six months, which was great and I moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometime after I move in, he notices my computer is standing up on a 20 dollar Walmart table I had just bought, and he offered to let me use a card table in place. I took it and let him use the table for his figures (this is important to the story).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso important to the story: he owes me 100 dollars because I bought him a bike so that he could get to work, a job he quit after a week. Whenever I ask about the 100, he simply says \"when I have a job\". It has been almost six months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne month later, he comes to me about how the room I am in is worth at least 700, and that I need to start paying more. This is bullshit and I argue about it but end up agreeing to pay 400 dollars per month. During this whole time I am unable to use the laundry, unable to store food anywhere, and getting blamed for food that is going missing (none of which was my doing).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother month in, he really starts hinting that he wants me to pay 600 or he wants me out sooner than 6 months. I told him that I don't have anywhere to go and that I am not moving into my parents house who I had just moved out of and his response is \"that sucks dude, start looking\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the beginning of the last month, I am coming home from my girlfriends house to see what he is up to, asking to hang out and play some games. He mentioned he was eating tacos, so I told him about how I had just eaten a breakfast burrito. Before I was able to continue and say that my girlfriend had made it for me at her house, he interjects and starts screaming at me \"oh so you fucking at my burrito this morning? you are a piece of shit and you need to be out by the end of the month.\" I try to say what is going on but he hangs up and texts me that he isn't going to put up with my bullshit anymore and that he told his dad, and his dad now wants me out.\" (for context, the missing burrito was out of a freezer pack of 8 el montereys)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I reluctantly set up to move in with my girlfriend into the smallest room that is now going to be shared. Three days before I move out, he comes to me and says \"hey man I am kind of an asshole about kicking you out over the burrito, if you need another month you can stay\" which is ridiculous to say to someone after they have been setting up to move out for the last few weeks. I say no and move out, in which I give him his card table back but don't ask for my table back because I didn't have anywhere to put it and he was conveniently using it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward three months to today, I have moved into my own house in a nice part of town, am living alone, but am very broke because of how much money I just had to put down on this place. I text him a few days ago \"hey man, is there any way I can get that table back? my TV is standing on a very crappy nightstand and I could really use it back.\" He is now saying that I gave it to him when I moved out, which I never did and would never have done. I have no furniture so I am not about to give out what little is mine. He has multiple tables to put all of his little things on. I have two for my computer and TV.  I explain this to him and he is not having it. He believes that because I used him as \"public storage\" for months for the table that it his now his and that I am \"Indian-giving\" as he said to me word-for-word. How do you argue with a 26 year old person that uses that term?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I asked him one more time today if I am ever going to see that table and he said \"Nah man like I said indian giving, buy yourself another table at Walmart\" to which I replied \"enjoy the table, find yourself a new best man\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas this the right choice? AITA? Thanks for taking the time to read this! Sorry I am not an English major, nor have I done any school in the last few years so bear with my grammar!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: \"best friend\" kicks me out over burrito I didnt eat, refuses to give me back a table when he owes me 100 dollars on top of it. I tell him I won't stand at his wedding that is in 6 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Attached to the email was a letter written by an employee about his daughter’s leukemia.   \n\nI did not read it. These kind of things always bum me out. I saw the picture of her, looking really sick and I noped out of Outlook immediately. Not trying to play victim too hard but Thanksgiving is already a semi-hard time for me because I have been excommunicated by my family over religious differences and I just didn’t need that additional emotional toll right now. I don’t know this guy. It’s not like I would read it and then feel moved to contact him. That’s not something I would do. I really didn’t think it would bother anyone to not read it.  \n\nAnother coworker asked me if I saw read the letter and I told her no. I should have lied and said yes. Lots of people were moved to tears by the letter. Word has spread that I didn’t read it and now it has become a thing.

      "title": "AITA: Am I the asshole for getting defensive with my (ex) girlfriends nurse for the wrong course of action for treatment?",
      "description": "So I was in a relationship with this sweet girl for six months (I am a 23 year old lesbian), and it was this interaction with the nurse that has put the last nail on the coffin:\n\nShort backstory on me: Call me \"N\". I'm still trying to find out who I really am inside (finding the right job, home, destiny, etc). It was only less than a year ago that I have found out that I liked girls after I have had a bad time with guys (I was bisexual then). My temperament was only on the short end only when I see something I think is wrong, or when things do not go the way I expect. \n\nNow here is my ex: Lets call her \"K\". From what she told me, she has severe depression and panic attacks. But when she was not feeling down/scared, she is kind, affectionate, and creative. Rarely gets angry, and always listens when I have issues. So she might seem like she would tolerate me no matter what? Well, this is where the story begins, then, fellow redditors, ask this, \"Am I really an asshole?\"\n\nSo I was over at my girlfriends house the other day, and she told me she has been having suicidal thoughts. I knew K was suicidal and I was scared to leave her alone (her parents would not give two shits about her if she was having these kinds of thoughts). So me and her went over to the nearby emergency room and got checked in. The hospital did the usual thing like checking her vitals and asking questions.\n\nWhen it was time for me to leave the room for the social worker to talk to her about the more intimate things, I left and waited for a few minutes. Then I came back in and here is how the conversation went (from memory):\n\nN: \"So, what is the plan baby? Are they checking you into the behavioral facility?\"\n\nNurse: \"So K and the social worker have come to a conclusion that she does not need to be checked into the behavior facility, she is going to give a call to her consular and make an appointment with him\".\n\nNow for a little more background: K does not have a car, so she cannot drive herself to her appointments (nor do I have much time out of my day to just drive her back and forth to her appointments), and her parents whom she lives with still works. And whenever she schedules an appointment, she does NOT put it down on a calendar and then the place she sees would get angry at her for not showing up and refusing to reschedule her. So JUST scheduling her for another visit? You might as well be pissing on a wildfire. And another thing is, is that I use to be suicidal myself, and had been checked into the emergency behavioral facility in that EXACT hospital before.\n\nNow, hearing that, I got a little too far off the deep end:\n\nN: \"Why the fuck not?!?\"\n\nNurse: \"K made her decision, and you should respect that, it is only up to the hospital and her to decide what is best for her\", \"Now, I will leave you and K to talk this out\".\n\n\\*K looks at me as to acknowledge what the nurse said was true\\*\n\nNow I thought that the nurse left the room, so I said this to K:\n\nN: \"Wow, what a bitch\".\n\nNurse: \\*comes back into the room\\* \"Excuse me, what did you say to me?! Say that to my face!\", \"It is the hospitals decision to decide what is best for their patients, not anyone else's\", \"now, you may have an opinion, but in the end, it is not up to you\". And she slams the door.\n\nK: \\*looking at me with great disappointment\\* \"N, that was really uncalled for, if you have another outburst like that in front of me SPECIFICALLY again, I will break up with you\".\n\nNow, I am a very emotional and expressive individual and always have been. I couldn't believe what my girlfriend said to me, and I just started crying softly. And being the nice person she is, she apologized and we made it up and went back to my car. \n\nA few weeks later: I never had another outburst like that. But one day, through Facebook message, she said she wanted to end the relationship. I looked back at the event that happened prior, and realized what I've done. So, like the ballsy person I am, I went to her home for the last time to do the breakup properly. I gave her the Christmas present I was going to give her (because it was close to the holidays), and the last words I have said to her was a tearful \"Merry Christmas\". To this day, I felt ashamed of myself for me being the cause of the breakup.\n\nAm I the asshole for being the cause of the end of this relationship? Why or why not?",

      "description": "Try to do as much background as relevant. I work for a small engineering firm which subcons for a fortune 500 company which makes parts that go into nearly every mobile device made by one of the biggest companies on the planet. I was promoted to manager back in November and think I'm way over my head because I really like the tech stuff but not so good with people. \n\nSo one of our devices is having an issue and my department's job is to fix the problem. We are under a super tight deadline because when the biggest company on the planet wants to release their next \"big thing\" on time, we don't want to be the holdup. Problem came to us last Thursday, boss had a deadline o this coming Wednesday when we are supposed to fly to our customers headquarters and explain our fix. I called my team in over last weekend and we actually made so much progress that I thought we were well on our way. My boss told me to bring in my team on Monday so we could prepare to brief him Tuesday before we flew out Wednesday. I don't think he remembered Monday is supposed to be a holiday.\n\nSo I made the decision that I really didn't need all six of my people (4 full timers, 2 paid interns but all essentially doing the same job) so I explained to everyone that I needed 3 people. I also said that this was a tremendous opportunity because they get to brief our CEO and potentially the CEO of a fortune 500 company so if any really WANTED to work on the holiday, please speak up. Also if any of them really didn't want to work, please speak up. No one spoke up as preference for either. This was Monday and every day since I would either mention in person or over email that I was still waiting for volunteers. I told them that if I didn't have any volunteers, I was just putting names in a hat and picking at random. No one objected or volunteered. \n\n\nSo last night I literally wrote names on pieces of paper, put them in my coffee mug and drew three names and emailed the \"lucky\" people and all the sudden all hell broke loose. One of the names I picked is our very talented African American interns. I was actually very relieved she was one of the one's I picked because while she's not the most technically capable, she is one that I can give a task to and she will get it to the 99% solution without any questions or intervention.  \n\n\nWell she was deeply offended that I was making her work on MLK day. She claimed that I was singling her out and went above my head direct to my boss. I was called into his office and was asked to explain why I picked just her. I explained that I didn't just pick her, I picked two others as well and that I offered everyone a chance to either work or not work multiple times over the week and no one, including this intern spoke up. My boss accused me of being \"tone deaf\" and then we went to speak with his boss who again asked me to explain. When I explained that I picked at random, she told me (paraphrasing) \"this is one of those times when your random pick shouldn't have been exactly random...do you understand what I'm saying?\" I told her that I was really sorry but I didn't and she said that I had a bad attitude and was trying to pin her into saying something she shouldn't say. So she is really pissed with me and she gave the intern the day off, basically going over my head. \n\nSo no either I pick someone else or I work 20 hours on Monday to get this project done before we brief the CEO on Tuesday. I feel like such an asshole for all this, maybe not for my process but for the outcome. \n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "This happened ages ago when i started high school but based on my parents reaction i still haven't forgotten it or came to a conclusion.\n\nLike i said above, it was the first day of high school which meant new school with new people that i didn't know. All these people were a year older than me and because they did a prep year they all knew each other.\n\nI have social anxiety, back then it was way worse. As a result, i just sat by my desk and browsed stuff on my phone. Every now and then i would hear people mumbling and whispering stuff about me. I couldn't hear exactly what they were saying but hearing my name or \"the new guy\" was enough to stress me. \n\nAfter this horrible first day, i head back home. I genuinely felt sick. Didn't have the energy to do anything. I went straight to bed and tried to get some sleep. Couple hours later my dad comes back from work and rushes to my room.\n\n\"Hey! How was your first day? Let's go somewhere nice, have dinner and celebrate!\"\n\nI was still very tired and felt like crap. The idea that i had to go there again tomorrow and experience it again was killing me inside. I politely said no. I made it clear that i felt like crap and just wanted to stay at home. My dads face went from the happiest, most exited man on the planet to the angriest, most disappointed man in a matter of seconds.\n\nHe then calls me a jerk and slams my door shut, like really fast. So fast the coat hanger that i attached to it fell on the floor. I thought that was gonna be it but no. I could hear him shouting the nastiest shit that anyone's ever used to describe me in the next room. Selfish was the most used. After a few mins pass, my mom comes in and usually she comforts me when me and dad argue over things or he gets pissed at me but this time, she also did call me selfish. \n\n\"He was all exited about you starting high school and wanted to have a nice evening out. It was selfish of you to reject him.\" she said. \n\nI get it completely that he wanted to bond as a family and have a nice evening outside after hours and hours of work and commute. However i really felt sick that day. It was about 7 hours of being very uncomfortable. I felt like i had a fever. The class wasn't hot and i didn't have any thicc clothing and i still felt like i was burning. The second i was out of it, i ran home where i was comfortable and wanted some rest. \n\nEver since this happened, i every now and then think about it for hours. Was i really in the wrong?  I don't usually look forward to spending time with my parents as we have very different mind sets. Different taste in about EVERYTHING you can imagine. But, i am their son and we love each other even if we don't get along well. I don't want to make them sad so i usually agree to hang out. That day, i really felt horrible and tired. I was tired yet couldn't sleep.\n\nWe are cool now btw.  This was a while ago. ",

      "title": "AITA for not letting my 5 year old neighbor hold my pet hedgehog?",
      "description": "First time poster here with a moral dilemma. \n\n*Backstory: I own a pet hedgehog named Loki.He needed to have an eye surgically removed recently and has finally recovered, but needless to say has been through a lot of stress. (Surgery, anesthetics, vet visits, antibiotics, etc.)\n\nMy vet posted his story to Facebook, with my permission, because hedgehogs are fairly unusual as pets and she was proud of saving his life. This is all fine, personally I don’t use Facebook but apparently the post got a lot of traction within our community. \n\nApparently, our neighbors saw the post as well and showed the pictures of my little companion to their 5 year old son. \n\n*Side note: I’m not close to my neighbors, just the occasional hello.*\n\nJust today, the father rang the doorbell and asked about Loki, referring to the post. It was kind of them to check up on him and I told them that he was doing well, to which he asked if they could see him. More specifically, if his son could see him. \n\nI understand that he is a rare pet and am aware of how exciting he must be to a kid, so I agreed. \n\nI asked them to come back later in the evening, since Loki is nocturnal and I avoid waking him up during the daytime (this was around 2PM, in Loki-time that’s like being shaken awake at 2AM)\n\nHe agreed and came back around 4:30ish (PM), with their son. He was really excited about seeing my hedgehog, so I let them in and brushed over the fact that they ignored my request. Loki wouldn’t be happy about me waking him up this early, but it would be fine. Plus, I don’t know the kids schedule, so maybe anything later wouldn’t have worked. \n\nI led everyone to my room and gently lifted the fleece blanket off my grumpy hedgie. After a while, he calms down.\n\nThe kid *looses his shit*. I mean excited squealing, jumping up and down, etc. This startled Loki and he curled up into a hissing ball (they’re easy to startle), to which I picked him up to calm him down. \n\nThe parents then ask if their son can hold him as well. He gets even more excited. \n\nHere’s where I want to know if I was the asshole: Hedgehog spikes can hurt when they’re defensive, and I wouldn’t trust a kid that young not to drop him out of fright. My hedgehog doesn’t know his scent and the kid was very fidgety prior to this, so I was concerned that this would scare Loki and lead to him being held improperly or dropped. And most importantly, I didn’t want to risk any further stress after his surgery story. \n\nI was polite, but firm when I said no.\n\nThe kid was upset, but ultimately understood and thanked me gloomily for showing him my pet. Despite being unhappy about not being allowed to hold him, but took it very gracefully. (Especially for a kid that young!)\n\nHere’s the thing: When we were at the door, the mom pulled me aside and told me that it was unnecessary of me to refuse her sons wish and that I had made him upset. She still thanked me, but shook her head as she left. \n\nAm I the asshole? Could I have handled it better? ",

      "description": "This happened quite a while ago but my brain reminds me of it everyday because there's one nagging question AITA?\nIt was my 13th birthday and I had a new bike, hurray! So I decided to ride it through the forest on the bike path. But first to get there I had to go up a large and steep hill. All was well and I had a fun time.\n(Quick side note the bike paths in my town take up half the pavement, one half for pedestrians the other for cyclists)\nThe day was beginning to end so I decided to head home. The hill I had once climbed I could now rocket down, so i was looking forward to it. And then it started.\nI began flying down the path and after a few seconds I noticed something ahead, it was a woman with a large dog staring at her phone walking in the bike lane. Huh? I didn't have a bell, and i was only getting closer so I decided to yank on my brakes. They worked well, too well because they also threw me off my bike (I was fine). \nAt this point I wasn't very amused. So imagine my shock when the woman says under her breath things like:\n'you were so close to hitting me' \n'really how didn't you see me'\n'children like you shouldn't be able to ride their bikes you could have really hurt me'\nAt this point I was quite unhappy so I said something foul under my breath as I was picking my bike up and getting ready to leave, she heard it and was getting more angry so I just left.\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "So my brother (30) moved back in with my parents two years ago. He was living out of state and got surgery, and so had to move home because he couldn't work anymore at his former occupation. Things are always fine, but he has very different political views than my other siblings and I. That's fine, everyone is entitled to their opinion. However, he constantly tries to start a political conversation, and rather than have a debate, he just starts yelling his opinion. Again, fine, if that's how you want to act as an adult that's your choice. Last time I was there it started with a discussion on medical marijuana, and how employers shouldn't be able to hold it against you. Which I agree with. it then spiraled out of control with statements like \"the green new deal the stupid Dems are pushing will outlaw planes\". Now, I don't really follow politics that much, but I have my opinions. My response was that I don't think that's what it says, I don't think  anyone wants to outlaws planes, because that simply doesn't even sound like a rational position. But I admitted that I wasn't really informed of the situation, but made the argument that it sounded far fetched. Now he starts yelling, got up and pushed me. I apologized to my parents and told them I won't be coming back until he either gets help or moves out. I know politics are particularly nasty right now, but it's absurd to think that I can't go see my own parents without worrying about being physically assulted.  I sent him a text saying we have an infinite number of things we can talk about that aren't politics, and we should refrain from any further discussion. ",

      "description": "Last post went over the character limit when I added a TL;DR and got deleted, so here it is again a little shorter.\n\nA few months ago I was doing homework at a friend's apartment and eating dinner while I worked. I was on the floor, which was carpeted, and had a cup of water with me. Now, I intentionally put the water far away from my stuff because I didn't want to run the risk of it spilling and ruining my electronics or notes.\n\nThe friend whose apartment I was at (J) was hanging out with her boyfriend (B) that night. At one point, they started roughhousing like usual, and when J went for the takedown, my cup of water got kicked over and sent across the floor towards my stuff. At first I didn't think that the water had gotten on my computer aside from a few droplets on the screen, that it had just sunk into the carpet and that was that. So I cleaned up the spill and went back to work. A few minutes later however, my laptop froze up, and then went to a black screen.\n\nI freaked out, asked if J had rice, she said she didn't, so I rushed home and brought back rice that I had, but not before giving very specific instructions to everyone there that nobody touch the laptop until I get back. Well, when I got back about 10 minutes later, B proudly announced that he had gotten it to turn back on. But it was on a weird screen that I'd never seen before, and I know when an electronic gets wet that you're not supposed to mess with the power. So I freaked again, threw it in the rice, and hoped for the best. But, when I took it to the Apple store the next day, I was told the entire inside was flooded and that I would have to foot the $1400 bill.\n\nFirst I called my parents, and they agreed to cover it up front because I simply didn't have that kind of money. But I knew I needed to pay them back, so I called J immediately after and explained the situation, and that since her and B did it, that I'd like if they helped me pay the cost. She agreed to help, but sounded somewhat reluctant.\n\nWe're all college sophomores, J has a job and gets huge discounts on housing, and B receives a lot of financial support from his parents. I don't have a job, I just get financial aid every month. After the next pay day after the incident, J gave me $45. That's the only money I've seen. When I ask, J and B either don't respond, or say something to the effect of, \"if your parents have already covered it then why are we giving you money?\" or that they earn their money and they shouldn't have to pay for my laptop.\n\nSo I'm a little fed up, and I really need them to help me out. They haven't outright called me an asshole, but the way they act about it tells me they think it. I hate asking over and over again, because I know that even though they work/get money, we're all broke college kids, but $45 out of $1400 is ridiculous. So, AITA for expecting that they pay for half of it, and insisting that they do?",

      "description": "Okay so this story happened years ago but still eats away to me to this day...\n\nI have a solid friend group that goes back since early college (we're in our mid 20's). Some of our friend group has left our city, but will usually come back to visit. Our one buddy, \"Jim\" was hoping to move back to our city and asked to crash out our place while he looked for a job (my roommate also is also in the same friend group) which of course was cool with us. \n\nJim ends up staying with us for about almost a month still job hunting, but this isn't a problem as he's our friend, he's chill and isn't messy. But, my roommate and I have both know that he has a sister in our city and ask each other why he isn't staying with her? We never bring this up to him because we don't want him to feel unwelcome - again not a problem at this point. \n\nThis is a good time to point out some aspects of Jim's personality. He's a pretty quiet guy, but always comes through with a funny quip or funny roast on one of our friends. He will sometimes joke about being smarter or better than other people, including our friends, but I always thought this was funny. For the record he is smart, I just sort of took at him hamming it up. Though he generally keeps to himself and is private, he's been with our group through a lot, he's just never really come out of his shell and been as super warm and open with us as we are with each other. But this is something we just accepted about him, it was never a problem. I think we all individually thought he was just closer to someone else in the group. \n\nThis brings us to the incident. Our whole group was out drinking, which is a regular occurrence. We're walking a pretty long distance to the next bar and we've all seemed to scatter in small groups toward our destination. I'm sort of walking on my own and Jim and our other friend, \"Dennis\", are walking ahead of me. At this point we're all pretty drunk, myself included so this is where things get a little complicated. \n\nI catch up to Jim and Dennis and we start talking. Dennis sort of falls behind us a little, but we all get in sight of the rest of our group. Me and Jim fall into kind of a deep conversation about humanity and the bigger picture. This is when Jim says something along the lines of \"Humans are stupid. People mean nothing to me.\" This took me aback because it was such a cold statement. I thought he was kidding at first, but it just was not the right context for this joke. I say \"what did you say?\" and he repeats \"people mean nothing to me\" I pointed to our friends and asked \"what about them?\" to which he shrugged. \n\nAt this point I just lost it. Keep in mind, this guy has never once said something positive or loving towards our warm and inviting crew and this is the first thing I hear from him about it. I felt betrayed because I was letting him stay with me, and from what he just said, to me, sounded like our friendship meant nothing to him. Considering this was the guy that was crashing at my house, my hospitality felt undeserved and kind of silly for me to continue at this point. \n\nI told him \"If that's how you feel, I don't want you staying at my apartment.\" He asks if I'm serious, which I say yes and I storm of to join my group. Dennis, who was just behind us, is very confused and catches up to us. Since I storm off, Jim is left to explain his side of the story to Dennis. \n\nI end up catching up to the rest of my friends, but at this point I'm so upset and the night is winding down anyway, so I decide to head home. Later that night around 2am or 3am, I'm back at my place in my room when I hear my roommate and Jim get back in. They're hanging in the living room when I come in and tell him I meant what I said and don't want him staying here. He throws out an \"are you serious\" but he knows I am. Things are getting very tense at this point. We're both drunk and angry. I tell him if he meant what he said, he's not welcome here. He says he meant what he said.\n\nMy roommate is extremely confused and has no idea what was going on. I get more aggressive and actually push him toward the door. For context, I'm a pretty shrimpy dude and Jim is tall and built. My roommate tries to calm us, but it's off the handle at this point. Jim is pissed and is like \"fine I'll leave but if I do, we're done\" and I tell him to go. He packs his things, says he'll get the rest tomorrow, and leaves. \n\nMy roommate tries to make sense of things but pass it off as a drunken fight between friends. I knew at the time I would never see Jim the same way again. I didn't want him in my life or to be using my friends who deserve much better ever again. I explained what Jim said and told him it was the last straw for me, if they wanted to continue to be friends that's cool with me, I was just not going to hang with him anymore.\n\nThen came the fallout. My roommate tried to reach out to Jim many times, but got no response, eventually he soured on Jim when he finally left our group chat with no warning. Jim distanced himself from the group and it became clear that no one in the group was ever really close with him. When I explained what happened between us, people were a little upset but not really surprised. I never wanted what happened with us to effect other people's relationships or bad mouth the guy, but it seemed like Jim didn't want to be a part of the group anymore. Dennis later told me I over reacted and that kicking him out was extreme. Jim ended up staying at Dennis's place that night. \n\nIn retrospect it did feel unfair to kick someone out on the street in the middle of the night. It was a purely emotional decision and not logical at all, but I'm not sure if I ever would have brought it up again if I hadn't addressed it that night... \n\nI tried reaching out to him months later and we both apologized to each other, but there was never a follow through to hang out again. He still lives in our city, but does not speak with any of the group, myself included. I haven't seen him since that night.\n\nSo, was I the asshole? ",

I ask my brother what's going on with the car and he tells me, \"Oh, it's SIL's cousin's car.\" I ask him where they're going to be staying and he tells me he doesn't know. \n\nThat weekend I end up going over to SIL's aunt and uncles house. I'm good friends with them and even DJ'd at their wedding. I show up and SIL's cousin and boyfriend are there. I've met him once before so I'm just shooting the shit with him and ask where he's staying. He says, I'm staying at SIL's house. I respond, \"You're staying at my house? We're roommates now?\"\n\nNow to put this in perspective, me SIL and my brother were all on the lease. I paid about 45% of our rent. SIL was just doing the stay at home mom thing and my brother paid all their expenses. I took the basement and had a living room and two bedrooms. They had the upstairs, front room, two bedrooms and the kitchen. \n\nI pull my brother aside and ask him what's up. He says that SIL's cousin's were going to be staying through the end of the lease (3mo) and they were going to be paying them $400 a month to stay. I think it's bullshit but agree for them to stay as long as I get $100 of my rent each month. My brother agrees. \n\nSIL freaks out, causes a scene, and ends up leaving the party. I go back home and try to talk things out. SIL tries to turn it back around on me that I am being selfish for not helping her family out and I shouldn't be asking for any money. I explain, no I am not living with her cousins for free and it's breaking our lease even letting them stay. \n\nWe go back and forth like this for like half an hour. SIL is emotional and punches a whole through the kitchen wall. My brothers says, \"This is happening. Get over it.\"  \n\nI lose my shit, slap the drink out of his hand sending it shattering against the wall. I go to throttle him, but instead opt to punch my own hole in the wall and proceed to start packing up my shit. \n\nThe next day I wake up hungover, patch the hole I made in the wall and tell my brother I'm moving out, that the four of them will cover rent. I let them know they can keep my deposit and as long as they don't dip out on the lease I'll give him $300  after they pay the last months rent. \n\nThe next couple weeks were tense. SIL and her cousins refuse to talk to me. I even offered to give them some furniture cuz I was moving my stuff to storage and all I got were dead stares. \n\nSo I move back to my dad's have just been chilling since then. SIL hasn't talked to me since that night. I run into my brother every once in a while at SIL's aunt and uncle's house but as soon as SIL sees me they're gone.  I'm not allowed to see my niece. \n\nAfter the lease ended my brother couldn't get into another place and ended up back at his mom's with his family. The cousins found their own place. \n\nSIL has declared that I am the devil, has completely ostracized my brother and I and has done her damnedest to ostracize me from out mutual friend group. The friends have stuck around but it's like I just went through a divorce. If there's an event I'm told when they will be there or vice versa. \n\nAm I the asshole? Should I have just grinned and bared it for those three months? \n\nTLDR; SIL attempted to force two new roommates on me, I freaked out, moved out, became ostracized and am now the devil in her eyes.",

      "description": "I (21M) go to a small college where attractive girls are hard to come by, and I'm in my third year now without having kissed a girl since high school.\n\nSo a few weeks ago I met a girl (20F) briefly, and she asked for my snapchat. The next night my fraternity had a party and she drank a little more than she could handle, which led to me briefly taking care of her, whilst she puked and asked if I wanted to go back to her room (I did not). The next morning she messaged me, thanking me for helping her out and insisting that she take me out sometime, an offer I turned down multiple times the next week. She finally surprised me by baking cookies for me to repay me, and I invited her to hang out that night. I had fun talking to her and felt that she's someone I can have deep conversations with, but I feel that our morals lie in different places.\n\nA little about me, I like to be in a relationship. I don't know what it is, but I feel uncomfortable with the idea of a one night stand. But, I suffer chronic depression and have decided that until I'm feeling a lot better about life and myself, I'm not going to get into a relationship.\n\nA little about her, a mutual friend (20F) close to both of us warned me about liking her, explaining that she leads guys on fairly often for her own validity and doesn't understand what she's doing. And I see where she's coming from. She certainly has a reputation for doing that, which makes me uncomfortable. Even if I ignore what other people think, she doesn't seem reliable (stood me up once when we were gonna hang out), nor would she bring much stability to my life. All that being said, I do think she's cute, funny and smart.\n\nAs a result of my insecurities and her reputation to lead guys on, I don't know whether she genuinely likes me or whether she's just playing games with me. And I'm probably acting the same way with her, because I'm just trying not to get hurt.\n\nI know I don't want to be in a relationship, nor do I want a hookup. It's been too long since I've been with a girl for me to turn down a girl I'm attracted to, and I feel that I'd regret not doing anything. Friends with benefits seems like a happy middle ground. Would I be the asshole if I tell her this?\n\nWhat if she doesn't think about me in that way at all and is just being nice? Anyone have any ideas on how I could find out? ",

We’ve now been in the same apartment for a few months, and I’ve noticed he does not clean up his hair. I find long loose hairs throughout the apartment, but as you could imagine, The bathroom is the real ground zero. \n\nThere is seemingly a constant supply of longhair is in the sink and in the tub. He will clean them when he does A general clean up of the bathroom, but he would never do A “maintenance clean” in between these general cleans. \n\nAfter thinking about it for a few weeks, I finally ask him if “He would be willing to get a handle on his hair in the apartment, but really what’s annoying me is the bathroom.” He reacted very poorly to this.

      "description": "Background: 2 years ago, my wife forced me into one of those cheesy cardio boxing classes, because I was weightlifting exclusively. Long story short, I fell in love and my wife and I turned it into something we do together.  I ended up loving it SO MUCH SO, I hired a trainer to truly teach me the sport technically. Not just for cardio, but to actually box amateurs. \n\nNow, I told my friends who relentlessly made fun of me, called me out for talking about it. I admit, maybe I got too passionate- but I’d never been athletic so when I realized I actually had a knack for something, I couldn’t hold in the word vomit. Eventually the luster wore off, and I continued the sport on my own, even after openly inviting them to join me in sessions to learn etc- they all refused basically mocking me along the way. \n\nFast forward: 2 years later, I’m quite good. I’ve trained for team USA(not seriously or competitively but I have trained with them and have a team USA license), and know what I am doing. I’m not even 50% of where  I wanna be, but I’m on the track. I’m not young(for he sport), I’m 30 but it became a personal challenge to be good and I’m achieving it. \n\nNow suddenly my friend who NEVER showed an interest, went to my trainer and picked up the sport. He didn’t tell me, I found out through my mom of all people, and my trainer of course. Now I confronted him because I felt it was shady and childish that he couldn’t admit that maybe, just maybe I inspired him and it’s a fun thing to do. But, instead I just feel hurt and almost resentful that something I worked hard to be good at and was mocked for- is suddenly cool. He asked me to come work out with him, and I flat out said I’m not interested and now training elsewhere. I have no ill will towards him as a friend but I have absolutely zero interest in training together or ever discussing it again. \n\nSo AITA for basically saying I’m no longer interested in sharing that portion of my life with anyone and refusing to train?

      "description": "So I feel like this is gonna take a little bit of backstory. We have a friend, Billy. He’s a cool guy but the whole friend group (late 20s to early 30s) has one big problem, Billy’s mouth. If Billy doesn’t like something you like he will go off on a tangent about how terrible it is. Never the you shouldn’t like this because I don’t like it, but your gonna get a earful. Basically everyone needs to hear his opinion whether it’s need or wanted. He does this when we’re casually hanging out. He’s done this in public before. He’s done this in public to strangers before. I’ll give a few examples.\n\nExample 1 - Billy, couple friends and myself go to a gaming expo. I’m having a smoke with a friend I met up with at the expo. We’re talking about some of the cosplays we saw walking around, I mention seeing one from a favorite anime of friends. Billy starts saying the anime is garbage, it’s a waste of anyone who watches it’s time, ect. If we try to interject or move the subject along, Billy just starts up again. After he's finished I just told my friend bye and spent the next hour texting him apologies for my idiot friend.\n\nExample 2 - Billy, male friend and me in a bookstore. I’m looking at manga, asking male friend a question. There’s another girl in the same aisle with a stack of a manga in her hand. Billy sees the series this stranger is holding and states that the manga is made for pedophiles. I try to move the conversation away from but he’s started and he’s gonna finish this rant. Friend and I just stand there silently embarrassed as this poor girl just puts her stack down and walks away at a speed not far from running.\n\nExample 3 - This is the recent one and the reason we've been planning this again. We decided to host a board game night. Billy spends the first hour of the night antagonizing my brother in law until him and my sister just go to their room until Billy leaves. BIL would just be talking to the group and Billy would pick the one thing he didn’t like to go off about. It was uncomfortable and awkward for the whole group.\n\nThese are just the top three. Friends and I have talked repeatedly about staging what we’ve called the assole intervention. At this point I don’t want to invite to anything and most everyone agrees. We’ve cancelled outings with him because we don’t want to be embarrassed. I love this guy like a brother, he’s a fun guy but this is getting ridiculous.\n\nI’m not planning on Billy coming over and springing a bunch of people with hand written notes on him as he walks thru the door. We were thinking of just two of us sitting Billy down and talking to him about this.\n\nWould I be the asshole? Honest recommendations on what to do would be great.",

And have a mental breakdown?”\n\nI lashed out and told him I didn’t need to think about my mother dying because what the actual fuck. And then he insisted that *I* was making his problems about myself because I told him to not do that shit. I basically ended up calling him a freak and that he’s not normal for doing that, and while I’m far from normal I try to be it at least. Then he answered with something along the lines of *“so what? You’ll decide to be neurotypical?”* (I’m autistic, it actually really hurt me to hear that). At the end of the argument I told him he had two choices - kill himself so he doesn’t have to watch his mom die, or don’t so he does have to watch her die. This isn’t the first time he started shit because this happened on Discord where he told me to shut the fuck up over memes and told me he stabbed a man (not to death) because he thought he said stuff he heard over and over again. He has even been emotionally abusive to me by making me feel like I said something offensive and overreacting to it so I’d feel bad. I’m genuinely heartbroken, and I hate that as a man it’s experiences like this that make me think men are fucking trash.\n\nTl;dr - idk how to summarize this please just read the whole thing",

      "description": "Some background, I live and work as a bartender in Korea but I am originally from the states. We have a frequent customer at the bar called J. He owns an English teaching business in the area.\n\nI really don't like J. \n\nFirst, during every shift I work he calls me over and asks me if I want a job with him. While I'm at my job. I find it super disrespectful and it's really annoying since I've told him no so many times.\n\nSecond, he uses our bar as a hunting ground for new staff. He knows we have a lot of foreign customers and so (he has told me) he comes to our bar in particular to try and find staff. \n\nThird, he pulls in people claiming they can get $40/hour \"tutoring\" English in private sessions. In reality he has most of them teach groups of 5-7 beginners with no curriculum for only $10/hour. He schedules privates for tutors but will cancel the lessons with no notice. He also has a policy that during the first month they will only get 30% of the pay for privates. (Multiple friends of mine have fallen for this and told me.)\n\nThis is where the assholery comes in. \n\nWhenever J comes in I will try and be the one to serve him so I can hang around his table. This means I can essentially \"job-block\" him. Whenever he lures in a young, unassuming foreigner (usually American, female, exchange student) with the \"$40 and hour\" spiel I will either wait until he goes to the bathroom or the foreigner goes outside for a smoke and try to warn the person of the reality of the job. Since these people usually can't find jobs over here a lot of them fall for it. \n\nI just tell them that they'll only be getting group lessons for $10/hour and to be cautious, ask for everything in writing, etc. I know that this has made a lot of people not take the job and stay away from him. I have heard him complaining recently that he's really low on staff and profit is lower and I know it's probably because of me. \n\nSo, AITA for warning people off of his scammy \"job\" and hurting his business?",

There was one role I really wanted. We'll call this role S. S was a main role. She was smart and funny. One of my friends (A) wanted to smaller roles, F and T. It turns out that I got F and T, and she got S. She was mad, and originally I was to. We talked about asking to switch roles. The day we agreed to, she went home early, so I was alone. I don't like confrontation, so I got really nervous. One of my friends helped me out, and I asked the director. He said he would think about it. I played as S, F, and T throughout the entire rehearsal. I became much more comfortable with the roles, and embraced them.  I don't know how A feels still. I'm worried that she'll bother the director enough to get our roles switched. She is a better actor than I am, and I think she'll do better as this role. She also looks the part much better than I do. She can get kind of angry sometimes. I worry she'll still want F and T. I like my roles, and don't want to switch. I'm willing to fight for this. AITA for changing my mind, and not caring what my friend thinks?",

      "description": "I know that sounds so bad, but let me explain!!\nPlease keep in mind that through out this story I’m 19 at the time and she in her 30s. \nWhile I was working at my old job, I met a woman who immediately took a liking to me. Obviously I was extremely nice because that’s what’s expected of me and she took that as me wanting to become friends. She eventually memorized my work schedule and would come in to see me and monopolize my time for hours. She would just talk to me and ask me questions and I had to stay because I didn’t want to be mean and I was generally not busy. She started asking for my contact info and I turned her down several times but she ended up wearing me down so I agreed to give her my number and that we would meet for coffee. I understand that was my first mistake. I should not have given in and sent the wrong message. \nNow, I don’t have a problem with autistic people and actually enjoyed some of our conversations. I understand that for her everything is black and white. There are rules that you have to follow and no gray area. The problem was that we had absolutely nothing in common and we could never have a good casual conversation because she would condemn a lot of things I did like drink or befriend people who smoked. I started to hide a lot of aspects of my life because I didn’t want a lecture. I never told her I dropped out of school or that I was gay or that I didn’t have a religion.  It became a chore to answer her phone calls (she would call all the time just to talk) and I never wanted to go out because I never had fun. \nNow for the current predicament!! \nI recently just got out of a very toxic abusive relationship and was dealing with a lot. This woman would still call me and ask way too many questions about why I couldn’t talk or hang out. I just told her I was busy. I didn’t want to tell her about my life because #1 that’s private and #2 I wasn’t exactly in a mental place where I could explain what was happening in my life to a stranger. \nPush came to shove and I decided to move to a new province and try to restart my life and I told her that. She was very very upset and told me I was running away from my problems and being selfish towards everyone I was leaving in my home city. That really hurt because this was the first thing I had done for myself since I got into my horrible relationship.  \nI left but she still messaged me everyday asking how I am and when I’m coming home. Right now I’m just ignoring her and trying to live my life. \nWould I be the asshole if I just ghosted and blamed it on the drama of moving and starting a new life? \n\nI’m also looking for advice on what to do because I know ghosting isn’t the nicest but neither is saying I just don’t like you. \n\nTLDR: I met a women with autism while at work (I’m F19 and she’s F30) and she forced me into a friendship. We don’t have anything in common and it’s a very one sided friendship. Now I’ve just gotten out of an abusive relationship and I want to move on with my life. Should I ghost? ",

      "description": "Ok so a few months ago i met this Girl online and we started texting and, after a while, hang out a couple times. now at first i was interested in her because i liked her character and the way she thinks but after we met that Feeling vanished because i didnt like how she looked. By that i mean that i have a few very specific Things that just make me instantly loose all interrest in someone (for example excessively hairy arms) and most of them are based on Looks.   \nNow the Problem was that she developed interrest in me, and we even had a Little bit of a fling afterwards, but we talked About a relationship and came to the conclusion that we dont want that from another. but then she started to become more and more attached to me (the typical Friends with Benefits Thing where one starts to like the other more than they should) so i talked about it with her, but she refused. The Thing is that everyone we met (my parents, Friends etc.) and I could see that she is defenitely more attached to me than i am to her, so i tried to break this whole Thing up by telling her that i dont like her in any romantical way. after 5 or so tries that she just wouldnt accept i quit beeing gentle and told her that i dont find her attractive (yes i now im an ass for starting something with her in the first place but thats not my Point) which again took me 3 times of explaining to her why and what exactly i dont like About her until she finally got it. \n\nBut now i feel bad because she is a genuinely nice Person that i dont want to date just because i dont like her Looks, so am i an asshole for thinking that Looks are equally important as character for Dating?",

Today we were reading a passage from a story, and taking it in turns to read. The main character was called Mi Nuong, and neither of us knew how to pronounce it. Every time Emily tried to read it, she would laugh. Then she asked if she could just call her Mi instead (pronounced me). This made her laugh even more, because it sounded like she was saying things like “Me looked at..” or “Me liked...”. I just smiled back, because she I don’t think she was laughing maliciously; she just found it funny that she couldn’t pronounce it, and then because it sounded grammatically incorrect. I’m just a bit worried that I should have said something to her about not laughing at people’s names sounding different, in case I accidentally teach her that it’s okay to do that?\n\nAgain, I know it’s not a big deal - just wondering if I should have said anything. If it’s important, I’m white, and Emily is half Malaysian and has a Western name.\n\nTl;dr - child I was teaching was laughing because she couldn’t pronounce an Asian name, I just smiled in response but was wondering if I should have said something about being respectful of other people’s names.",

I was isolated and essentially she tried to sabotage any relationship I had with anyone else. I broke our friendship off recently because I realized I never felt good about myself after hanging out with her because she always said some hurtful jabs at things she knows I’m insecure about. If you care to learn more about it I have many posts on my page about the situation on a narcissistic abuse sub.\n\n\nAnyway, today she messages me that she’s thankful for the time she got to share with me and all our memories.

I said it made me feel like she would rather talk to her co-worker than hang with our friends and me. She admitted she fucked up and needs to set up better boundaries. Promised me it would change and all that. I trust her, and I think she will stay true to her word, but I also don't think she's ready to get married if she has a problem with boundaries. So I was thinking I would buy myself something nice instead and save up for the ring throughout the year. Would that be wrong?",

      "description": "So for some context, I am in high school and my sister was a senior last year. She made a club in school called the fitness club. I was forced to join (parents btw) and I was the only male there. \n\nLittle did I know that there was another fitness club for males.\n\nYearbook pictures came in and there are two pages for fitness club, the male one, and my sister’s one. Like I said before, I was the only male there...\n\nI assume you all know the assumptions that could have been brought up.\n\nFast forward to this year, where there just so happens to be a transgender male in my lunch. He walks up to me and starts to introduce himself. I personally have nothing wrong with LGBT people, so I played it cool. He then starts to flirt with me two months later. I’m incredibly weirded out and try to distance myself from him.\n\nHe doesn’t leave me alone and keeps following me. I’m a nice person so I won’t bluntly say for him to leave me alone.\n\nI was going to lunch and he asks me to go with him to the front of the gymnasium. He then asks me out and I plainly tell him that it is a giant misunderstanding, and that I am not transgender and not interested.\n\nHe won’t leave me alone. He then proceeds to touch my arms and hands and then I lose it. I go crazy and yell so loud that the entire hallway (and principal) heard it.\n\nI strongly tell him I am not transgender, will never be transgender, and If he doesn’t leave me alone then I will call the cops for harassment.\n\nHe then rants about being transgender and being discriminated and how people mistreat him. He cries and then makes a huge deal about it. \n\nI just don’t get it. Just because he is trans means I have to be nice and date him?\n\nAITA?",

Finally after a few plans to hang out fell threw she texted me ‘why don’t you just come over’ I was cautious but also excited so I decided screw it and went over to her house.\nShe turned out not to be an axe murderer and we had pretty great sex actually. After that she starts texting me pretty frequently even though we made it clear it was just sexual. \nWe made plans to hang out a few nights later, but right before she was going to come over she told me she was spotting and asked if that grossed me out and wanted to abort the plan to hang out. I told her that I have had sex with girls near and on their period, but it was with a serious girlfriend and honestly wasn’t sure I was ok with doing that with a relative stranger.\nShe was cool about it and thanked me for being honest so we rainchecked for a few days later.\n5 days later she came over and we immediately started having sex. About half way through I could see blood on my hands and her body and I immediately stopped. I got up and went to the bathroom to wash off. She responded by saying ‘it’s only blood, it’s not gonna kill you’ and sat on my sheets seemingly amused as I kinda freaked out, taking a shower and washing off clearly flustered.\nWhen I got back to my room I asked her if she could clean her self up and get off my bed. I was very much annoyed, turned off, and grossed out. She asked if she should leave and I said yes. I knew it was kind of adswhole thing to do but I wasn’t about to watch a movie or hang out with her.. that’s not really what we were there for in the first place. And I felt kind of betrayed and disrespected by her coming over for sex while she was on or effected by her time of the month.\nI obviously feel bad, I’m sure it was an awkward situation for her. But I don’t regret it. And I feel like she is the asswhole too. Maybe I’m wrong, you tell me, I’m curious.",

      "description": "So my new nanny for my 3yo and 1yo has a lot of positive traits and has seemed really good in almost all ways. However I have felt that she has not bonded with my 3 year old and frankly seems to think he is a bit of an asshole. I have explained many times that he is struggling with starting kindergarten, potty training (which he really really resisted) and the loss of his old nanny who left suddenly due to illness. I have told her he will get better and he is acting up because he's not coping, we have been through it before with him and he will come good. But she recently suggested he wasn't socialised enough and has stayed silent when I have said things by text like 'don't leave me! He will come good! I am sorry he wet his pants 4 times today, eek! 😁' etc.\n\nSo on a hunch I logged into the nanny website where I found her and saw that her profile was updated and she had logged in the day before. Hoping it was just one of those things, I have checked each day and seen that she is logging in most days. I think it's fair to assume she must be looking for another job.  She already has a second job and would have no time for a third so I feel like it's pretty likely she is looking to replace us. \n\nI have started looking for a new nanny. I haven't decided what to do if I find one but I am so worried that she will just quit. I have started a new business and the next couple of months are really crucial, I just need reliable childcare. \n\nI know I should talk to her but I am worried that once she admits she's not happy, she will just quit. I want to be ready if that happens. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\n\n",

      "description": " Me and my spouse have been living together for six years and both have worked/ been in school full time up until September when she got a job as a supply teacher. Being a supply teacher means her work is not always consistent, if she doesn’t get a call that day she doesn’t work. Last week for instance she only worked one shift and the week before she worked three. I work full time, 40-50 hours a week as well as about 2-5 hours of work at home. \n\nWe have always split household chores 50/50. It only seemed fair considering we both worked an equal amount. I thought it would make sense that since I’m working sometimes 35 hours more a  week than her that she would do more around the house, however, she is still expecting us to split 50/50. \n\nI have come home from work multiple times since September to the house being a mess (no vacuuming done, laundry to do/ fold, garbage not taken out, dinner not started etc.). She told me that she was waiting for me to get home so we could tag team things, even though she spent all day binge watching a show on Netflix. I didn’t complain and helped her out doing half the work. \n\nI finally sat her down last week and asked her if she could do more around the house considering I am putting more hours in at work and she is home far more than me. She got really emotional and said I was accusing her of being lazy and not contributing enough. Since this conversation, not much had changed. So I snapped last night. \n\nI get home from work late after a hellish day. She had a friend over all day and they were baking and hanging out. She says to me when I get in “I already hand washed three rounds of dishes so I have met my quota for the next few days”. I got really mad and told her that I shouldn’t have to clean the dishes nor should I have to do nearly as much as I have been doing around the house. I work way more than her and the least she could do is tidy up and keep our home from looking like a shit hole. I don’t think that’s too much to ask! We have kept to ourselves all day today and she is clearly furious with me. And tbh I’m not pleased with her either. This has nothing to do with gender, as we are both female, it simply comes down to me currently working more than her. \n\nSo, AITA? ",

The problem is that I find it really boring after about 30min to an hour(he usually plays for 3-4 hours). When I do happen to come watch him(which isn't often admittedly) I will sit there alone and probably on an uncomfortable barstool. After about an hour I will either leave or go sit in the car to relax and mess with my phone. \n\nI love him and support him but I can't help but feel like it's just not my cup of tea.

As my dogs went off, I was awoken with a surge of adrenaline. After realizing what I had happened, I was furious. I had effectively taken a power nap and was no longer tired. I texted my fiance and told her I'd get even. I texted her sister and went off on her for her lack of respect. I contemplated hooking up an alarm to my bluetooth speaker outside her sister's door but elected not to because of the collateral damage.\n\nTo be clear, I know my reaction to that situation makes me an asshole, but I'm wondering about the situation as a whole.\n\nThe next day, my fiance justified her sister's behavior with \"Well she gets off at work at 9:40pm and still had to go to the gym\". I pleaded my case and how that had no weight with me. She could have left the gym 15 mins early. For the next four days, my fiance and I didn't talk. On the fourth day she came to me and asked why I was upset and ignoring her. I was neither of these things. I felt defeated. I felt like i had been tricked from the start to buying this big ass house under the ruse that I could live comfortably. After talking it out, we ended on a good note. My fiance kind-of supported me but said that if her sister would be coming home late, she would accomadate. I did not like this at all. On day one everyone was good with it but now that it's not convenient to follow the rule, they don't. I shouldn't have to negotiate with a tenant in my home so I can get sleep. I go to sleep at 12am. That is more than fair and reasonable. I did not \"win\" this argument.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, my fiance came home last night at 12:18 from the gym and woke me up. The night was uneventful but the next morning I kept leaving the bedroom light on while I got ready just to be petty. I wanted her to feel what it felt like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I didn't handle either circumstances well but as a whole, I need some perspective. I'm open to advice, or being told flat-out, I'm the asshole.",

I know the Convention and her friends are important to her, but like it's my sisters wedding which is very important to me as well.

I'm extremely analytical and have often been told that I have traits resembling that of Asperger's, though I'm not on the spectrum.\n\nTwo weeks ago, my girlfriend (18) and I (17) went out to a night market with some friends.\nMy girlfriend has only recently started a job now that school has finished (We both finished our final year at the start of November) and hadn't yet been paid, instead having money from her part-time babysitting job.\nHer money was all in cash, however, the market was card-only, so she found herself unable to purchase anything. Instead, she asked if I would pay for her, and she'd pay me back. Of course, I obliged, and I spent exactly $25.50 on her that night.\nI don't work too much, as my job is part-time and I'm moving cities next year so there's no point upgrading to full-time, so it was a decent amount of money but not too much, certainly not enough for me to actually make a big deal over.\n\nThe problem was when the next week, she said to me, \"Don't I owe you like twenty bucks or something?\"\nMy immediate unfiltered reaction was to say, \"Actually, $25.50,\" which I didn't realise would be a problem until about five seconds later, when she suddenly got very upset that 'I valued the money over her.'\nAgain, I've always been very precise with numbers, and she's extremely aware of both this and my tendency to say exactly what's on my mind, but she still seemed extremely upset that I had bothered to remember the exact amount of money.\n\nI later told her to just pay me back $20, which she had no problem with, but it's still stuck with me.\nI have no problems with her - I love her, she's great - but I'm still wondering if I was really being the asshole there, as I often do quite rude or mean things without being aware of it.",

Both parents have work from home desk jobs. I work from 4 am - 1 pm stocking shelves. \n\nMy parents go out to a nice restuarant with their friends every Thursday. So it usually falls to me to make some kind of food for my siblings. Yesterday I made some frozen pierogies in a pan and went to sleep shortly after because I worked at 4 am the next morning aka today. \n\nWhen I got up, the pan was gone, so I assumed someone had taken care of it and I was like \"Oh that was nice\" and went to work. I came home from work and got my car Echecked but other than that I did nothing for hours. No one said anything to me. \n\nMy mother decided she wanted to cook dinner but also just had to go get her passport started so she didnt get back to start dinner till 5pm, we were out of catfood so I took my boyfriend and we went to the store. By the time we got back only the main course had been finished because apparently my mother was outraged I never cleaned the pan and she needed it for dinner. \n\nI told her we were back and was greeted with \"Thats cool, I dont care. I'm done making dinner I did the main dish. I'm just done\" I asked why she was upset and kept trying to figure out what was up and she refused to do anything but scroll on her phone. I said whatever and made the rest of dinner so my siblings and father would have food. \n\nMy father came downstairs to check on food and finay told me that it was my fault for not cleaning out the pan she obviously needed.\n\nI tried to tell him I fell asleep before they were done eating and got \"Im not having this conversation with you, you knew what you needed to do\"\n\nSo I told him to finish dinner himself and went downstairs. Now Im starving and Im just going to go to sleep since Im such screw up. This is the last time I cook anything for anyone in this house. Guess theyll go back to surviving on frozen chicken patties.",

      "description": "     My girlfriend moved recently. Only three hours away, so it isn't as horrible as it could be, but we're both still in school. I don't have my license yet and I'm the older of us. We wanted to sit together on the bus because this was the last time we would see each other before she moved.\n     The bus only allowed two people per seat, and there weren't any empty ones. We asked a boy if he could move in the politest manner possible, which is odd for my rather abrasive girlfriend, and he seemed hesitant but willing, when suddenly this girl comes out of no where.\n      She tells us that we have no right to ask him to move, and my girlfriend argues back. The other girl's friend jumped in to defend her, and by that point I was thoroughly embarrassed at the scene we were making, but sure we hadn't done anything wrong, so I backed my girlfriend up.\n     By now we were holding up the line and another girl who I'd known for a few years offered to move. I felt sort of bad because I knew it was only so we'd stop arguing, but I still accepted. Until, that is, the other girl ordered her to sit down because \"no one should move for us\". Eventually the bus driver told us to sit down in seperate seats for the fact that we were holding the line up.\n     I don't know if it was because she had a grudge against my girlfriend (who she always seemed a bit rude to, and for good reason seeing as my girlfriend isn't toi nice), if it was a race thing (the boy we asked to move was asian, the girl who offered to move was indian, and the girls who yelled at us were black, so maybe they thought we were racist or something?) Or if we were actually the assholes here.",

My wife loves to dance and I hate dancing (important). \n\nAlso the party is for staff only, no spouses/partners permitted.\n\nThe staff party went well, I'd been hanging out with a few colleagues who know not to ask me to dance. I've had a few drinks, but am still comparitively sober and am thinking it'll soon be time to head home. I head to the drinks bar nearest the exit for one last glass before leaving. \n\nWhile I'm there, an intern (roughly half my 44 years of age) approaches me with someone quite high up in the HR team and asks me to dance. I politely decline. She asks again, taking, I guess, my refusal for shyness (I am quite shy, but not especially introverted). I again refuse, stating that I don't even dance with my own wife, I'm not going to dance with her. She asks yet again. I very abruptly tell her to stop bothering me as it's just not going to happen. She leaves, her and the HR lady staring daggers at me.\n\nFast forward to January. I have to spend a lot of time on the intern's floor and each day I'm there she's giving me death eyes. I speak to her alone and apologise for upsetting or offending her as it wasn't my intention. She says it's fine.\n\nFebruary and March, still coldness and death eyes. I ask if we're okay. She doesn't want to talk to me because I was rude and hurt her feelings. So I've not made any more attempts to smooth things over and just put up with constant looks of contempt.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "I’m in a computer science course and my professor has given us a massive month-long assignment that requires us to work in teams of four. Here’s the problem though. After he puts us in groups via random selection, he then goes through every group and manually chooses one student from each group he calls the “team captain”. He does not give us any sort of criteria for selecting this student. He then explains that this students job is to write down the “extremely specific” percentage of work each member of the team has done and turn it in with the assignment. This person is also supposed to take notes during meetings,  give out assignments, and write down if another member shows up late. He says at the end of the assignment each team member must sign that they’ve seen the percentages and if there’s a problem come to him and he’ll look at the notes the team captain took each meeting.  I feel this is completely unfair on two levels. One is that this setup is designed to make students compete and fight with each other to do more work and look good instead of actually working together, and students with more introverted personalities that don’t like to speak up for themselves will inevitably get shafted out of this. Second, I feel it is unfair both to the team captain for being given extra responsibility and a target of hatred from their teammates for an unknown reason and to the teammates themselves for another random(?) student essentially having so much control over their grades. I feel like this violates some kind of rule, but I’m not sure what specific one. The website says that in order to file a complaint I must speak with the professor first. I am fairly sure that even if I were to go to him with my concerns, he would simply defend his actions on how it’s actually fair. But perhaps my worst fear is obviously, this professor now knows exactly who I am and will never look at me the same again. I understand that filing a complaint is a serious thing for a professor and would not want to falsely inflict damage upon him if there’s no rule against what he’s doing. and I’m not even sure if he’s violating any rules in the first place. Would it be wrong of me to attempt to go behind his back and speak to a department chair? ",

      "description": "(Using a throwaway, hope that doesn't violate the rules of the sub)  \n\n\nBackground: my partner and I moved to a new rented apartment about 8 months ago. When we agreed to take the place, the landlord committed to fixing a number of defects with the property (leaking pipes, dodgy electrics, cracked tiles, mould, old fittings). However, since we moved in, he's been a ghost. We made efforts to work with him on these issues, getting quotes from multiple contractors, offering to foot the bill for more cosmetic fixes if he would step up and deal with the critical quality of life issues.  \n\n\nEventually, we lost patience and decided to move out. However, since we're breaking the lease early, the landlord has told us that we are still responsible for paying rent until a new tenant is found to replace us (this sucks, but as far as we can tell, the law is on his side). Now we've advertised the flat again, and have been showing it to new prospective tenants.  \n\n\nThe problem is that my partner thinks that we should be honest with them about our poor relationship with the landlord, whereas I think that by doing that all we would do is screw ourselves over by scaring off people who would take over the lease and get us out of this situation. Caveat emptor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being an asshole?",

These 2 friends have also recently started dating within the last year, which has caused the guy friend, who I have known longer, to become slightly more distant over time. That's understandable to me, as I can understand why he'd prefer to spend more time with his gf.\n\nWith the last couple weeks, we had made plans to play DnD. These plans were set for last night starting at 9:30 PM since that's when I got off work. Everything was falling into place since we actually had the time to finally host a session. \n\nHowever, at the last minute, and I mean within a couple hours of me getting off, they texted me saying that it wasn't going to work out, as the guy was too tired to wanna stay up. Fine, like I said I'm very understanding of them and what they wanna do, as long as their honest with me about why they don't want me with them. I'd prefer not to be led on if that makes sense.\n\nSo this morning after waking up, I saw that the girl had posted on her story on Instagram that they were playing DnD, and also with somebody else in place of me. I got pretty upset, and decided to unfollow them and just not talk to either of them throughout today. I just recently sent a text saying that I would like a break from hanging with them for a while, but as I was typing it up, I wasn't quite sure if I overreacted or not.\n\nI plan on letting them know why I feel this way, I just want to know AITA for wanting to cut them out of my life for a while to reevaluate our friendship.",

      "description": "This happened a bit ago, and I just got on reddit, but I still wanted to see what’s up. So some context for this. I’m a high school student who goes to an art school, I’m involved in the music program. I’m in jazz band, chamber choir, and a few other top tier classes, so I have responsibilities to keep up with so I can stay in those classes. My school was doing Chicago the musical, and our jazz band was providing the music for it. The problem with this is that for the 3 weeks leading up to it, rehearsals were mandatory, with the threat of getting kicked out the production and possibly jazz band. Because of this, I needed to work as much as I can in order to save money to pay my car insurance and car payment. On winter break I worked everyday that I could, expect for Christmas and Sunday’s (I work at Chick-fil-A so those were the only days that we were closed) and I would work long hours. I even worked on my birthday. I talked to my girlfriend (now ex) about that and she understood that I needed to work to save money. The problem is that when her birthday came around, I was scheduled to work 1- close. A few days prior, my bathroom flooded cuz one of the pipes exploded, so we had to take out everything and build a new bathroom. The morning of her birthday, I was up since 8 to help us fix it, and I didn’t stop working until 12 so I can shower and go to work. That morning I said happy birthday, and told her that I was gonna be busy cuz of the bathroom situation. She asked what time I got off at work and I said I closed. She got mad at that, saying that it was her birthday and that she wanted to see me. Her and I talked about my working situation a lot, and I told her that if she wants to do something, I need to know ahead of time so I can make arrangements for it to happen, but if it’s last minute and work is in the way, then I have to chose work. I told her “I’m sorry but there’s nothing I can do about it” and she said “well if you really wanted to you can”. That’s when I got mad, because there’s literally nothing I could’ve done to change when I got scheduled, but even if I could I needed those hours. I told her “you didn’t make plans with me, so it’s not like we were gonna do anything anyways” (not the best thing to say but yeah) then she got hella mad and started calling me selfish and that I didn’t love her and that I should’ve made an effort to drop things because it was her birthday. After we finished closing, I drove to her house so I can see her and I apologized about it, but she was still mad at me\n\nTLDR: I had to work a lot because I needed more y to pay for my bills when I was going to have 3 weeks of no working do to school. I worked on my (ex) girlfriends birthday, and she got mad that I didn’t see her \nAITA??",

      "description": "My friend, K, has been living with me (and paying rent, though his name is not on the lease) for the last 2 months. The whole situation is shitty because he was originally supposed to stay for 1 month and still shows no signs of leaving anytime soon, but that's a whole other ordeal. Just know that tensions between us are high.\n\nK loves my cats, and even feeds them for me sometimes without me asking him to. I'm always grateful and thank him whenever I notice him doing it. But they can be little shits, and one of their favorite troublemaking hobbies is gallivanting through the halls of my apartment building, which, as indicated by my lease, they're not supposed to do. But sometimes they're too quick and squeeze by me before I can stop them. I don't mind it much though and I almost always catch them before they get too far down the hallway.\n\nNow, I just started a new job yesterday morning. I haven't been feeling well and couldn't sleep much the night before, so I was exhausted that morning. K, knowing this, went out to the grocery store down the street while I was still sleeping and bought me an energy drink and a snack to get me through the day. I thought this was really sweet of him and thanked him for it several times throughout the day.\n\nFast forward to tonight, I'm trying to nip a potential ear infection in the bud by pouring some hydrogen peroxide in my ear. Anyone who's done this knows how unpleasant it is, and to top it off, I'm particularly squeamish about things touching or going inside my ears. K knows all this, and I was also very vocal about my discomfort while it was happening. K decides now would be a good time to tell me that one of my cats got out as he was leaving to buy those snacks for me. The cat led him on a wild goose chase throughout the building, running up and down several flights of stairs before K could catch him. I sort of half-chuckle and say, \"Yeah, he can be a shit.\"\n\nSo there I am, head cocked to the side and nursing this peroxide bubbling in my ear, and K just says, rather rudely, \"You're welcome.\"\n\nI was caught off guard by that so I didn't say anything. K says, \"Wow. Really, nothing?\"\n\nCue some bickering. I told him that I would have gone out and caught the cat myself if I knew it was happening, and also, what else was he going to do, just leave him out there? K responds, \"Just because something's common courtesy or expected doesn't mean you shouldn't still say thank you.\" I'm annoyed at this point so I halfheartedly apologize but I tell him that I didn't realize a thank you was expected or necessary in this situation.\n\nHe responds, \"Whatever, it's a really minor thing anyway.\" I reply, \"Yeah, it really is.\" Thought it was over. He says, \"Maybe the next time you do something minor I'll just forget to thank you for it.\"\n\nThen I told him to fuck off and went to bed.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for not thanking him or is my friend TA for expecting a thanks?",

      "description": "Some context for the story. My friend, let’s call her Maria, and our friend group have been friends for 6 years. We’re all very close and are almost like sisters.\nAbout 5 years ago, she met her friend who’s not in our friend group. Now, I’m pretty sure we were all open to the idea of being friends with her too, until she expressed how much she hated us. It’s not even just being “fake”, she doesn’t even try. Her reasoning for being that way towards us is because she thinks Maria can do “a lot better” than us. For example, she’ll text Maria and ask “where are you?” And she’ll respond “I’m with my friend group”. And her friend literally responds “ew” whenever our names are mentioned.\nThe other day, I was joking about picking between us or her other friend. Although I was joking, I almost meant it. I don’t want her to pick sides but in my opinion, it makes us uncomfortable that she overlooks it.",

My girlfriend considers the cat part hers and sees it everyday.\n\nThis cat was elderly and infirm. It was blind, deaf, had no control of its bowels so it was constantly laying in its own urine and feces until someone found it. It could not move on its own.\n\nIt is on so much medication that it doesnt even recognize people anymore. It has to have its face held against a bowl of water to drink and a plate of mushed up food to eat.\n\nThere was no quality of life. This upsets my girlfriend greatly. I volunteered to destroy it and end its suffering, however my girlfriends mother refused. She said that she would rather it die naturally. This in my girlfriends opinion is cruel, and she sends me to put it down discreetly.\n\nThe cat was already heavily medicated but I followed the proper protocols and injected it with a sedative before giving it an overdose. It felt nothing and died quickly, I measured its breathes as I held it in my arms until it expired.\n\nI placed it back down for my girlfriends mother to find. My girlfriend is upset but thanks me.\n\nMy sister (who i told) believes i shouldnt have destroyed the cat without the mothers permission, despite the undue stress on my girlfriend and the cat.

      "description": "First off, I understand that beauty is relative and is in the eye of the beholder, however most of my friends and non family members agree that my little sister is *not* cute, even for toddler standards.\n\nLet me start this by saying I have two half-sisters, both younger and all of us are from different women. (They are 11 and 2 years old respectively, i'm 18.). I am referring to the younger one. I love them both dearly like any older brother and care a lot for them.\n\nThat being said, neither of them are very good looking. All of us highly resemble our father, me being the most similar. My dad is a good looking guy, is young (40), looks even younger (early 30's) and plays a lot of sports/gyms regularly. He has very masculine traits such as a defined jawline and strong cheekbones. Now those aren't bad genetics to have... as a guy. The 11 year old wasn't the cutest child because of that but she's pretty normal and is getting better, I think she'll be a very beautiful woman in the future.\n\nNow regarding the youngest, she is an objectively ugly child. I know this sounds harsh but please hear me out. She inherited all of my fathers strong masculine traits, and most of my step-mother's bad traits. I just don't see the cute part, I can't. I know people change in life, especially at such a young age, and am fully aware she will still develop a lot, but at this current moment, she is not a good looking person. I've mentioned this to my dad, and he'll tell me im being mean but never actually disagrees with me in any way. He's not the type of guy to lie to himself either.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

Fast forward through weeks of flirting, we started hooking up every now and then over a month and a half until she cut it off because she met someone. \n\nI was completely fine with that because we had always agreed it was a FWB/no strings attached type of thing and I was slowly distancing myself anyway because as far as I could tell her hygiene was going downhill. We wished each other well and hadn't spoken since. This was 2 weeks ago. \n\nHeres where I maybe fucked up. Last Friday I was at one of the ex co workers birthday party when my friend asked what happened between me and Kylie. I told him what happened and that I was fine with it because her vag was starting to give off a sour cream dip stench. (A lighthearted joke but not a lie). He had a laugh then we continued on with the night. \n\nCome to this morning and I get a text from Kylie telling me I'm a piece of shit for spreading shit about her amongst her co workers along with some other choice words. This is 2 days later. I didn't spread anything I literally just told my friend as a passing joke without anyone around. I'm pissed at my friend because I don't see any reason for him to repeat that shit unless directly asked which he obviously wasn't because wtf.\n\nI know Kylie isn't the asshole but who is out of the rest of us? I told someone something that wasn't supposed to be repeated and it took 2 damn days to get out",

      "description": "She has been my best friend since Grade One, and we lived together in university for four years. We graduated in 2014 and I moved to a different city to pursue my Masters while she moved back home. We are 26 now.\n\nSince December 2017, she has been exhibiting delusions and paranoia (thinking water sprinklers in rooms are cameras; thinking the FBI is following her; inferring a significance from licence plates; she thought she was poisoned and was brought to the hospital and it was found to be \"psychosis due to exhaustion\"; seeing an arrow in the sky and thinking it's pointing her in a direction). She abuses her Vyvanse prescription and smokes weed sometimes; she used to smoke weed every day. She posts long, incoherent posts on Instagram with unnecessarily wordy language (but that has always been her style, it's just amped up now). She is very spiritual and into numerology now, especially the number 1. On the eve of my late father's birthday, she got upset at me because she thought that I expected her to give me something even though I explained over and over I did not. She doesn't believe me about anything. She is very isolated, she has had difficulty keeping friends in the past few years. \n\nShe lost her brother last summer (definitely a trigger, I acknowledge) and since then has been spiralling downward. She has been incredibly narcissistic but justifies it as \"setting boundaries\". I totally get this - I fully support being selfish in the wake of grief but not when it begins to hurt other people - she has told multiple exes that I have been trying to sleep with her (this is untrue) and that my current girlfriend looks like her because I secretly want to be with her.\n\nRecently she made a poor decision to meet up with an ex while her current (but now ex girlfriend) was clearly unhappy. I told her that maybe it wasn't the best decision and she blew up at me. She called me evil and abusive. She's done the same to her now ex whenever they would argue. \n\nShe is a person you simply can't confront about her behaviour because she doesn't see it and if she does, she has every reason (she believes) to justify it. For some context, I used to be childishly mean with her when we lived together (i.e. throwing candies at her while in our living room, acting like sisters). One day she got SO upset at me, she flat-out told me I was mean, and (without trying to toot my own horn) I realized I was a dipshit and I tried to make the effort to my kinder, and I think I have been since then. \n\nI just want nothing to do with her now, selfishly. She has made little effort towards our friendship since I moved (to be fair, mental health could have played a role as well as finances) so I'm not too invested anymore. Should I stay to ensure she's okay or can I go on my separate way?\n\nShe also isn't close with her family so telling her parents about her behaviour is not an option.",

      "description": "A little back story. So I met this girl (just found out she is 15) a month back and we started “dating”. Turns out she just wants to be friends which is fine by me. A little bummed out but no skin off my nose. We talked a lot and she struggles with depression and she claims she has a lot of responsibilities in her life and it’s overall very crappy. I comforted her as best as I can and I advised her to get back on track in life and go back to school. She basically ignored all my advices and said she doesn’t want things to get better.\n\nAlright so on Friday, she went to her friend’s house to smoke marijuana and drink. Keep in mind she’s 15. She told me she nearly passed out and felt like crap. I thought it was really irresponsible of her friend to enable her to do this. We had a argument over text last night which basically was me urging her to do better and do the right thing. All she had to say was she didn’t care and she just wanted to give up because she’s too lazy to do anything. She told me she planned on going to her friend’s house to smoke again today when I asked to meet her so we can talk. She lives with her mom and she told me her mom doesn’t know. So at this point, I found her mom on Facebook and texted her and basically told her what was going on with her daughter. Her mom thanked me for telling her. Now she and her best friend spammed my text calling me a dick and said it was a dick move. I told her best friend that I was worried for her health and what she was doing was very dangerous. She shouldn’t be involved with people like that. But she told me what I did won’t solve anything and will only make things worst.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "AITA for acting like this?\n\nSo, background:\n\nI am a computer science major. In the particular semester in question, many projects were filled with intense team work, collaboration, and 'figure it out yourself' stuff. Personally, I am an A student, have a background in at least the beginning coursework, and have been known for taking some time to help others. \n\nOn one team project, I am paired with two classmates I know pretty well, and one guy who joined because he couldn't find another group. This guy will be referred to as X.\n\nI've never really talked to X before this, but he was known for lying, and not knowing much.\n\nAt one point,  X claimed his grandfather worked on Stuxnet which, for those of you who don't know, is an extremely classified government project/computer virus of which little is known about. There is literally no way this kid's grandfather worked on this project, and he know about it.\n\nX has also claimed to be excited to join the military and \"shoot people,\" and has a story about everything. His highest grade was a C, and seemed alright with that.\n\nQuickly into the project X made it clear that he was exactly as he appeared. He made little to no effort, and what he did had to be thrown away.\n\nI, being a blunt person, repeatedly told him off. I said he was lazy, needed to contribute, and I was not putting up with his nonsense. I told him to stop talking and focus whenever he started making up stories while we were working, and rejected every offer of friendship he made because I didn't feel comfortable near him.\n\nI told this kid I \"wanted nothing to do with him \" socially, and just want to get through the project. \n\nAfter a few days of this, he finally said: \"I am autistic, and can't keep up! You guys need to do some of my work for me!\" and laughed. \n\nI had no idea that X was autistic before this, but wasn't crazily surprised. \n\nStill, I decided he made me uncomfortable, and if he could go to college, he could act at least semi mature and be able to do some work. I continued to treat him the same as before.\n\nI told him he made uncomfortable, and I didn't want to interact with him beyond the project. I would help him with work up until he tried to get me to do it all, or insist on talking about guns/stories, at which point I would leave and tell him to ask one of the other members.\n\nHe would offer to buy me food (I never accepted, obviously), would apologize for \"being a horrible person,\" and continue to not do work.\n\nProbably the nicest I ever was to X was when I told him \"He wasn't horrible, I just wasn't comfortable with him personally.\"\n\nI've had autistic friends, coworkers, and more. My boyfriend's brother is autistic, and we hang out all the time. For some reason, though, I couldn't help but be so blunt to this kid.\n\nAm I the asshole for treating X bluntly, and possibly rudely, even after finding out he was autistic?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly two years now, we barely fight and if so its just about some trivial things that we resolve quickly and together, however, today we had a discussion and she has said to me that it has made her upset and disappointed in me but I don't think it is warranted.\n\nWe both live at home with our parents, respectively seperate but still close by and such, we spend a lot of time at each others houses so there isn't any question about like me not seeing her enough. She asked me to come over today and stay the night because her Mum has left to go to Byron Bay for business and has left my girlfriend home alone at the house. (We are both 20 years old) I told her earlier in the week that I'd come over Saturday and Sunday to keep her company but not today because I had a rough day at work and just need some time alone.\n\nThought I'd throw in that I'm a person that feels like they would go crazy if they didn't have time to themselves. I need time to just do my own thing and feel like I don't have to entertain someone when I'm with them, hence my feeling on not wanting to go over today. (I haven't been home all week from spending time at her house, work and going out) I am desperately in need of just staying home alone today. She however is the opposite, she always feels the need to see me and be with someone.\n\nAnyway, back to the story, she is disappointed in not coming over because she gets nervous staying home alone, and wants me to come over and make her feel safe. I completely understand that but respectfully and nicely told her why I didn't want to come over, and she just doesn't understand, no matter how many times I've told her in the past how I feel about this stuff. She continues to say \"She wish her boyfriend would spend time with her, and come over\". I always spend time with her, seeing her almost every day of the week somehow. \n\nI told her she needs to get over this fear of being home alone and such, she is 20 years old and if she is going to move out and in with people or herself she is going to have to learn and overcome this fear and such, it isn't going to help in the future. She told me I was being an asshole.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to come over when she feels scared staying alone at home when I just need to have alone time?",

      "description": "So, our next door neighbors in our apartment complex seem to have some kind of fancy sound system where the bass, the tune, and some lyrics can be heard very, very clearly through the walls of our apartment. It's been so loud at some points that it sounds like someone has the TV on in the living room even when no one else is home.\n\nMy roommates and I thought previously that the walls were just that thin, but we've noticed that not only do we not hear our other neighbors at all outside of the music, but no one has mentioned anything to us about our, erm, accidental volume increases when playing games after work (we do our best to be mindful). So, we're thinking....maybe the walls aren't that thin and the music from our neighbors' sound system is just that loud.\n\nThe wrinkle here is that they only seem to play music from about 9am to 7pm. The three of us all work second and third shifts, so we're all usually home to hear it. Makes it a little difficult to sleep in, especially for my roommates whose room is closer to the wall that the sound system seems to be placed against.\n\nThey aren't exactly playing it during hours where people would normally be sleeping, but it's consistent enough and loud enough that we occasionally wonder if anyone actually goes to work in that apartment. It's why I'm wondering - are we the assholes for preparing to get with them to ask them to tone it down? \n\nWe technically SHOULD be awake by 9, but considering our shifts all conveniently start around 3-4pm and end at 9 or 10, we do sleep in an extra hour or two.

So I responded with “I might not be able to change your mind, but if you don’t vaccinate your kids then they’re not allowed to play with mine.” \n\nAs soon as I said that she went off about how I would be irresponsible for getting them vaccinated and how it wouldn’t be fair to the kids to prevent them from playing with each other just because I didn’t agree with her. I told her that at that point they would pose a risk to my children and just because she was willing to risk her kids lives because of her stupid reckless opinion doesn’t mean I’m going to. It got really heated and obviously didn’t end well.\n\nEver since then, she’s been spamming me with phony articles supporting her views all citing no existent studies and spouting the same bs. I just ignored her and honestly didn’t feel like I did anything wrong until a few of our mutual friends messaged me saying “You guys don’t even have kids, just let it go.” And “Would you really isolate your kids just because you disagree with her” and “You’re would vaccinate your kids anyway, there would be no health risk to them.” Completely missing the point. \n\nThese friends messaging me all disagree with anti vaxxers, but are acting like I’m an awful person.

      "description": "So, long story.\n\n\nIt was my old Dungeons and Dragons group. My friend, lets call him Austin ran a group on Fridays initially for a group of 8. (Let's call them, Alex, Chris, Cody, Aj, Troy, Ellie, Josh and me as players.) I ran a dnd group on Sundays for Chris, Cody, Troy and Ellie.\n\n\nThings seemed to be going great. Then Austin and Alex got into a disagreement and Austin turned the entire group against him. (It was specifically because Alex had an interview for a job that Austin didn't approve of. Flight Attendant for the curious.)\n\n\nAustin was autistic (aspergers) and had anger issues though and those became more apparent after Alex left. Seems Alex was somewhat keeping him in check. Well after that, Austin started taking his replica swords (that were sharpened) and putting them to peoples throats when they pissed him off. \n\n\nCody lied about getting a factory job so that he wouldn't have to come anymore.\n\n\nAj was targeted next. Minor bullying, insulting his in game ideas, trash talking his character concepts, denying him the ability to do mundane stuff in game but allow others to do amazing things without rolling. Not to mention the sword. While also talking behind his back constantly.\n\n\nAj left the group.\n\n\nNext up was Troy for the chopping block. He was targeted for months but ended up using his family as a means to get out of it. He went through all of the same stuff as Aj.\n\n\nAt that point it was just me, Chris, Ellie and Josh left. I was the next target. The sword was finally put to my throat. And Austin kept purposely trying to give me panic and anxiety attacks during the game as proof that he was doing a good job at telling an intense story.\n\n\nI was very suicidal.\n\n\nI told the group that I needed to get away from the game for the foreseeable future otherwise I would probably end up killing myself. (Exact words was, \"Hey guys. I'm sorry to have to do this. I'm in a very bad mental state right now, and dnd is honestly just making it worse. I need to take sometime for myself for the foreseeable future to work things out, otherwise I honestly think I may kill myself. I'm really sorry about that. I hope to be back soon!\") It was right after a bad break up with my fiance, so it all was adding up too quickly.\n\n\nSo I... Never heard from them again. Except for Ellie.\n\n\n\n\nChristmas 2017 comes around and Ellie contacts me. Apparently Austin showed up to my house to give me a Christmas gift?  I got a job a couple of months later and started working full time.  But the day he claimed to was before I started working. I was a shut in who hadn't left the house in about 2 months and was terrified of stepping outside and seeing him. So I know he never showed up. But she was upset with me for blowing him off. I mean I guess I could have missed him. She asked if I would contact him. Said I would. Then my work schedule changed and I was working a lot more and forgot about it.\n\n\nSkipping ahead to May. I hear from Ellie again. Everyones doing good. She's still the only one that put in any effort to contact me.\n\n\nI got back in touch with Alex, Troy, Cody and Aj and we all realized that we went through the same situations in the same order like it was systematic. Had a good laugh and have been helping each other work past it.\n\n\nI heard from Ellie a couple of weeks ago. She asked the reason why I left the group and \"hurt Austin so badly\". Told me that she was tempted to come to my house and assault me for hurting him as well? I explained. She told me that apparently the group was SO hurt by me leaving. But yet none of them ever tried to contact me. So it was my fault.\n\n\nMy number never changed. I had half of them on facebook and the other half on other social medias. They had numerous ways to contact me. But I was trying to avoid contacting them first because I didn't want to go back to that situation. However if any of them had of messaged me, I would have responded just like I did with Ellie. (Also as far as the contact thing goes; I'm one of those people that I don't initiate conversations often. I initiated so many conversations with that friend group that you could count it on both hands over a two year period. So it's not like it was anything strange with me not texting anyone.)\n\n\nAnyways. It's mostly just Ellie's last contact that had me wondering about this entire situation.",

      "title": "AITA for not letting a wheelchair bound person ahead of me in a busy hall?",
      "description": "A while ago I was at a convention. There's a long, narrow hallway/bridge at the top floor that connects the two buildings the convention takes place in. The hall is split like a road, 4 meters on each side going opposite directions. Foot traffic in these halls is *slow*; it is everywhere in the convention center. You can't really push through people, it's packed. You can expect to take at least 10 minutes to get from one building to the next.\n \nWhile I and a group of friends were walking down the hall, we hear a woman saying \"Excuse me\" behind us, until we see her roll up in her electric wheelchair. She keeps pushing through the crowd to get to the end of the hall, albeit not running people over and at least giving them an audible cue. We get out of her way, and she continues plowing through, with a smile on her face, so I see no reason to believe this was an emergency.\n \nI was kind of puzzled. I mentioned to my friend, \"Why is she cutting through like that, no one else does?\" My friend looked at me as if I just insulted her, and said something about her needing to get to the elevator at the end of the hall. There's elevators at both ends, not just the one she was headed towards, i.e. she had already passed one, she wanted to get into the other building (like the rest of us), it wasn't like she just needed to get downstairs. \n \nSo now I'm left with a moral dilemma. I can't see any reason she would feel like she can push past other people, other than having a wheelchair. There are other people at the same convention who also use wheelchairs, and I've never dealt with one cutting through crowds.\n \nAm I the asshole for thinking she shouldn't get special treatment in a situation like that just because she's disabled? I feel like maybe, but I'm missing something.",

      "description": "My husband passed away 10 years ago at 27 from a motor vehicle accident.\n\nAt the time of his death, he had not spoken to his mother or step father in 4 years. By his account, he never intended to speak with them again and didn’t want our children around them, communicating with them, receiving gifts or cards, nothing. He had a whole story made up that he planned on telling the kids when they asked about his parents, about how sometimes there are bad people etc. They were abusive to him growing up (not to mention raging bigots), there was always tension between them. At the time I met him, he wasn’t close to his parents at all, barely spoke, saw them once a year if that, but no drama as neither side invested that much effort in the relationship. \n\nThe final falling out had a lot to do with me. His mother was very overbearing and disrespectful to me while I was pregnant with our first child. My husband tried to put a handle on it, her reaction to him trying to establish boundaries is what killed the relationship. His mother refused to acknowledge or modify her behavior, to the point that she seemed psychotic. His step father joined in my spewing hateful words to my husband. He cut them off and we never looked back. The decision to end all communication was his and he took it seriously, he sent a cease and desist to her at one point when she kept sending packages to our house.\n\nAfter the accident, his mother reached out to me trying to basically plan the funeral. I told her that she would neither have a hand in planning the funeral or be in attendance. I told them they could have their own service if they felt so inclined, but they wouldn’t be at the one I was having for him. My brother told them both that they would be removed if they were to show up. She tried demanding some of his remains which I refused.\n\nOur babies were only 3 and 1 at the time of his death. My decision about his parents attending was based on the fact that he himself said they were dead to him, and he never wanted them to be around his own children. My babies were at their fathers funeral, I didn’t want two strangers to all of us there.\n\nMy now 13 year old daughter asks a lot of questions about her dad, naturally. She just recently learned that she has another grandmother who she hasn’t met, she had a lot of questions. The subject of his funeral came up last night. She learned that I did not allow her dads mother to attend last night. She is very angry with me and told me I should have put my own feelings aside. I tried explaining that I did it to honor her dad. She slammed her bedroom door, yelled some things at the door, I heard the words immature and petty several times.\n\nAt the time, I was certain I made the right call. Now, 10 years later, I can see why my daughter feels that way. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm currently living in a relationship with my partner and our two small kids. In my life I've felt pretty shit for long periods of time but atm I'm doing great. I absolutely love my kids and spend all my time with them. The one problem is that me and my partner have become just best friends that have kids together, anything resembling attraction has been gone for a long time for whatever reason. Even getting the second one was tough because yeah, it's tough going through the motions when there's really nothing there.\n\nSo my partner travels a lot for work, leaving me quite a lot of time alone with just the kids which suits me perfectly anyways. For the last couple of months we've been spending a lot of our time with another kid that lives nearby and their parent (we can call them E) who is in pretty much the same situation as myself except further progressed along the same path. E's partner is also gone a lot but when they're together they fight a lot and they're really never even friendly to each other.\n\nMe and E have bonded a great deal for some time, our kids are best friends and we know each others situations perfectly. Neither of us really has anyone else to turn to about this as none of our friends know how bad our relationships have gotten, the facades are still in place for both of them.\n\nLast week E suggested that we should get together for a night out without the kids which I happily agreed to. Sounded really fun in its own right, but also my partner were actually going to be out of town with the kids for the suggested weekend so I had a pretty good idea what might happen. I spent time thinking about what if  we ended up the night together, and concluded that I would be fine with it. From my perspective it would give me some kind of boost to carry on with my life, as I wrote first I'm at a better place in my life than I've ever been and I don't want to change anything right now. Sex is not really that important to me but E is incredibly attractive and a complete lack of it has also driven me a little crazy I guess.\n\nFlash forward and ofc we ended up really drunk and finished the night at my place having awesome sex for hours because both of us had needed that for a looong time.\n\nI woke up the next day feeling fine about it all, while E unfortunately are having some serious regrets. Turns out they had not expected this outcome after all. Also their partner was not away while this night happened and they've had to tell quite substantial lies to cover it up. Me on the other hand only has to not say anything which is quite a lot easier ofc.\n\nSo. AITA and if so against whom? Against my partner because I was completely unfaithful and that's always an asshole move? Or, against E because I pretty much knew that this would happen and went along without stoping anything?\n\nI didn't feel like an asshole at first, but E's reaction has got me rethinking the whole deal. If anyone should be having regrets it should be me because I actually really really like my partner, they will always be my best friend whatever happens with everything else.",

Because of this, my friend tells me to not scream and be a degenerate, I tell him sorry and I'll try not to. I do it again out of habit and he leaves the server and makes a new one to invite everyone to. Some people leave and I'm left with 2 of my friends and me. After the game he comes back into the server and tells me if I stop screaming when I make a play he will let me play with him. I tell him that I don't want to fucking play with him and leave. He personally calls me and starts slinging insults at me, telling me how his ears ring because of me. I tell him I'm sorry and I don't want to be in a call with him if we ever play again, reasoning being that I don't have the self control not to yell, and also because I don't like it when he berates me. He tells me that I'm a fake ass friend for not having the self control or caring for his well being. \n\nTLDR: Play LoL with friend, get hyped and scream.

      "description": "I’m a super pragmatic person, I’m an atheist that believes solely in science and what has been proven. I have nothing against religious or spiritual people and completely respect their views and beliefs. \n\nMy best friend is the typical Los Angeles new age girl, crystals, tarot, reiki, faeries, astrology, etc. She knows I don’t believe in any of these things and still she talks about them with me ALL THE TIME. I basically sit there trying to take her seriously, while she goes off about spirituality talking about it all like it’s all real and based on facts. It’s incredibly uncomfortable for me and I’ve politely told her multiple times to try to talk about these things with her other friends because all that goes through my mind when she brings it up is how it’s all fairytales. But I never say that, and still listen and try to be supportive. I think it’s a little disrespectful to constantly talk about her beliefs with someone that doesn’t believe in it. \n\nEarlier today, she asks me if I want her to read my tarot, then later we were walking our dogs and she points to the sky and says: I wonder which one is my star (she says she’s a pleidian starseed), and babbles on about that for a while, then she was telling me how aliens introduced reiki to someone in Japan and how people believe acupuncture and all these things were taught by aliens. And I lost it, I usually just smile uncomfortably, but I started laughing out loud uncontrollably. She took it really poorly. I told her that if a Christian person was constantly preaching to her about God it would probably be uncomfortable and she said it wasn’t the same situation and acted offended. She went on saying that I’m a bad friend, and I have the need to feel right all the time, and I just have a superiority complex, and continued with personal observations about who I am. I starting feeling really bad and emotional so I just walked out. She won’t talk to me, and I know it was rude of me to laugh at her beliefs and feel really bad about it, but AITA here?",

      "description": "Hey Reddit,\n\nThrowaway obviously.\n\nSo the other day, my husband and I got into an “argument” over something that I think was stupid. We’d recently been out to lunch with a couple that we’re very close friends with and were talking about recycling and how you don’t know what’s recyclable these days. \n\nI then joked and said, “haha yeah, hubby over here leaves random things out for recycling that aren’t recyclable.” He acted sort of stiff and offended and said, “no I don’t”, so I laughed and said, “Oh it’s happened a couple of times” (while sort of wiggling my eyebrows).\n\nAnyway, he said he didn’t again in a more tense and pointed tone which made things a bit awkward, so our friend stepped in and made a joke so we could move on. Later that night, I said to him that I didn’t really appreciate his response, that he does sometimes leave things out, and I was embarrassed that our friend stepped in. He apologised sincerely and said he’d been thinking about it.\n\nI thought we were cool but then he said that he didn’t like how I made him look stupid when I said he left the wrong things out. Reddit, this is literally where I’m stumped. I honestly don’t see how my joke made him look stupid. He’s a very smart dude, and it’s a mistake we all make (hence why we were joking about it). I love him and had no intention of hurting him or making him seem stupid with my comment.\n\nI told him I honestly didn’t mean to offend him and didn’t understand what I’d done, and he started getting really upset, then I got upset for upsetting him. In the end, we communicated clearly and apologised to each other and hugged, but I need to know AITA for teasing him in the first place?\n\nI have BPD (borderline personality disorder) but I’ve done DBT, have a psychiatrist and psychotherapist I check in with regularly, take my medication and practice mindfulness. HOWEVER, I also recognise my normal meter could be completely broken and this is something that could totally have skewed my perceptions of what is hurtful, so I think it’s worth mentioning.\n\nIf it turns out, I’m NTA I would never use it against him. I just want to know if he’s particularly sensitive or if I need to modify my behaviour overall. If AITA, then I think I’ll need to take a good, hard look at myself.\n\nTL;DR: I made a joke that made my husband feel stupid. AITA?",

He started talking about how disgusting it is and how that one baker should be allowed to not bake gay cakes (it was still in the news at the time). I am homosexual but I hate being confrontational or making a conversation an argument, as a result. I did my usual thing where I act like I agree with you and repeat what you say. We talked about it till I got to my stop but he gave me the information on his church and since we both believe in conservative judaism, I started going to his church. It was also when I barely moved from my hometown so I needed a new one anyway. We've stayed in contact and it's been a while now. We don't talk about homosexuality or anything like that. Nonetheless, we are very alike in other subjects so I enjoy talking to him once in a while. \n\nI am currently in a relationship and I mentioned him (we go to the same church) and what he said. He didn't say I was a bad or anything but he did say that I shouldn't have said what I said. I personally think it was okay and I would have done a bad thing if I made it an argument instead. \n\ntl;dr, I am acquainted with someone even though they have said homophobic remarks. ",

      "description": "My ex and I (both 20f) only dated for about two months. When we first met, I knew she was ace but was willing to look past that/compromise because I thought I really liked her.\n\nOur relationship started off really well and it seemed like we were inseparable as we tried to spend as much time as possible together. \n\nFast forward to two weeks ago. After hanging out all day, we come up on the topic of being gay and childhood. Then she admitted to me that she’s never actually had a crush on anyone and how she considered being in a “queer platonic” relationship.\n\nThis made me really upset/shocked (she told me before she liked girls + guys and she’s the one who asked me to be her girlfriend) and I basically told her I didn’t believe in such a relationship and asked if she was really attracted to me, to which she very quickly answered yes and then the conversation ended.\n\nAfter this it seemed like she was avoiding me. We both work a full time internship but I kept trying to make time for us and she kept pushing me away (even though she had PLENTY of time to spend with her guy friend who she spent almost everyday with).\n\nI confronted her about it and she pretty much told me that she was aromantic and knew about she might be before we started dating but tried to push herself to be in a relationship. We decided to end it mutually but she said she would love to still be friends because our breakup doesn’t really change anything for her. \n\nI’m at the point where I’m pissed at her and I don’t want to see her again because 1) I feel like our whole relationship was a lie. 2) This was the first relationship I have ever been in and I feel like I’ve been cheated out of it. 3) It upsets me that I’m the only hurt by our breakup. 4) We met on a dating app so intention of DATING was pretty clear.\n\nSo basically I have to ask: AITA for not wanting to stay friends or should I just accept her for who she is and try to shake it off?\n\n",

      "description": "I’ve known my friend for years, since 6th grade (I’m a senior now). He’s always been kind of a dick, but we always respected each other and hung out quite a bit. We’ve butter heads a few times but it’s usually worked itself out. \n\nLately though, his life has been going downhill. In Sophomore year his girlfriend of 2 years broke up with him and accused him of sexual assault. (He’s never told the full story on it, but I’ve heard from her friends that she exaggerated) He lost a good amount of friends, and out groups never recovered to what it was. He got hella depressed and left school for a few months. He called me one day, saying that he knows he hasn’t always been a good friend, and that he’s sorry and he’s really glad I’m friends with him.I think he tried to kill himself that night. \n\nWhen he came back, his now ex-girlfriend tried to get him removed from the school, using everything she could to get him removed. It didn’t work, and she got a restraining order instead. Junior year he came to school less and less, and eventually he stopped coming for months at a time. Every once in a while, our group went over to his house and said how we cared about him and he had to go to school, and he would go (for a month or two) and go back to doing his shit. \n\nHe says he has chronic pain, and that it’s sometimes unbearable, but we don’t really believe him. He usually stays at home and gets high (basically 24/7 since his parents took away all his technology to try and punish him) and sneaks out whenever he wants to if he has a booty call (sometimes 3 am).\n\nHe failed most of his classes Junior year, but he was still on track to graduate(he’s a smart guy and was ahead in most subjects) but this year he’s still not going to class, saying he’s sick. Yet he’s not sick enough to go drink and smoke and party with some other guys. He’s become increasingly hostile to our group, especially those who call him out on his shit. \n\nHe’s also a borderline sociopath, and has shown us multiple time that he hardly cares about us and only hangs out with girls to fuck them.  He even told a friend (who’s sister was dying in the hospital) that she should hotbox her breathing tube. Once she died, and she caning crying to him, he made a joke and didn’t talk to her about it.\n\nAfter taking a step back and looking at what kind of friend he’s been, I honestly don’t care what happens to him anymore. We’ve done all we can at this point, and I don’t think he’s a good friend. Am I the asshole if I let himself ruin his life?\n\n\n",

      "description": "So, first of all let me just get it out of the way thaty coworker (in my eyes at least) is a total piece of shit. He's smug and annoying, kinda slimy, and constantly tries to one-up everybody else in a very irritating and condesending kind of way. He also flirts with another girl who works here, even though he already has a girlfriend. Nobody in the office really likes him, and me and him have a bit of a rivalry going on for quite some time. Anyway, I could deal with all his bullshit, but last week he really crossed a line. See, I work in the media, and my company recently had something of a contest going on. Now, I wasn't really bothered by this, the job is just how I pay the bills, know what I mean, and I'm generally not a very competitive person, so I was happy to just ignore the competition. My coworker, however, was the opposite. He was *all over* it. Working all day and night, boasting to everyone about how he was going to win, etc. Weirdly, he kept trying to put me down while he did so. He was starting to really piss me off. I'd also been going through some difficulties (personal stuff) and just really wasn't in the mood for his crap. This all came to a head when my coworker entered his submition to the contest and won. It was MY work. He'd taken it, made some *slight* edits, and called it his work. I was livid. I decided to do something about it (my boss was/is kind of a dick and doesn't really give a fuck, so I couldn't really go to him). I gathered proof, and made a little folder with my original work and the edits pointed out, and went to confront him. Everyone was congratulating him on winning the competition and I just kinda strolled up to him and started probing him. He acted all smug, as usual, and as though he didn't even care that he'd screwed me over. I'm ashamed to say I lost my temper. I pushed him, insulted him, and made him beg me not to tell. I handed the folder in, and (suprisingly) my boss took it seriously. He got fired. Now that I've calmed down a bit I do feel a little guilty. I was nasty in a way that's not like me, and the guy now doesn't have a job. Also, I'm pretty sure his girlfriend broke up with him to. So, reddit, AITA?",

Well it turns out that one of my friends had a problem with this and she said that I put her on blast but I told her she’s always known that I do this because I’ve done it with her being my vent person/filter.

I don’t know if doing this will make me lose all my friends or make me closer with them and I also don’t know if I’m being an asshole.

      "description": "The way my company works is coworkers opt in for a shift and then work that shift. If you opt in for an open, you have opening duties. Part of our opening duties require us to scan inventory in daily around our location, and that requires a bit of crouching and walking around. Certainly not the easiest thing to do with a broken foot.\n\nMy coworker recently broke his foot and has been slowly using that as an excuse to not do his duties. The issue I have is that he's choosing to work open shifts, and there are other shifts scattered throughout the day he could switch other coworkers with. \n\nI feel like if you're going to volunteer yourself for an open shift that you chose, that you should be required to do open duties. If you're unfit to do the duties, then don't select an open shift. \n\nWIBTA if I told him he needs to do inventory?",

      "description": "I'm M28, she's F25 and we've been together for 2 years now. I just got a new job as a VP of sales for a start up and they're giving me a budget and letting me hire a secretary/assistant. I told my GF this and she's like we have to have a serious talk about this and basically told me it can't be a girl. I was shocked and just said I'm gonna hire the best person for the job. I got HR to post the job online about 2.5 weeks ago and asked them to forward me qualified people and I'd narrow that down to interviews which I started this past Monday. The problem is, well not really a problem is that mostly all women applied for this position and they were more than qualified and i'm not going to discriminate based on sex that messed up to me. I had like 4 interviews this week (all young women early to mid 20's) and I really liked one as she has a degree, experience and wants to move up in the company. Also said she'd be more than willing to do personal tasks for me such as order food, get my dry cleaning ETC and this was very important to me as I will be swamped working this job. I called her yesterday and told her the job was hers and gave her the top salary range as she has a degree and experience. She starts on Tuesday and she was very happy and insisted on starting today (fri) but I said nah take the long weekend and enjoy it! Monday is a holiday here anyways.  \n\n I told my GF about her this morning and she said no you're not going to hire her I told you a guy only or an old lady. I got mad and told her not to tell me how to do my job and that I'm hiring her because she's qualified and I don't even care/noticed if she was good looking. She got super pissed and left calling me a douche and a creep for wanting a young assistant.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": " \n\nMy sister and I aren't terribly close and live on different coasts.  We get along fine and she has three children that my husband and I adore. Since we don't have children we're happy to be the ones that travel to visit.  In the last 15 years she's visited 3 times (my wedding, our mother's death, our father's stroke).  Except for the wedding weekend we've hosted them in our home.  I've visited her over 30 times (again, no problems there - a good portion of those trips have been combined with business trips, too). Their house is smaller so I always get a hotel nearby to not inconvenience her. We usually spend our visits at her house playing with the kids and sometimes cooking together. \n\nI now live overseas and was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer. I'm in great health right now, however, and wanted to spend time with her and the family while I'm active since, while I'm sure she'll visit me in hospice, neither of us would want the kids to see that. It would almost certainly be the last time for us all to be together \n\nAfter my sister approved the dates, my husband and I booked our hotel and a flight literally across the world for a weekend visit. Once I sent her the confirmation she proposed that we actually take an adults only trip the night we're in town.  I told her that my main goal was really to see the kids and be together as a family. Two days before our scheduled arrival she emailed to say her house was too messy for us to visit there.\n\nJust a note, I'm pretty healthy but I'm on a very restricted diet so I can't eat out and don't drink.  I get tired quickly and need to be a place where I can sit down. We had booked a hotel suite with a small kitchen but it wasn't large enough for the family. I was pretty heartbroken to think we were flying all that way just to sit in some crappy hotel room where I either wouldn't get to see the kids or they'd be miserable.\n\nIn an (admittedly passive aggressive) escalation of emails I pushed for her to let us come visit in her house where we could see the kids and there was seating for everyone, swearing up and down that I don't care about any mess (I don't) and trying to figure out if there was any other reason she didn't want me over (she insisted there wasn't).\n\nEventually I guess her husband cleaned the house and we had a really pleasant weekend coloring and playing board games with the kids in the afternoons and making some really nice memories. \n\nStill, my relationship with my sister has been strained since and I realize I was technically in the wrong for inviting myself to her home. I've apologized profusely but still, given that it's been prior precedent, I make 98% of the effort for visiting, and... well... I have a terminal diagnosis, am I really the asshole?",

      "description": "I\\[25F\\] currently rent out a 3 bedroom house to my little brother\\[20M\\] who has a 2 year old and is expecting another baby in April. A few weeks ago he told me about some water damage and when I came over to look, I discovered that we are going to have to completely redo the floors and possibly put in new windows. When I moved out of the house and let him move in, there was some less than perfect carpet. When I went in to check on the water damage, the carpet was seriously awful. They have 2 dogs which they claim are potty trained, but based on the stains, puppy pads and smell...I'm gonna say that they aren't. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, I don't want to redo the floors with a pregnant girl in the house, and my niece running around. I worry about fumes and nails and stuff like that. So my original intention was to ask them if they could stay with his dad or someone while I get it all fixed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I had a thought. I don't want to spend a bunch of money on NEW floor, just for them to move back in and ruin it. It's also not just the house, they ripped up my flower beds, they have junk piled outside in the carport, they painted TWO rooms without asking me...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know they don't want to stay there forever. They don't even want to buy it from me, but y'all I am ready to sell this house (or at least charge more to rent it...like double) and I have a lot to do to it before it will be ready for that. This is almost the perfect opportunity to be able to do that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom, however, thinks it's rude of me to ask them to move out. She says that she's afraid that they won't have anywhere to go (despite the fact that his dad literally does anything he asks) and that they can't afford that right now. Bear in mind that my brother works for his dad, gets paid under the table REALLY well, and just bought a couple thousand dollar engagement ring for his gf. They easily qualify for government housing and would even be paying LESS than what they pay to rent from me now. I want them out (in the nicest way possible), and I'm willing to help them find somewhere or give them money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

After I told my bf, he got mad at me over it and come the start of this term, started to get mad at me for talking to certain people and was constantly monitoring my actions via social media, demanding my location.etc. This in turn led to me losing my social life and becoming permanently locked in my room out of fear for what he might say if I met a friend.\n\nIt was also after this he began to suspect he had some serious mental health problems and was genuinely struggling with severe mood swings and was hurting himself/had thoughts of hurting himself. I blamed myself for this as it only really properly manifested after I told him about what had happened. It eventually resulted in him calling me to tell me he was going to drown himself in the river on my hometown. I was terrified and started worrying the house down in panic. I promised him I'd always look after him and help him through the issues but recently my eyes were opened to him doing some fucked up stuff like, going through my phone when he came to stay and sending screenshots of private conversations to himself without me knowing (he kept them in a folder on his pc and sent them to others), having a go at me for talking to my family and for telling them the nasty stuff he said and how he'd isolated me from everyone here. I had spoken to him on many occasions about his behaviour and kept forgiving him over and over but the stuff mentioned was the final straw. \n\nAt this point I was so pissed I left him but I've heard that he's been struggling again recently and has/has considered seriously hurting himself after the breakup. I still care about him and want to support him through getting help but I don't want to speak to him anymore because he keeps trying to manipulate me back into being with him again and he's angry at me for my choice so I feel like an asshole for both leaving him and for choosing to not support him when getting help for his mental health.\n",

      "description": "Ok so basically this happened about a year ago but didn’t know this sub existed, im on mobile blah blah blah. \n\n  So here’s how it started, I (17 M) was talking to this one girl (16 F) in my class and she and I became pretty good friends and by the end of the year prom was coming up so I asked her to it. She said yes and that was about 3 months before the prom, so during those months we went on 3 dates and talked and texted all the time. \n  Anyways, long story short, she feels like shes leading me on so she doesn’t want to date me anymore. Ok cool, she could’ve lead me on for longer and we both would’ve hurt more. We stopped dating but we were still good friends so we are still texting constantly. \n  Here’s my problem, she texts me talking about how there is no snacks in her house, so im just like ‘go find some lol’ she replies back that she found like 3 different types of snacks. I jokingly reply back ‘omg you’re eating everything.’ That is the comment that I fucked up on so badly. She just replies back ‘wow’ and I text her like 3 different apologies but no response. Eventually she texts me again and tells me that she didn’t think I’d say something like that. \n  She then tells me how she makes herself throw up because she is unhappy with her body and says shes been doing it for months now, and when she finally started to eat well I sent her that text and she said that she went to make herself throw up after that. \n  I had no idea that she was doing that to herself the whole time we were talking. \nReddit, Am I The Asshole?",

      "description": "I’m engaged to be married and have been discussing potential bachelor party ideas with my best man. The 4 groomsmen and I have all been very close friends for the past 15-20 years. We have lived together, traveled together, completed weeklong backpacking trips, and more. Most of us live in the Western United States.\n\nAs we thought through various ideas, my best man and I talked about how an international trip would be fun. I went to Prague on the last bachelor party I attended (different group of friends) and it offered a great mix of a rich cultural and architectural history and happens to have the title of most beer consumption per capita. The trip was filled with walking tours, a beer bike tour, and just general exploration of the city (perhaps boring compared to a “typical” bachelor party, but we all loved it). My best man and I thought through several different locations but ruled many out due to being too expensive, too risky/dangerous, or too far to travel. We zeroed in on Budapest as a potential location.\n\nMy best man floated the idea by the group, without me, to get their genuine feedback. The goal was to allow everyone a chance to say no if we had gotten carried away with the idea. I wanted to ensure that the trip would be one that everyone would want to go on and not feel like a burden or obligation. Based upon the feedback, he and I started talking potential dates that could work that would offer the lowest overall price. I offered to pay for some/all of an Airbnb to minimize the total cost since flights are pricey. \n\nA groomsman felt this was way too much time and money, but instead of raise the concern ended up posting it as a question to the editor on a popular blog. The editor responded calling me an asshole for trying to plan something that was beyond a 4-hour drive away and that European vacations should be reserved for, among other things, “a tiny number of beloved friends.”\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Long post from a first time poster on mobile, so formatting might be weird. Apologies in advance.\n\nSo a little while ago, in a discord server for a certain fandom, me and a few people were discussing Latin classes we take/have taken. I mention, slightly jokingly at one part of this discussion, that I get a little bit of a PTSD flashback whenever I see Latin. The reason, which I didn’t reveal to the group chat but did to a friend who also happened to be in the group later in DMs, was my mother. \n\nBackstory time: I took Latin for 2 years, which was required for all students at my school that was a ‘University Prep’, during the height of my mom’s ‘Stereotypical Chinese Mother’ phase. I literally had the words “If you don’t get into Harvard, go back to China” written in Chinese in my notebook by my mom. Now, my mom is no longer as crazy (just in a different way but I’m also no longer her obedient little drone that wants to be a surgeon), but during this time, there was a lot of yelling, etc. she never hit me, but being an antisocial Chinese kid with only my mom, I valued her opinion above anyone else’s, and it crushed me when she screamed at me for my shortcomings.\n\nOne notable memory was when she ripped the cover off of a novel she got for me at TJMaxx during one of these screaming episodes, throwing it and scattering some of the pages into the backyard (dog chewed on it). \n\nSo, whenever something makes me remember that time, I get severe anxiety. I’ve never gone to get any kind of diagnosis or anything because, while I believe and want to enforce the importance of mental health, I’m still a little too Asian to try and take care of that aspect for myself. But, I’d get rapid heart beat, this cold, overwhelming fear that makes it feel like I’ve got fish bones stuck in my throat, start trembling, a weird detached feeling to myself, amongst a list of other symptoms. \n\nNow, about what happened in the present: One person that I maybe spoke 3 times to on this server, after I offhandedly said that I get a little bit of a ptsd flashback whenever I read Latin, said, “You know using the term PTSD in a non traumatic way is hurtful to those who have actual PTSD’ and I just???\n\nI felt a rage go through me, which was weird because I’m so used to feeling only dull sensations of emotions nowadays, and I had to put down my phone for a few minutes because earlier listed symptoms haven’t stopped trying to tombstone pile-drive me into a full blown mess. But, after I calmed down a little, I replied, “Aight, but you don’t know me like that” and haven’t talked to her since.\n\nWhenever she speaks in chat, even if I’d been active af previously, I wouldn’t respond to what she said. This was from like, the tail end of January, and I can’t help feeling like I’m being sensitive and overreacting a little....\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My mum drinks on average about 2-3 bottles of wine a night and has done since I can remember. She is still able to hold down a full time job so I don't know if this makes her an alcohol. I believe this is a coping mechanism for previous traumas in her life… such as an abusive husband. The last of this happened 15 years ago however she sits and dwells on it and I've had many deep conversations with her throughout my life. My brother describes it as ‘mental gymnastics’ in which she over thinks everything in every possible way. He hasn't lived here for 5 years now but I can hear my mum call him 3 or 4 times a week to complain and tells him things over and over again, when very drunk. When I overhear, she hardly let's him say anything and it's always about her terrible life. We have expressed that she needs a therapist or something but she refuses to help herself so I've grown sick of constantly listening to her. I am not her therapist and it's having a mental strain on me as well.\n\nShe isn't physically abusive but she does get angry and verbally aggressive with me which has resulted in us having a rocky relationship. Perhaps this has made me resent her. I am leaving home to go to university, a 4 hour train ride away, in September which means she will live in the house by herself. I fear this will make her more lonely and drink more. I know people are encouraged to share their problems but is there no cut off point? Surely after 15 years you'd get professional help? I have no problem talking to her when she is sober, hence the after 7pm. \n\nIf there is an emergency, my nan would be the person she'd call as she lives near by. I would not be able to help as I'd lives hours away.\n\nTd/lr My mum drinks to excess and then calls my brother to complain about life at least 3 times a week. I fear this will happen to me when I leave home. I am not her therapist.\n",

      "description": "I've really been struggling with this, because I definitely FEEL like the asshole and feel guilty. But I had my reasons for doing what I did. I know my mom is not the asshole in this situation, I just want to know if I am. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago, my sister had a falling out with the family. I was living with her at the time. She was doing great, but then all of a sudden just lost it. She met a horrible guy, made a bunch of dumb decisions, became a drug addict, left her husband for him, screwed us all over financially, etc. We all did EVERYTHING WE COULD to try to help her, but ultimatley this guy was dragging her down and she was choosing him. He was violent, drug-addicted, manipulative, was draining all her money, and just a loser. He physically attacked my father once. She broke the lease on our house and didn't pay a cent, stole our money, caused a bunch of damage to the house that we all had to pay for, and cut us out because we didn't get along with her BF. After a long and hard struggle, we chose NOT to support her decision to be with him, told her she'd have a place with us if she ever saw things for what they were but we would not enable that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was EXTREMELY hard for me. It hurt me really bad, and still does. I've struggled, but have come to a point where I feel like I'm ready to leave the situation behind me and move on with my life. She hasn't reached out to me or been apologetic or regretful in any way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom has been still keeping tabs on her. We know my sister is living in a homeless shelter. My mom checks the arrest records and often finds either my sister or her boyfriend. She checks the updates on my sister's Facebook. She calls hospitals and sometimes finds that my sister has been in for an OD, a psych stay, etc. We know my sister has had a child, which has been taken away by CPS because the dad broke the child's rib.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have come to a point where I do not want to hear about all the horrible things going on in her life. I'd like to move on, but it hurts me freshly every time I hear about what she's doing. I KNOW it hurts my mom deeply too, and she cares so much. However, when she finds something out about my sister, she tells me what's going on. That makes things hard for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo recently, for my own best interest, I asked her \"Could you please stop telling me all these bad things happening? It really just makes me sad every time you bring it up.\" She stopped talking instantly. I could tell that I hurt her feelings. I know I'm her main confidant about this because I'm the one who understands the most. But it's really hard for me when I'm trying to move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for hurting my mom's feelings to preserve my own? I want to help my mom, but I think it's not good for her to be keeping tabs on my sister. I feel terribly guilty and wish I could un-see the look on her face when I made that statement. But I really thought it was the best thing for me...",

      "description": "I (28f) have like 5 or 6 people I would call my close friends. I got married in March, and moved an hour away from them. I work full time and I'm in my last year of my Psychology bachelor. My husband and I pretty much fit in an hour or 2 of TV per night, but the rest of the day, we're doing things we have to do. \n\nWhen I first got married, one friend called me selfish and said she felt used because I was always available before I got in a relationship and never am now that I have my husband. I did reduce seeing her alot more after I got engaged, mainly because things started getting alot more hectic with uni and I was in and out of a few jobs, dealing with bipolar disorder, newly engaged, studying, and honestly, I actually realized how little time I want to spend on ALWAYS being available for other people. Previously, I had been extremely generous with my time, and I could no longer justify spending my time doing favours for others or doing things I genuinely don't like doing (like spending Christmas with her very racist family). I feel like, I dont get much time to do what I want (sometimes I just want to stare at the wall and do absolutely nothing for an hour) so when I do have some spare time, I would rather spend it by myself than sit with someone for an hour. I feel reenergized and feel like I get in contact with my inner self. \n\nOver the past month or 2, I've started resenting most of my friends, and only feel like I can actually tolerate one now. Everyone else just complains and makes me feel bad about me not wanting to drink (I hate hangovers), about me not going for trips (I really cannot afford to and even if I could, I'd go on a proper honeymoon with my husband), and not being there for them. Yes I feel bad but I am already exhausted with so much other crap, I can't fathom doing everything I used to do. \n\nAnyway i literally want to burn bridges now, cos I can't seem to shake them, but my conscience is eating away at me. AITA? ",

      "description": "About couple of months ago, I mentioned to my friend that I'd like to start going to the gym, but I don't really know what I'm doing. He said he'd been looking for a gym buddy himself and offered me to go with him.\n\nWe started going together a couple of times a week or so. Often we'd meet up for breakfast or a coffee before or after. He was much more into it than I was, and would go without me more times in the week, but I enjoyed it as a fun thing to do together as friends.\n\nOver the Christmas / New Year period he went away for a few weeks and we fell out of our routine. Today I messaged him and said I need to get back on it. He replied saying he \"doesn’t see a point in going with anyone anymore\" and because I can't keep up, it means he has to spend longer (\"2 hours instead of 1.5\") than he would if he went by himself and that it's annoying to have to change the weights over (because obviously he can lift more than me).\n\nI'm pretty upset about this. It feels like he's saying I'm not good enough for him, and that hanging out together, while also helping me out, isn't worth the extra 30 minutes a couple times a week. It's especially painful as it was his idea to begin with, and he was so blunt in saying this - it's not like he said \"look, I think I need a gym buddy more at my level, but let's do something else together some time\" - it's just like \"nah, I'm done with you now\".\n\nAm I justified to feel hurt here, or are my expectations unreasonable? AITA?",

      "description": "I’ve been dating this girl for about a month now. We met through a shared interest...to keep it vague I’m going to say that we met at a generic sports game. I’m 21 years old and she claimed to be 19 and actively attending college. No real warning signs fired off from the get-go, she was built like an adult, she shared my interest in video games, she had a TikTok account but I knew girls my age who were obsessed with it, she told me she loved me after maybe a week but I’ve dated plenty of girls who say “I love you” freely and carelessly...I’m not sure if I was just a blind dumbass but to me this was all pretty normal for people our age still shaking off their baby fat.\n\nShe was pretty open with her mental illness from the start, which didn’t really scare me off too much as someone with bipolar (I usually mention it early on as well as to avoid people I date accusing me of hiding it from them). She mentioned being on suicide watch on and off, I actually took comfort in knowing she was being treated and had people supporting her who knew to help her out and keep her from hurting herself when shit got hard, no real red flags for me there either. The fact that she was open about her mental illness and seemed pretty normal on the surface didn’t really scare me off too much.\n\nShe still lived at home, as did I at 19. Her parents routinely invaded her space, as did mine at 19. She talked about school and how much it stressed her out but how disappointed her parents would be in her if she dropped out. Perfectly reasonable to me.\n\nThings never really got too close for us, we kept just missing eachother since she was attending school and I work on-call. The worst thing that happened between us was that she sent some risqué but fully clothed pictures my way. Either way, I didn’t really know too much about her personal life, we mostly just talked about our interests and not about our personal business. \n\nTonight, she texted me, saying she didn’t think she was going to live much longer. I tried to calm her down to the best of my ability, talking her through it while heavily recommending she call a suicide hotline or go to the hospital if she felt like she was in any danger. She started to get into how much she hated school, then she said something along the lines of “I have two years left, i really want to go to university but can’t if I drop out”. That was the moment where things finally clicked in my head and I realized both that she was lying to me and I was the densest fuck on the planet for not realizing it. I continued to calm her down, until she told me she felt a little safer. Not wanting to sleep on the fact that she just told me she was actually 16 or so for one second longer than I had to, I said I couldn’t ignore the fact she just admitted she was a minor to me and broke up with her over text. I was deeply uncomfortable with the concept of waiting to bring it up at a later date, so I did it right then and there, then immediately started screenshotting the whole conversation and scrubbing the internet if any evidence we were ever together. I didn’t block her on anything because I wanted to be there for her, but I went out of my way to delete everything that involved the two of us together.\n\nTl;dr I broke up with the girl I’d been dating in the same text conversation where she told me she wanted to kill herself because she admitted to me she was a minor and I couldn’t ignore that fact until she was more stable.

      "description": "Hi guys,\n\nMy art school running this competition every term, and the students can submit entries. If you among the chosen 12, you get some store credit and website posts. When I was at school for the first term, I was kinda excited about it, but then I found out that only one guy (co-founder) is judging the whole competition and it really depend on his personal taste. \n\nAfter that I feel like it is more of a \"who can please this guy\" more than a competition that suppose to inspire or boost our work. So I kinda against investing time into it. I still submit my stuffs in and even won 1 time, so I guess it is okay.\n\nThen my fellow classmates start investing heavily in it and kinda ignore the more important courses. And I saw people who were sad or rage when they did not get selected by that ONE single guy, while the other classes' work and finals were half-abandoned.\n\nSo from that on to now, to people who I befriend with, I usually advise them to do the best work for themselves and their own education, not to win the competition. Most of people I talk to understand what I am trying to say and take my advise. Until today I kinda casually talked to a guy I know for a while and he was visibly upset, his face turned red when I said I don't give a damn about that competition.\n\nHe told me that if we win, recruiters from art studios may look at the website and hire us. That he could be famous and people with know about him, good for publicity. I told him that if it is that easy, why do we need to present our portfolios at the end, and there is also career day when you can talk to companies' representative. Most of them I talked to want to know what can be contributed to the company, not just only the stuff that get made here for homework. \n\nAnd on the other hand, what if we win, what if we didn't win, who cares. We are here to learn, get educated, and learn from the best artists, not to focus all the time and resource to impress one guy that solely judge on his personal preference. And he countered me with \"the guy has been in the school for years, he knows better\" and I told him that yes, but that does not mean he does not have a bias taste.\n\nThen I concluded to him by saying: Do your work as best as you can, but for yourself and your own good, don't do it for a guy or a competition. There are more than that in this environment and the experience you get from participating all the classes are way more valuable than a website features and a few coins.\n\nI think I was a bit too harsh on the guy and I feel like I shouldn't say it after all. I apologized for being rude and told him that is what I feel like and he can make his own decision.\n\nThen he calmed down and we started talking normally again.\n\nI just don't want to see my friend gonna walk down that destructive path and broken when they dont achieve what they want.\n\nAITA?",

Everything was going fine until randomly my exclaims that someone who is an ex-convict will being stay with us for a few weeks &amp; that they'll be here tonight. I want to make one thing clear before continuing about the housing situation. I living in the house with my name on the lease, the electric bill is in my name, &amp; finally the gas bill is my name. I've also pay rent each month.  I don't live on my family an we all contribute to the house. So naturally I was upset that I couldn't be informed before hand. It's not that I don't want the person at my house. I'm perfectly happy to open my doors to someone who needs help. It's fact I was treated like I have no say in what happens in my home. When trying to tell my mother this I was lashed out at &amp; told I'm a selfish SOB. I once agian reminded her that I don't mind the person staying over. I was then once agian cursed out this time told \"I don't have a say and this is her motherfucking house.\" My sister the entire time agreed with her. Saying \"It doesn't mattter.\" Reddit I'm very open when it comes to admitting when I'm wrong &amp; willing to apologise if so. Please just let me know AITA? \n\nTLDR; Got in an argument with my family about someone staying with us suddenly unannounced.

      "description": "Yeah long romance mushy story time. I was in a terrible time in my life. I had been dumped out of an unhealthy relationship, lost all of my friends, when about two months later one reached out after coming back from a summer camp. We talk for a few weeks when my depression got real bad I told him I was transgender (ftm) and scared nobody would ever love me. He said \"well I do\" and that's how we started dating. \n\nWe had been dating for like five months, he was very supportive. I think I would have killed myself without him. He would stay up with me, help me with what trans issues he could.  Then I noticed how skinny he was. Neither of us where very physical people and we where not interested in sex so it took a while, I always knew he was skinny, but this was a level I'd never seen in person. Slowly I noticed how he never ate. I finally asked him if he had an eating disorder and he said \"depends on your definition, but I don't want to talk about it \" in the year we dated I tried to help, he opened up a little, but never really saw a problem with the way he was living. Said he would try to change but that lasted for a week. Refused to see a therapist. He was over six foot and weighed maybe 110. Skinniest person I've ever seen outside of a war zone. The statistics on people with eating disorders who don't seek help are very not good.\n\nHe used to have a drug/drinking problem, but beat it before we dated. I didn't care, I think it made him more attractive in a way. Showing that level of self control, the ability to beat your demons, shows a lot of character. In college thought he started getting into it again, almost ever weekend. He said he was having fun, and it wasn't a lot so it was okay. I told him addicts don't get to do \"just a little\".\n\nThat summer I moved a few hours away and I think we saw each other three times in the last four months. That's when I noticed I didn't really miss him when he was gone, so I called it off. I still care for him deeply, we just where not right for each other romantically I guess.\n\nHe asked to stay friends, I told him I couldn't watch him go down the path he was going down and unless he seeked help he wasnt going to see 40 years old. I couldn't watch that happen. He said he was fine the way he was living so I ignored his message and never texted back. Haven't talked since.\n\nHis roommate called me telling me he was talking about killing himself a week later. I gave him his brothers phone number to call and said I was sorry but I didn't know what to do outside of recommend professional help.\n\nHe's still going down the path he was going down last I checked, but he's still alive.\n\nWas I wrong for breaking up with him when he was in trouble, when he stuck by me during my time of need? It wasn't the only reason we broke up, but he needed me. I knew after months of trying that he wouldn't listen to me, but maybe he would have. ",

      "description": "Backstory on the people and location - Long time friends of mine and my wife (known her 15+ years, him since they've been together) stay with us occasionally. They live several hours away. We know this couple well, have traveled with them, my wife was in their wedding, etc. Overall relationship is very good. Her parents are in the same area as us, but have a small house that is at capacity and not convenient for them to stay in so they usually stay at our place. We have a guest room with a nice bed, they have full use of a separate bathroom, a driveway where they can leave their car without blocking us in, etc. We go out of our way to make sure everyone has what they need. Last trip, they brought their baby and we had a portable crib set up and rocking chair in the room. The bed in question used to be mine but wasn't used much after my now wife and I moved in together as she had a larger bed. Many friends and family have slept on the guest one recently, including me occasionally - no complaints. It was quality when I bought it, not some cheap \"it's only for the guest room\" bed.\n\nSo, the wife in this couple comes out for the weekend to go to an event in our area. We repeatedly offer the guest room, but she declines each time and stays with her parents. I figure since it's just her and she had no car because she flew in, etc. it was just easier. My wife had dinner with her one of the nights she was in town. I wasn't there, so I'm hearing this third party, but it's from my wife and I believe the details to be true. This person informed my wife that the real reason she didn't stay with us is because this bed is \"so uncomfortable\" and her and her husband couldn't stand it the last time they stayed with us a few nights as mentioned earlier. I thought this was pretty audacious to bring up about free accommodations even if what she was saying was accurate. She then proceeded to show my wife texts FROM THE HUSBAND encouraging her to bring up how bad the bed is! My wife arrived home around 10:30 that night and told me about it. She felt bad (scratching my head over that reaction). I nearly hit the ceiling. I thought it was incredibly rude and ungrateful, not to mention completely false. If anything, they have a hardness/softness preference that this bed doesn't meet, but that doesn't make it a bad bed and sure as shit doesn't mean I should have to do dick to resolve it.\n\nTo further complicate matters, my wife informed this person that we have another mattress in the basement that is unused and maybe they could try that one. Sorry, but there is no way I'm moving a mattress up two flights of stairs in the off chance that it \\*might\\* be acceptable for people who stay with us maybe 6 nights total in a year. On top of that, I'm not inclined to do anything besides make a hotel recommendation after this load of unappreciative bullshit over what is essentially a free and very convenient, safe, and quiet place to stay.\n\nAITA here? Thanks.",

      "description": "My ex played soccer in college and all through elementary and middle school. Fun fact but women's soccer is actually the sport most prone to concussions, not american football.\n\nI was my ex's first intimate relationship, but im a few years older than her, so I have had my fair share of ex-es that could be considered crazy. Like half the posts in this sub could be them. This girl had all negative stuff of my past, more \"normal\", relationships -- the yelling, the passive aggressiveness, the shittalking to friends during fights (girls tend to do this during fights more than guys). It also had some of the crazier stuff I've already been through too --- the pathological lies, the suicidal threats, the cheating etc. This is all stuff that may or may not happen in a relationship but is not necessarily a sign of brain injury.\n\nWhat made this relationship different tho is the way this girl would argue. Of all the things, it was her thought processes during arguments that set off alarm bells in my brain. It wasnt crazy like in an emotionally-sporadic way, it was crazy in like a psychotic-delusional way. She would legit take everything I said and twist it into the worst way possible, but it was in ways that made no logical sense whatsoever. It got to the point where just as a test I could literally agree with everything she was saying and she would still twist my words to keep the fight going somehow. I'm telling you, it was like the words that came out of my mouth were not processed on the other end, like she couldnt fathom on a cognitive level what was happening. And it got to the point where some days i would basically just sit and watch her argue with herself, where I would seriously wonder if there was any possible thing I could say (even if it wasnt how i truly felt) to get her out of this mood. \n\nWhen she moved out (after a big fight where that strategy I'd been using went horribly wrong) she spread a bunch of rumors about me that weren't true. I mean that sucked but it does seem like something that happens in relationships occasionally. What made this different was that her dad actually reached out to me to say that she \"wasnt the same person anymore\" and that he hadnt talked to her in 3 months. So yea, all that stuff about the suicidal partner was happening here -- I couldnt defend myself to my friends and even my family (she reached out to them too with her weird manipulative delusiond) without risking her offing herself. I guess that's not relevant tho.\n\nA CT scan wont diagnose CTE by itself, but it could be really, really useful 3 years from now to show that the brain has changed over time. That's cause CTE is a degenerative disease.\n\nI'm wondering how I can bring this up without her thinking I'm trying to antagonize her somehow...? I really feel like i care about her a lot as a friend and I am worried about her brain cause she's smart af too...  I doubt I could even show her this thread without her assuming the worst in me. But it would be worse if she somehow thought I was being clingy or like I want to get back together.\n\nI waited a few months and we had our first friendly convo yesterday so now is a good time I think.... \n\nA lot of the threads in this sub are about \"how you say it\" not \" what you say\". I think this is the most precarious \"how you say it\" situation possible because it is a legit crazy  person here and i dont know what to do.\n\n\n",

      "description": "Okay so long story but bare with me.  Last week I had a one night stand with this girl, we’re both around the same age bracket (early twenties). I’ve never really hung out with her just the two of us as I know her from a mutual friend and I’d usually just speak to her when me, mutual friend and the rest of our friend group were together. I always found her extremely attractive and thought she carried herself well as most girls, including some in our friend group act like complete whores with no self respect, so this shy, timid and cute girl was a breath of fresh air to me. It made me instantly want to strike up something more intimate with her and as we got talking more and she became more comfortable with talking to me in person and on social media we quickly became close and started flirting.  \n\nFlash forward to a few months later we’re sexting and all of that crap so finally last week we agreed to hang out at my place while my parents were out, pizza, movie the usual schlock. Quickly we were making out on the couch and I thought it’d be best to carry on upstairs incase someone walked in earlier than expected. The sex started off great, honestly I don’t know if it sounds creepy but she had this whole innocent, pure vibe and it got me so fired up that I was afraid of climaxing earlier than I usually do. We began doing doggy and everything was going great until half way through, she farted while I was inside of her (sorry for the detail but yeah) and it wasn’t just a little silent pop, it was a loud trumpet sort of sound and I had to stop because my erection immediately went down. She starts looking confused and asking if everything was okay, I tried to just play it cool and pretend I was tired but I think my attitude put her off because I couldn’t keep eye contact with her (honestly I was just so grossed out I know I sound like a douche but I’m just being honest) \n\nI told her eventually what the issue was and she started crying and apologising saying it was a mistake, I felt bad because she looked really embarrassed but for me personally I couldn’t carry on or try again with sex after that, I felt pretty gross if I’m being honest so I ended up asking her politely if she could leave and we’d hang out again some other time. She didn’t say anything and just got dressed and went downstairs waiting for her cab, I didn’t go down and wait with her because I had to jump into the shower and by the time I got out she was gone. I haven’t spoke to her in the past week since it happened and I feel pretty awkward about even trying now as I feel there’s no point. ",

He  is the only one in our relationship that has a car and a drivers license.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was cooking chicken parm today, I was making marinara for the dish and had made, what I thought , was enough. cut to about 2 when I began to batter and fry the chicken, about half way through I realized I didn't make enough sauce. My fiancee walks in and I ask him \"would you please go to the store down the street to get some jar sauce please?\" he said \"I can watch the stove while you go\". I tried to tell him that I needed to keep frying and asked him once more if he could go. He repeated that he could watch the stove. I got irritated and said please once more but when he huffed out a \"fine\" I gave up and just ran down my street to get the sauce. I came home to the oil on, nothing in it, and him washing dishes. I said \"hey\" and asked why the oil was on. \"oh, I didn't know how you were frying things so I just let it be, but I watched it to make sure the oil wasn't burning.\" I said ok, feeling a bit agitated, but I just wanted to get shit done. \n\nThen he said \"I think I did well since I was going to get the sauce even though I didn't want to leave\" Admittedly without thinking, I responded \"yeah, cuz I asked you to get it 3 times to get it babe\" in an Irritated tone. He stormed off into our room and we have barley talked since.\n\nTL;DR: my fiancee is upset at me because I was irritated he made me walk to the store so I could finish dinner.",

So I always had a crush on this girl, we went to school together but she thought she was too good for me. \n\nA few years later we wind up working at the same place. She’s more down to earth now and seems to have been humbled a lot, but she had a man and still didn’t seem interested in me more than platonic friends.\n\nFew more years later, she marries a guy that I’d slowly became friends with. Few months into the marriage they’re having problems and I, for some reason, am the person she goes to with their problems, but I tried to stay as neutral and objective as possible since were all friends now. \n\nAfter they divorce she goes to Florida for a year and finds herself. He proceeds to party his ass off and bang every chick that looks at him twice. \n\nAfter she’s discovered herself she moves back to a town about an hour away and starts seeing him again. He sleeps with someone else after a couple days and she comes to me with it again. I’m there to listen but make it very clear that I am neutral in this. She even said something about a bunch of his friends trying to holler at her, which I did not, till a couple days ago.\n\nThat’s the gist of the back story. Out of the blue her and I started snap chatting and exchanging a few pictures and before long were talking about hooking up. If I do it I’m not gonna tell him about it but if he somehow finds out I’m not going to lie to him. She’s his ex wife, divorce is final and long set in stone. \nHe also has a girlfriend now and I keep thinking about the fact that he had her back and cheated agains. To me, he made it clear that he didn’t care that much about her to begin with but I’m still a little torn morally. \n\nInput much appreciated!",

I scared her.

      "description": "So first post here, I'll keep it brief, all names are fake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am just moving out of a 3 bedroom house with two roommates but one's girlfriend is a close friend of ours and just lives with us as well since she never goes home due to a bad roommate situation. so I'm moving into a 2 bedroom apartment with the one roommate, who we will call Bill, and the other roommate and his girlfriend will be moving in together who we will call john and sally respectively. John and sally are able to move in to their place a couple days early so they plan to take advantage of it. What this means is that they move out before the weekend while bill and myself have to wait until the end of the weekend. so there will be a two day gap between our moves. We planned about two weeks ahead about where moving trucks go, who is able to hep who, who cleans what, etc. Due to my busy schedule i am unable to help them move on the Friday because i had midterms, and big projects due, we all spoke about it and agreed it was fine (bill couldn't help either since he had to leave for work in the morning). building up to the move out date for john and sally, bill and i help move some of his stuff to the garage just do it was easier the morning of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn/sally's move out date arrives and bill wakes up to go to work but helps them move some boxes first. I however had to continue studying and working on the projects in the morning before my bus arrived (i was in the house, i just was working on the things we spoke about on my computer). They asked me to move my car so there moving truck could pull up which i did but afterwards i went back to my school work. Later that morning when I'm at school, cramming for my midterm, i receive a text from John saying that he is pissed at me for not helping him move, i responded with telling him sorry but i had to work on my schoolwork. he then refused to respond. i later found some my moving boxes were crushed and destroyed. the text really fucked my mindset up before the midterm so i decided to post it here for some piece of mind.\n\nso reddit,\n\nAITA for not helping him move the morning of.\n\nP.S. i do not expect his help when bill and i move out in two days, don't know if it is worth mentioning.",

      "description": "Hi all, I'm so confused,first post.\n\n\n\nBackstory: for the past few years I had suffered from a really bad depression. Now at age 20, I'm feeling a lot better and I'm able to move on with my life, college etc. I go to college about 4 hours away from my hometown and honestly I wanted to go farther. I hate the town I grew up in due to just my experience there. When I come back there it just puts me in a bad mood and my family doesn't make it better. My oldest sister (24) has bad anger issues and when she's angry I get the most of it. My mam is also dealing with a lot of bad stuff right now and it's safe to say she is not mentally okay. I seem to be the only one to notice and I try to help her by suggesting counselling and other methods but that's all I can do.  I find it hard to stay at home for long periods of time for these reasons.\n\n\n\nWhat happened: I'm off of college this whole week. My best friend is about to go on placement for college and I won't be able to see her until September. Because of this, she was going to visit me in college and I was going to visit her. We planned to get drunk, dance and generally have a good time (note: this is legal as I'm for Europe ;) ). She came to visit me a few weeks ago (which is the first time I saw her in months) and I was going to meet her today. Everything was set until mam this morning decided that I was no longer allowed to go. 1- I am 20 and 2- this has been planned a while ago I can't just cancel. I got angry about this and asked her to give me a valid reason and I would drop it. She claimed I had study to do because I was so busy with study yesterday (spent 5 hours studying). I don't see the logic but idk. She then drops on me that I am affecting her mental health. I was honestly floored by this statement and made me extremely upset. I then finished the argument by saying 'fine I'll leave and won't come back until the semester is over'. (1st of June for me). I think I went too far with that statement but I honestly think it's the best option for me at this point. I did not get to see my best friend at the end of it all.\n\n\n\nSo am I the asshole? I honestly have no clue at this point.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading!",

One instance of their excessive PDA is when 9 of us were having brunch, and they were kissing (and really going at it) while we were waiting for food. In a smaller group, they are slightly more tolerable but still try and sneak in a few kisses when the rest of us aren't looking.\n\nOne of my other friends approached them about their PDA in public, and the girlfriend snapped back that it's not her fault that he doesn't know how to show affection to his girlfriend. I have brought the PDA issue up with my best friend casually, and he plays it off as not a big deal. I did not push the issue because he is well aware of the group's concern.\n\nFor my birthday in September, I want to go interstate with 2 other couples (not including them) for the weekend to celebrate. I don't really want them there. They would know about the trip, and they will probably be upset and think I'm the asshole for not inviting them.",

      "description": "I am heavily involved in the music department in my school. I am a quad player. We have our own specific drum for the season, and we (the percussion section) came to an agreement that we can all store a few items we use day in and day out on our case for our drum. \n\nBecause I am also in a chamber ensemble, and in a Jazz ensemble, I put my guitar case on top of my quad case, then I put my hoodie, stickbag, and wrist braces on top of the guitar case. I have tendinitis and neuropathy in both wrists, and throughout half of the building, the climate control is broken so in the northeast during the winter you need to keep something with you.\n\nProblem arose a few months ago where people would start taking my stuff and hiding it way up high or in someone elses stuff, or hanging it from a flagpole. The problem really escalated when someone literally stole both of my wrist braces and a $50 snapback that I was using for bandcamp those weeks. I have not gotten those items back. I replaced the wrist braces, and left my stuff. The bass player in the Jazz Ensemble then started stealing my cables and using them for marching band activities in the front ensemble, which with the cold and moisture, completely destroyed two of my Hosa 25ft instrument cables. Then last week, he stole my (new) wrist braces, and was wearing them on his sweaty ass stank ass fucking feet (just socks on) and while I was getting that shit sorted out, he got someone to take my macbook that I was using for arranging jazz pieces for other ensembles probably 20 seconds prior. I got extremely pissed off, and I began yelling and when someone told me to calm down and that it is a joke (that they were part of, with stealing my laptop) I decked him.\n\nEveryone that was part of this thinks I am overreacting meanwhile I have lost $150+ in property (2 25ft inst. cables, 2 wrist braces -$60-, and a $50 snapback) and have not been able to leave any property of mine where I need to be able to access it.

And just in case I am not being clear enough I care so little about you that you could get hit by a bus right in front of me and I would just keep walking.\" \n\nThis is again a lie, as I cared enough to come up with and practice this speech in my head in preparation to this inevitable confrontation.

And says \"I'm coming back later you F'ing wet bag\"...\n\nSo reddit... AITA?",

I work as a stock boy at a grocery store and about two months ago the store hired a special needs worker through a government program, let's call him Bryan. I was usually by myself on Saturday nights (3-10) but over the past two months or so I've worked every Saturday with Bryan. I do prefer working by myself and hold no hate towards him, but lately the Saturday manager has been placing us on different aisles to separate us because he understands where I'm coming from and agrees that I work better alone. Today at work, however, I heard from that manager that Bryan was going around telling people that I told him that I hated him because I never wanted to work with him. I absolutely never said that and my manager agrees with me. Apparely one of the other managers is \"changing the way she thinks about me\" because of this. I'm always nice towards Bryan and have never said anything to offend him. I treat him the same way I would treat anyone else I work with. So am I the asshole?",

My parents are both really excited but especially my dad.\n\nHe has always wanted a grandchild and has already bought, built, and offered more stuff for the baby than all the rest of the family combined.\n\nNow he and my mom aren’t together anymore. And he is much more in my life than she is as she moved  several hours away when she remarried.\n\nMy due date is just a few weeks away and he asked me who all would be in the delivery room. I told him just my husband, and my mom. He seemed kind of hurt by this to my surprise.\n\nHe asked me to consider letting him be in there too even if he stands off to the side. I told him I’d think about it but honestly I’m pretty uncomfortable with the idea of being exposed in front of him like that.\n\nBut I understand how hurt he might feel especially since I am letting my mom in. I’m considering not letting her in either just to eliminate that factor. But on the other hand I would like her in there for support and I don’t feel the same discomfort at the thought of her being in the room. \n\nIt’s compounded by the fact that he has been way more involved during the pregnancy than she has.\n\nSo, AITA for letting my mom witness the birth of my baby but not my dad?",

      "description": "So, I'm currently having a depressive episode in my life (not depressed, just ocassionaly catch the blues), due to stress, hormonal, college basically sucking my life out through a tube... you know, the usual.\nIt's been holding me for some time now, meaning I can't focus so much on studying (I am a procrastinator but during high school I procrastinated during the day, and studied at night, now, I can't do even that).\nThis morning, I woke up ready to study. I have an exam coming up on Tuesday, and it's from the only class I actually like and makes me happy that I started this faculty. \nMy sister comes to visit and leave my niece and nephew with mom so she could look after them while she goes to the hospital for whatever the reason was.\nI start studying, full motivation, full concentration. \nAbout 20 minutes later mom calls me to look after my nephew so she could start making lunch.\nMy sister said she'd come back about in about 40 minutes.\nSo I said to mom no, I'm studying. The child is a wild one. He can not be left unsupervised cause he makes a mess out of anything and everything. So I wouldn't be able to just take my book sit with him and occasionally glance what he's doing. No, full on observation so that he doesn't kill himself and everyone else in the house.\nNo response.\nSo, after about 15 minutes my sister comes back, and mom starts going around the house and I remember I wanted to explain to her something that she didn't quite understand and is regarding the field in which I'm studying. So I go out eager to explain it to her and she scoffs off at me, saying that I'm just looking out for my own ass when I said I couldn't come out to look after my nephew.\nIt kinda stung. I told her I was studying and she says I'm just looking for my own ass, even after she torments me every day to study...\n\nAfter that I go back to my room, kinda crushed and definitely boiling inside. I stop studying due to zero motiviation, and just spend the next hour or so basically doing nothing. I tried, so many times to get myself to study but all the motivation I had just vanished. \nShe comes knocking on my door (they were locked) and asks me to go to the store. No big deal, I wasn't even doing anything productive so a walk might help out.\nI go to the bathroom to get myself ready, put on some make up etc.\nAbout half-way through, she knocks on the bathroom door and asks if I'm gonna come out soon. I bacially say 'kinda' meaning not immediately, but also not gonna take me another 15 minutes. I couldn't be precise cause I was doing my eyeliner so if I mess up I gotta start again.\nShe scoffs off at that again, and I kinda lose it.\nCome out seconds later not caring if my left wing was lower than thw right and ask her had I ever dome anything or said anything that she approved of, liked, praised me for. \nSister tries to intervene but I just don't give a damn. \nI tell her how I had to study and breaking my concentration meant I'd have to go through everything again cause I need to repeat and rehearse. Tell her how she killed my motiviation etc.\nShe scoffs off saying that I'm just a lazy brat who spends my evenings playing games (I sit around 9pm and spend my time in front of the PC till 11pm) and then wake up late in the morning (around 11am usually). Then I spend about two hours doing nothing (her words not mine) after which I THEN decide to study (she implied I had the audacity to study during tje day if I play games late at night, I'm translating and transcribing at the so I didn't know how to explain).\n\nAnd I just sit there in front of the door dumbfounded.  Like, what am I supposed to mother? Not study during the day so I can be open to your every bidding? I didn't know slaves were back in town. She goes sarcastically 'Yeah haven't you heard?' \nTo which I reply something along the lines 'Then go buy yourself one, cause you sure as hell didn't birth yourself one.'\nShe's ofc already pissed as hell, saying that I have no right to talk to her that way and that she wouldn't tolerate any of the shit I'm saying to her. That I should learn respect yada yada yada\nI tell her that her issue with me is not lack of respect but rather that she doesn't like the fact that I don't give a damn about it when she's not giving me the same back and treating me like I'm less than her. That the problem she has with me is that I am gonna talk back and not just tolerate every shitty thing she throws at my way. \n\nOn the other hand,\nShe had to take care of an unruly toddler, a crying baby and a hormonal teen while she herself is going through some issues. I think she woke up with a headache but looked completely fine afterwards, we talked normally while we ate breakfast, before all this happened I had gone to use the bathroom and she asked me to hold the baby so she could also go to the bathroom and change her clothes, everything was fine up until she scoffed at me for studying and saying 'kinda'.\nSo Am I the asshole?",

She claims that it’s hard to find a job cause she’s at a disadvantage to people who speak Swedish fluently? I guess that’s true but if she just worked harder on learning the language it wouldn’t be an issue? She also claims that moving away form her family to a country where she only knows me and my family has been a major anxiety for her and she had a hard time getting comfortable here, makes sense but shouldn’t take that long to get over it. \n\nNow she’s thinking about going back to school (online) to improve her chances of getting a job but that won’t bring in money enough to provide as much as I do? So what’s the point? - I want her to stop being lazy and using excuses. She says she wanna find a job and that she’s tired of being home alone but I don’t believe that. \n\nTDLR: girlfriend has moved in with me a year ago (different country) and I am annoyed she hasn’t found a job yet and she keeps complaining about it.

      "title": "AITA for telling my bf his sister is not allowed at my b-day party?",
      "description": "Sorry for long read, TLDR at bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: To say that my bf F and his sister is close is an understatement. They are always talking/texting, and he's always talking about her. I had thought this was a positive quality, b/c I appreciate partners who are family-oriented, but I feel like K and his sister go overboard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example they text each other quite peculiarly. Online when they post new photos on Instagram and Facebook they will comment on each other's pictures saying, \"wow, looking hot/gorgeous here!\" or something to that extent. Also, when they end conversations they will text each other something like \"g2g, I love you ❤\". I am an only child so I am not sure if this is common but I've never observed anything like this with my friends that have siblings. I have made a comment about it in the past saying \"Wow, you and your sister are really close!\" F responds, \"ya, we've been through a lot!\" So I just dismissed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this all kind of got to me a month ago after F's Sis moved into town to look for work (she just graduated after studying abroad). She is constantly hanging out with us - I don't mind hanging out with family, I understand Sis doesn't have any local friends, and of course I want to get to know her more. But I don't like how she will comment on F and I's relationship or gets oddly defensive about him. An example is that when I ordered takeout for F, she jumped in and said, \"don't order that, F doesn't like that. Do you even know him?\". Or the other day when we watched Avengers and when Thor came on the screen, she said, \"You better not cheat on my brother for someone like Chris Hemsworth!\" ???? These are a few examples and there are other times she has made these comments and behaved this way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think one of the things that did me in was when we were hanging out with mutual friends playing board games. Me and Sis were sitting on the ground by the board game coffee table and by F. Suddenly out of nowhere F starts giving Sis a back massage. There was a girl at the hang out that was friends of a friend, and she had commented \"Aww, you two are really cute! I wish my bf gave me massages!\" At this point F says, \"Oh, she's my sister!\" I cringed at this and I felt super embarrassed. The girl says \"oh, you're a really good brother then!\" And everyone dismissed it (but me in my head) and that was the end of the interaction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy birthday is coming up and I asked F if he could not take Sis to my birthday party. I skirted around it at first when he asked why and F ends up telling me that Sis has no reason not to go, and besides, all our mutual friends like her and she will feel left out if she doesn't come. I tell him it's my birthday, I can invite who ever I want. F responds, \"well, you tell her that she's not invited then if it's that important to you.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the point I tell F that his relationship with Sis is weird. F asks me what I'm talking about and asks me to prove it. So I ask him for his phone, as I want to start by showing him the way he texts her. I'm scrolling through the messages for examples when they tell each other I love you and I see that he texted her about a small unrelated argument we had. She texts something like \"you can find someone better\" and that really pissed me off. Of course it's normal to tell siblings about relationship problems I guess but I'm offended by her saying he should break up with me on top of other compounding reasons. I blow up on him and tell him about the \"I love yous\", the weird compliments online, their weird \"too close\" behavior (like giving her a random massage around friends), and the way she patronizes me. F gets really mad at this point and tells me that if his Sis isn't going, then he isn't either. He doesn't get what I'm trying to say about him and his sister, he loves her and cares for her it's normal for them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking this way, and not inviting my bf's sister to my party? I feel like I am, I feel like I fucked up badly  but I really can't shake off the feeling of me being uncomfortable my bf and his sister being too close, am I just jealous and in over my head about this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know and give me your criticisms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: I felt like my bf and his sister are too close, didn't want her at my b-day party, pretty much insinuated incest between them when I was at my worst and now everyone thinks I'm an asshole.**",

      "description": "So I've been friends with this person Lyndsey for a couple of years now. I've been roommates with her, and have been a combination of mom and nursemaid- I've woken her up in time for classes, advised her on her truly terrible dating choices, listened and sympathised whenever necessary etc.\n\nShe's highly irresponsible, and constantly makes her parents worry (they live far away and she's their only child). She never picks up their phone calls, and they ineveitably call me to ask her whereabouts and how she's doing, and to go find her and give her the phone to talk to her.\n\nI didn't really mind in the beginning. But this reached a point where they used to disturb me when I'm studying, or sleeping, early in the morning. They handed out my number to her grandparents as well, and now i started getting calls from multiple people. I tried being polite about it and telling her that this isn't working.\n\nStill, there was no change in her habits of being unreachable all the time. Finally I ended up blocking all their numbers and telling her to grow up. \n\nShe then went to another mutual friend of ours, Jess, and asked if she can give Jess' phone number to her parents, as I'm no longer available.\n\nI cautioned Jess that she's now going to be pestered with calls all the time, and will have to be a live location tracker of Lyndsey's. Unfortunately, my roommate heard this and walked away. Later I found out that she called me a real bitch for insulting her parents.\n\nAita here? Should i try fixing things?",

      "description": "So earlier this year I almost committed suicide. I got the help I needed and throughout the semester felt better. I took my medicine and didn't feel so depressed or anxious.\n\nHowever my RA started to become a bit overbearing. I found myself no longer being able to feel really sad or angry without my RA panicking that I was going to hurt myself. Just normal moments of sadness would be interpreted as severe depression. One day I was having a really pleasant lunch outside. Just having some me time, when my RA demanded I meet her ASAP.  I go and it was just her checking up on me. I found this to be too much and very annoying. I tell her Im fine and we go on our way.\n\nAt the end of the semester I cried when my roommates left. We had grown close, and it was the last time we'd be together. It was very emotional for me. I'm a very sentimental guy. And it's just natural to cry at endings for some people. But my RA once again thought I was severely depressed and a danger to myself. And tgis really ruined the moment beyween me and my roommates. It was heartfelt, raw, and honest. She sent me a message that night, and I didn't get it til the morning. Basically she wanted to make sure I was alright. It was graduation day, so I didn't respond until the next day.\n\nI basically said \"I understand and appreciate you're concern, and it's what makes you a good RA, but it is unneeded in this case. I cry when things end. It's just who I am. Please don't link every time I'm emotional to my anxiety disorder and depression. It's honestly more damaging that I can't just have a normal cry without people thinking I'm depressed or suicidal.\"\n\nShe never responded, and I feel kind of bad. I don't like snapping at people. Should I feel bad? AITA?",

      "description": "Ok, so I am living with my grandparents to look after them. My uncle occasionally would come back here to stay and God knows what illness he has as he would often shit on his pants when he is outside. \n\nHe would return home, enter the toilet, change his pants, and carry the shit filled pants around the house to the kitchen to put it in the washing machine, expecting someone else to wash it for him. However, while walking to the kitchen, the shit would drop out of his pants onto the floor. Because my grandparents are too old to bend down to clean, I usually end up having to be the one having to clean it. This happens at least once or twice a month and has been ongoing for months. My grandmother refused to speak to him about it no matter how often I asked her to. \n\nSo this happened again today and I was angry. So I told my grandmother that as he is her son, I think it would be best if she spoke to him about it and make sure he cleans up after himself (it's kind of rude in my culture for a younger person to approach an elderly directly to tell them to do something). However, she insisted that he wouldn't listen and there wouldn't be a point in telling him off. I then told her that if she is ok with it, I would approach him to tell him to clean up after his shit. But she got angry at me for suggesting that and said that i was rude. \n\nI told her that somebody has to let him know that he can't bring his shit home and expect me to clean it up for him and wash his pants for him. She then replied asking what is wrong with helping him clean his shit. At this point I just said \"someone has to speak to him, it's either you or me\".  I then walked away to avoid anymore confrontation. Was I an asshole for asking her to speak to her son regarding this incident? ",

      "description": "My roommates came home with some mutual friends/acquaintances. We drank for a bit and eventually all who remained were me and a girl who has made it pretty known that she is into me but I am not very into at all. She insists on sleeping in my bed despite me kind of hinting I'd rather her sleep on my couch in another room. She doesn't seem to get the hint and says we should watch TV in my room. \n\nWhatever, I lay down opposite her in my bed and turn on Netflix. One thing leads to another and I drunkenly allow her to feel me up. Things start to get handsy and, admittedly, I am into it briefly. Halfway through foreplay, however, I make it very clear that I am not interested and stop the encounter. I fib a little to soften the blow and say that I don't like to do things with people I am not dating and emphasize that we are both drunk and that this isn't fair to either of us.\n\nDoesn't seem to bother her but she asks if we can at least cuddle which I reluctantly oblige to for a short amount of time before getting up and going to the couch in the other room where I am now, unable to sleep and wishing I could have my bed back. \n\nI feel really bad about the whole thing. I shouldn't have let things go as far as they did, but when you're drinking, poor decisions are made. I am glad we didn't have sex but am upset I let things go as far as they did. I feel especially bad knowing that she is going to probably be upset about this because things did NOT go any further.",

      "description": "So this friend of mine (lets call him Vlad) is getting married in 2 months. Invitations only arrived about a month ago. He is not having any bridal party and no best man (neither is she for the record). He's a very indecisive guy who tends to go along with whatever is going on but never leads and rarely makes his opinion known. \n\nAnother friend of ours (Miguel) setup a group chat between 5 of his friends to plan his bachelor party as a committee of sorts. After everyone cited interest, after a week no one added anything resembling a plan or idea. I took up the reigns and thought of an idea (vacation house in the mountains with some activity during the day like paintball) and a weekend. Everyone said they were down. \n\nI message Vlad and squeeze out of him that he wants about 10 people max and weekend long only. No week long party with 30 dudes. I ask him for who he would like to invite; we have a large group of old frat guys which could easily reach the 30. I get no answer. I message him twice more every 2 says. He says he's busy and will let me know. Nothing. I message his fiance to ask him to send me invite list so I know who to invite and make sure people can make the weekend I suggested. She agrees. No response from him. At the suggestion of Miguel, I compile a list of 10 guys and send it to Vlad to add or remove as he wished. Adding that time was a factor. 6 days later, no response.\n\n2 days ago I find an amazing house with indoor pool, sauna, hot tub, fire pit, secluded, enough space for everyone, and at an unbelievable low price that I negotiated with the owner. I call Vlad and tell him that I really need an answer. That I'm not asking a lot from him but this is important and urgent. I tell him I need an answer by 8pm that night (so that I can honor the incredibly generous price I got for the house, I don't tell Vlad this). He agrees. No answer that night. Next day, no answer. \n\nI vent to Miguel who reaches out to Vlad and gets an agreement on the weekend I suggested and agrees to the invite list I compiled. Still not a word to me. \n\nAt this point, I'm still going to go to whatever bachelor party gets planned but unless I'm asked to do something specific (please bring X, Y,Z, call to schedule this or that) I'm going to take a very firm back seat. I feel slightly bad about it but c'mon, I feel like I put my best foot forward. We're all busy with our own shit, he was asked for something that takes 1 minute of his time. AITA?",

      "description": "Okay, so before you go off the title for my judgement, there’s some details I need to explain first. \n\nSo my best friend from home and I have been talking to each other lately and He knows that in my current situation, it’s very difficult for me afford anything right now. I’m currently attending college, have no job or meal plan, so food can be very scarce. He’s even come and visited me seeing how much I struggle. However, every once in a while, he’ll offer to send me money (about 40), just for an emergency. But I’m always declining because 1. I don’t want to owe him any money, and 2. As much as a good friend he really is, I don’t want to take his money because he has his own stuff to pay and deal with. So I don’t want to be a burden to him. I’ve tried to apply for jobs. But unfortunately no luck as no one wants to work with my school schedule. I have to save the money I currently have however to pay for my rent. \n\nNow recently I’ve been able to budget, but my rent is due soon so I’ve been going extreme lengths trying not to spend money. I bought a bunch of groceries to last for a month, but believe or not, my roommate at everything with the span of a week. He said he would try and get SOME groceries, but he doesn’t get paid until next Friday. And I ate my last batch of food this morning for breakfast. Now I can probably hold off till the weekend, but it’s going to be very difficult to do considering it’s barely the middle of the week. The best I can do is wait till my roommate gets paid, or at the very least wait till my parents come visit me next weekend and for them to restock groceries for me, as they always do whenever they come visit. \n\nIt’s getting really difficult to eat one meal - two meals a day, and honestly I’m kinda thinking about asking him considering this is looking like a definite emergency. If I don’t get groceries soon, I’ll basically be doing a water fast until I get more food. But at this point, I rather have a roof over my head then be able to eat. ",

      "description": "My dad (68m) recently came to visit me (31f) and my wife (32f) for two weeks. We have two cats: Roger is a male gray tiger, and Tommi is a female that is all black. Dad, for the entire two weeks, would call Tommi “he” or “him”. In these situations there was zero ambiguity about which cat he was referring to, as Tommi would be right in front of us and Roger would be off sleeping somewhere.\n\nAt first I would correct him passively. For example if he’d say “He’s a mischievous one” I’d say “yeah, she is pretty rambunctious”. Often after this, dad would say something along the lines of “yes, she”, indicating (to me) that he saw his mistake and wanted to correct it. As days went on and he continued to make this mistake (often multiple times a day, even after getting it right a few times), my corrections sometimes became more direct. He’d say “He has such a high voice” and I’d just say “she”. He’d respond “yes, she”. Sometimes I wouldn’t correct him at all, but the majority of the time I did.\n\nThere were times that he seemed to be either drilling her gender into his head or showing me he could get it right by unnecessarily mentioning her gender to her. Such as “you’re a sweet little girl cat, aren’t you Tommi?” Or “you’re the queen girl cat in this house, aren’t you Tommi?”\n\nAt one point, I asked him why he thought he was having issues with Tommi’s gender, and he said it was because of her name. There are women called Tomi, though I will admit that it’s more commonly a man’s nickname (Tommy).\n\nThere is nothing mentally wrong with my father, I should note. Also, I don’t think he’s the asshole in any way. But am I the asshole for continuing to correct him, two weeks into him making the same mistake?",

      "description": "I (26M) was doing the dishes after cooking dinner for my SO (42F) and our two boys (3 year old and an almost 2 yr old).\n\nShe asked if I can watch the kids so she could take a break and relax. Since I was in the middle of doing the dishes I was hesitant to drop it to go watch the boys as the dishes were piling up since over the weekend. I continued to do the dishes and tried to convince her to reconsider. But she got upset at me and left. I didn’t say anything rude to her, but she kinda cussed at me a bit.\n\nI continue for a few minutes then decide to stop. I just finish off a few more plates then  I go to our boys room but now my SO is kinda giving me the silent treatment. After a while she tells me that , “I needed your help and you wouldn’t help me” I tell her that I believe washing dishes is harder (or at least a bigger pain in the ass) than watching the boys.\n\nWhen I watch them they pretty much just play with their toys and watch some TV. But I guess it’s different with her, as the younger one keeps trying to go on her to breastfeed and the older one likes to climb on her. \n\nShe tells me she’s had a hard day at work and just needed some time to relax. She said she was cleaning other parts of the house while I was cooking. She wants a sincere apology, but I don’t feel like I did anything wrong at this point.\n\nAITA for not dropping what I was doing to assist her?\n\nSome background info: We both work full time jobs and contribute equally financially. In terms of house work we try to split it, but admittedly she does a bit more than me (it’s about 60:40). Trying to keep the house clean is pretty challenging while we’re both working 8-5 with two small kids. I don’t want to downplay her struggles as she does get less sleep than me as she breastfeeds at night while I sleep like a rock.\n\n\n\n",

I was alone in the car with a friend/coworker who has as a part of her job to drive me and a bunch of other people back and forth to a hotell and the place where we work, as there are too many assigned to the same tasks.\n\nI have told myself to be as honest as possible with all of my friends whenever I can be so I took this opportunity to tell her what some of the others co-workers have said behind her back.\n\nShe got visibly upset about it and the silence during the duration of the trip was deafening. I had only attempted to clear my conscience (not denying this for one second) and to be honest with her.\n\nAita for telling her about what some people have said behind her back whilst I was simply trying to be honest with her? I have a gnawing sensation that I fd up when doing it and simply got a feeling of guilt. I did apologize to her but she said that I shouldn't have apologized.\n\nTl;dr: was truthful with a friend and felt bad about it afterwards",

I really look forward to living with her.\n\nHowever, she has a problematic dog (that pre-dates our relationship, if that's important). The dog was a rescue and was physically abused by the man who owned her before, leaving her with a serious (albeit justified) hatred of men. She will bark at and go to bite any man she sees, and isn't social with other dogs. The only time she really 'behaves' is when my partner is right there telling her to. She still barks continuously at guys and lunges at them, myself included. I'm prepared to work on this as I know with enough time and effort I can get her to trust me, but what happens when my dad comes to visit or I want to have a party, and my father or my guests can't even go into the yard for fear of her hurting them.\n\nThe dog is a staffy so she's more than capable of delivering a bite that could seriously injure a human. I've voiced my concerns to my partner briefly, but she just seems to think with enough time her antisocial dog will just become a social dog.\n\nAITA for not wanting her dog to move in with her if she does?",

      "description": "So my wife and I (both late 20s) were recently married and this is our first chirstmas together as husband and wife. We have a tight little family even though my daughter is from a previous relationship but we are a super close little family. I work two jobs (one job 4 days a week 9-5 and the other involves weekends) all year round and she is a teacher. So spending time together doesn't happen too often but when it does we make the most of it. \n\nHer family are going through some things (her step dad is cheating on her mum and every one is trying to be cool about it (another story altogether)). So step dad is spending time with his piece on the side at new year.\n\nSo my wife, her (2) sisters and her mum have planned to go away between christmas and new year, leaving me and our daughter (which again we can do stuff together no problem, I'm a pretty hands on dad). We don't have our daughter on christmas day, so instead we are having christmas day on boxing day and we have her right through to the 2nd Jan. But my other half does charity work and will be feeding the needy on boxing day night (our chirstmas day, I should add that I have no problem helping the needy whatsoever but I see this as our family time and there are other helpers in the charity, this part is selfish I know). So she'll be occupied on our christmas night then is away the day after for 3 days with her sisters and mum. \n\nI've brought up that I wasn't keen for her going away at that time but she got annoyed and said she needs to support her mum. But historically I feel like my other half feels responsible for her mum's happiness through this ordeal even though she has two sisters, one older and one younger, all adults and yes I'm there to be supportive to but I feel like this whole thing that everyone is brushing under the carpet is making life more stressful and affecting our little family life.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to spend time with my family? Should I just get on with it? I feel like maybe IATA but I dunno.\n\n(In addition to the affair thing, I'm not needing any advice on it. I've tapped out of the whole situation regarding that and I'm just there to support my wife when she needs it)",

Also, I work with one of my best guy friends maybe that's relevant I'm not too sure. I don't drive and today my boyfriend offered to give me a ride home from work. Since I get out late (1am) and my dad doesn't want me taking the bus home that late. So when I finally get off work, my boyfriend isn't there. And one of the most recent texts I had from him was him saying he was going to get there \"a little early.\" No biggie. My guy friend is there, and he waits with me because his friends are still closing up. I call my boyfriend twice, leave a voicemail, and text him 3 times. No response. \n     So I'm waiting around and I ask my guy friend if he would please give me a ride home and he asked where my boyfriend was and I explained that he wasn't answering. My friend said he was going the opposite way but that he would wait with me. So we waited a bit and then there was no word so my guy friend took me home. I texted my boyfriend and let him know. I assumed he went home and fell asleep because he did that a few days ago when he was supposed to get me and me calling him woke him up. Anyways I get home and after I've been home for an hour my boyfriend texts me back LIVID. Saying he was already on his way when I said my friend was taking me home. And that he was waiting for me. And I am so confused. ",

      "description": "Context: Yesterday was my girlfriend's birthday, I've been hyping it up a lot as I spent an entire day finding the perfect gift, made a cake for her, and sent her a birthday message. First thing I see her everything's good.\n\nWhere the problem begins: So first class is science class, there's a lab due. I have most of it finished, she has half of it, I saw her stress and decide to help her out with one question that takes a lot of time to do. Then I finish my own packet and ask her if she wants it, she replied:\"It's too late and I can't read your handwriting\" but I didn't hear that part, I only heard:\"It's too late\". So I don't do anything for the rest of the class period thinking she doesn't want my help. I still see her struggling at the end of the period so I decide to help her when she was finishing up. I heard :\"I could've used some help\" muttered under her breath, then she further blamed me for not helping her out. Next class I get a sarcastic text message regarding if I finished my lab, I don't see it as sarcastic at first and justify my actions from what I heard. I continue to defend myself until she just told me to forget about it.\n\nThe Main Problem: It really bothered me considering that she could just blame me out of nowhere like that and get away with it, I'm irritated on the inside.\n\nWhere the problem gets worse: Later in the day she acts completely different to me actively ignoring me, telling me I shouldn't speak after saying I had a rough day in general with not specifics and that she's not going to let this day ruin her day. I was conflicted between being nice to her since it's her birthday and frustrated that she just decided to act inappropriately to me. Turns out she expected an apology out of me, so I did it out of guilt but before I asked why. It was so bad I ran to my favorite teacher and  poured tears out of my eyes struggling to get a word out of my mouth when asked what's wrong. I was writing how I felt the entire day claiming her treatment to me is unfair  and sent it via messenger, and only got responses like:\"How Dare You\" and \"You've got the nerve\". All I wanted was an apology, and it just seems like I couldn't get it no matter what I tried to do. Was forced to apologize to her parent. Finally she told me that she had a great birthday without me, I have no common sense and not to expect good things for my birthday when it comes.\n\nWhat stings: That all my hard work, preparations and presents got nothing more than monotone responses of:\"thanks\" \"wow it's beautiful\", it feels like I spent hours on that for nothing. How could anyone be so blind to their own wrongdoings and not even consider the other side? \n\nWhere am I now: \nI consulted with some online and IRL friends, teacher and parents all have concluded that it makes no sense for me to be treated that way. Dunno what's gonna happen",

      "description": "Idk if this is the correct place to post this, delete if not appropriate. \n\nSo I ride horses and own one of my own. I’m super close friends with my riding instructor. She’s taught me 90% of what I know about riding, and she does a great job. I’m very happy with my lessons with her, and plan to continue taking lessons with her. But the downside? She only teaches Western riding. (For those who don’t know much about riding, there are 2 main disciplines of horseback riding. English and Western. Some of the basics are the same, but the tack/equipment used and the sports in each discipline are very different. Western, think rodeo/barrel racing. English, think show jumping horses and dressage) She doesn’t know a thing about riding English. And most of what I want to do in the future is English riding. For a long time now, I’ve wanted to get into dressage, jumping, and HUS (hunter under saddle). She can’t help me with any of those things. \n\nOne time, we were talking and she was telling me about a student she had that had asked to be transferred to a different instructor. She said “I don’t really mind. But if *you* ever asked to be transferred to a different instructor, I’d take it personally. I’d REALLY take it personally!” I assume because I’m her most loyal student and we are such close friends. I just kind of smiled and didn’t think much of it.\n\nHere comes my situation... I am finally at a point where I think I’m ready to learn the English style of riding. And we have a well respected dressage and jumping (as well as just English in general) instructor that works at our barn in addition to teaching at her own barn. So I scheduled a lesson with her at her barn. (Chose her barn because we only have one English horse at my barn, and he isn’t fit enough to jump. And my own horse is older and has primarily been ridden Western all her life. Her barn has many seasoned horses experienced in jumping and dressage)\n\nI take my lesson from the new English instructor next week. I take a lesson from my regular riding instructor the week after. So it’s not like I’m ditching my original riding instructor and transferring! I just want to take lessons from an English instructor in addition to my regular lessons. But I’m absolutely terrified I’m going to hurt my friend’s feelings or greatly offend her! I haven’t told her yet, but I *need* to. I just haven’t seen her in person yet, but I plan to tell her before my lesson. I want to take lessons from both of them. Am I being horribly selfish? Is this wrong of me? AITA? Please help!",

      "title": "AITA for smacking the shit out of my 8-year-old nephew for stealing hundreds of dollars of my Pokemon cards and taking some of them to school and trading with them?",
      "description": "Little bit of backstory: I really enjoy Pokémon and play competitively in tournaments and open a shit ton of packs. Doing this means I have a very large collection of valuable cards. I still love at my parents house (I’m 18), and I keep them all on a shelf in my room. My nephew is 8, almost 9 and he and my niece is living with us because my sister abandoned them for some druggie on the streets. \n\nAnyway, a few days ago I got home from work and was wanting to edit one of the decks I had built for the tournament later in the day. I go to pick up a few deck boxes and a binder and found that one of my binders, and 3 of 9 deck boxes were missing. I immediately freak out because I have them all very organized and well-kept. My nephew has **a lot** of behavioral issues and gets in a lot of trouble both at home and school. He also isn’t ever really disciplined because it would make the situation worse(you’d understand if you met him and my family). So I go into his room to look for them. Lo and behold, there they are, scattered all over the floor, most of them taken out of sleeves, some bent, some of them was thrown in his backpack—oh and my binder was completely empty. At this point I was *beyond* furious and all I could mutter was “ Oh my God” over and over. \n\nAfter I pick everything up that I could find, I go upstairs and casually bring him back down to his room and then start screaming at him, and demanding him to find the rest of them. He kept saying he didn’t do it and he didn’t steal them, that they were in his room when he woke up and he thought they were his (keep in mind he lies about *everything*). So I get even madder if that’s possible and I smack the shit out of his leg. Then he starts screaming bloody murder and my nstep dad comes down and demands to know what’s going on. I couldn’t even get a word out before the child went up to him and said I was trying to kill him. My nstep dad coddles him and then gets in my face and threatens to beat me to death if I ever lay another finger on him. \n\nAfter they question him for about an hour, he finally admits that he took them to school and was trading and giving them away with his classmates. His punishment: a stern warning and no tv for the night (which he screamed and cried over). He also said he hates me and wished I would just move out and die. My parents then berated me for a while and essentially told me that I’m a child abuser and if I did that again they would have to call the police and have me charged with assault (mostly my nstep dad saying this, my mom understood what I did and didn’t make it a big deal). All in all I recovered most of the cards losing about 20 out of 250, but with all of the damage that was done to some of the cards I probably lost about $180 of cards. \n\nSo am I the asshole in this situation? Was I overreacting by disciplining him because my parents don’t? I get that it’s not my place to do that, but I completely think that it was deserved and I honestly feel that I should’ve smacked him again. He goes back to school today and I have already contacted his teacher and explained the situation; thankfully, she’s going to confiscate every Pokémon card she finds and let me come in after hours to find which ones are mine. Sorry for the lengthy post but I needed to vent my frustrations. AITA? \n\nTLDR: nephew went in my room and stole approximately 250 valuable cards while I was working; I get home and find out and I smack the shit out of him. Then I’m threatened to be killed/ be turned into the police for assault the next time I put my hands on him. ",

I told the GM I had full availability and was available for full time hours. Fast forward to now and my average shift I have there is 10-12 hours. Very long, and draining but I get it, the industry is unpredictable. However I am in an online class for school and am struggling to keep up with it from pure exhaustion at work. So I requested an availability change. \n\nI requested to only work four days a week, whatever days the manager wanted. However I noticed today my request was denied and I was scheduled for 5 days once again. I sent her an email inquiring about it but I know she will mention that I told her I was available full time when hired. \n\nMy dad owns a restaurant and says it bothers him when people tell him they are available fully during their interview then change their availability once hired. I totally get it! It is not what was agreed upon when hired.\n\nSo AMITA for changing my availability?\n\nAlso, my GM is extremely passive aggressive and I am very nervous to go to work tomorrow.

For now, admittedly, I'm just enjoying my habit a lot while waiting to get insurance.\n\nMy girlfriend insisted I quit now, because my potential health problems give her anxiety and because she also has to do things she doesn't like because of me, like go to work (???). \n\nReddit, am I the asshole in this situation??",

Whenever my grandparents come to visit from outside the country, they stay with us, and I'm usually the one to give up my room for them to stay in, and I sleep in the extra bed in my sister's room while she is at her college. They come visit for medicine and better healthcare, as the country they come from has shit healthcare. \n\nMy privacy is one of the things I value the most, and I usually stay in my room for most of the time that I want to be left alone (which is a lot) where I can do my work, or just spend my free time. Since I don't have that privilege anymore, I'm forced to either spend that time in my sisters room, who complains about me all day, or spend time in my living room, where somebody is always watching television or talking on the phone. Any type of noise usually throws me off and I can't focus at all, and have been irritated just living in my own house for the last two months. They were supposed to go back to their country earlier in the month, but my grandfather sustained a leg injury and couldn't walk. They had to reschedule their flight for another month until he gets better. \n\nMy grandmother apologized to me for the inconvenience a few times, and I told her it's fine, as there is nothing I can do about it and I wouldn't want to burden her with knowing my discontent.

But I always feel like I am taking his decisions, so I didn’t say anything this time. I joined them though, while they were smoking and everything seemed fine. But after the blunt kev started vomiting and just got very pale. He basically didn’t handle the weed and was so high he couldn’t really think straight. \n\nI then told him to go home, which he did but overall I feel very guilty for letting him smoke in the first place.

I'm sure I'm going to fall short, but I'll give it a go.\nMy husband of well over a decade is about to deploy. This past weekend may be his last weekend home. His grandmother recently passed away. We (me, him, our daughter) attended the services on Friday, almost 3 hours from our house. When he and I moved in together, he hadn't talked with that set of grandparents in years. Nothing happened, they were just never close, and weren't big talkers, so it just happened. I made it a point for him (along with me and our children) to reconnect. We have spent an important holiday with them every year, for over 15 years. Including when he is deployed. I still take our kids to see that side of the family, even if he's not with us.\nSo, we go to the services, get home, and change into pajamas. I had mentioned 2 weeks prior that friends from work were meeting for dinner that night, but DID NOT say a word about it that day. He says \"you can go out.\" I ask if he's sure, throw some Jean's on, and head out. \nThe next day, we were supposed to take our kids to a Mardi Gras parade. This had been planned for weeks. I got up that morning, made breakfast, prepped, and arranged to pick up my daughter's friend. Then he said he and my son would just stay home. My daughter, me, and her friend drove down, had a great time with my aunt, sisters, and nieces. After the parade, we went to my friend's mom's house. Kids had a great time goofing off and eating ice cream.\nI started to get tired, so I texted my husband that we were going to drive back to my Aunt's. A 10 min drive vs. A 1 hour 30 min drive. He never texted back.\nNow he is super pissed at me. I can answer questions with more detail,  but this is the gist of it. ",

      "description": "Hello! Long time reader first time poster. TLDR at the bottom\n\nSo I'm (22 M) currently a senior and this prank took place freshman year of college. A little background about me, I chose a University about 5 hours from home and no one from my highschool went here, therefore I was placed with a random room mate. \n\nMe and the room mate (we'll call him bird) hit it off instantly and become great friends, so at the end of the year we decide to celebrate our friendship by wreaking havoc on our other friends with a slew of pranks around April fools day. The pranks ranged in complexity from simply covering one friends room in toilet paper to staging a fake argument over the entirety of a week that would ultimately culminate in a fake fight with fake blood. \n\nAll of the pranks had gone well and the last of the pranks, which turned out to be our crown jewel, took aim at our good friend G. A little background G had been having sex with this girl and confided in us that one night, when he was drunk, the condom slipped of his dick and he was terrified he had gotten the girl pregnant. The strange part about this fear was that he hadnt even managed to cum from the sex so there shouldve been no worry (this turned out to be important later on). So as our last prank of the week, we decided to use a throwaway number from google voice to give him a call from \"the pregnancy clinic.\" Bird made the call and, although I dont remember exactly what was said, the conversation was something along the lines of \"(Name of the girl he fucked) just got in results that she's pregnant. She wanted us to give you a call and inform you that you're the father. Would you be willing to attend appointments with her?\" Note all of this was said by Bird in a pretty bad British accent to throw him off the scent. Also note that this call was made ON April Fool's day. Much to our surprise he bought it hookline and sinker. His tone became resolute and solemn, saying that he would step up and become the father he was meant to be. We reveal our prank and have a great laugh.\n\nLater that night G comes into our dorm looking very down. He confides in us that we tapped into one of his greatest fears. At the time he received the call, he was in the dining hall and had a mini panic attack. He said everything began to spin and he blacked out contemplating the call he would have to make to his mother to expalin the situation. He ended up in the dining hall bathroom throwing up for a bit afterwards. He told us he would rather have been kicked in the balls. \n\nSo reddit AITA for being so damn good at pranks? \n\ntldr; Room mate and I went on a prank spree culminating in a fake call from a pregnancy center to another friend on April Fool's day, causing him to think his worst fear has been realized and have a mini panic attack.",

      "description": "A coworker of mine is getting married and I am the maid of honor. Two of my coworkers (we will call them Hal and Jenny) are attending the wedding as well and are in a relationship. Hal used to be good friends with my boyfriend and I, he introduced us actually as they have been friends since childhood. However, about s year ago I expressed to Hal that I felt Jenny was being fake when we went out with other people (which looking back wasn’t very smart and I should’ve kept my mouth shut but hey, hindsight is 20/20) and he took that the wrong way and stopped speaking to both my boyfriend and I. Jenny and I smoothies things over and have a fine relationship now but Hal has still held a grudge and does not speak to me. Up until recently he hadn’t been speaking to my boyfriend over but after my boyfriends persistent efforts to hang out again they finally did and things seemed to be fine...\n\nFast forward a few weeks and while I am at work and unable to talk to them, Hal and Jenny ask my boyfriend if they could book the flights for my coworkers wedding as a group of 8 with two other couples as they will get a better deal. My boyfriend says that he doesn’t care but it’s up to me and to talk to me first, however they don’t and just book the flight.  When I found out, I was mad because they booked the flight leaving on a day that my work explicitly told me I couldn’t leave on (as too many coworkers were already attending this wedding and we would be short staffed) and our return flights are the day after the wedding which I didn’t want to do because I didn’t want to have to rush, hungover, to the airport the day after the wedding. \n\nI calmly requested that they call back the airline and switch my flight but this became an issue and Hal told my boyfriend that I was creating problems and being difficult. Jenny then insisted to me that not only am I lying about the whole situation, but that my boyfriend is also lying and he told them to book the flight and they didn’t have to ask me (which Hal says is a lie and told my boyfriend that he doesn’t know why Jenny would say that to me.)\n\nNow, I asked Jenny for the flight info: departure time etc. and she said Hal sent it to my bf. I asked him and he said Hal did not but he’d ask. Hal says he doesn’t not have the flight info, but another co worker of mine does because it’s under his name and for me to ask him for it. Fine. So I ask that coworker next time I see him and he says that no he doesn’t it, in fact Jenny has it. \n\nAll of them have denied having any of the flight issue and I am afraid to ask further for risk of being shit on again.\n\nAm I being unreasonable for being mad? Am I the asshole in this situation? \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to go to my best friends wedding because I’m not a groomsman?",
      "description": "Some backstory to start with... we became really good friends my freshman year of college. We were inseparable and spent a lot of time together. Nick had been with his gf Krista for years at that point, high school sweethearts. I became great friends with both of them, and his gf’s friends. It was a really good first year of college. The next year of school we lived together in an apt. I winded up not getting a bid to his fraternity that year. It was a really big deal for many reasons, but its a long story. To sum things up, it really affected me personally and it changed our relationship. We started hanging out less, and I hated living in our apt which was basically an annex house for the fraternity... living there even though I wasn’t in it.\n\nThat year he graduated. We still kept in touch, and 2 years have passed since then. We talk intermittently, but to be quite honest with you I have put more effort in than he has. One weekend he said he was coming to visit, but then the alumni event for his fraternity got cancelled so he didn’t come. I asked him why he couldnt have came just to see me, no response. I texted him happy birthday a few months ago, no response. He didnt text me on my birthday either. I’ve asked him to come up multiple times since. No response. It sucks.\n\nStill, I consider him to be one of my best friends even though we don’t see each other that much. Krista told me while we were in school that he’s never been as close with a friend like me... I was one of his few best friends he’s ever had. The wedding is this summer and I recently got an invitation. I went to the wedding website, and he has 10 groomsmen. None of them are me. He could have at the very least given me a heads up and let me know why that was the situation, but he didn’t. Most of the bridesmaids I was pretty good friends with. His groomsmen... for the most part... are all people I know for a fact he wasn’t that close with. His best man is his cousin and I know they weren’t SUPER close.\n\nI think if I had gotten a bid to the fraternity the relationship would be different. It’s really sad. Its hard to put in perspective why it was a big deal on reddit, but it really was. I don’t think I can show up to the wedding by myself and not be involved. I would be extremely awkward, uncomfortable, and left out. Is it selfish of me to not attend? I just cant ignore how hurt and disappointed I am. \n\nIf I did tell him how I felt, I wouldn’t lash out with anger. I’d just tell him I love you, I wish you and your wife the best, however this is how I feel and I’m not coming\n\nTLDR; Best friend from college has failed to upkeep the friendship with me, but I have tried hard. He invites me to the wedding but doesn’t make me a groomsman even though it seems like it would be a given. Butthurt and disappointed, is it selfish of me to not go entirely?",

      "title": "AITA For Wanting To Break Contact With My Stepdaughter?",
      "description": "So, a little history is required. I met my ex-wife when I was 19, she was a little older than me and had a three month old. The father had done one when he found out she was pregnant, or so I was told but looking back on everything since I'm not overly sure what's a lie and what isn't. We were together for five years in all and married for one and a half. During this time I raised the little girl as my own and I'm the only father figure she knew and was aware of because she has only recently turned 6 and hadn't met her real dad until the last year.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago we went through a divorce. We lost a child together through miscarriage and it went downhill from there. She began to not really talk to me about things and seemed to be texting an awful lot. I tried to talk things through because even before the pregnancy we weren't really doing stuff together together. She'd go out with friends and I'd stop in with my step daughter. Then comes the bombshell that she no longer loves me enough and she loves someone else. 10 points to Hufflepuff if you guessed she'd been texting and was getting back with her ex, the one who dumped her pregnant and is my step daughter's biological Dad. I was left with 14K worth of shared debt in my name and having to move back in with my parents, sleeping on the sofa for a year because they didn't have a spare room and I had nowhere to go. \n\nThis brings me to recently. For the last year and a half I have still been seeing my step daughter every fortnight. Maybe an odd choice on my part but I had spent my early twenties raising this girl as my daughter. My ex has been fairly good about that but it's getting obvious I'm making things complex for her new situation and although she won't tell me I can't see my step daughter for fear of looking the bad guy I can tell she wants me to say it. She's lied to her family about our breakup and what she was up to (I found nudes sent and messages about meeting up in a hotel and she did go on a bizarre work trip out of the blue) and whatever she said has made them hate my guts despite the fact I supported a little girl who isn't mine and my ex-wife for five years (with her not working for two of those five).\n\nThe frustrating thing is, my stepdaughter's real dad is moving them both to Wales in the new year and we live in the Midlands currently. I'm still in a buttload of debt and visiting my stepdaughter regular would be problematic and they know that. It all came to a head last Sunday as an altercation took place between me and my ex's grandad as I was trying to drop my step daughter back home (until they move to Wales they're living at their grandparents). Basically he's demanding I pay back £1000 he gave me towards my car two and a half years ago which was never a loan. He said it was to help us out because at the time we were in financial trouble without a car and I needed to keep my job which involved a commute. He basically said you do enough for your wife and my stepdaughter and that was that. I said I wasn't comfortable with him giving me money and he just said not to worry. They now claim I said I'd pay it back. I said it was never a question of it being a loan until I got dumped and my ex left me in 14K of debt so am I getting 7K back? Apparently I'm a waste of space, he's taking me to court and went for me as he tried to throw me off his property. All whilst I was trying to say goodbye to my stepdaughter. My ex's grandad has never really liked me, he's bigoted and very opinionated and I was so thankful for their help at the time regardless of the circumstances. But now they keep using my step daughter and access to seeing her as a bargaining chip in their demands. When I said I wouldn't be paying it back as it was never a loan and I'd been left in a mountain of debt he told me never to show my face around the house again and that I was going to be stopped from seeing my stepdaughter as soon as she goes to Wales in February, he let that slip because he was angry and I could see my ex's face drop like he'd let it slip prematurely. She didn't say a word other than to tell me to leave when he started to get aggressive.\n\nI'm honestly not sure what to do. Whether to take this arguement as it and just decide now to walk away, stopping all contact immediately, or keep making the effort until they take my stepdaughter away in Feb. She's miserable because they bitch about me in front of her and start to argue with me in front of her. As much as I love her and I'm sure she'd miss me at first I think she'd be happier out of this toxic nonsense and as difficult as it is to type I think I would too. They've spoilt having her for me because there is always something else and now apparently legal battles and they seem to keep reminding me that she's not mine which is getting more obvious and difficult everytime I see her. Any advice would be appreciated, it's been a tough couple years that just seems to not be ending. The time of year is a big factor, for my own mental and physical health walking away seems the best thing to do but there's a six year old that never asked for any of this looking forward to the holidays and is doing it now cruel? Especially because taking this threat of never showing up again as gospel means I basically just vanish? Is vanishing better than speaking to her? How do you tell a six year old you won't see her again and her not get upset and think it's her fault, especially three weeks before Christmas? \n\nDespite the fact I was told to never show my face again and that they'd see me in court, my ex text me to say \"sorry bout that, not stopping you seeing xxxxxx\" as if to put the ball in my court and absolve herself from any guilt. I didn't reply and that was about five days ago. If you haven't guessed by this point she's quite manipulative and often finds someway of turning arguments around on me. I have to admit I'm not as eloquent as she is and it's frustrating because she's never proven wrong. I ring my stepdaughter on Sunday evenings by ringing her mum and her passing the phone over, would stopping contact now be the cowards way out? I'm considering blocking their numbers and just moving on. We don't live in the same town anymore but we still work in the same small town, I commute. \n\nTL; DR Wife left me for my stepdaughter's biological Dad who dumped her pregnant and hadn't seen his daughter in five years. Her family want to take me to court for money I don't owe them and my ex and stepdaughter are planning to move to Wales, not sure whether to walk away now and break all contact and stop being so damn nice (or a push over).",

      "description": "Worst breakup of my life happened three weeks ago. She lives (or lived) with me in my apartment and paid no rent since i have a job and shes a student. Dated for a year and a half.\n\nHad the strangest feeling she was two timing me with her semi homeless ex. So i follow her to class and YEP! She meets up with him. Confront her and she confirms shes been cheating on me for 3 months.\n\nCool cool. So now its time to get the fuck outta my life and apartment. I am nice and give her one week before she needs to leave. She begs for two months, NOPE. Also if that loser shows up shes out now and can call a lawyer i dont give a fuck.\n\nA week passes and she makes no progress. I guess she thinks im a good little cuckold who will continue supporting her. WRONG AGAIN.\n\nWhile shes away I take all of her clothes, her boxes, her jewelry cases, her armoires, and her tv and toss them off my balcony. Neighbors saw and i explained later. Also took her laptop and nicely tossed it onto the soft grass. Changed the locks as well.\n\nShe ended up dragging the shit into her moms van and got the fuck out of my world.\n\nTold coworkers, half think im a hero and the other half think im an asshole.

      "description": "So, for context, my bf (let’s call her Lisa) was going to marry her gf Sue in June this year. Sue has no family to speak of, no job and was delegating everything she couldn’t do (applications, dealing with paperwork, etc.) to Lisa, who also paid for everything. Nevertheless, Lisa trusted her and loves her so we, her friends accepted Sue and tried Toningenieure her into the Group.\nThey had a fight last week that ended with Sie saying she could not marry her anymore, although she couldn’t provide a reason. Turns out: Sue had been talking to and sexting her ex for months and lying to Lisa when she asked about it. When they had had an argument, Sue met her ex at a hotel to have sex while my friend waited at home. Telling her ex she couldn’t wait to f** again... you get the picture. The wedding has been called of, logically.\n\nSo Lisa kicked her out, picked her shit and told her to pick it um while she’s on a business trip.\nNow, they talked on the phone earlier, Sue cried her eyes out, saying it had been a mistake and she wanted to get back together. Now Lisa told her that she would think about it, setting some conditions. And then she asked me my opinion.\n\nSo I told her that it would be stupid to trust her again and that, while I understood that there are still feelings involved, she could not let someone with so little respect for her back into her life. Wochenende discussed this and Lisa said she wanted to give her the chance to make things right. I replied: „By doing what? UnF**** her Ex?!“\n\nTL;DR: my friend is about to let her cheating ex back into her life and singable her a piece of my mind.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for being that frank?",

      "description": "I've run a D&amp;D for a group of 6 players for 3 years now. I'm the DM as well as the host. One of my players Dan asked to bring his coworker Brian to the game. We agreed and Dan would help him out while he learned the game.\n\nFirst couple sessions went fine. I've played with new players before and I understand there is a learning curve with D&amp;D. Dan did a good job helping him fill out his sheets and explaining how to calculate rolls. All was well. Then after the 3rd session Dan was still helping Brian with almost every single roll or decision. Brian just either didn't absorb what was being taught to him or wasn't really listening and learning from it.\n\nI talked to Dan one day and asked if Brian was enjoying the game. Dan said Brian liked playing with us, but he didn't seem to care about the rules.  I explained to Brian that we really needed him to understand the rules.  Having to show him how to do everything each turn was slowing down the game and burning through our limited play time.  Brian said he \"just wasn't a rules kinda guy\" and I repeated that it was important for everyone at the table.  He seemed to agree and said he'd read up.\n\nWell Brian didn't show up for last week's session and Dan said he'd been badmouthing me and calling me an asshole. He also said I'd implied he was stupid for not knowing the rules. This isn't true.  Eventually the entire table got to talking about it and everyone agreed we were losing a lot of game progress because of Brian. Dan agreed to talk to Brian and try and smooth things over but make sure Brian knew we needed him to know the rules going forward.\n\nFast forward to this week's session and Brian comes. Everybody is in good spirits until we get into our first big encounter. Brian is right back to needing Dan to help him do everything again and the table's mood plummets. We end up ending the session early because two of the players want to leave early. Later that night I went into a group chat for our play group and asked if anyone would object to me kicking Brian out since he refuses to learn the rules and talking to him solves nothing. Dan objected saying we just needed to give him some time while everyone else agreed it was for the best. I explained to Dan that I'd given Brian ample time to learn the basics and that if he hadn't figured it out by now he probably never would.\n\nDan wasn't happy about it and said that if I wanted Brian gone it was up to me to tell him. I texted Brian and told him he was uninvited to the group since he refused to learn the rules and it was ruining the game for others. He responded telling me I was an asshole and that I could go fuck myself. Dan has been cold to me since so I am leaving him alone. Everyone else in the group agrees with the decision and while I still think I did what was right I feel like an asshole for kicking him out when he seemed to enjoy playing with us.",

      "description": "Couple friends of mine got \"conned\" into buying a Rainbow vacuum. It's a good vacuum, but it costs almost 4000€ (WTF?!).\n\nRainbow sells through multilevel marketing schemes, so basically to help pay for the vacuum they need to sell the vacuum to other people (\\^.-). Fair enough, I'm not going to spend that much money on a vacuum, but they tell me that by just listening to the sales pitch I'll help them get a discount on their purchase. OK\n\nMy friends are still considered \"in training\", so they shadow another couple that are already official reps of Rainbow. They all come over to my house with the vacuum and start their pitch....\n\nThey keep going on and on about the toxins in the air and basically all types of scare tactics related to health and hygiene... basically they try and make you feel like you're dirty and you live in filth. Things like asking:\n\n \"Do you drink tap water? Would you drink the tap water in this deposit if it were in glass?\\*turns on the machine to vacuum air, opens up the water deposit full of dirt\\* Would you drink this water now?! WOULD YOU?!\"\n\n\\*vacuums the couch, shows all the dirt that was extracted\\* \"WHAT?! Are you going to sit on the couch again?! aren't you disgusted?!\"\n\nAfter about an hour I'd had enough, and I said \"LISTEN This pitch isn't working for me!, show me the functionalities of the vacuum and don't talk about health statistics, I don't care enough about that and I'm not enjoying your tone\" The rest of the pitch became super awkward as I continued to criticise their approach (seems like their script doesn't adapt to \"difficult\" audiences)\n\n(also to clarify the \"health statistics\" were just ridiculously false, basically used to con people that don't know much about the world.)\n\nThe Salesperson started to tear up and deemed me a bad fit. I apologised to the couple that was pitching and to my friends and tried to make my criticism constructive. But I still feel bad that I criticised so harshly (and I really ripped them a new one). But I also feel I shouldn't have to put up with someone I don't know, coming to my house and treating me like a filthy idiot. \n\nMy friends seem to think I should have just grin and bear it, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for getting angry at my very close friend immediately dating my ex after me?",
      "description": "I know the title seems straightforward but please bear with me as there are alot of details. Also   \n\nI’ll start off by saying my buddy is B and my ex is E\n\nSo B and I have been friends since high school, We’re both 25.  B left for BC after graduation and didn’t see him until 4 years later when he moved back to his moms. We caught up and eventually started hanging out and becoming more like brothers.  \n\nNow he lives in a town about 100km from where I live,  and despite the distance for years i would drive up on a Friday night after work and hang out with him until Sunday evening.  At times when my other buddies would go out i would drive more than halfway to pick him up and bring him along.  He doesn’t drive so as for meeting up I’m the one doing all the driving.   \n\n\nNow when he moved to his moms,  he met a couple girls at his job and one weekend I was up we hung out with both of them.  One of them being E.   He became pretty good friends with both of em, but after the past couple years he’s really only kept in contact with E from time to time.  They would hang out sometimes but it became more frequent when i got involved. \n\nNow we’re at this past October.  Up at his place one morning I had matched with E on a dating app and she reached out to me,  from there on we started talking, more and more each day until we decided to become a couple.  B knows full well I’m talking to her, and during all this B ended up breaking things off with his then GF,  to which I withstood crap from E because I wanted to be there for B and help him out through what was a trying time for him instead of seeing her (During all this I would only see her on weekends as she lived in the same town as B). For 7 weeks in a row i drove to and from B’s place on the weekends to see both B &amp; E.  E however explained to me that B, when it was just them two one evening, confided in E that he had feelings for her.  This was while we were still dating mind you,  and she told me that she didn’t feel the same way.  \n\nHere’s where I royally fuck up though,  because I had a fling who also lived in that same town and one Saturday, both B &amp; E were working and against my better judgement we arranged plans to meet up.  At the time I guess i wanted to see her, but when I was driving to her place I couldn’t shake that feeling of guilt and backed out.  I know that it’s a real shitty thing to do, especially because I had it done to me once before.  So later that night she was going through my phone, unbeknownst to me and came across the convo with my old fling.  Of course she was upset with me, and as I’ve been honest so far,  I never felt like more of a piece of shit.  I really do have feelings for her and I answered every question she asked regarding my old fling.  We came to the agreement that we were still going to try and make it work.  I took all the shit she gave me and then some.  I even drove up after work on a Tuesday to see her to at least show her that I’m trying my best to make things better.  But sometimes your best isn’t enough.   \n\n3 weeks after my fuck up,  i was talking with her on the phone on a Sunday evening and she tells me that she can’t stop thinking about me and that fling.  So we agreed to “start over”.  Her words not mine.  \n\nDuring that following week,  i could tell she was just losing more interest everyday, and (i dont do it anymore) I saw on Snapchat that she was at B’s place pretty muc everyday that week.   On the Friday I’m driving home,  call her and chat for a little bit. I could tell something was up.  And after our call,  she then proceeds to ask me if I remember that night we talked about B and how he told her he liked her.  Then says that she doesn’t just like him “she’s in love with that idiot”.  Idk but i just sorta lost it.  I had to pull over because my head was spinning and I just wanted to scream.  I was under the impression we were “starting over” and not actually ending things. \n\nEverything I’ve done the past several years B has been involved.  We were inseparable, and I don’t have anyone else who I’m as close with like i am with him.  \n\nBasically that whole weekend and next week B doesn’t say boo to me.  In fact he acts like everything is ok.  I had to bring it up and he just asks “oh what’s wrong buddy? Is it E &amp; I? Does that bother you?”\n\nI lost it on him because yes it bothers me and how in the flying fuck do you think that it wouldnt.  I’m the kind of guy that wears my heart on my sleeve and he more than anyone knows that.  Or at least I thought.  Within a week when she told me about B they were already posting pics on social media and the like.  It really hurt my feelings,  not because she just up and leaves but because my buddy didn’t have a single shred of doubt that what he was doing was wrong,  or that I would be perfectly fine with them dating.  \n\nI can’t think of either of them without the other and it’s been constantly bothering me.  I told him that I don’t think I can come up to see him like i used to, and that i just need to time to sorta work this shit out.  He doesn’t seem to mind because he still is with her pretty much everyday now and he doesn’t reach out to me at all. \n\nI apologize for the block of text,  but i just need a third party’s’ opinion on this because I want to see B again, and hang out with him and his family,  because I’m like another son to them,  but I’m angry that he’d done something like that to me.   I wish he would have at least talked to me about it before,  it seems that they’d always had these feeings for each other but decided to act on it right after I date her.  Again,  I’m not wanting to downplay what i did,  i know it was wrong and I took a long look at myself and knew that’s who I didn’t want to be. But i also dont want to just pretend everything is ok between B &amp; I because this just hits me right in the heart.  B would be the the guy i go to whenever I had issues with a girl and now he’s become directly involved.  I still havent seen either of them and this was the week before Christmas this happened.  \n\nSo AITA for possibly not talking to B or hanging out with him again? Should I just try to come to terms with it and move on? I don’t know what to do\n",

For one, it's really cramped (I didn't feel comfortable walking into it, even with no furniture in it), and for the other, I would be the only one that would have to give up furniture to move there, since not one of the bedrooms can fit my 3 pieces of furniture (bed, PC desk and TV stand).\n\nThe thing is: my grandmother loved it. And when I said I didn't, I got treated like I was the most unreasonable person ever. When I voiced my concerns saying that I felt is was a cramped apartment and that none of the bedrooms could fit my furniture, all I received in return was that \"You could just get rid of your TV stand\", even though I have a need for it.\n\nSo, please, give me some outsiders insight.

      "description": "Obligatory sorry for formatting, on mobile etc. \nThis is eating me up inside and I know, yes I'm an awful person and should probably die in a fire  for having an affair at all etc. I want to finally put this to bed but don't know how.  I know i was an asshole for doing what I did but am I still one for not coming clean? \n\nI was married in the past and it was a mistake. We were young and it seemed like the right thing to do. We had 3 kids together. I'll call ex husband John. John and I were for the majority of our marriage more like housemates than partners. We lived separate lives, he was into video games and didn't like to go out and do much. We were together for 20 years but about 15 years into it I had a brief affair with a friend. It was a mistake, I regret it deeply and wish it had never happened but it did and I can't change it now. My husband never knew about it, the only people that know and me and my friend. I'll call the friend James. \n\nFast forward to a few years later and John and I break up. I guess you could say things came to a natural end. We're still friends and co parent our kids well with no animosity. We are both with new partners - he's currently living with his new lady, I'm in an LDR of almost a year and it's going really well for the most part. Let's call my new partner Karl. \n\nHere's  the problem. Late last year Karl was at my house alone. I was out working and he was on my laptop and took it upon himself to read some of my messages on  whatsapp desktop. He came across some old rather flirtatious messages from James, before Karl and I were together. Also when I was newly single James had messaged me trying to hook up again - and again when Karl and I started seeing each other and I shut that down. Karl knows he did wrong in  snooping but he has some trust issues as his ex left him for someone else. He asked me if James and I have a history. I panicked inwardly and said no. But now I feel I should have been honest but it's too late now to come clean. I am worried he will find out somehow. AITA for not telling him the truth?\n\n",
