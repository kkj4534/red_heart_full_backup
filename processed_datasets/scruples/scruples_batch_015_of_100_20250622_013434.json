      "description": "A little context, we live about an hour away and we like playing games on pc together since we only see eachother every other week or so\n\nWe were playing ranked Overwatch and I was already frustrated with him that day and he said he didn't want to play Overwatch anymore. Ok cool so I ask him what he wants to play. He says it's up to me. I tell him to pick something because I'm fine just sticking with overwatch. He says he doesn't want to play Overwatch but he keeps asking me to pick something else to play, and I keep saying he should pick because he's the one who doesn't want to play Overwatch. He says he just wants my input on what we play next and I tell him I just want to keep playing Overwatch.\n\nFinally he decides on Borderlands, and says we should stop playing and go to bed at 2, but he took so long to choose that it's now 1:45. So he wants to play 15 minutes then go to bed. I say we could have just stayed on Overwatch and played one more game or played for like half an hour or more if he chose something faster. \n\nHe says we can play another game of overwatch if I want but I'm just too frustrated with him so I just leave the discord call and go to bed. \n\nAITA for not picking something then leaving the discord call? I feel like I could have just picked something, but I just wanted to play Overwatch",

      "description": "I (32M) have went most of my life without much luck with dating/hookups with women. I've had very few, and seldom been considered a viable dating option. Now I was always in decent shape, well groomed, so it wasn't a hygiene or looks issue I don't think.\n\nThe only thing I have going for me is my job, which is quite good. Now here's the thing, I don't actually subscribe to any MRA, PUA or RedPill stuff, but it came to my attention recently. \n\nI came across this stuff recently and I can't help but SEE IT happening TO ME...I'm finding it very 'tempting' so to say, here's what I mean:\n\n- I've never had luck with dating, until recently where I've got more attention from women my own age. Some of the same women who didn't give me the time of day in high school/college, are now interested in me and have asked me out. This to me is a bit bemusing, but under ''RedPill'' theory, I would be the Billy Beta provider who she wants to settle down with since she spent her 20's going for ''Chad's''\n\n- Now I don't WANT to believe any of that, but many of those same women were doing exactly that when I knew them. Going for these bad boy types, could it be possible that they just see me as a ''provider'' that they want to settle with? I rejected those women who came for me btw, because I'm a bit bitter...I don't want to be anyone's ''second option'' that they feel they should settle with\n\nAgain, I know better than to blindly fall into such narrative theories but I ran this by my sister (35F) , and she freaked out. She said that the reason I've been shown more interest is because women know better who to date than when they're younger, but I don't feel that even addressed my question properly, so I'm still pretty much the provider? She said that I need to get away from these writings/theories as soon as possible and that I'm ''turning into a fucking asshole'' for even entertaining them. I was startled by this, I never said I believe them, just that I'm sort of...tempted by them? I guess it's like being ''tempted by the dark side'' in Star Wars, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "So, at the school I work at they have been doing lockdown drills by classroom in addition to doing it whole school. Every time it has been different.\n\nThe first time he came in to \"test\" my students and me, we were told to line up quickly because the \"shooter\" was on the third floor, and we had to evacuate. I stood at the front and walked backwards watching my students be very calm and quiet. We get outside, and it gets a little chaotic. I have a couple students who have autism, and one girl in particular had panicked and ran off to find the ESE teacher. When we got back, I talked to her about the importance of sticking with me. I told her it was just a drill and to not be too upset (she was in tears because she thought it was real).\n\nThe next time he did a lockdown it was the same class period. This time, he wanted my kids to line up against the walls when he came in. At this time, there were teachers or students hitting a steel drum to simulate gun fire and were banging on doors. The same girl that had previously panicked, crawled under a table and began crying. I talked to her real quick about how she needed to head to the other side of the room.  She runs over and literally dives into a pile of kids. After this ordeal, I had to talk to her again about how to react better. She apologized and has since gotten better.\n\nThis Friday is where I lost it. That morning the officer came by my room and told me he'd do a drill later that day. I told him that I had a child with autism that I have been working with, and if he could not visit that class period because I don't want her to miss out on state test prep because she's too scared, that would be great (it has begun to seem like he has been only picking this particular class period ever). He said he wasn't sure and that she needs to just deal with it. Later on, during this same friggin class (and during state test prep for a test on Tuesday), my door is unlocked by a master key by a teacher. In comes another teacher with an air horn that also blasts smoke, and she runs around the room. The student I had warned him about falls to the ground screaming in hysterics. I just glared at him while the teacher without the air horn comforted her. I was pissed. I was starting to feel like he was just picking on her. The teacher that was comforting the student saw how angry I was, and saw me walking toward the officer. She immediately got in front of me and told me to walk out and relax, and I did. I was nearly in tears because I was that frustrated.\n\nAm I the asshole for being upset during this drill to the point I had to walk away?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my friend to fuck off in class and getting her in trouble over a creepy eye movie?",
      "description": "\nThis took place in philosophy. We have a teacher that I strongly dislike. She teaches an easy class that is practically all seniors, but is insistent on being a hard ass. \n\nYesterday she decided to play a movie. Yay fun! But actually no. She said that if we look at our phones, take out papers, put our heads down, sleep, whatever, we would have to complete a research paper tomorrow. Essentially, we are being forced to watch this movie. \n\nAnd the movie she picks (the Minority Report) sucks. It’s the type of movie that appeals to a specific audience (it’s a creepy sci-fi thing) and high school kids that just woke up aren’t it. But what can i do? I watch this movie. That is, until it gets to a part involving the removal of the protagonist’s eyes. I am utterly repulsed by anything that has to do with eyes. They start showing the tools for the eye extraction and I start panicking inside. I decide to plug in my earbuds and put my head down. I’d literally rather do a research paper than watch this guy have his eyes removed. \n\nA few seconds pass, and I feel a hard pat on my shoulder. I look up, and on the screen is the exact thing I was trying to avoid. It was fucking awful. I look back and it’s my friend who tapped my shoulder. She is laughing. She’d gotten out of her seat just to “prank” me into looking at the screen (she knows I hate eye things, i’ve even used the word “phobia” before). I very loudly said fuck you or fuck off (i don’t remember). Awkward whole class stares moment. \n\nI hang around for another minute but the image of the eye removal is stuck in my head plus the movie is still talking about it and I can’t take it. I walk out of class in panic (i’m pathetically crying and gasping at this point because I can’t stop thinking of the fucking eyes) and out of school and drive over to a coffee shop. I stay there for an hour. \n\nAt first I’m pissed at my friend for her “prank” and want to lash out. But after the hour, i’ve calmed down and decided that I’m not gonna be mad and will just pretend like it never happened. I go back to school and see my friend during lunch. She asks me where I went, I say it doesn’t matter. She tells me that after class, the teacher pulled her aside and was angry because the teacher thought she had said something offensive to me that had caused my reaction. She seemed really upset then and didn’t show up to school today (she rarely get in trouble, so i think this was rather distressing). \n\nI have no idea what to make of the situation. I don’t know if my friend is angry at me. I don’t want to ask. Reddit, help me out... did I over react and get her upset over nothing?\n\nToday when I went to class, teacher pulled me outside. I briefly explained what happened. She told me I can’t leave school and she told my counselor but whatever I don’t care. Fuck her and her creepy eye shit. Why couldn’t she just play Nemo or something?\n",

      "description": "I haven’t made any decisions yet because I really just don’t know what to do, but I’m considering not going to my best friend of 13 years wedding. \nShe just recently moved a few states away from me, a couple weeks ago she calls me and says her and her boyfriend decided they are going to get married in one month. I told her this is such short notice and I might have a hard time being able to afford the plane ticket. She said she would help me out by buying a plane ticket for me since she got a very nice tax return and can afford it right now, but that she expects me to pay her back the majority of it once I get there. I told her that would work but now I have spent the last two weeks telling her that she needs to hurry up and buy these tickets because every time I look online the price keeps going up and up to the point where I’m going to have a hard time paying her back. She keeps saying she knows someone who she thinks can help get her a deal, but now with only two weeks until the wedding she still hasn’t bought them and I still have no idea how much I’m going to owe her! But on top of this she’s telling me that I’m not allowed to bring my boyfriend because her fiancé and my ex-boyfriend are best friends and he wants him to be there. He’s afraid he won’t come if he finds out I’ll be there with my new boyfriend. Even though we broke up two years ago he’s still not over it. The worst part is that it’s going to be a very small wedding with just me, my ex, and a few other people at the wedding and we will all be spending the whole weekend together at her house. I’m having a hard time telling my boyfriend that he’s not allowed to come because of my ex and that I’ll be spending the whole weekend in a house house with him in another state. I obviously want to be there for my best friend when she gets married but I’ve been extremely stressed out about these things. Would I be the biggest asshole if I told her I would rather just not come? I know she will be very upset but I just don’t know what to do!",

      "description": "My father has eaten his whole life too much which is the reason why he has always been overweight. My grandmother didn't really know what eating normally was due to the fact that she has experienced food scarcity in WWII. She didn't want her children (my father, aunt and uncle) to live in the same conditions as she used to, so she let them eat as much as they could throughout their whole childhood. About ten years ago, my dad's doctor confirmed that he has type 2 diabetes which, at that time, seemed to deeply affect his mood. For example, he became upset when a family member told him he couldn't eat ice cream. Many family members confronted him and told him he should eat healthier, by which he starts to play the victim and saying things like \"you don't know what it's like to have diabetes\". His reaction confused me, because he already knew his health was in bad shape and he acted like it was some sort of joke at first. \n\nIn the past, he followed harmful diets that made him lose and gain weight quickly, like juice cleanses. He says it's difficult to lose weight and I don't doubt that, but to me and my family it seems like he's barely trying to improve his lifestyle. He follows a diet that his doctor recommended to him due to his health condition, but eating custard and so-called healthy cookies after dinner? That doesn't sound like something a doctor would recommend to someone with diabetes. He walks an hour a day, yet he eats junk food at work (not everyday, fortunately). My mother can tell this by his expenses that she can search on his bank account. I don't know exactly how much he eats, but I can tell he doesn't know what eating normally is.  \n\nMy family and I are at our wit's end on how to improve his health. I'm worried he might get a heart attack one day and I don't know what I could say or do to make him eat normally, because he's quite stubborn about this topic. Whenever he asks for candy and such, I want to say 'no'.\n\nWIBTA to tell him to eat healthy?",

      "description": "My grandfather passed away very recently. I currently live over 600 miles away from my grandparents and drove out to their town when I found out he was in the hospital (under the care of one of his kids, my Uncle). I am lucky that my job was very understanding and let me stay for the week, helping take care of my disabled Grandma and my Grandpa while under hospice in his house. He was bedridden the entire time and we had to clean him because he was unable to do so for himself, which I know hurt his pride, but I didn't mind being there for him. My grandparents have done so much for me and it was a no-brainer for me to be there.\n\nHe passed and I came back home, because work starts again on Monday and I am unfortunately not in a position where I can keep missing work. Not to mention the drive is costly in both gas and wear &amp; tear on my vehicle, but it was still much cheaper than a flight.\n\nI will be working this week and have training for my job next week in another state - my company has already paid for the flight, the hotel, etc, for a full week, and if I want to advance at this job, it's important that I go. And I can't just keep missing work - life has to go on.\n\nMy Mom, who was not there during the hospice period or when Grandpa passed, wants to schedule the funeral for the week I would be traveling for work. I told her I would be unable to attend if that was the case. I also said if they wanted to schedule it a month out instead (he will be cremated so no having to worry on the condition of the body) that I could buy a plane ticket and be there if it's on the weekend. But I understand that these things move quick and people need closure.\n\nI told her that I was ok with not attending the funeral - I was there when he needed me most and I don't feel the need to be there. She started to try and guilt me into coming. And now I'm getting it from siblings and other family members.\n\nI know everyone will wonder where I am - I'm the oldest grandchild and I was there the most. And I am starting to feel a little guilty - I know that I would be support for my mom and uncle and Grandma if I was there.  A part of me wants to be there and a part doesn't.  And I am angry that people who weren't there at the end of his life are trying to make me feel bad for making this hard decision.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I didn't attend his funeral?",

I like the guy, first one I've seen that had a job (Retail Store Manager). She has been on food stamps since kid 1 was born. We have had to 'Help out' several times over the years for things like utility bill or unexpected car repair. Not 3 hours after helping her out with a car repair, she says she's having another kid.\n\nEveryone starts congratulations, I'm so happy... Etc.\n\nInside I'm seething, SIL notices something is wrong and looks at me. I say I'm shocked (true) say I'm happy for her (not true, but I'm smarter than to start that convo in public forum)\n\nI am pro life, I am not advocating abortion, but up to this point I've felt that she made her mistakes early and is dealing with it the best she can. I've never regretted helping her out (still). Especially because those two wonderful kids didn't choose this. But now SIL is repeating mistakes I thought she learned from. How hard is it to put on a condom? She can't afford the children she has. Myself, uncle Sam and who knows who else have had to step up. I'm considering suggesting she give up the kid for adoption. Hell I may take it in, but am I the asshole for suggesting it?",

      "description": "My roommates and I moved in together a few months ago and things have not gone very well since then. We live in a two bedroom apartment that they selected. I have the smaller room and the guy and the girl share the larger one. We also share a bathroom. They are vegan and against most technology, and their lifestyle is different than mine. I have a cat named Smeowg. Over the last couple of months there has been a very noticeable silence between us. \n\n\nI came home last night from class to a post-it note on my door that said \"Smeowg's litter box is full!\"\n\nI put one up and said I was aware, but that I was going to clean it in the morning so I wouldn't wake them up during the night. I also said that we should talk face to face instead of through notes.\n\nI woke up this morning to multiple notes on the door from the girl saying that she will leave “as many notes as she wants”, that we \"aren't friends, we're roommates\" and that apparently it's my fault that Smeowg scratches at things and wakes her up.\n\nTo be fair, I need to be better about his litter. They’ve mentioned that to me before and I’ve apologized. But I do need to try harder with it. \n\nI waited for an hour out in the main room for them to stop avoiding me, and when she came out I told her that I wanted to talk. She told me that she and her partner didn’t care to talk in person because they had nothing to say. I asked what she was upset about, and she told me that they have been taking pictures of dishes that I’ve washed that apparently haven’t been washed well enough, that I would be at fault for any paint that was taken off the wall from our loose shower rod because I hang my towel on it sometimes, and that Smeowg is scratching because he wants attention, which is my fault for not feeding him at the same time every day. (He gets fed daily, time changes depending on my schedule.) I apologized again for the litter box and told her that I did not want to comminicate through notes because it felt passive aggressive and I would rather talk in person since we live together. She told me she didn’t see a point in talking face to face.\n\nAITA? To me it feels like they’ve micromanaged everything since we’ve moved in and do things their own way, and I have NO idea how to make them happy. I was told a while back that my music was offensive because a song I was listening to had the word “fag” in it. It was referring to cigarettes, and I am bisexual. \n\nAITA? ",

      "description": "So about 5 years ago, my niece came to visit us. This was really exciting for her because she was 14 and she was finally allowed to travel on her own. Her mom, my older sister, is a single mom who struggles to get by (barely paycheck to paycheck), so it was our treat and pleasure. We also happened to have a new rambunctious puppy at the time. We reminded my niece multiple times to put her valuables away and to push in chairs, etc, but our puppy ultimately ended up eating her retainer. I immediately told my sister that we would pay for it, since it was a slight hardship for us (~$400-600, can’t remember, but they had no dental insurance) but would have been a devastating blow to my sister. My wife (then GF) grumbled a little about how my niece wasn’t responsible with her belongings even after multiple warnings (she left retainer on table with chair pulled out, a specific scenario we warned about) but ultimately conceded that it was our puppy, our home, and therefore our responsibility.\n\nAnyway, when we were home visiting for Thanksgiving, my wife came to our room (really niece’s room that we’re staying in) to find that my sister’s dog had torn up her suitcase and destroyed most of the clothes she brought and all of her cosmetics. My wife is into fashion, so this is totalling around $800ish damage. The dog had jumped over the gate my sister put up.\n\nThis would be, again, a devastating financial blow to my sister. It wouldn’t be easy to replace ourselves but we could manage to do it, especially over time. Get the most crucial stuff now and fill in. That to me seemed like the best solution, but my wife is throwing my old logic back in my face: my sister’s dog, her roof, her responsibility. And she is saying that since my sister put up a gate, giving her a false sense of security, it’s even more crucial since she wasn’t “irresponsible” like my (at the time young teen) niece was. AND she wanted to stay at a hotel anyway, but my sister would have been hurt if we did that so she had already compromised there (this is true). I get all this and I’ve validated my wife’s frustration but I still don’t want to ask my sister to give us money she definitely doesn’t have when she’s raising a daughter and struggles to barely make ends meet. \n\nIt doesn’t help that my wife and my sister aren’t each other’s biggest fans for a lot of other reasons but I think that’s fuel more than fire.\n\nAITA? Or is my wife thinking too black and white?",

      "description": "I came home from jogging tonight to find my neighbors dogs running around our compound, a chow chow and a rottweiler, both full-grown. To give you a picture we live in a compound of 3 row houses sharing the same gated perimeter. My neighbor seems to be a couple, a skinny about 4'11\" girl and an even shorter rotund boy. Now, as a dog owner myself, I love dogs but I know that each have different temperamental. So, I made a firm stand not to enter the gate and requested that they put the dogs inside their house judging by how the dogs can easily get through the grip of their owners due to their stature and built. I waited for a few minutes and the girl seems to just follow them where they go and the boy was just sitting outside their front door step. Sweaty and a little bit impatient, in a firmer tone, I asked them to get the dogs in the house for awhile until I reach and close my front door which is about 5-10 seconds away from the shared gate.   The lady raised her voice and told me that she is trying to get them inside, that's when the boy stood up and carried the chow chow inside their house in a rather harsh manner then the rottweiler followed. I heard them commenting inside their house (most likely about me) before the guy slammed their door shut. After I got inside, I heard the dogs running again outside which is fine by me. I actually pity those dogs because they are usually stucked in that house. I can hear them barking in the morning before I leave for work. \n",

      "description": "Here goes my First time posting. So My girlfriend has a very close family friend she has considered her “ brother “ for for a long time, He is very special to her. He has been out of jail for about 4 months since he was sent away for murder. Since he has been out he has on drugs and not in a steady living situation, we have had a few good times hanging out with Him and whatever but he defiantly wasn’t my favour person to be around to begin with. Until he lied to my face and stole 100$ cash from me, for drugs. knowing it was all the money I had at the time, and ghosted both of us for weeks. Then I really wanted nothing to do with him. Flash forward a few weeks he is texting my girlfriend saying he has nowhere to live.  She tried to convince me to let him stay in our 1 room apartment till he figures his shit out. But I told her I don’t want him living here considering his drug habit and this is where I keep all my special/expensive stuff that I don’t trust him around, although she assures me over the years that she has always been able to trust him and that he wouldn’t steal from us. But the way I see it is that he hasn’t showed me that I can’t trust him. \n\nMe telling her this caused a huge fight, she got mad telling me it’s stupid that I’m holding that against him and that it’s Annoying that I won’t look past it, and pretty much that she would do it for my family ( which I truly don’t believe she would as I have enough trouble as it is just to have friends visit me at home without problems) . Plus I’m sure you could all imagine how much it could suck to share a 1 room apartment with my girlfriend, Her 6 year old son, and her drug addict brother. Like cmon I’m already sleeping on the couch Half the time so her son can sleep with her \n\nShe wants me to forgive him even though he hasn’t reached out to me at all about it only asked her and apparently in her eyes it makes me a big asshole\n\nSorry for the long/ possibly confusing post but I didn’t want to miss anything, I’m just looking for opinions, am I the asshole?

      "description": "Ok, so a quick backstory. I grew up in a very dysfunctional household where my dad was an abusive alcoholic and as kids, my siblings and I were forced together in a lot of situations, i.e. locked in a room while my dad was on a bender and my mom tended to his alcoholic rages. And when he was sober, we were once again forced together due to his unnatural desire to have us be with each other at all times and essentially force family time with us whether we wanted it or not. Suffice to say, nobody was really able to express themselves in any meaningful way until we all grew up and moved out. But now my oldest sibling has taken it upon themself to organize events for us to all hangout, regardless of work schedule or just general life schedule. It’s gotten to the point where my eldest sibling is trying to get my younger sibling involved in my after work activities (it’s sports, not anything weird) just to kind of force us together, or at least that’s how I’m taking it. Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend extra time with them outside of holidays and the occasional movie/lunch? \nTl;dr Bad childhood forced me and siblings together. As adult, older sibling is trying to force us together as I am trying to move on with life. Am I the asshole?",

Well this one guy who I’m kinda friends with and this girl who I’m aquatinted with decided to make some jokes at my expense. The jokes consisted of comparing me to this weird kid at our school who actually threatened to bomb the school. Also from an earlier incident in the day where I had said I didn’t like a person at our school that happens to be black they decided to call me racist ( I took this as a joke, but it eventually went too far). So after about a hour of this I got fed up and insulted the guy, and then the girl. I said “ your face looks like a ball of dough” she then said ironically “ good one” I then responded with “ I could take your face mash it up roll it out with a rolling pin stick it in the oven then have a pizza”. After this she said something along the lines of wow I bet you feel good about yourself. I said yeah I do. She then said stuff about not making fun of girls and started crying.   She then went to the bathroom for the last 15 minutes of class. The teacher and some of the girls said I was mean but most either said nothing or good for me for Defending myself.",

I wanted to share an update about what happened. \n\nI broke up with my boyfriend first and foremost. I told him my reasoning behind it, and he didn’t take it well at all. He tried to cut me down, said some verbally abusive things, told me I was an abuser, and that he hated me. He also said that (for some strange reason) that he still wanted me in his life. I refused.\n\nI told him we both have our issues, and in order to deal with mine, a step that needed to be taken involved seeing professional help. I told him that I need to work on myself and my depression before I enter a relationship again. I suggested he see a therapist, too.  He got offended, and resumed the verbal abuse. I left his house immediately.\n\nI didn’t speak to him after that. He sent me texts and emails that were at one moment filled with hate and vitriol, and the next, he’d go on and on about how he loved me. When I didn’t respond, he sent me a text about two days after our break up saying that he’d signed up for a dating site. I deleted every message and blocked all means of communication from him. \n\nMy therapy is going well. It’s got it’s rough days, but I’m slowly but surely working my way into managing my depression. Positive thinking, surrounding myself with supportive people, and changing my views about myself are some of the things my therapist and I have been working on. I’m now prescribed with antidepressants as well.\n\nLife isn’t perfect, but with the right amount of work, I’m hoping it can be a bit more kinder towards me, and vice versa. Thank you for reading.",

      "title": "AITA for being too tall?",
      "description": "I’m 6’6 and whilst this might not be crazy tall it still seems to be enough to warrant a situation where almost everywhere I go a stranger will approach me just to ask how tall I am. I can almost guarantee that every other week or so people that I have never met before will either make a passing comment about my height or ask me questions. \n\nNow I’ve had my fair share of abuse over the years from people who have tried to ridicule me for my height and it’s been pretty rough sometimes. People can be mean and I’ve certainly beat myself up about it in the past. There’s been times where people have called me names and I’ve caught people out before where they’re just staring at me and it makes me feel really uncomfortable. \n\nAs I’ve gotten older and gained more confidence I now carry myself with a lot more self respect than when I was just a kid. But it’s still incredibly infuriating to have a stranger approach me and say things like ‘Oh my god you’re massive! How tall are you!?’ \n\nIn the worse case scenario people can be really rude to me and it feels like they’re trying to make me feel small by pointing out how I’m either too tall or ridiculously tall etc. I’m a pretty self conscious guy and the attention isn’t really wanted and sometimes I’ll react really sarcastically to the people questioning me. I get that I can stand out and more often than not I suppose people are just being inquisitive, sometimes people are friendly about it but it still feels kind of weird to me. It’s like people have no sense of boundaries or how to be respectful, but I don’t know if I’m looking at this all wrong. \n\nFor example, today I’m in the shop with my girlfriend and just as I’m about to pay this guy walks straight up to me and goes “How tall are you!?”\nI look at the cashier and then look back at the guy and go “8 foot 5 inches...isn’t that crazy!!?” \nHe just looked blankly at me and walks off like I’ve offended him. Then I feel doubly uncomfortable because firstly he made a comment on my height I didn’t ask for and secondly I seemed to annoy him with my answer. \n\nI don’t mind people approaching me and speaking to me if it’s a proper conversation. I’d quite like a “hello how are you?” that would be kind of nice I’d imagine. But to straight up come at me and ask questions about how I look feels unfair. I wouldn’t approach someone that’s overweight and ask them how much they weigh so why do people come up to me and ask me how tall I am?\n\nAm I looking at situations like this all wrong? Should I just expect that because I’m tall people will want to know exactly how tall I am? Am I the asshole for not responding positively to peoples questions?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I told my friend's Mom that the autographed picture she gave me is a fake?",
      "description": "(TL;DR at bottom)\n\nWeeks before my birthday, a friend asked who my favorite actor/actress was. I had a gut feeling she was going to do something amazing with whatever name I gave her; having them wishing me Happy Birthday on Twitter, for example. I had no idea that the gift from her Mom would be an autographed picture of a favorite actress!!! To say I was shocked and emotional was a huge understatement. I cried. They cried. I was elated and speechless over this priceless, thoughtful, and unsuspecting gift.   \n \n\nI'd learned that my friend's mom knows someone who has a connection to big names in Hollywood. Mom kept saying, \"She signed this JUST for you!\"; \"It's real, and she stopped to take the time to sign it just for your Birthday\"; \"I didn't want her to write your name on it in case you decided to sell it later\". This got my spidey senses tingling. Why say this repeatedly? I stared at the photo to admire it, it became quickly obvious that the signature was not real marker ink on paper but a machine pressed stamp of the autograph. Am I a trained professional in autographs? No. But I am smart and I have excellent eyes when it comes to spotting discrepancies. Later on, I took the photo out of the frame to have a closer look and had my suspicions confirmed. The signature was way too symmetrical and evenly inked to have been a marker. I could see/feel the perfect indentation left by the stamp. No need to have it authenticated.  \n \n\nI've thought about it and have decided it’s unfair to be angry that it's fake. Instead, I tell those that ask about it that I have a *genuine replica* from the source. But what do I tell Mom? Do I even tell her at all? I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, surely she wouldn’t be lying to me, right? She either had no idea that it’s not real and truly thought she gave me an original; or, she knew it was fake and was trying to pull one over on me. I want to believe the former; I want to believe in her innocence and thoughtfulness.  \n \n\nIf I was her and thought *I* gave someone an original autograph and they found out it wasn't real, I'd want to know so that I could either make it right, or, avoid making the same mistake to someone else.\n\n**WIBTA** for politely mentioning that I've come to learn that the signature is not real? I don’t want to lie to her and say I took it to be authenticated when I did not. I don't have the desire to \"catch her in a lie\", I just want her to be aware of it, so she doesn't do it to someone else; or have her naivety be taken advantage of in the future.   \n \n\n**TL;DR:** Was gifted an autographed picture of a favorite actress. Discovered it’s a machine stamped signature; not signed specifically for me as the Gifter repeatedly stated. The gifter either did or did not know that it's fake. I don't know how to tell her, or if I should tell her.  \n \n\nThank you for your input.",

      "description": "The title sounds pretty benign, but the way people reacted on reddit made it seem like I was doing something way wrong and I still don’t understand.\n\nSo what happened was I broke some computer parts in my PC when I was drunk - the motherboard and the GPU. I basically got some liquid on some components and they stopped working.\n\nI replaced the motherboard out of my own pocket because I was going to upgrade it anyway. But I didn’t have any money to fix the GPU. So I decided to see if the warranty covered it. I read up online about it, and the warranty basically said it doesn’t cover user-inflicted damage.\n\nBut looking at my GPU, you wouldn’t be able to tell if it were water damaged or not. So I made a post to a tech support subreddit and asked basically if there were ways for a company to know if a product were water damaged and if I should bother sending in the GPU to get it fixed/replaced. I stated that I was most likely going to send it in despite everything. And to read the comments you would have thought I was robbing the company of thousands of dollars. People were very upset that I was ‘taking advantage’ of this company (a large corporation, not a mom and pop computer shop). They were pretty nasty and I didn’t really expect people to react that way. They assumed I made the post looking for validation for my ‘wrongdoing’. Like I created the post solely to feel better about my crime or something. The truth is more closer to “should I bother spending 10-15 dollars to send this thing in to be checked by this company.\n\nI mean if I sent the thing in, the company would have the choice of either replacing the GPU or not. People made it seem like I was committing some act of fraud. I know it might have been my fault that the GPU broke, but this is a multi-million dollar business. And the GPU I had was outdated by at least 3 years. So it’s like 200$ or so. Maybe less idk. If it were any other industry they would have been ok with it. Like if this were a car part or something. People were genuinely upset.\n\nSo am I an asshole for doing this? I didn’t think people cared if a giant company swapped out a 200$ GPU for a broken one but I guess I was wrong. And this wasn’t just a few people being upset, there were a lot of people with highly upvoted comments saying what I was doing was morally reprehensible. And I just don’t get why people were so quick to defend this company, at least in the manner that they did.\n\nTL;DR I broke a GPU on my PC and asked a subreddit if it were worth sending it to the company to be replaced. They were pretty angry at me. ",

      "title": "AITA for driving the speed limit?",
      "description": "This isn't a single conflict but rather a continuous thing. My commute to work is a 35 minute drive, and most of the drive takes place on a two lane (one each way) highway with a 55 mph speed limit. The road is not divided, and there are several long straight sections, so passing is fairly easy on this road. The road is usually heavily policed (I tend to see a cop each time I drive the road, generally in oncoming traffic).\n\nI'm sure you can see where this is going. Ever since I got pulled over once for speeding, I've been trying my hardest to avoid repeating that. So I simply set my cruise control to 55 for the duration of my time on the road. However many drivers on this road tend to drive at 60 or 65. This means that I tend to gather a conga line of cars behind me. Some pass me (like I said, passing is fairly easy on this road--it's not too crowded and has lots of passing zones), and some don't. Plenty of them ride my ass really close, which can be frustrating.\n\nI understand that sometimes driving slower than the flow of traffic can be dangerous for all involved, but I think that is less of a problem here than say, a crowded four lane highway. I also worry that by encouraging people to pass me I'm putting them in greater danger as well, but in my mind it is their responsibility to decide when and how to pass safely. I do make sure that I hang to the right when someone looks like they want to pass me so that they have a clearer view of oncoming traffic. Also I don't know how safety concerns about going too slow weigh against the the slower speed being safer. It's also worth noting that other cars are rarely ever going more than 5-10 mph faster than me.\n\nIn the end I feel as though I shouldn't ever feel pressured into breaking the law, and I think I should be justified in following it, even when others don't.\n\nSo that's it: am I the asshole here for slowing people down and (maybe) causing more dangerous road conditions, or am I justified in keeping to the speed limit and others should just deal with it?",

      "description": "Have been thinking about this for a little while now, and it'll probably go down in a reddit garbage bag, but I need some opinions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI probably have had what I would consider for myself the toughest few years so far in my life. Debt was just one of the *minor* issues let's say. Lived in overdraft for about 5 years straight with no positive numbers and just a few months ago had reached my goal and have actually begun to start saving in an investment account for myself where I have a few thousand saved. Soon after, met my boyfriend (been dating for about 5 months now) and I really do love him for everything he is. Except how he handles his money. Have attempted to help him with his finances, in almost any way that I could. Even gave me access to his account - had subscriptions to things he didn't even know was there, would pay an unnecessary amount for groceries of one person, didn't know how interest rates or investment funds worked and doesn't have a savings account. As someone who recently got out of a huge funk, I want to help him the best way I can but he lives in the States whilst I'm in Canada (1 1/2hr drive). I eventually want to be able to settle down - put a down payment on a home, have a family, travel, etc. but he can barely pay for his part of the meal when we go out for the occasional outing. I've been through past relationships where I was the provider and didn't realize it until after the fact. I don't want to relive that ever again because that's how I became indebted in the first place. AITA for not wanting to be with someone who cannot handle money or know the value of a dollar really well?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My grandfather was taken to hospital 3-4 months ago to the hospital because he was having a hard time breathing. He was moved to ICU same night and stayed there for 2&amp;1/2 months and after New Years was sent home.\n\nHe came home with a breathing machine attached to his neck and a feeding tube in his stomach and has one more for bladder, we were thought how to clean all that and got bunch of stuff related to his care, we had to hire a nurse for 2 weeks because even the doctors suggested they reckoned that’s how long it would take us to learn. This is all normal it can happen to any of us.( I hope no one has to go thourgh this tho.)\n\nNow the part I’m maybe being an arsehole about, I’ve been working for 2 years since I graduated not the best but it was something rather then nothing. Couple of weeks after  my grandfather got sick I was let go from the place I was working in, bad wage, no extra pay for overtime since they found this method to cover it all legal no issues, they aren’t a bad company and all have been nice but I had to leave at 5-6 am for work and came at 8-9 pm (traffic is a nightmare). I had saved up money it was all good.\n\nMy grandfathers sickness required a lot and we had to pay for quite a few things and the most expensive 2 were nurse(3 of them coming whenever and whichever got time from their regular work.) and some medications which wasn’t covered we had to buy. Nurses cost nearly a third of my monthly wage in the company I used to work at.\n\nA good chunk of my savings went to that while my father used what he earned for getting the bed and other items we require like the bed and the special thing it should be placed on so we can hone him upside down or straighten him and stuff.\n\nI got a loan from bank for this as well and I’m paying it by myself and I have very little remain from my savings which I don’t want to give it to him just because he wants to get the best stuff rather then getting the mediocre ones. \n\nI may sound heartless and maybe at this point I am, this isn’t our first time taking care of a bedridden relative my grandmother was paralyzed when I was 6 and lived for 18 years I helped with that too and now helping with my grandfather.\n\nForgot to say my grandfather is 92. He isn’t conscious and more like in a blank state he doesn’t respond but occasionally stares ahead.\n ",

      "description": "She hasn't even been dating this guy for a year. She still lives at home with our Mom. Her boyfriend has two kids. I'll try not to rant about my sister and keep to the subject at hand.\n\nWe'll call her boyfriend Fred. Fred has two kids, somewhere between 6 and 10 years old. My sister, Sue, has been dating him for about 8 months. Fred isn't that bad of a guy. He's been divorced but does the best he can for his kids. I respect the dude and genuinely think he's decent. Sue, on the other hand, is selfish and feels entitled to everything. \n\nAnyway, every weekend, Fred has his kids. That's great, he should be able to see his kids. But, the issue is that he doesn't have his own place. He sorta moved into my sister's room at my mom's house over the time they've been dating. Times are tough, I get it. Well, his kids are fucking brats. \n\nI myself stay here off and on due to work. I have very little possessions. I tend to keep to myself because I don't really like my sister. While I'm at home, I have my dog (5 pound Pomeranian) and he's my whole world. He's my best friend, he sleeps with me, I play with him as much as possible, and I just fucking love him. Cue Fred's kids. \n\nHis kids have no idea how to treat an animal or personal property. They take my dogs toy and just tease him. They never give it back and like to psych him out. I get furious when they do that, so I eventually, yet calmly, went off. I told them if they're going to play with my dog, then they better play nice and stop freaking him out. They continued to not give him his toy. On top of that, they like to pick him up by his front legs and fly him around like a god damn superhero. I lost it. I told them to let go of my dog and they're not allowed to pick him up anymore. What do they do? The exact opposite.\n\nAlso, the little brats like to invite themselves into my room, jump on my bed, and harass my dog even more. For Christ's sake, I have my door closed with me and my dog in here but they still feel invited?\n\nIt's not just my dog. They're loud, always bothering me, and constantly touching my shit. Why the fuck are you in my room you little kids? There's shit in here that they do not need to see or get a hold of. Examples: Bong, handgun, and my VR setup. Before you jump to conclusions, my gun is closed up in a case, unloaded, clip out, and stuffed away in the back of a drawer. It's not in a safe because 99% of the time, I'm nowhere near kids. \n\nFred does tell them to stop when he sees that I'm getting aggravated, but they'll get back into being little shitheads sooner or later. Sometimes I'll take Sue to the side and let her know that their intruding in my room and harassing my dog, but she usually shrugs it off.\n\nAITA?\n",

Let's call him Tom to take Disney  (A 5 week old black and white kitten) and put the kittens face in their ass. I opposed this but didn't say anything. I didn't know Tom would comply. But he did. He grab the kitten and pulled down his pants. He put the cats face on his bare ass and  farted. (The friend who invited us over was at the store right now getting snacks) Everyone was laughing but I was honestly disgusted. I started yelling at him. \"WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? IT'S A KITTEN.\" I then punched him. We started pushing and punching eachother until he pushed me really hard. I fell on something. It was a small 2 week year old. We took the kitten to the vet and it died. I feel awful and lost many friends that day. It's a silly ordeal and I just get frustrated thinking about it. Am I the asshole?",

It wasn't a super rude no way, but I did try to play it off as a bit of a joke with \"Oh no, no thank you. You ate durian! Haha.\" She got quite angry at me and won't speak to me after saying that I always act like she is some disgusting thing when she eats durian. I have no problems with her eating durian, she loves the taste and that's perfectly fine. I even once bought her durian ice cream. But I fucking **HATE** the smell of durian, it nearly makes me puke, and I have explained that yet she always accuses me of overreacting about it. Years ago I used to over tease her but she explained to me how hurtful it was and I made a conscious effort to stop, but that doesn't mean I will pretend to enjoy it. It is one of the most vile and genuinely disgusting smells I know. I prefer the smell of my own fermented dick cheese to it, but she loves durian so I respect that and never make a fuss about her wanting to eat it, it makes her happy.\n\nSo it angers me that she can't seem to understand that it grosses me out. No, I don't want to kiss you, and have my most hated taste stuck to my lips right below my nose, so that I can be smelling it for minutes to hours. But she insists that I am being a jerk because it's only a quick goodnight kiss.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to kiss her?",

      "title": "AITA for going to a party instead of hanging out with my girlfriend?",
      "description": " (18f and 18m) I posted about this previously before it happened. Yesterday, I had a plan to go hang out with some buddies at my friend’s gender reveal party for his kid. At the same time, my girlfriend was telling me that she was going to want me to hang out with her, even though I had already planned on going to the party.  No random girls were there and that she was more than welcome to come. She has been taking care of her newborn nephew the last week, and yesterday was her only chance to hang out despite me going to the party. I went to the party, didn’t hang out with her (I stopped by for an hour during the middle of the party) and then returned and smoked weed against her wishes. \n\nI have heard many people say that in situations like this that the girl is just being controlling, but on the other hand she is really emotionally needy, has mental health issues, and is super busy so I know that dating her means that if she needs something that I’m right there beside her. We typically hang out a lot, and I rarely go out with friends.  Today, we got in an argument and she came back at me with her take on the situation as if it were happening from my perspective. \n\nHere is her take on this situation. I am “A” in this scenario. \n\n“Imagine this: \nYou’re having a super long and tiring week. You’ve been taking care of your 6 year old niece and trying to help your sister with her newborn baby. You finally get a coworker to take your shift, yay! You can hangout with A. You mention it to A that you want to hangout. He says, “I can in the morning but I have a party to go to later”. you’re busy in the morning and you remember that this is a gender reveal party for one of his so called “friends”. So you ask him to do the right thing for your relationship and come hangout with you instead because you’re emotionally and mentally tired and you need a break from everything with the one person you can get a break with. He says no, that this party is too important to him because he promised his friend. But he’s broken so many promises to you (quitting juuling,  texting people you don’t like), why does it matter? You two fight a lot and now you’re even more sad and upset than before. You ask him to come over for a few hours, but he shows up 45 minutes later. You’ve made plans with your other friends since your boyfriend couldn’t take the time out of his day to make sure you’re okay. He then invites you to hang out in a nearby town at 10:00, only 25 minutes after your movie starts, but he only invited you because he felt bad (she was invited to the party in the first place but declined). Then he said he was going to go home for the night, and you asked him not to smoke and he agreed. You wake up and figure out that he did indeed smoke, despite what he had promised you. So why is his promise to his “friend” so much more important to his promise to you?”\n\nSo, AITA? ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to celebrate my mother's birthday?",
      "description": "Less than half an hour ago, my father, my mother, and I were sitting on the couch in the living room. My mother's birthday is coming up (on the 20th) and that seemed to be the reason of the following conflict.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were discussing the plans for her birthday so I told the ideas that I had come up with. My idea was somewhat of a family-oriented one. I hadn't seen my parents for four years prior to 6 months ago and I was really busy this semester at school and work. I was looking forward to spending some time with my parents as well as my aunt and my cousins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my parents my idea:\n\nWe would go to check out a city about an hour away that is known to have an incredible Christmas atmosphere. It is an overall nice city with lots of Christmas decorations and festivities and a great place to spend an afternoon in.\n\nI've heard a lot of good things  from a few friends about a restaurant in the above city. Since both my mom and I work the afternoon of the 20th, I figured I could bring her some breakfast in bed on the day of her birthday and book her a massage so she can relax a bit (lord knows she needs it). On the 23rd, we would drive to the above city and spend our afternoon there (after 5 since we both work until 5 on Sunday) and pickup Christmas dinner from that specific restaurant. The restaurant offers a carry-out dinner that serves 8 to 10 guests for $190. I told my parents I would buy the dinner, and we can have my aunt and her family come over on Christmas day (or Eve) since this would be the first year my mom celebrates Christmas with her sister. That way nobody has to cook and we can all spend some time together and kind of reconnect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother got incredibly mad. First, she stated how she was disappointed that she was not getting a car for Christmas. A bit of backstory here: my mom was never a driver and she drove enough in the past 6 months to pass the driving test. She demanded that we get her a car so that she won't depend on us to drive her to work and other places. This responsibility fell on me since I'm the only one in this family who knows how to buy a car, and most importantly, speaks English. As I said before, I was busy the past four months due to school and work so I didn't really have any time to buy a car for my mom's birthday. I told her she would have a car in January since I'll have some free time during winter break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother kept getting madder. She would jump from arguing with me to yelling at my dad because he wasn't saying anything. I could tell that she was mad about something and that she couldn't get mad at me so she got mad at my dad instead. I told her I am trying to have a conversation so we can reach a middle point and compromise. She shut down all my ideas by throwing slippery slope arguments at me and would go back to releasing her anger on my father. I looked at my mom for a minute and realized that this is what she was doing:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Shut down my ideas by throwing slipper slope arguments at them\n* Get mad and trying to release that anger on me.\n* When she'd realize that her anger wouldn't work on me and that I was deflecting the fight by remaining calm and rational, she'd turn to my dad and start yelling at him about how he is not saying anything and that he should be saying something at the moment.\n* My dad would take the bait and start yelling back.\n* I watched my parents yell at each other for a good minute and overall escalating the argument. I was right in front of them but it felt like I was so far away and was a spectator to their fight. I was somewhat amused and found the whole thing funny realizing that I probably am the only responsible adult in this house and that living with my parents is going be to a lot harder than I thought.\n* Go back to asking me what my plans are for her birthday and  Christmas, thus returning to the first step and repeating the whole process.\n\nI was accompanying my mom in this loop for the first couple of times. Then I realized what she was doing and I stepped out. She kept going. That scared me. My mom has random bursts of violence and I'm afraid it might escalate to more than fights\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that moment, I realized I was trying too hard and that I couldn't force my parents to change. Any effort of mine would be useless as these patterns are engraved in their brains. Thinking that I would probably have to deal with another fight when we'd hung out for her birthday and spend time together for Christmas, I told her I don't wanna do anything for her birthday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was tired. Tired of all the fighting. I don't want to deal with that anymore. I don't want to spend time with my parents, nor do I want to get them Christmas gifts anymore, nor do I want them to progress in this new country anymore. I want to distance myself from them. I believe they are toxic and contribute to my unhappiness and poor mental health.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I The Asshole for wanting to be happy?",

I speak in an authoritative way to let him know, hey, you're not in control here. Relax. He then goes between apologizing, threatening, m'fing me. Etc. We argue. My girlfriend gets me into the house.........and proceeds to yell at me. Saying ITAH and I'm embarrassing her. That pisses me off because I know if I stayed inside, I'd get yelled at for not having her back. \n\nI cool down. She again tries to leave to get her daughter. I go to go for a drive. When I do. I see her. Our other neighbor and the ass hole neigh or yelling. The other neighbor is a great guy. 67. Always looks out for her and her daughter. I get out of my car but just stand back. When it looks like the AH neighbor is about to attack, I then get in the middle and he backs off. \n\nPolice come,( he called them saying he felt threatened by me but as soon as he hung up he said I'm lucky the police were coming because he was going to beat myass lol), he moves his truck, blah, blah, blah......but the rest is not important. I'm asking, am I the asshole? I'm still upset at her comments she made to me after I defended her. I'm not kidding when I say the guy was definitely trying to intimidate her verbally and physically  before I stepped in.",

      "description": "So last night my girlfriend was at my house, but needed to be home by 12:30am as she still lives at home and her dad usually wants her home at a specific time. Last night however, her dad was out playing poker, which he’ll usually play until about 3am.\n\nSo we just made cookies, were watching Netflix, it’s about 10:45 and I notice she’s falling asleep. I figure it’s only 10:45, and I’m not even tired yet, so I just wanted to lay down next to her for awhile. Big fucking mistake. Apparently I did fall asleep, didn’t even recall falling asleep, and she wakes up at 12:40 freaking out. I immediately wake up and try to comfort her, I put my hand on her leg and say, “Hey it’s okay, it’s only 12:45, and you only live 5 min away.” She pulls away and says she doesn’t want to be touched and grabs her keys leaving without saying good bye.\n\nAt this point I know she’s pissed at me, but I still want to make sure she got home safe so I text her and say just that. She replied that she doesn’t want to talk to me, today or tomorrow and blocked me on everything. Then she asks “Why would you not wake me up” I tell her i didn’t mean to fall asleep and I’m sorry. And she says “Sorry is just overused now. I’m leaving”\n\nThis is the first time something like this has happened, (me falling asleep and her being 15 minutes late). Although it was an accident, I know I should of probably set an alarm or something along the lines. But...AITA for this situation??",

      "description": "I have been with my husband for 4 years. He is from a different country and culture who speak English as a second language. I am very family oriented so have tried very hard to integrate as I got married by being as friendly and open as possible with my in laws who I see on average 4/5 times a year. His mum is adorable and whenever she is around she shows me a lot of affection (even though she doesn’t speak much English). However, my brothers/sister in law and their partners make very little effort and barely speak to me. I thought it was a language issue initially so brushed it off but recently realised that their English was good enough to ask me to ask my husband for a lift or to ask me for food. \n\nRecently my husband decided to host a family lunch at home. I cooked and set up a buffet for everyone. One brother grunted hello at me and went to sit down elsewhere, (not the first time. I was told it was because he was not talkative but when sat with my husband you can’t shut him up), his partner didn’t offer to help in the kitchen once, just sat there in silence and only got up to ask for food or help herself to drinks in the fridge, the other brother’s partner barely said hello and just went to the kitchen to help herself to snacks. I heard feedback from my husband that the food was excellent (people were going back for seconds) but no one from his family said anything to me and I was basically ignored in my own home for the day. \n\nI decided that next time my husband wanted to host his family (apart from his mum who I would smother with love) I would have a spa day and leave them to it. Am I the Asshole for taking this stance? ",

I don’t really speak to my sister because she’s really dysfunctional and was abusive in childhood. I have forgiven her, I just don’t want her in my life. Anyway, I heard from another family member that her husband was out of work. I offered him a job. Day one was ok. Day two he was negative and complained he wasn’t feeling well. Today he texted and said he couldn’t come, which left me in a bind because I took last night off (working 16-18 hours a day to keep up right now) and was expecting him today. He offered to come in on Friday but I said no thanks because I need dependable people, but thanked him for giving me a help for a couple of days. I then went to his house and dropped off some money to help him out. No one answered and when I texted to let him know I put money in his door, he still hasn’t texted. I don’t mind helping people, but I’m serious about my business and what I expect from employees. I mean, AITA here? I feel like a thank you text would have been nice. I wasn’t rude when I basically fired him and did thank him. Frustrating! ",

She asked me what my rating was and I told her that I’m a special warfare operator (I’m not) to impress her. She got skeptical and started questioning me about all this SEAL shit (apparently her ex boyfriend was a SEAL) and I decided it was too late to backpedal and decided to keep up the lie, since I knew all the answers to her questions, having worked with SEALs. Eventually she got really frustrated and I told her she was acting bitchy so we both left. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "We work in a city which is known to have a cooler climate than the surrounding area, due to the topography, and it's been a bitter winter so I've been dressing in layers to stave off the cold while I'm out, but we have a big wall-mounted heater unit, so my innermost layer has been pretty much just comfy t-shirts. And recently I got a flesh wound on my shoulder and have been wearing sleeveless blouses to keep from bothering it while it heals.\n\nNow, you might be thinking I'm the one turning the heat up, but no. I'm the one turning it down. I get into the office and it's a vaguely chilly 64-68F. I prefer 72F but I can deal with 60-78. My coworker comes in 30 minutes after me, which gives me enough time to acclimate to the room and be comfy. She takes up to an hour to really settle in, during which time she's in and out, doing whatever work she needs to do away from her desk.\n\nWhen she finally does settle in, she turns the heater on. I'm fine with it for a little while; like I said, it's vaguely chilly. She turns it on high though so when I'd been overheating for a while I would go over and announce, \"I'm just gonna turn this down, it's getting really hot.\" She doesn't say anything, so I put it to low. It's still a bit hot, but not getting hotter, so I deal with it.\n\nBut then about 20 minutes later, she turns it back up again. I can open my window to regulate my space, but it's loud outside the office and part of my job requires taking customer orders over the phone. It's gotten to the point where I just go turn it down when I can without saying anything.\n\nI don't get it. She's from the area, and wearing sweaters. I'm from one of the warmer surrounding areas, and wearing short / no sleeves. But who am I to decide how cold she is? But then, who is she to force the whole office to sit in 74° dry heat just because her clothes aren't warm enough?\n\nAm I the asshole?",

We let him know that our current campaign is reaching it's end so joining now would be kind of pointless and that we have a few more people wanting to join our next game. \n\nThis guy (let's call him Jim) has always been very nice and from every encounter I've had around him he's never done anything for me personally to not trust him.

He still drinks and smokes weed which isn't a problem for me but him being a former addict makes me not want to associate with him just from personal past experiences with some family members.\n\nI mentioned to my friend that I wouldn't feel comfortable if he joined us because we rotate between mine and his house for game night and I didn't want Jim in my house, my friend felt the same way and we agreed that if he asked that we would tell him that were full.\n\nAITA for basically black listing this guy because of his past?",

So I decided to step on the path of self improvement, and that's when everyone turned around and started to badger me about getting a date. This has always been annoying but I could just do my own thing, until today.  \n\n\nMy 18th birthday is coming up in less than a month, and so everyone has been asking me what I want, trying to make it special. My dad, in the previous years, has made an increasing amount of jokes about getting a prostitute for me, but I always brushed it off as a hurtful joke.   \n\n\nToday, however, I was upset, and said a swearword, which in my language means, \"Ah, my dick\", as a way of saying \"Ah fuck\", and that's when he went hostile, chastising me about being a virgin and wanting to propose me for a hooker again, and at that point I cut him off. I went home shortly after. The reality of the situation set in roughly 30 mins after I got home. I didn't want my mom (they don't live together) to know what's up, so I just sent him a message saying if he ever spoke to me like that again, I won't be nice about it.  \n\n\nI am not on especially good terms with either of my parents in personal matters, I just don't like to talk to them about it, hence why I didn't tell my mom.",

      "description": "Background: Met a girl off Tinder, and hit it off pretty well. She had some stuff going on involving being a unicorn for another couple and a weird situation with another guy resulting in police intervention, all of which happened before we dated but while we were initially talking. About 2 months into us dating she goes home with me to meet my parents as I live about 10 hours away from them. My parents and I don't have the best relationship but we grit and bear it for the sake of family. Girlfriend isn't happy with how I interact with them and tells me about it afterwards.\n\nFast forward to this month, things have been going okay, but not really the best. She recently was diagnosed with Bipolar and I said I needed to consider what that meant for us because any past relationships whether romantic or friendly involving Bipolar have disintegrated. She takes it offensively and I can understand why as I'm not being supportive of her diagnosis. This leads to her breaking up with me two weeks ago citing that she needs time to figure out what we are to one another. To me that seems reasonable because we're both having on and off feelings for each other. We agree that staying friends seems like a viable option while she figures out what she wants. She continues to talk to me telling me how she loves me and I tell her how I love her back. Meanwhile she is going out with other people including the couple from before which fine by me, we aren't dating. We wind up meeting up to talk about our situation and she tells me that she was just fooling around with these people to get my attention (or as my friend said: \"make you jealous so you take her back\"). I'm not the kind of person that gets jealous and I took it that she wanted to move on. \nNow for the part that got me going, since she is now at my place and her phone is dead she asks me if she can use mine. I agree and go take a shower. She asks me questions regarding a friend that I have and whether or not I've started seeing said friend romantically. I've made it very clear prior that the friend was just a friend, because girlfriend was very insecure about her. Girlfriend informs me that she read my messages between me and my friend and that she doesn't think we are just friends. I tell her that she has broken my trust and that I don't think we should go back to dating because I can't date someone I don't trust. Girlfriend has made it clear she doesn't want to be \"just friends\" and I feel like I can't date her, so am I the asshole for thinking I should cut tail and run?",

      "description": "We've been together for almost 2 years. She's 23 and I'm 24 now. We had great compatibility in the sense that we could handle decision making and disagreements maturely while also being silly and adventurous together. Soulmate material, right? Unfortunately, throughout the 2 years, we never had penetrative sex.\n\nIn the first few months of us dating, she tried to have an IUD insertion, but it was unsuccessful. We figured that it was one of those common situations where a woman that never had sex needs time for her vagina to adjust to penetration so that the pain can go away over time.\n\nShe was still in university while I've graduated a year ago. We would go on dates almost every weekend, but often didn't have the opportunity to engage in anything sexual because we would end up at her parents' house, so the most we could sneak in is a makeout session. I honestly didn't mind all of this that much, she was my first girlfriend and our relationship was mostly great otherwise. Sure, I had a healthy libido, but I could take care of myself. During that first year, we also had problems with finding the right condoms so that delayed things further. We were having outercourse when we had a place to ourselves, however rarely.\n\nIn year 2, she moved in with me for the second half of it, and that's where we could really start to make consistent progress since we would be at each other's disposal almost every day!... minus the period weeks, and minus when she just didn't feel like it since her libido was much lower than mine. She tried to practice self penetration with fingers and a small dildo. She made some progress in being able to fit things in a few inches without it being super painful. It wasn't really enough for sex though. She thought she might have endometriosis, so she went to her doctor. The visits, which were spread over a few months due to how busy her doctor was, didn't result in anything conclusive.\n\nAfter a year and a half of being patient, I was starting to lose that patience. I didn't see any hopeful signs that we would be able to have sex anytime soon. I also felt like she wasn't prioritizing this problem enough by escalating her doctor visits and seeing more specialists. She was busy and stressed with finishing up school, dealing with her family, and then looking for a job. I empathized with that, so I kept giving her more time. Eventually, close to the end of year 2, we had one of our many \"heart-to-heart\" conversations where we discussed our situation and how she feels that she is holding me back from experiencing a \"normal\" relationship where the couple can have \"normal\" sex. I also expressed that I'm running out of patience and just don't see an end to this struggle in our near future. We both agreed that she should move back in with her parents at the end of the month and that we should break up, but remain friends.",

      "description": "Earlier tonight I had gotten into a bit of a loud back and forth with my brother over lending his friend money. First I should start by saying I am already owed over $700 from him that I'm yet to see a dime of. \n\nThis friend of his had decided to fly to Pennsylvania to meet with someone she has been told cut out for months. She gets there and all there plans fall apart and she is left stranded with only a small amount of money. As expected she has gone to my brother hoping to receive money for a flight back. Now I should mention that my brother has been manipulated by her in the past and everyone who knows her either despises her completely or just tolerates her. Whenever something bad happens to her, she has always had someone to bail her out. With that said, I feel like by lending the money I only allow the problem to get worse. Meaning she wont learn from her mistakes like this, and my brother will continually enable her feel as if shes done nothing wrong. Am I in the wrong here?",

      "description": "After I turned 18 my 4 other siblings were put up for adoption. My mother has completely changed and has tried so hard for the last 3 years to get my siblings back. Demon Child (DC) has stopped her at almost every turn. I am the oldest and she is one of the middle children (number 3/5). She was 14 when they were taken and was put into a foster home with my 2 youngest siblings. Within 6 months, she was acting out to them all the time, which was understandable given the situation. She was diagnosed as Bi-Polar and would constantly run away or fake life-threatening situations. They ended up putting her in a group home for a while before giving her back to my mother. While she was with my mother, she got away with EVERYTHING and if she didn’t, she would threaten mom with things like child abuse.\n\nEvery time mom would come close to getting the other kids back DC would do something drastic to stop it. She would quit taking her meds all the time just because she felt like it. She would also steal money, or the car and skip school or go out with friends and not come back for days at a time. She eventually dropped out of school all together. Once she pulled a knife on mom just to get the car keys. I hold a lot of resentment for her because the only chance I had to see my siblings again was when mom got them back.\n\nA little over a year ago my SO and I got pregnant with our first baby. 2 months later, she “surprisingly” got pregnant too. She also actively changed her appearance to look exactly like me. To the extent of perming her straight hair, dying it my color, wearing glasses she doesn’t need, and talking about DIMPLE SURGERY. When she had her baby, she made my mother take care of it while she ran off and still only returns a couple hours a week. She won’t give up parental rights though because ‘she’s too arrogant’ (her words). She’s pretended to change so many times, but has never lasted more than 2 weeks. Now she’s 19 and my mom got the kids back a few months ago and she has ALREADY influenced my younger sister (4/5) to go off her meds and drop out of school too. Yet since she had a baby and mom got the kids back, everyone else is fine with her and just watches what they say/do around her, except for me since I cut her off completely. I get lectured constantly about how I should stop being judgmental, holding grudges, hating her and just make up but I think that’s ridiculous! I don’t want to be anywhere near her! I believed DC so many times when she said she was going to change. I helped DC out and supported her so much. And I was the one who had to be strong for my mom and pick her up every time DC pulled her bull. I listened to mom cry, cried with her, missed out on 3 years with my siblings, and had to pull the family back up every single time DC tried to tear it down. But now since the family is back to normal, I am just supposed to forgive and forget, hoping she won’t pull her sh\\*\\* again? WHAT?",

      "description": "So, I was friends with a former co-worker up until today, because apparently I bug her with trivial things, and \"don't care that she has real problems going on\". \n\nSo, I have a former co-worker (I'm a guy, she's a gal, yes, I'm  the type of guy who doesn't mind female friends, no I'm  not gay) who used to be quite mean to me, until all our other co-workers stopped liking her. She decided she was being unfairly mean to me, and tried to be my friend. Then, she left our work to work somewhere else. She still decided that we would be friends, and we would text/talk, but honestly, never hang out (we hanged out maybe once in 2 years). \n\nOver these texts/talks, she basically would only complain to me about things in her life, and how horrible things were. \n\nThese items include:\n\n- the death of her mother from suicide (&lt;12 years ago).\n\n- how her grandmother is old and she takes care of her, but because she does, she can't go out and have fun, like travel.\n\n- her dog, which died of old age about a year ago (honestly, that is the most recent thing).\n\n- her relationship with her boyfriend of 7 years, and how he didn't treat her right, then after they broke up, her new boyfriend who also didn't treat her right, and then how they broke up.\n\n- pissed about her brother for pretty much anything.\n\n- how people at her new job were mean to her, and old stories from our work, about people being mean to her.\n\nMost of the time, I tried to be empathetic/sympathetic, but a few months ago, I just gave up paying attention to her talking because it was always the same old stuff (she's depressed about [insert topic from above]). Today, over text she got pissed at me for apparently ignoring her problems (her grandma is sick). She also stated that I never take anything seriously. I just said fuck it, and stopped responding to her texts and she said she can't be my friend anymore. Honestly, I was relieved, because I was tired of her bullshit, and how she would only talk to me whenever she was having a problem that she can't move past.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Okay, strap in folks. You're in for a long ride.\n\nIn 2015, I started working in a family owned bakery. The owners were an older couple with a 28 year old son, A, that managed the place. The owners spend most of the year outside of the U.S. every year so A was the one running things. He was recently married to a seventeen year old girl, F. Late in the year, her brother, R, who was recently out of an abusive relationship and also recovering after the suicide of his best friend was drafted into managing the store because the manager,A, and his ridiculously young bride wanted a new life separate from his parents' business. He asked R to quit his job and take on the bakery as a favor to him so he could start his life. The owners were also planning their retirement, so this was their way to get a new manager who was still somewhat in the family since A wanted out. This new manager was loved by the staff and was brilliant at baking bread. The biggest change he made involved organization of our storage space, which wasn't updated since they opened and frankly, was a bit dangerous and unsanitary until that point.\n\nI started dating R and things moved fast. Over the course of 2016, we got really attached and he's the love of my life. I can't imagine my future without him. He was completely in charge of the the bakery after a few months and things were going well. His salary was about $60,000. I was the head cake decorator and he was an excellent baker and we both worked full time. We made good money and planned our future. I loved my job. The old manager, A, moved on completely, and became a real estate agent. Although A had never worked hours like this, the owners insisted that R work 12 hour days, 6 days a week. He complied, but asked for 1 hour lunch breaks. This made him hated by the owners. In their country, that is not something a suboordinate asks for in the workplace. \n\nWhen the owners came back, they spoke to R about his lunch breaks and told him to stop. He said he wouldn't give up that time as it was just a few hours out of his week. They also were furious about him reorganizing the storage space, as that  made it hard for them to find things (although they spend most of their time out of the country) The owners talked about letting him go because of \"different ideas about what work ethic means,\" so R went to A to reason with his parents about keeping his job. A got back to R by formally letting him go from the company and taking his old job as manager at the bakery back. \n\nR and I got married in late 2017. I work part time in a retail store and his land development job is very low-paying and they can't even work on rainy days. We're both constantly looking for work but nothing really pays better here in a right-to-work state. \n\nA and F on the other hand, are doing much better. A does both managing the bakery and real estate and openly talks about his money, always saying things like I plan to make 600k this year etc.  He and F have bought 2 huge homes and A has literally totalled two BMWs in the past two years.\n\nAnyway, A and F have had a baby and that's great. But I'm not hype. I spent two years at that bakery expecting a promotion and they never gave me that. R gave up his former pretty well-paying job to do A a favor in that stupid bakery. He worked there for over a year and the owners fired him for him eating lunch. (Also, the 60 year old owner was weirdly obsessed with me and was definitely mad R and I got together). A never tried to apologize for what happened. His parents did finally retire, and now he's hired a bunch of his friends to manage the place. \n\nI don't think of this all too often I've kept my head down and dealt with my crippling money issues silently. I mean my life is mine and I'm happy with R. He's seriously the best person I've ever met. But with everybody ooh-ing and ah-ing over this rich little baby that is directly a product of stunting the plans I'd had, I'm so freaking mad. Seriously, seething with rage. They coerced R into taking the job by tempting him with that salary and then ripped it away. He had ideas, was bringing in new clientele, and he just really loved bread!\n\nI'm NOT going to go over there to their basic, Crate and Barrel showroom house to see all the things they don't need but can afford AND a brand new baby that we probably won't be able to afford for another ten shitting years, while we struggle to pay rent, for food, and my student loan payment that isn't even worth anything since I can't even find a decent job.\n\nI feel like I'm a bit all over the place, a little irrational, and just plain stupid. But am I an asshole?\n\nSorry for all of this but I'm mad.\n\n",

      "description": "So, in September a lady that I do small clerical type jobs for asked me for a favor. I normally help her organize her things, she’s is a MAJOR hoarder of paper and antique furniture. She asked me if I would put a storage unit in my name for 30 days (30 days only cost $1, after that the price is $240 per month). She had been given a notice to remove refuse (old furniture) from the property that she’s renting or face eviction. I agreed. I added her as an authorized user for the unit. She payed me $20 for this favor. Well September was coming to a close and it was time for her to move her things out of the storage unit. September 26th she tells me that she needs me to be available September 29th to help with the storage removal and closing the account. I told her that I was unavailable to be present that day which was a Saturday. So, she said she would start it Saturday and finish it Sunday (30th) then I could close the account. I agreed. Well Friday the 28th she tells me that she has to drive a truck across country from California to New Jersey, so her daughter would be doing the moving for her. I just needed to close the account after the daughter was done moving. Sunday the 30th rolls around and I don’t hear from her. She never gave me her daughter’s number so I waited to hear from the lady or her daughter. She calls me at 6:11 pm on a 3 way call with her daughter. She asks me if I had called the storage company to let them know she would be moving out. Mind you, she’s an authorized user and she could’ve done this herself. I told her that I spoke to them earlier in the week but not over the weekend, but I had just arrived at my in laws house 85 miles from home and I couldn’t talk long, as we had a family emergency. She tells me that she has an emergency as well. LADY SAYS: “You were supposed to be available to close the account out today. I took the key with me so daughter couldn’t get into the unit and you are the only one that they will cut the lock for. You need to call them so that I don’t get charged.” \n\nSo, I said I would call back when I could talk. She sends me her daughter’s phone number so that I can coordinate with her (too little too late IMO). At the time that she called, the storage place was closed, it closed at 5 pm because it was Sunday. When I spoke to her daughter, the daughter admitted that she forgot about having to move out of the unit Sunday around 3 and when she got to the storage place she realized that she didn’t have a key. So we made a plan to try and keep from being charged the $240. I already knew it was I vain, but I humored her. She has blamed me the entire month because she cannot afford $240 for a storage unit. Well, she kept the unit for an ADDITIONAL 30 days. I told her last week that she would need to close out the account after she moved out. I cannot be there to do so, and since she is on the account, I do not need to be. She finally paid the past due balance on October 30th. She asked me several times when she needed to be out of the unit. I told her every specific detail. \n\n“THE FINAL DAY TO MOVE AND MAKE A PAYMENT IS OCTOBER 31st. YOU MUST WALK INTO THE OFFICE WITHIN THE BUILDING TO CLOSE OUT THE ACCOUNT AT LEAST 15 MINUTES BEFORE THEY CLOSE. IF YOU DO NOT CLOSE OUT THE ACCOUNT, YOU WILL BE BILLED FOR ANOTHER MONTH. I DO NOT NEED TO BE PRESENT FOR YOU TO CLOSE THE ACCOUNT. YOU NEED TO DO IT.”\n\nShe got a major attitude and told me that I was full of excuses as to why I couldn’t be present. She also informed me today that she was on the road again delivering a truck somewhere and that she would TRY to make it back before they closed. I am beyond infuriated. I checked the online account and it has not been closed out, which means she probably didn’t make it back in time to move her things out. \n\nIf she doesn’t pay the $240 that’s now due November 1st, AITA if I have the storage company break the lock so that I can change it? If I am going to be stuck with a bill, I am going to try to sell whatever may still be there. I don’t think the storage company will restrict access because the current bill isn’t past due yet. I am afraid that she is going to take her stuff and ditch this second bill. She blames me for the account being open when I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HER FAILURE TO MOVE!!\n\nANY other advice in this situation would be very helpful as well. ",

      "description": "    About two weeks ago my sister came to me and asked me to buy her a new K-pop album. She usually comes for me for money because I have a job and our parents won’t give us any. I agreed and told her that she would have to do three weeks of dishes to pay me back $30. She also agreed to this. \n     One of the weeks included in a three weeks would’ve been spring break and now my sister and my stepmom are going on a trip instead of being home. The original agreement was if she would do the dishes till 6th of April (3 weeks from the purchase date) but she does not come home until 6th of April and she leaves tomorrow. I asked her if she would make up the days from when she was gone to continue the payment but she told me it was unfair because we only agreed till 6th  April. \n      Am I an asshole for wanting her to do the dishes to make up for the time what she’s gonna be gone? She told me I could just leave them for her when she gets back but I don’t want my house smelling disgusting while she’s gone. I asked my stepmom but she told me because she wasn’t there for the original agreement she can’t help me\n\nSummary: I bought an album for my sister and she said that she would do the dishes for three weeks to repay me but now she’s going on vacation during the time she was supposed to be doing the dishes so she’s not doing them nor making up the time",

      "description": "I'm in a poly relationship. Im seriously dating two women. Who I would marry i would. We all live together. They are bu but dont have a relationship with each other they dont find each other attractive but are best friends. They both have flings off tinder with other girls 90% of the time they dont see the girl more then once the other 10% they see for at most a month. Now they both see a girl every other week or so. Usually ever other weekend. They talked it through set it up so they would basically swap weekends. \nI'm rambling now. So I'll try to move on.\n\n\nNow I got into poly when i was about 18. I was dating a girl who i loved more then anything. She was great but always wanted to have other partners. Took me a while to agree. But eventually we agreed to til she started talking about another guy I told her to cut it off and I dont want her sleeping with him again. She got upset but agreed. I didnt like their fling because we said never talk about or other partners. Well she said she wanted to change a rule and we should tell each other about our partners. I reluctantly agreed. So we talked about all our partners. I flet a little guilty after hearing shes been with about 5 other guys in the 6 months we opened our relationship. Cause I  had been with basically 4x the amount give or take. She was extremely upset. Literally the next day I come over to her dorm as she asked. And shes getting fucked by this guy. I literally threw up. Broke up with her that instant. Never spoke to her again. Even though she tried really hard. I didnt care. Didnt date anyone till I met my current girlfriends. That was like 2 years after the breakup. \n\nAnother commenter told me it wasnt healthy that I didnt want my girlfriends to fuck other guys. They have never asked me to. And I said when we started this relationship that I wouldn't want them too. They both said they never even thought about another guy. And to be honest I dont sleep with other girls without one of them being there. So I'm not sleeping with anyone else but them.",

      "description": "I currently attend college and have a job at an after school program. I also live with my mother and younger sister who works at a fast food restaurant.\n\nMy mother has made it clear time and time again that she will no longer help me with adult problems. Which is why I do not have health or car insurance at the moment. And since all of my belongings are in her house, she expects me to give her $150 of each of my $370 paychecks.\n\nCurrently since the school district is on Winter break, I have two weeks to hang out with my friends who are back from various colleges/unis and my SO who leaves Monday for Mexico, he won’t be back til after New Year. \n\nAnyways, my mom told me that in order for me to leave the house I needed to clean my room and the kitchen. I planned to leave early in the morning to my SO’s house to have a full day of hanging out. So I cleaned very late at night and decided to not do dishes so I didn’t risk waking up my light sleeper of a mom.\n\nAnd instead I:\n\n-Cleaned my room\n- Cleaned the bathroom and its mirror\n- Took out the bathroom trash\n- Took out the trash from the trash can\n- Fed the cats, dog, and my leopard gecko\n- Cleaned the living room which was a disaster thanks to my sister\n- and even washed some of my clothing\n\nOnce I finished, and patted myself on the back, I took off to my SO’s house. No too long after I got an unhappy text from my mother. She was disappointed that the kitchen was still a mess even though my sister was the reason it was a gross mess in the first place.\n\nI decided I had enough. My mother does not help me in any way. I pay to live there and I never eat the food in the house because there is none. We are a struggling family. I take care of myself and my SO who doesn’t have a job, he only attends college.\n\nI told my mom everything I did to clean and that I no longer wanted to come home for Christmas. Every year Christmas is the same, my aunt and my cousin’s grandmother only take interest in what my cousin has to say. They adore her and all I get in conversation is a “Hi, how are you.” Before the conversation is focused back on my cousin.\n\nWhich is only worsened by the fact my mother only talks about my sister and I to them when it’s about negative things. Every Christmas I feel neglected and uncared for. \n\nMy mother told me to grow up, and that I needed to give her positive things to say. She also told me that she would take any money they intended on giving me and tell them to return all presents they had for me.\n\nI’m a college kid who’s working hard to help those around me. I’ve asked for nothing all year, and don’t even desire Christmas presents. All I wish for is my mother to buy the proper medicine for our dog who is growing older and older. I’ve not been to jail or even messed around with drugs. I’m decent at college and I’m fucking great at my job. I may not be an all star child but she’s starting to make me feel like trash.\n\nI told her that she isn’t my mother, and quite frankly I never want to see her again. \n\n\nTL;DR - My mother got mad that I didn’t clean the entire house and told me that I needed to grow up and become a better child even though I’ve never asked her for any help or thing and I give her $300 every month for rent.",

      "description": "I was at a party the other night with my family and as we were chatting, this random person came up to us wanting to talk. Okay, we think, we’ve had this happen already what’s this guy have to say. As he’s talking, I just think something’s... off. He only talks about his interest in D&amp;D and how anti social of a person he is, how glad he’s found someone like me, who looks so nice to talk to. This sets alarm bells off in my head and when he leaves (barely asking anything about me or my family despite coming up to talk to us) I tell my family how uncomfortable I feel. They brush it off, saying he might be autistic, and as an autistic person myself, I should understand and sympathize with his plight of talking to others.\n\nSo the night continues and I’m watching this guy from across the room. He’s grooming his mother and as I walk up to get food (which is coincidentally right near where he is sitting) I hear him say something along the line of “I made a girlfriend. (Points to me) There she is.” \n\nSignificantly creeped out, I hurry back to my family, and the night goes on as normal until the guy from earlier comes up asking for my number so we can “keep in touch.” I panicked and tried to get out of it, but my parents were adamant I give my number to him, so I gave him one that sounded like mine but wasn’t. He walked away before I could get his. My siblings found out and are calling me an ass for not being understanding to this guys feelings, saying that I’m an awful person, and it’s really worrying me.",

Eventually a sort of banter developed  between us and it was kind of fun to be honest.  Then she asked out one of my friends right in front of me which I just kind of smiled and said it seemed like I broke some ice for them.  I hear from my friend that he couldn't believe that I was so chill about it. He also started acting intimidated when I was around.  I began suspecting that it was fake and just to mess with me but I thought I was crazy and probably just a little jealous so I wanted to believe that.  Then I hear from my friend that it was to mess with me but now they  are legit going out.  I was a little upset and confused that she wanted to mess with me that much but I didn't say anything.  Eventually I hear that she is working night shift and can't find time to go out.  Then I find out that this is a lie to avoid him.  She stops talking to her best friend at the the same time over this issue.  It does blow over and they break up eventually.  Recently the entire incident comes up and she is shocked that I learned everything.  I tell her that I don't care about what she tried to do to me, but I do care that she lied and hurt my friend.  I told her I thought she was more mature than that and I expected better.  I also said that I don't like her less or anything, I just don't like what she did.  I specifically had this talk in private as well.  I didn't say anything to anyone else but I find out she tried to turn other people against me.  AITA?",

      "description": "I (f16) was asked for nudes from my close friend (m18) who I think of as a brother. He brought it up as a complete joke, and since we have joke flirted with each other in the past (of course he knows it is a joke, we've discussed an actual relationship in the past and he decided he did not want it, and I was in a committed relationship at the time this was asked of me), I didn't think much of it. Suddenly, he seems a bit pushy on this joke. I tell him to drop it as he surely doesn't actually want them. To which he asks if I would be upset if he did. He said it would be pretty hot, and I declined. He asked if it would still be a no if he paid me, I told him I did not want to do anything of the sort, especially at this age. He kept badgering me about it until I eventually told him to not text me anymore about this and turned very cold towards him. He later apologized (more for my reaction than his behavior tbh) and I accepted. \n\nHowever, this encounter left a cold feeling in my gut. I was currently in my first relationship, and this ask left me to wonder if I was seen as the type of girl who would send nudes to pretty much any guy who asked. If I had somehow built up a reputation of that sort (not a bad thing but a. illegal at my age and b. I was raised very traditionally and am still following the belief of waiting until marriage). I reached out to a trusted individual about the scenario and she assured me he was just being gross. I felt better about myself. \n\nFast forward a month and a few friends (the boy and girl mentioned previously included) and I are hanging out and, skipping over unimportant details, I ended up making a joke he was a pervert (as we all do to each other, this is not a rare joke), and my friend I had reached out to laughed really hard. He looked at the two of us suspiciously, and quickly leaves. I didn't suspect much of it, and I get home and check my phone, and I have a message from him. \n\n\"Sorry I trusted you with an odd request, it wont happen again\" and then he proceeds to block me over every form of communication we share. \n\nThis boy was my best friend for over a year, was it my fault the friendship was terminated?

      "description": "Tldr at the bottom\n\nSo a few months ago I came to the group of friends that I play dungeons and dragons with and offered a new system to play. This new system is more number crunchy and than d&amp;d so I offered to read the whole manual (close to 600 pages) ahead of character creation (referred to as CC) to get a better understanding of the new rules. After reading the manual I decided if I was going to be the game master that I should create a small one shot to introduce everyone to the new mechanics. This whole situation takes place in about 3 to 4 weeks\n \nA couple of days pass as I take the time to read and create the upcoming game. At our usual d&amp;d sessions I request that some of the guys take the time to read the player's portion of the manual (section is about 20-30 pages) so they aren't blind sided by new rules for CC. I send everyone some pdfs of the portions they should take a look at and they all tell me they will read the passages. Several weeks pass and each group session we have I ask them if any had read it and of course none of them had. Each time I spoke to them I warned them that this new system is more complicated and would take some time for all of us to adjust to it. But I get reassured by all of them that they will read the sections I gave them.\n\nThe day finally comes around and of course every player is blindsided by new rules aside from one. As I focused on learning the mechanics of playing the game I realized I could've spent more time on CC, but I assumed my warnings would be enough to encourage other players to read their sections. So CC goes much slower than I would've wanted and everyone is slightly frustrated. Thankfully I had the one player who had a thorough understanding CC. So we continue on into the one shot I created and everyone is having a great time or at least it seemed that way to me.\n\nBut the next time our group gets together for my game several of the players don't show up without any warning. Whatever, it happens so we continue on with our game and all is well. A little irked the next time we get together for d&amp;d I ask what the issue is and they all say they don't quite understand the rules so they opted to stay out to not slow down the game. I reminded them that I told them to read before we started and that I would help them along so we could all play, but I conceded to taking a break from my game so we could focus on our d&amp;d game.\n\nTime passes and I ask if we are ready for my game again. So the one player that actually read the CC portion I sent then respondes with:\n\n\"yeah play a game where I know more about the game than the dm? No thanks\"\n\nKind of blind sided I look to the other players and they either don't acknowledge the exchange or nod in agreement.\n\nTldr: warned players to read manual for new game only one does. The one that does has a better understanding of character creation than me. One player says he knows the whole game more than me. All players then decide they don't want to play ",

      "description": "AITA? I have a condition called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Its not well understood by most doctors so typically people with this condition rely on each other to better understand it and its treatment. I've met a lot of people online with the condition via groups where we ask questions and exchange advice  \n\nThere is one girl I've met who has a strong personality. In all honesty she seems like a huge SJW. I've seen her almost bully people that she claimed were ableist or sexist when they really weren't. She seems to like being a victim if that makes sense. I don't know if that is what she was doing here though. \n\nWell she seems to often get medical issues that I've had a few years earlier. As usual her doctors rarely know what's wrong or are confident that they can fix it despite a lack of understanding. If I can share a possible answer to her issues I share, as do many others. She often took offense to this sometimes although I never understood why. We wouldn't diagnose her or say what to do. We would just share similar experiences and just share ideas for her to discuss with doctors which is what these groups are for. I now leave her alone and try to respect her. \n\nOne day she announced that she was looking into a surgery to fix a knee problem that we share. I nearly had this exact surgery for the same reasons a few years ago. Thankfully a doctor stopped it. Ever since, many doctors have said that I'd have likely lost a lot of function in my legs if I'd not been saved by that careful doctor. My condition makes the surgery horribly unsafe. \n\nEvery time this girl posted about it I told her about this and begged her to at least get certain tests to see if it was safe for her. She always refused and said that her doctor understood this condition. He clearly didn't well enough if he was willing to do this surgery without testing her first. She would post an update every few months btw. \n\nShe got angry at me every time and had some friends bully me over it online. Oddly I was labelled as an ableist. I didn't mind really as I didn't take it personally and expected it. I tried to be as polite as possible whenever I did this and explained that I was scared for her. I would just say my thing then stop as I didn't want to pester. \n\nWell she got the surgery a year later and it went as expected. She's having a terrible recovery and things are going bad even sooner than expected. I'm worried about her future. We both have limited use of our legs and she may now have none pretty soon. \n\nI want to be respectful towards her but I struggle with guilt. If I didn't do everything I could to change her mind I would have blamed myself a little for holding back. I'd wonder 'what if I could have stopped this fate?'. I'm glad I didn't stop for my own mental health as I'd struggle to live with this. Is this somewhat selfish? Does that make me an arse? I'm not sure what the right thing to do was. Leave her to make a possibly life changing mistake as a 19yo or annoy her with the hopes of her requesting some tests before her surgery? ",

      "description": "So, I'll start with some back story...\n\nMe and the friend have known each other for about 3 years and are on the same uni course so we typically see each other quite a lot and became pretty close over the time.  During this time we've obviously done quite a few things together outside of classes, like pretty much weekly coffee's/going out for a drink ect. For her last birthday, upon hearing she would be spending it alone, I took her out for a nice meal and a few drinks because i know she would have been upset doing nothing for it (and i would sorta expect something similar back if the roles happend to be reversed - because we're close friends). Now i know you don't enter a friendship with expectations of what to get out of it but i feel as though its been pretty one sided and I give a lot more than I get back.\n\nI could also go on about the many occasions where shes vented to me for hours on end about things that are bothering her, or the amount of times I've helped her out with things, but, i feel as though that's just part of being someones friend, right? You're supposed to be there for them?\n\nOnto the situation/s... so this friend knows I've got pretty bad social anxiety (so i don't have many friends) and ongoing depression that exacerbated by the winter period, and i also have my birthday on the Chirstmas eve (i could go on a whole rant about why this sucks but the main thing that bothers me is that no one ever has the time for me because of Christmas, i know this is sorta selfish to think, but if one of my friends birthdays were constantly over shadowed by the biggest holiday of the year i'd definitely try do something for them). \n\nAnyway a week prior to my birthday she recalls us going out for hers and says she'll do something with me for it, a week goes by, hear nothing more of it, surprise surprise, it doesn't happen. (my other 'best friend' also said we'd do something and nothing came of that either) but this isn't the main thing that bothers me, like i understand everyone's busy and its childish to just assume i should be everyone priority. The part that bothered me about this situation is that she phoned me on my birthday, not to say happy birthday, but just to vent about how her boyfriends an asshole (as if this hasn't been obvious for months..) and that he had canceled their plans for Christmas. So I calm her down and tell her i'll change my plans for the next day and she could come round to mines if she liked, to which she agreed. The next day she came round, we got drunk, it was a fun night. (I should clarify, whilst i was a bit upset she didn't say happy birthday, i understood she was preoccupied, so it didn't bother me much then)\n\nhere's the part that got to me though,  so in the run up to new year i asked all my friends (like all 3 of them - none of them know the others) what they were doing for it, their plans ect, and everyone told me theirs but no one even asked me mines. New year comes and goes with me spending it alone in my flat, feeling depressed af, and wondering why i always seem so prepared to go out of my way for my friends, yet they wont even ask what i'm doing for new year, and the only 'happy new years' i got were in responses back. So 2 days after the new year, the friend mentioned above finally decides to ask what i done for new year, and upon telling her i spent it alone, all she replied with was \"you need more friends hahaha\\*laughing face\\*\".\n\n (and this is the part where i feel i may have turned into the asshole)\n\nThis really just totally set me off, i replied saying \"or maybe just better ones\"\n\nShe then seemed really offended by my reply and asked if i was referring to her with more laughing faces,\n\nI explained i wasn't exclusively referring to her, but yeah the shoes fits,, i asked her to imagine that, if when she had phoned me on birthday, how she would have felt if my reply had been similar to hers there, and finished it up with 'go fuck yourself'.\n\nShe then said that she doesn't understand and that she wasn't intending to come across as a cunt (her words not mine), but i replied by telling her to go find some new friends (petty i know).\n\nTo make things worse upon her telling me to chill the fuck out, i just started ranting, and said she would understand if she ever took head out of her arse long enough for her to see things how they really are (and then doubled down on the self-absorbed insults, rich from me i know).\n\nSo ultimately i'm having a hard time deciding weather i was the asshole for over reacting like that, or if their the asshole by being so inconsiderate in the first place.\n\nAnd whilst i do agree with her, i could do with more friends, what good are more friends of the same caliber if the friends i have don't ask me to do anything anyway and it feels as though i make most the effort?\n\nThanks in advance for your opinions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(sorry its so long and apologies for any spelling mistakes/long winded sentences)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

All during our one together she would keep dropping hints about how she ants to grow old together and how serious she wanted to be. This freaked me the u k out at he time as I was just looking for a casual high school girlfriend and not something so serious (I know I sound like a dickhead but I was just a kid and had a serious amount of schoolwork to do). She would always talk about her older sisters (19) boyfriends and how they perfectly inter grated into her family and how he would always stay over for dinner. I knew what she was saying, and it honestly scared me as her parents are always “testing” me and I’m a naturally aquward person.\n\nWe had been to he movies 1 on 1 a couple times by now and we both had fun each time, but one day she asked if I would like to go on a date wit her and her entire family. I’m talking both sets of grandparents and parents, all her siblings and her siblings partners. I had only met her sister and her parents and this was definitely not the way I wanted to meet the rest of the family.’",

I have been going trough some personal shit and really needed support and was looking forward to seeing her. We planned this a week or so in advance. So about half an hour before we decide to meet up she canceled on me because she just discovered that she had to go to her boyfriends brothers birthday, which was moved to today. She offered to hang out for half an hour before she had to go but I declined and got slightly mad about the fact that she found this more important. Would have been understanding if it was her boyfriends birthday, but it was his brothers birthday who she has only met once or twice I believe.\n\nSo am I justified to be slightly mad and annoyed about this or am I acting like an asshole.",

      "description": "Two years ago I made the decision to go to grad school in Richmond, VA to eventually get a better job in my field so that I could travel and not worry about needing a job so much, as well to be at the top of my profession. My longtime girlfriend decided to not move with me but instead stayed in NYC because she liked her job and has family in NYC. We decided to stay together long-distance and actually got engaged not too long ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am about to graduate and have been looking at jobs at different cities around the country and although NYC has a great job market, it's just not a place that I want to go back to since I had worked there before grad school and we have lived there our whole lives.  I could very easily get a job in NYC, but will not feel happy if I do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiance has been very adamant about staying in NYC, because she says that her job is great and moving would be too difficult. To be honest her job is just okay, it is the only job she has had since graduating undergrad-five years ago and doesn't pay her enough to allow us to save much money. I honestly think she is just afraid of trying to find a new job, where I am the opposite and want to live in a bunch of different cities before we get to old. As you can tell I think her job is a dime a dozen, but it makes her feel important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe job that I will be able to get will be able to support both of us barely if we move to a new city, but it will be at a company that is at the top of my field so growth potential is at the maximum for my job market. So I won't necessarily have an amazing job from the standpoint of $$ but it will be at a top 10 fortune 500 company.\n\nAITA for wanting to push my fiance into moving out of her job and into a new city for the job of my dreams after completing grad school?

      "description": "I (19M) have been on a dry spell recently. And it's making me feel really low. My friends (both 19M) are trying to help me get laid but honestly I think my looks are just too bad. I'm clearly ugly and therefore I can't participate in the hookup culture.\n\nSo I was playing Xbox in my flat living room and my female flatmate (19F), we'll call her Katy, walked in with some of her female friends (3 girls, all my age). I said hi to them, made some small talk, etc the usual.\n\nAnyway they were sat on the kitchen table just talking while I was playing Xbox on the sofa, and I heard them change their convo topic to guys. They started talking about some hot guys they know and how good looking they are, and honestly, my heart shattered.\n\nI was playing Xbox to GET AWAY from feeling low about my dry spell, and to now hear 3 good looking (4 actually, including Katy) talk about these ''hot guys'' just made me feel even lower. It reminded me that no girl talks about me the same way they were doing those hot guys.\n\nSo I just politely said to them ''Please stop doing that'', they looked confused and Katy said ''Doing what??'', so I just calmly looked at her and said ''Talking about those hot guys''. She looked even more bemused and said ''Um...why not?'' so I just said ''It makes me very uncomfortable''.\n\nShe went a bit quiet and said ''Ok....'' and a few minutes later they left, now later on the day she pulled me aside and said that embarrassing her wasn't cool and that i'm an asshole, I said to her that it's got nothing to do with embarrassing. And if it was me and my friends talking about ''hot girls'', I'm sure she wouldn't like it. \n\nI thought what she was doing, was selfish, because it made me feel like shit, AITA?",

Jack falls in love hard and fast. as a best mate i never judge or criticize unless expressly asked i.e \" what do you think of her buddy?\" and even then i always say \" shes great mate\" or \" lovely girl\" with the added \" take it slow\" but being a friend is hard cause when the inevitable end comes and your there helping a crushed dude who you love as a brother, it also crushes you you want to help but short of getting drunk and letting them grieve you cant do much else.\n \nback to the AITA. i explain to jasmine that maybe instead of rushing over to jacks house and professing her love for him that she waits until shes sure of her feelings and sits down and talks to him and explains how she feels and that jack can get into his feelings sometimes and maybe wait a bit she agrees and leaves and i go to bed and get up for work. midday i get a message from my best mate\n\n \" it would be best if we took a break from talking for a bit, jasmine told me what you said \" \n\nim really confused cause were pretty honest with each other and nothing i said was bad in my head or was something i didnt tell him before.\n\ni ask what did she say i said ( god this sounds childish just writing it) and he says \" you know what\" i txt jasmine going  \" wtf happened\" she says she went to jacks house told him everything and im still confused, jenny txts me saying \" jasmine and jack and other friends are really sad with what you said you need to apologise\" \n\n\nim get fed up, obviously jasmine must have lied about something and im working and im just really done with all this childish he said she said and i txt jack and say \n\n\"until you want to explain exactly what you think i have done the whole lot of you can F**k right off \"\n\nthis was weeks ago and i havent heard a peep from any of them and honestly its so refreshing not having to deal with all their shit, ive got other friends but now im kinda wondering if i was an asshole in not finding out what happened. i kinda flushed a 20 year friendship down the drain in one text.\n\nTL:DR AITA reddit?",

      "description": "tl;dr &gt;!uncle died because he refused to go to the hospital and my family is suing. I don't agree but I keep being called an asshole now!&lt;\n\nTo start, I'm not using a throwaway because my family doesn't know my reddit account and if they find it, they know my stance on this matter and it's their own damn fault if they stalk me and see that I'm a big fucking disappointment anyway. I want to know if I'm the asshole in this situation, buckle in because it's a long ride. Also maybe some catharsis for me, go figure.\n\nIn June, my uncle (we aren't actually related but my 'grandpa' is my family's best friend, we're basically family) was in pain from what he assumed was a muscle cramp that just kept getting worse. We called an ambulance and they checked his vitals and everything. I specifically asked them to make sure it wasn't a heart attack, because his brother had actually had one earlier that year and early heart attacks kind of run in their family. The EMTs assured me they would do everything they could. \n\nTo my uncle, they recommended he go to the emergency room to make sure everything was 100% okay, but the thing about my uncle was he never wanted anything to be a big deal - especially about himself. He REFUSED to get in the ambulance, and the EMTs told us it was severe muscle cramping (I think) and said  they couldn't force him into an ambulance. They left. \n\nOver the next few hours, my uncle got worse until he was delirious with pain. Then he pissed himself and we realized that he needed to go to the hospital, NOW. It was literal hell, I had to carry him to the car with my sister's help and the whole time he was just saying \"aaah, ow, aaah\" in the most monotone voice ever, it was pretty fucking scary. I'm actually pretty sure he was dead and gone before we even put him in the car.\n\nI couldn't go with them, but the rest I've been told; they took him to the ER and he was taken by helicopter to a different hospital with the necessary equipment, and it was like I thought - earlier he'd started having a heart attack and his deliriousness was because he wasn't getting enough oxygen to his brain. \n\nHis aorta was torn, and he needed surgery that the doctors said he had a 1% chance of surviving - and unbelievably, he survived the surgery. Problem was, he was brain dead because like I said, his brain wasn't getting enough oxygen. \n\nThe thing you have to know about my family is they are VERY dramatic. Everything is screaming, everything is basically reality TV levels of drama. My twin cousins screamed at the doctors with all the cliche lines you'd expect from House or Scrubs, things like that - and they were definitely milking it. That sounds harsh, but I know my family and they LOVE drama and make everything 50 times more dramatic than is necessary. \n\nThey started grandstanding about how they were going to sue the doctors for 'killing' him but then they settled on the EMTs. They began talking about the EMTs and they were so hateful, and I understand we're all grieving but they were making up lies and saying that Mike wanted to go to the hospital but the EMTs told him it wasn't a big deal and argued with him when that WASN'T THE CASE. I was in the room when they were checking him out and my uncle refused point-blank to go with them, and then they lied about more little details. \n\nLater the day after he died, we were sitting on the trampoline smoking some weed to relax and my sister and cousins start talking about how they're going to sue, and repeated the lies my mom insisted were true that I know for a fact weren't. I argued with them and things got a bit heated, and my sister's boyfriend started yelling at me that his sister is an EMT so he knows the procedures and they didn't follow the procedures in place for EMTs and I was yelling back that I literally read the handbook for it and they followed it to the letter and said the EMTs don't deserve to go through hell when they're already aware that their negligence inadvertently killed a man.\n\nThat's when everyone on the trampoline announced that yes, they deserved hell and even to be killed, so I told them being angry is one thing but they need to get a better handle on themselves before they ruin other people's lives. I don't think the EMTs did anything worth being dragged through hell for, people make mistakes and this was one of those horrible and unfortunate ones, while my family is one of those families that insists everyone around them are the assholes except us. (Like my mom breaking the lease in 50 different ways, then being an asshole to the landlord trying to hold her to the lease for example). I know for a fact they're only trying to sue because when my family is 'wronged' they have to prove they're right, and it's awful. \n\nAfter that my sister said \"You're gonna deal with momma\" and jumped off the trampoline to go inside and get my mom. At that point I ran inside too and upstairs because my mom has a history of being abusive and I certainly did not want to deal with that. For the record and to my surprise, my mom was very understanding. She demanded I open my door and asked why I called her a liar but I explained I didn't call her a liar, I called my sister's boyfriend a liar and told my mom what my sister's boyfriend said, which was that Mike abused adderal and that's why he had a heart attack and had what's coming to him and it resulted in an almost fistfight. She cried, I cried, whatever. \n\nFast forward to now and there's a court hearing my grandpa is going to for this stuff. My family has kept me out of the loop on purpose because of my stance, so I'm not 100% sure on the details - I know the EMTs had to be retrained and I think one of them was fired. I'm posting this because my sister turned her nose up to me when my grandpa mentioned it and said \"Might not want to talk about that here, \\[grandpa's name\\]. \\[My name\\] thinks we're all assholes for wanting justice for Mike. She didn't even go to the funeral!\" Obviously implying I'm an asshole, too. It was just the straw that broke the camels back, I guess.\n\nI didn't think I was an asshole, but I'm doubting myself - I don't think the day after he died was the right day to have a screaming match with my family, but I really well and truly believe they're pursuing justice for something that was just a horrible, awful mistake that those guys have to live with. I'm sort of the pariah of the family now (it was always that way but it's worse now) and I've been getting shit on by basically my whole family for the last 6 months. Is it really an asshole move to not want this? I only said my piece once, but my family won't let me forget it. \n\n&gt;!Sorry if this is one of those \"quit posting for validation\" posts everyone hates!&lt;",

      "title": "AITA for abruptly dropping a decent woman from my life",
      "description": "This happened a couple years ago but I still feel guilt about it.  Maybe four years ago I dated a woman for 3 months. She was by far the most beautiful, intelligent and successful woman I'd ever been with. Also, the sex was insanely good. It was clear to me (and probably her) from the get go that I was way more into her than she was into me. We had a great few months, but then one day she abruptly ended it with me. She couldn't explain why, and left open the possibility of us getting back together. I think things were just getting too serious too fast and she was recently divorced and didn't want to jump into something serious.\n\nI believe I handled that part well.  I was understanding, I didn't rant or rave, and we decided to be friends. After that I continued to hang out with her and sometimes her two sons, and we had a good time.  But after every time we got together, I'd sink into a depression for a couple days. It wasn't just seeing her, it was spending time with her kids. I don't have kids (I'm in my 40s), and regret not being a dad. We all got along well. Once her 8-year-old son was walking with me and without thinking took my hand, and once a waiter referred to me as \"dad\" when we were out together and it kind of broke my heart.\n\nAbout a year later I realized that I still had strong feelings for her, and I wrote a long email explaining that, and asking to get back together.  She never responded.  After a few months I reached out to her again, she apologized for ghosting but said she didn't know how to respond, and we went back to being the same way we were before.\n\nWe started hanging out together more, and then one day she texted me and asked if I wanted to do a couch to 5K. I thought about writing back, \"I will if you go on a date with me,\" or something like that. I asked a friend for advice and he told me it was never going to happen and I had to end it. And I did. I wrote her a text in which I said that I still had feelings for her and a bunch of other stuff and I wished her the best and I hope she meets someone who she wants to be with and goodbye. She wrote back something like, \"Fuck your sanctimonious bullshit.\"\n\nAnd that was the last I ever heard from her.  About a year later I wrote a long email to her apologizing for cutting things off so abruptly. The email made clear that I didn't want to restart things, I was just feeling a lot of guilt for how I ended it and felt the need to apologize. She never responded, of course. That was maybe a year ago and I still think about her a lot and still feel guilty for cutting things off like I did. This makes me think that ending things was the right thing because I was obviously way too into her, but what I feel guilty about was how I ended it – so abruptly, over text. Long ago I had a friend cut me out of her life abruptly like that and it really hurt. I hope this isn't a validation post, I really struggle with whether I was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It's annoying. I've told him to stop a hundred times, I've told him if he doesn't stop I won't talk to him. \n\nAnd just about four weeks ago, I finally I had enough and snapped at him. He said \"I don't see why you like him, he's annoying and a racist\" which he isn't. The freshman has said his MOM is racist, not him. I told my \"friend\" that even if I didn't like him, that doesn't give him the right to be a dick about it. \n\nHe didn't listen and two weeks ago I just stopped talking to him bc it got so annoying. I hang out with the kid and his other freshman friends, so if my old pal starts to bother him I can stop it, but otherwise, am I the asshole for just suddenly cutting contact?\n\nHe's tried to talk it out, but I just don't want to deal with it. He's sent mutual friends my way and once again, don't want to deal. He's even started telling them that IM lying and that he isn't bullying this kid. He's even managed to manipulate my best friend into believing him. The only way she will talk to me is if I make up with him, but i think that's stupid. All my friends are against me and I just don't understand why. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Kind of a long story but I feel like the background is needed. Please bear with me...\n\nMy mom is an alcoholic / addict and has been for as long as I can remember (I’m 25F). But to be honest with you, idk how many people could live her life and not be.\n\nShe’s had a rough life. She was married to my dad, who is a literal psychopath. And, as you can imagine, she had an abusive dad herself and an eff ton of horrific luck, including sexual assault by total strangers.\n\nSeeing pictures of her as a young woman break my heart because I feel like things could’ve turned out so differently. They didn’t, though, and she became neglectful / abusive herself. But unlike my dad, shes always loved us kids—and I believe that entirely. Which is why this is so hard.\n\nA few years back, my mom relapsed and almost died. My sister (15 at the time) was living alone with her. It was bad. (Without my dad around, it was bad neglect and not so much other forms of abuse.) My brother moved back home from school to take care of her while my mom went to rehab—I was already living hundreds of miles away.\n\nThe brunt of her recovery work fell on me, with her counselor wanting me to do things like write “impact letters” literally sharing the worst things she’s ever done to me. It was hell.\n\nDuring this time, my sister’s grades fell and she became extremely depressed and began acting out. I didn’t want my sister living with my mom anymore, but as my moms counselor put it, her entire identity is built on “being a mom.”\n\nMy sister and I got her accepted with a scholarship to a boarding school. My mom initially liked the idea but then freaked out and wouldn’t sign at the very end. My moms counselor and step-dad were furious at me. They believe “taking my sister away” would make my mom relapse and this time probably die.\n\nWe got into a fight about it and my step-dad said “do you want your mom to die? Do you care if your mom dies?” And I told him my priority was my sister’s well being and happiness. He (and my moms rehab counselor) have always insisted my sister’s life isn’t in danger (because it’s neglect and not horrible physical abuse) while my mom’s life is. My step-dad was absolutely repulsed when I said I valued my sister’s happiness over my mom’s life. \n\nMy sister never went to boarding school. But now, 3 years later, were repeating the process again with college.\n\nMy mom wants my sister to stay in town, but she wants to leave and I think that’s what she needs. That being said, I genuinely think my mom not having any children around will negatively impact her mental health and may lead to another relapse.\n\nMy mom sends me gifts and texts me sometimes and wishes she was a mom, and I really feel for her because her life has been so hard, but in my mind, she just never has been a mother. And this may be awful, but if my sister leaves, I don’t want to have to pick up the slack by having more of a relationship with my mom to prevent a relapse. I’m so tired of it all.\n\nAITA for wanting my sister to be happy and for not wanting to build more of a relationship with my mom, even if it’s possibly at the extent of my mom’s life?\n\n",

      "description": "This is my first time posting here, so bear with me.\n\nI have my steam profile up on a website where you play the party game Mafia with other people online. One of my close friends on said website saw that I play a game that he also plays (terraria).  He contacted me and thought it would be fun if we play together. \n\nI am a big fan of this game, and he was a little bit new. I was teaching him some good tricks and was really having some fun, but I felt uninvolved when it came to actually doing stuff together in this game because he was actively avoiding wanting to do other stuff (such as bosses) with me.\n\nWe were doing one of the harder bosses. I was preparing for this fight beforehand and I admit I rushed it. I didn’t give him any idea of what to do in the fight. I just gave him some potions and expected him to roll with it. He dies immediately, and I finished the boss. He got passive aggressive and told me to log off, and that he would do the boss again by himself. I apologized and left. \n\nA few days later, he invited me to play again. I got on and was really excited to continue from where we left off, but he went through the next 25% of the game and expected me to be prepared for the next fight. I was sad and mad, but I didn’t let that be known. I asked if he had anything to help me catch up and that he didn’t. I was sad because I missed out on a big portion of the game when I was expecting to spend that portion with him. He told me to get some items from other characters and I got some at like 1% higher than what he was currently at.\n\nHe starts the boss, and after we finished it he sees a weapon I used to do well in the fight and calls me a cheater because the weapon I got was one boss higher than the boss we were fighting, but it was still at the same level we were at. He gets mad at me and says he’ll fight the boss again by himself. I got mad and said “I’m not the only one who can do shit by them self” and “You might as well do the entire fucking game without me” because of what happened earlier. I haven’t contacted him since.\n\nI realize that it’s bad to get mad over a game, but I felt more mad at his actions rather than anything else. I really want to apologize because I realize that being petty is never the answer, but I want you guys’s opinion.\n\n",

She asked my wife if she could be a surrogate out of the blue and after days of thinking about everything she decided that she's gonna help her friend. I understand that their bond is huge and what she is doing is noble but I really don't wanna be a part of this.\n  \nI have a couple of reasons:\n1- My wife is gonna be pregnant with a kid that's not mine.    \n2- There could be complications or there is a possibility that she can have severe problems or outright die due to her existing conditions (Anemia).   \n3- I don't want to be helping her carry the baby for nine months just to give it away.  \n\n  \nAITA here? Honestly I tried telling her in the most gentle way possible that I'm absolutely not on board with this but she is stuck calling me a sexist and an asshole. I'd rather divorce than be a part of it and she knows it yet she still chose to do it. Any advice?\n\n",

      "description": "This boy who doesn’t go to the same college as me asked me to his lacrosse formal which is this Saturday. He’s the roommate/teammate of my roommate's boyfriend and we’ve only met in person once. Since meeting, we would snapchat a little, but lately not frequently at all.   \n\n\nHe mentioned the formal to me a couple weeks after meeting. He said that if we hung out again before the formal he wanted me to go with him. At this time, he didn’t officially ask me. He never mentioned when it was or anything else about it until tonight.   \n\n\nI kind of assumed that he wasn’t gonna actually ask me because we hadn’t hung out since our first initial meeting. I don’t have anything to wear since it’s such short notice and I know that if I go, I’m going to have to get with him (which I’m not sure I wanna do) so I made up some bullshit lie about my friend coming to visit this weekend (I was nice about it though I promise!). All he replied was “bet” and when I apologized again in reply he left me on opened.   \n\n\nThis gives me the impression that he assumed that these plans were already kind of set and that I’m fucking it up by saying no even though I never actually agreed to anything.  \n\n\nAm I an asshole for saying no? I feel like he assumed that I was going to be his date and so now I’m playing dumb in order to justify myself (“well we didn’t hang out again so I'm not going”).  \n\n\nI’m not explaining this very well, but I hope you know what I mean.   \n\n\nThanks!",

      "description": "This event took place around three years ago but it still to this day has made me question my character and thought I’d share for some emotional relief. \n\nI was in a year long relationship with this girl who I met from a guitar class I took Highschool. She seemed super cool at first, we shared a ton of common interests. I literally thought she was the near perfect match. We get to know each other and she tells me of some troubling issues from her past with unfaithful men she’s been in relationships with. I’m not that sort of guy, I consider the women in my life that I hold dear and how it would affect them if any man hurt them.  After a few months of serious talking and being close friends, we began a relationship.\n\nNear the end of the relationship we got into another argument and I forgot what it was for but I remember we talked it out and it ended up fine. However the next morning after, she doesn’t respond to my good morning text and this was a Friday.  I text her through out the day and no response not even a read receipt which she normally has on. Sunday night she finally gets back to me and says she just needed some “alone time” cause she felt she would easily get angry with me for the next few days since the last argument. I kinda get where she’s coming from. Monday I have class (we are in college btw). I get back and let her know how my day was, very brief convo. She didn’t get back to after my last text even though she was responding rather fast during the convo. I left my phone to charge while I ate dinner and forgot the convo and went straight to home office to do homework. I get back to my phone and see she had text me while I was eating and let her know that I left my phone in my room while I did homework. She responded with “it’s not like you cared to talk to me anyway”.... At this point I had absolutely lost my shit. Like that’s the response I get when you literally ignored me for almost 3 days. So I write a lengthy message (keeping my cool) on how I’m done tolerating this kind of shit and how hypocritical of her to even say that to me. I tell her that I love and care for her but it’s mentally exhausting on me when I’m constantly convinced I’m the bad guy when it’s pretty objective that she is at fault in some disagreements we have. She never responded to me after that but when I woke up the next morning with a few messages from her; one she accuses me of being verbally abusive. She said she deleted the conversation and demanded I send her screenshots cause she wanted to see a counselor to which she would show the messages to but next few hours I’m barraged with messages from her girlfriends telling me how awful I am. But I doubt she showed them all the horrible things she has said to me. I do admit I was aggressive in how a responded to her the night before but not towards her but to how she was treating me and I made that really clear for her. Since then I’ve wondered if I’m really as toxic as she made me seem to be. ",

      "description": "Okay, so backstory. I was friends with this girl 3 years ago after we went overseas for college. We really bonded and I thought I had a friend.\n\n So fast forward about a year or so and being friends with her litterally felt like I was a mirror. It was always \"take pictures of me\" \"wow I'm so hot\" \"me, me, me\". She would interrupt me when I would try and steer the conversation away from her, but she would just snap it right back to her. \n\nShe was in to cosplay and she would make me her personal photographer. So, I got tired of it and confronted her about it and she called me a bitch and told me she had to constantly walk on eggshells around me (which is how I felt with her btw). And we were fine for a couple of weeks. \n\nIn the meantime, there was this guy we were in a class with (separate classes). The guy, who we will call John, and I were both set up to be partners for international students for the week they were at our college. She saw us together and the pictures that came from the reception, and she ignored me for 2 weeks because she thought John and I were dating. (he liked 2D girls more). \n\nI had to ask HER what was wrong and she made it to be my fault. After that, I decided to break off the friendship silently. And haven't directly heard from her since, but our mutual friends tell me things like.\n\"Oh, yeah she shits talks about how you're horrible friend\" and \"She thinks you're toxic\". \n\nAny thoughts?\n\nOn mobile btw so sorry for format.

      "title": "AITA for planning a trip without my boyfriend and then getting mad that he's planning one without me?",
      "description": "Hi guys. Throwaway with some details changed because my friends use reddit and they would recognize me. \n\nSome background: my boyfriend (M30) and I (F25) have been together for 3 years. I'm in medical school and my boyfriend is in finance, so we both have pretty crazy schedules. Also, things have been tough lately since I'm studying for my boards. For anyone who doesn't know, the boards the most difficult thing you do in med school, and your score essentially decides your future and what residency you can get into. I'm under the most pressure of my entire life, so I've been in a bit of a panic the last few weeks. \n\nNow for the story: My favorite band is playing in San Francisco in August, and I really want to go see them. I knew my boyfriend wouldn't really want to go on this trip for a couple of reasons: he doesn't like to go places he's already been, and we already took a trip to see this band at my request. I didn't think this would be an issue since we frequently go on weekend trips without each other. Our schedules and interests don't always align, and I don't have any issues with us taking separate weekend trips. However, we always have planned our big vacations together. \n\nLast weekend, I brought up the concert to him like this: \"Hey, I want to go see XX band because you know I love them. My friends and I talked about going for the weekend. I would love if you came with us, but I understand if that isn't something you want to do.\" His reaction was furious, he went off on me for being selfish and not \"making joint decisions.” He never told me whether he wanted to come, and I couldn't get a straight answer out as to why he was upset with me about this particular trip. This went on for a few days. Since I've been super stressed due to the pressure I've been under, I asked him to drop it for now. I haven't seen him since the fight, and I've barely heard from him this week (which is unusual, we usually text constantly and stay over each others' places every night). \n\nThis morning I called him because I was upset about my studying and was thinking I might have to change my schedule around to have more time to prepare. I mentioned this to him and he got very defensive with me. When I asked why, he said \"I'm planning a trip to Costa Rica this summer.\" This came out of nowhere and I asked when he decided this. His response was \"Since you don't take me into consideration for your plans, why should I take you into consideration for mine?\" I got really upset with him and ended up hanging up the phone. \n\nI feel like these two things are nowhere near the same. To me, taking weekend trips with our friends is one thing but it's another to use his only vacation time to plan a trip without even discussing it with me. Furthermore, I feel like he's only doing it to be petty and make a point. I shouldn't have hung up on him, but I'm so stressed out and it's frustrating to me that he can't let things go when I really need support. So reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "My fiance and I have a complicated relationship. We met in highschool and instantly got really close to eachother. Our relationship did have a lot of ups and downs because we were both still figuring ourselves out while dating, neither one of us was really prepared for a relationship to be honest. Despite this we continued to date, causing the relationship to become toxic/unhealthy. \n\nEventually I caught her lying and figured out that she was cheating. I confronted her and she admitted she met some guy 2 weeks ago, had been with him physically, and wants to be with him, ending our two year relationship. I do admit I was a shitty boyfriend at the time but in my opinion, that does not excuse cheating. \n\nAfter a year apart, we got back on speaking terms and slowly started to find mutual ground. Occasional conversations turned into constant conversations and before we knew it we were back together. Since we had both done tons of growing, we were better together now. There were still issues of course, as any relationship has, but for the most part it was smooth sailing. \n\nBeing cheated on seriously scarred me, changing me in many ways. I went from being an extrovert to an introvert. I refused to open up to anyone &amp; chose to deal with my emotions myself. Honestly I can only really express primitive emotions. I do my best to talk about things but I visibly struggle and this really bothers her. She hates how I deal with things myself and feels like she should be there to help me with everything. I understand her point of view but I just prefer to handle it alone.\n\nFast forward to today, in our culture, it's her \"time\" to get married. I was basically given an ultimatum, marry her or break up. As a 21 year old who's still in college and doesn't even own a vehicle, I find this ridiculous. I just don't understand how I'm expected to handle all this responsibility when I'm still grinding college and working a minimum wage job. Furthermore, although we do love eachother we're not \"in love\". Of course I care for her a fuck ton but when I'm told to picture my future wife, I don't picture her right away. I asked her to tell me why she wants to marry me &amp; honestly, neither one of us has a solid reason apart from our history. Despite this she's still adamant on getting married, maybe she's lying? I don't know. \n\nWe're now one year away from the wedding, both our families are involved and our marriage has basically been announced to the world (well our mutual world). She now brings up wedding plans often which visibly disgruntles me. Last night after she kept pressing me to try and explain why I get like this and I finally told her the truth as best as I can. \n\nI'm not ready to get married, mentally or financially. I feel like I have so much left to do and there's no way I can handle this level of responsibility in this stage of life. I also told her, growing up I always dreamt about my post-uni bachelor's life. Buying my first car, going on road trips with all my best friends. Of course if I'm having to sacrifice a childhood dream on top of taking on a lot more than what I feel like I can handle, I'm going to be pissed. Despite this I told her losing her would hurt a lot so I'm prepared to choose her but she can't expect me to be all sunshine and flowers. \n\nShe dismissed my feelings, told me I'm a disrespectful dumbasss, so on and so forth. \n\nAITA for feeling this way and letting her know about it? Should I not be feeling this way at all? Should I have confessed this all to her earlier before everyone was informed of our wedding rather than finding the words for it now?\n",

      "description": "Please first and foremost understand that I am not in the slightest homophobic or against gay rights or anything of the sort. My sister is lesbian and I had no problem accepting that. I have several gay friends and we treat each other no different than straight friends. \n\nNow today my sister and I somehow came across the discussion of what happens if my son (my wife is 20 weeks along her pregnancy with him!) turned out to be gay. Well I said to her I hope he isn’t, but if he were I would still accept him the way he is. My sister BLEW UP and accused me of bigotry and that I was “closet rejecting” her lesbianism this whole time. I tried my best to assure that is not the case and that I believe there is nothing wrong with simply hoping your child is not gay, I would just prefer if my son could have a biologic child with a wife, in the same way my wife and I are having him. The way I think about this is like if I owned a business and I hoped one day my son would take over it, now if he didn’t that’s fine I would love him all the same and he can choose any career he likes but there is nothing wrong in my eyes with having a preference for that to begin with, the same way someone can like chocolate over vanilla ice cream but no harm no foul if their son does not.

      "description": "**Background**\n\nI live in the UK. I have two children who will soon be two and four years old. Before my oldest starts school (this September) my wife and I were planning on taking the children to Florida for two weeks to Disney World, etc. This was to be timed so that we went at a quiet (ish) time of the year outside of school holidays.  \nI don't think we had mentioned this plan to my mum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mum has recently said that for her 70th birthday she would love to take the family (mum, dad, me, wife, kids (2 &amp; 4), my sister, sister's kids (9 &amp; 11)) to Disney World, etc. She would pay for all of the children's flights, tickets, etc... Adults would pay for themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would have to coincide with my sister's children's Easter school holidays (first two weeks of April).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis sounds pretty good - we were already planning on going and though the start of April is busier than we would have liked it's really not too bad since we just miss the US Easter holidays. The timing does make flights a lot more expensive than it would be at our ideal time, but with my mum paying for the children the price kind of evens out (for us).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The quandry**\n\nThe problem is that my wife is unable to take off the first week of any month due to her work commitments. She's asked several times, but can't get the time off approved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur only option would be to fly out for the second week (when flights are even more ridiculously priced) and then either only go for one week total, or stay for a further week on our own but with full-on Easter crowds everywhere. I'm told, and my research corroborates, that the parks are going to be absolutely rammed for April 13th onwards due to Easter.   \n\n\n**Our position**\n\nAfter much, much debate, I've told my mum that we don't want to go on this holiday and would prefer to go at a different time on our own as previously planned because:\n\n* After travelling from the UK, one week is too short to visit all of the parks and other things that we want to take the kids to\n* If we stay for two weeks, the second week is essentially written off (for going to parks) because:\n   * I think it will simply be far too crowded to go with a two year old and a four year old (and actually enjoy ourselves)\n      * I think I'll be constantly stressed about losing them in the crowds\n   * Queue times will be far too long for them to cope with\n      * I don't want to have to explain to two young children that they have to wait 30+ minutes in a line to go on the teacups or that we have to hang around for an hour before we can have something to eat.\n* If we go on this holiday we won't ever have another chance to go outside of school holidays\n   * I think that this is the real thing that's getting to me. I want them to have a wonderful time where we can take our time and not have to worry about cramming things in in the first week before it goes crazy, and we'll never have the opportunity to do that again once they start school.\n\nWe'll happily go somewhere else closer to home for the week where we can overlap holiday times if that would work for everyone. My parents, my sister, and her kids (we weren't invited as we didn't have kids at the time, I guess), have already previously been to Florida before so it's not like I'm ruining their one chance to go there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family is suggesting that we just takes the kids to a beach for the second week, but as I say above, I don't think that it gives us enough time at the parks as we'd prefer to take our time and not cram it in. I presume that the beaches will be rammed then too anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife and I have been arguing because we don't want to let my mum down, but don't want to compromise on what we were planning for our children either. My wife has been crying because she's so upset at the position we're in - she's considered quitting her job so that we can go on the same dates as everyone else. I don't want to put my wife in this position.  \n\n\n**Why I feel like IMBTA**\n\nMy mum has her heart set on this magical whole-family holiday and I feel really bad to be saying no to it and letting her down. She hardly ever asks for anything.  \n\n\n**So.. judgement time**\n\nAITA? Am I being selfish and using the kids and the impact of the Easter crowds as an excuse?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So about 6 years ago I met my friend, he moved to my town and started going to school with me, and he wasn’t very sociable and was shy. Same person as me so I quickly found common ground with him in video games. So one day we exchanged PlayStation names and started playing Minecraft for multiple years had a world whatever, all good fun.\n\nFlash Forward to the last few years and we still play video games still talk. But his toxicity became clear quick. It started as jokes and when he came out and said he was depressed. \n\nWhen he came out to me and our friend group as depressed it didn’t truly come as a a shock knowing how he acted and his family wasn’t the greatest but his made around with it so it was whatever. But then it progressively got worse when he got to memes, and other stupid shit such as simple conversations. He even would bring it into video games. Saying shit like, “holy fuck you guys are the worst group of gamers I have ever played with” or “I know PlayStation sucks, but [ one of the friends group members] you fucking suck” and now we know we aren’t the greatest but not terrible but we also know where the line draws.\n\nSo today while playing with him, we were playin BO3 Zombies since I refuse to get BO4 and I went down a few times, even forgot to revive him one round because I was trying to save my ass so we didn’t lose, but out of nowhere a few matches in he screams through his mic “ Holy shit fuck can you just fucking help me complete this Easter Egg, you waste of fuck. I don’t understand why you downloaded this game if you suck this much” \n\nI sat there appalled and confused, I left the game, muted my mic, and walked around my room for minute, unmuted my mic and asked him a question I think it was, “the fuck was that for dude?” No response, and then I heard a slight you heard me fuck head, and slight shit my bad under his breathe. \n\nI had it, I went off on him. Told him that he had no right to fucking come at me and call me shit for no reason, and that he was a toxic piece of shit asshole that didn’t deserve my friendship if he was gonna keep this shit up. \n\nHe quickly responded that it was just a joke that I shouldn’t have taken seriously cause we are friends, I left the party and turned off PS4, later I unadded him and am not sure if I want to add him back.\n\nSo AMITA? Also TL;DR: Me and friend were playing BO3 Zombies and he got pissed for no reason, called me terrible and shouldn’t have downloaded the game, told him he was toxic and a piece of shit ",

One time my boss asked me if she could borrow my earpods for work purposes and I made an excuse that I left mine at home, next day she saw me using it so I didn’t have any excuse and let her borrow it. Fast forward she came to me and told me she lost my earpods. Apparently, someone stole it when she left it at her station. She assured me that she will just replace it. I asked her if she’s sure because it was kinda expensive and that she should try looking for it maybe she just misplaced it. She  was like “How much is it? I know it’s original, I’m the one who lost it so I should replace it. I don’t have a choice. Where can I buy it? I’ll just give you the money.” So today I went to a power mac center it was $33.98, told my boss, I can see she’s kinda shocked. She said “MF that’s expensive.!”She asked me if it’s okay if she will just give me  $10 to buy an earphone, told her she should buy the same one she lost. In the first place, she’s the one who promised that. Earlier she keeps on joking in front of our team that it was too much of me to make her pay for something brand new and that she should just replace it with a 2nd hand. She also jokes about how she would grade me lower and that she have to use her money from her savings, if it was really original blah blah blah.  I know it’s a joke but she’s been going at it the entire shift every time she sees me and it’s starting to annoy me. Although on a serious tone she asked me several times if I am really going to make her pay. Now I’m actually the not the type of person to do this. I’m a shy and quiet person but i’m trying to get out of my comfort zone by saying what I really want and learning how to say no. Is it really too much to make her replace it with a brandnew earpods?

I’m pretty disappointed because I can’t play when my parents get home, my set up is in the living room and talking over PS4 would be too loud. But hey, atleast they won’t drive home drunk. I hop in my car, throw on some music and drive pretty fine the whole way there. I’m able to get myself in a good mood fast. I like to drive at night. I pull up at the casino around midnight. I walk in and find my dad and...\n“Why are you here?”\n     Mom had not told him I was coming to get them. So he’s extremely upset. I walk away and find mom and she’s excited to see me. I tell her that dad is upset that we are leaving and she’s confused too. \n“We aren’t leaving.” And tries to give me money to play.\n     The next THREE HOURS are spent with them yelling at me about how I need to be there for them when they can’t drive home. Which...I was.\nI tell them that I had a night planned and that sets them off. On and on for hours, even after we are finally home about how they provide me shelter and heat, how they work more than me and deserve their Saturday night!!\n    I did not take their Saturday night. They called me there. I feel like I am doing crazy. I really do feel like I’ve lost my mind. I’ve been crying on and off since we got home. They keep yelling at me whenever they see me.\n     Like? Yes. I live in their home past 18, I don’t work as much as them. Does that mean that I am the asshole for wanting a Saturday night to relax too?\n     I’m perfectly fine getting them if they need me, but I feel like it’s different. They didn’t need me, she just tried to trick me into hanging out at the casino with them. Which I didn’t want. I should get to spend my Saturday night how I want. They are acting as if I completely destroyed their night by showing up when they asked me to and then being sad when they wouldn’t leave.\n\ntldr: I live at home at 20, my parents told me to come pick them up because they were drunk and couldn’t drive home from the casino. When I showed up they wouldn’t leave for three hours, and are calling me an asshole for not being cool and wanting to hang out at the casino with them. I had a night of video games with my friends planned that I canceled to go get them.\n",

      "description": "First off, on mobile so sorry if formatting sucks. This is probably gonna be long.\n\nAs a bit of background, my fiancée and I are both trans, and we're expecting a baby in 8 weeks.\n\nMy fiancée is bipolar, and unmedicated. She blames her insurance lapsing a while back a lot of the time, but refused to actually make an appointment with a therapist despite promising to do so repeatedly.\nTo combat her symptoms, she decides to smoke weed. A lot. Which is legal, but she's bought $100 worth of weed in the past two weeks, when we're struggling to finish getting ready for our daughters arrival. \nIncluding buying from a ex-prostitute that she cheated on me with for pills while I was on bed rest due to bleeding early into the pregnancy.\nI am currently not working due to medical issues, and am enrolled in a program to see if I can qualify for cash assistance to help pay our bills.\n\nOnto today;\nWe went out to her friends house so she could pick up. I had to pick up new maternity pants and such for uniform requirements, so I went with her. She got mad that I had to try on clothes and snapped at me for \"saying everything so loudly\" when I asked what her problem was, calling me a cunt and storming off. Now, I am autistic, and sometimes have volume control problems, so maybe I was being loud. I'm not sure on that part. But she was pissed because I was taking too long trying to find fitting clothes. \nI was relieved she wasn't getting from the dealer she cheated with, but it ended up being an hour away. And we ended up having to sit there an hour and a half because he wasn't home from church yet, and wouldnt answer his phone. When he finally showed up, they went on for ten minutes and then we left for another hour ride home in the dark.\nI hadnt eaten all day, which is on me, but I didn't think we would be gone all day either.\nWe got home, and she decided to smoke with everyone and told me to pick a movie for after, since I cant hang out while they smoke because of the baby.\nAnd I snapped at her about how we were supposed to be cleaning today and finishing cleaning and setting up the baby's things in case she comes early, because she's promised to help me for two weeks now. So I stormed away, and immediately felt bad for snapping, and about ten minutes later apologised for snapping while she sat and looked dejected because I didn't want to watch a movie with her. I still feel bad, but am currently trying to cool off alone because I dont want the stress effecting the baby.\n\nI really didn't mean to upset her, and I know there are things she cant help due to her bipolar, and I feel bad for snapping when I should've kept a more level head.\nSo what's the word, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hi everyone. If y’all want a bit more detail, I made a similar post to relationship advice but would also like all of your inputs.\n\n\nBasically, through 2.5 years of college so far I have spent every break with my parents. This spring I would like to spend my 1-week spring break with my boyfriend. His birthday will be during that week and considering we are long distance when I’m away at school, we would both like to maximize time together when possible. \n\n\nMy parents are the ones actually submitting the money for my college but the money is mostly coming from a fund from my grandparents. Besides that and staying at my parents house for most of the time i’m at home, I am financially independent. I am able to pay for any transportation during spring break.\n\n\nI don’t plan on ditching my parents all the time starting now. I simply would like to spend one break with someone else as I’ve been with my parents for basically 20 years straight. \n\n\nMy parents are telling me that I need to or should spend the break with them and that I don’t need to spend time with my boyfriend. \n\n\nAITA for wanting to not hang out with my parents for this one break? Similarly, AITA if I try to reason with my parents or outright telling them I won’t see them during the break? Thank you!",

I've been with my boyfriend for a little under 2 years now, and we were planning on going on our first road trip during this time. Our original plan was to go to Zion national park in Utah, but then we changed it up and decided to go Pheonix/Sedona/Flagstaff (AZ) then Vegas (NV). \n\nNot too long ago, my bf found out that he was no longer eligible for his student loan and isn't receiving it anymore. No money = no road trip. I'm definitely not mad at him even though his situation sucks and puts me in a suckish position. When I told my mom (who I'm super close with), she said she would be down to go on a road trip with me instead, preferably to Vegas. She is usually the person I go to for advice on my personal conflicts, but she suggested it so now I don't know what to think.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I went to Vegas with my mom, even though I was planing on going with my bf until circumstances changed? \n\nI just want to play Top Golf. *\\*sigh\\**",

      "description": "I am a 25/F. My parents have been divorced since I was two years old. I grew up with two families but never fit into either side of my family. I was always different. No one else was born from both my parents like I was. I’ve known both my step parents for 20 years. \n\nMy dads family is very wealthy and they constantly go on vacation and invite me last minute. I’m never involved in the planning. So therefore I can’t ask off work in time to go. I live three hours away and went to college three hours away from them and they hardly visited me. They always visited my stepmoms son in college who lived ten hours from them. My brothers on that side get BMWs, vacations, concert tickets constantly, nice dinners, etc. \n\nMy mom and my stepdad took my sister and her boyfriend at the time to Cabo last year. I wasn’t even informed they were there until I called them and they told me they were at the time share. I asked my mom what the fuck? And she said sorry I thought you and your sister would fight. I said no. We get along just fine.... I would have paid for the trip if I would have known about it. My mom is a penny pincher when she can be. \n\nI got so upset at my mom today when she told me that her my stepdad my sister and her new bf are all going on a cruise together. She said she looked for another room but it didn’t work that way in that you couldn’t get a room with just one person instead of a couple. I told her that’s bull. She then told me that it would be weird cause I would be a fifth wheel. I told her again, if it’s about money I will pay. I just want to hangout with my family and feel included since I never felt included my entire life with my family. Fuck. They visit my sister every other weekend for her volleyball tournaments ten hours away and they hardly would drive thirty minutes into town to see me where I live. I planned a dinner date with them earlier last week and my mom tried changing the date of the dinner the day of for some bullshit reason. I told her I wouldn’t cause of work. \n\nI cried and told her no one ever includes me in anything hardly or seems to see me as anything more than a financial burden so that’s why I tried to separate from my family and be financially independent at a young age cause I didn’t want to bother them any more than I had to. \n\nI’m a child of divorce and my parents used me as a messenger to discuss issues they had between. I could see at a young age I was an emotional and burden. I didn’t ever speak up about anything ever because I didn’t want to make anyone more uncomfortable or upset because I just knew my existence caused discomfort to my family. \n\nSo am I the asshole for being upset about this?

He's been using my Xbox account to play with his friends since then, and I have only used my account here and there on my 360 and my PC.\n\n Well, I finally got an Xbox One S for at my mom's house, and I had told him a while ago that if I ever got one, I'd be taking my account back. (It has a lot of my digital purchases and such on it). But now that I have my Xbox, he's not giving up my account. He told me earlier today that he was trying to make a new account, but he kept getting an error, and he said that he's been trying all day. I know he's lying because I was able to get on the website just fine. \n\nAnyway I've decided that I'd had enough and I changed the password without telling him, so I ask you, am I the asshole for that?",

      "description": "I am in a class that requires a mini group project and a main group project. At the beginning of the semester, my two friends and I agreed to be in a group for both. Groups could be max three people. So the mini project comes along and we all do an equal share of work. No issues. A week later my grandpa passes away and I take the next day to grieve. I inform them that I cannot make it to the meeting that day and why. One expresses her sympathy, we'll call her E and the other one G. Later that day, E told me sh'ed be doing the main project with someone else and that I'd have two days to find a new person before groups had to be submitted. I double checked with G to see if we would still be in a group and she said no she was doing it alone. I went back to E to ask if I could be the third person in her new group considering I was under the impression that we were in a group and everyone else had groups. Her new partner  refused to entertain the idea. I do not know why as she and I had never really interacted before.\n\nThe next mini project meeting to split up the work was two days later and I did not attend as I was still grieving. I admit I was an AH and did not tell them I was not going. I reached out the next day asking what I needed to do. Flash forward, I do my part and leave some comments that I needed input on before I could finish. The next meeting I had to come an hour late to because of work, which I explained in advance. By the time I got there, they had completed erased my section and rewrote it. They told me it would fit better in the results section, but they didn't save it and I did not remember what I wrote. We redistributed the remaining sections. E wanted it done that same day, 5 days before it was due. I said I couldn't but if they needed me to, I could have it done the next day. I was not given a response. My section not being done didn't affect the ability to write the other sections. I didn’t get a chance to until today, 2 days before it's due. I get a message saying they are going to print the final draft. I said I still needed to add the one section, which would take all of 15 minutes. This is when I get told they already wrote it.\n\nThey never told me they needed it done Friday or checked in to remind me if they were under the impression it was going to be. I am annoyed that my name is going to be attached to something I had no input in. I don’t want credit for something I didn’t do. I told them that after this is turned in, I no longer wish to have contact with them. E came to see me asking what she had done wrong. I wasn't in the state of mind to have a civil conversation. Even if I tell her what upset me, would I be wrong to cut them off since I feel I can no longer trust them  ",

      "description": "I recently went into a chain hair salon to get a haircut. So I check in online, head over, really nice lady cuts my hair, we talk a little about movies and plans and stuff, everything goes great. Great haircut, looks good, I have every intention of tipping 20%. At this particular establishment, haircuts are $15, so 20% would be $3.\n\nAnyway, once she is done cutting my hair, we walk over to the register and I realize I don’t have any singles in my wallet. I end up paying with a 20, hoping to get some singles in change. Instead, I get a 5 dollar bill, so I decide against giving her anything extra and I leave.\n\nOn the way home, I started to feel really bad about not tipping the lady. When I got home, I texted somefriends about it and asked what they thought. Some said it was the lady’s mistake that she gave me a 5 instead of singles, so I didn’t have to tip. Others said I should’ve asked for singles instead of a 5. It’s kind of been bothering me for a little while, and I feel like I need some more opinions on the matter.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA? Should I have asked for singles instead of just taking the 5?",

      "description": "I'll make try to make this short.  I \\[M50\\] recently got transferred to a new unit (IT) within my uni.   I was in academic system support, so I worked with a lot of sensitive egos, so I know when and where to use certain language and am very sensitive to workforce diversity.  The workplace I work in now are a bunch of ex-systems guys (there is literally three women and two are assistants) who have created a toxic \"smack you in the ass attaboy\" kind of environment that is full of sex, age, and any other discriminatory language you can think of.  \n\nI've got a few years under my belt and I have heard so much stuff slung around, so...most of the time I brush it off.  But lately, I have been getting the \"old guy\" schtick from the new 30 yo recently promoted Tech-Wiz manager (we will refer to him as TW).  This is the guy  who definitely knows his stuff, but has the mentality of a 20 yo drunken rugby player.   Type of guy who has zero respect for experience and thinks \"old guys\" should just shut up and retire.     He and a few of his cohorts (including one of our PMs)  have created a real \"boys club\" gang who looks to make fun of and exploit any differences.  Basically, public humiliation for the LOLs.    \n\nSo, today,  I go to ask a question in PM's office that is from a VP.  High priority get it know stuff.  Everyone knows this kind of request.  TW is standing in his office and I stand outside for a second to hear they are shooting the shit about football or something totally unrelated to work.  PM asked me what I needed and TW says \"He doesn't need anything\" and literally slams the door in my face.  I can hear them chuckle behind the door.  I say whatever and walk off.  They open the door and do that \"C'mon man, I was just joking.\"  I was pissed and just asked him, \"Do you have to work at being such a dick or does it just come naturally?\"  I got the \"what?\" reaction from a few people, but most of my office (I said it just load enough) just smiled as they knew what was what and had been treated the same by TW.  PM followed me back to my office and was telling me, \"Sorry about that, man.  You know...it was just a joke.\"  I said, maybe, but young buck needs to figure out how to speak to people and not try to humiliate everyone based upon his own social insecurities.   \n\nSo, it has created a real tension in the office and I am now waiting on my manager to come back (who is also's TW's manage) to come back for a discussion.  Seems that the \"conflict\" has created tension, but I am afraid I am about to get railroaded as they are all members of the same team.  For obvious reasons, I keep tons of written notes and audio recordings of encounters, so there is a history of racist, homophobic, and ageism.  Especially before TW got promoted (he is trying really hard to be a good boy.)\n\nI am not out to get this guy fired and I am not sure where the conversation will go, but I'm tired of these young tech-bro's .  Fuck 'em.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

When he got out he seemed chill and better before he went away, but after a month or so he went back to his old ways of stealing candy, running from the police etc...  (Nothing to bad). But it got worse over the last few months, Our dog Baya gave birth to 15 baby puppies and we plan on keeping one and giving another to my grandma, lately he's been referring to his friends as his dogs (he  contributed nothing towards raising them) and says he plans on selling all of my puppies. Everyone in the house disagrees with him but he won't listen, every so often hell try (and sometimes succeds) at taking a few to his friends house. Lately he's been telling us that he'll \"find them homes\" But the problem is they're still going and not ready to be given away yet. Our family has gotten fed up with his shit and whe he's gone my siblings (and sometimes parents) will consult with each other about what we should do about him. We've constantly told him that if he doesn't stop well kick him out and hell be homeless and won't be able to support himself (hence why I said he works at subway). We all eventually decided we're going to get rid of him in about 2-4 months. When he heard about this he started rambling saying stuff like \"I have other places I could live\" And \"you guys are assholes\".we do feel bad about this but we also know he'll go right back to being his former self. \n\nSo please tell me redditors, are we the assholes? \n\n(If you have any questions please ask I'll try to respond as truthfully as I can) ",

      "description": "Context: I’m 17 and from a Mexican-American family with divorced parents, but live with my mom, younger sister (14). and older brother. Since my parents’ divorce though, I’ve felt the need to step up as a somewhat head of the house due to my older brother not caring about the happenings in our household, and my mother not knowing much English.  \n\nFor about the past two years, my sister’s behavior has changed so dramatically to the point that she’s tried running away, disappearing for hours at a time without telling anyone to go with her boyfriend, stealing money from my mom’s purse, and even attempting suicide. My sister and my mom are constantly fighting (at times getting physical) over what each of them is allowed to do: sister claiming that my mom’s doesn’t want her to be happy and she should be free to do whatever makes her happy; mom claiming that she’s an out of control street rat who doesn’t care at all about anyone/anything, not even herself. My dad still lives in town, and is used as a threat by my mom, but my siblings and I are so turned against him that it doesn’t work as a threat anymore on her. Each of them are incredibly unhappy and childish at times, but each of their arguments seem somewhat valid yet wrong at the same time so I can’t side most times.\n\nI’ve always been the mediator in our family as I’m the most rational and least temperamental, but over time have gotten backlash from both sides for supporting the other. Attempting to deal with all of this at home plus my own problems at school has just devastated me mentally to where I’ve been seeking help and have been instructed now to not meddle in their situation anymore. But since I’ve always been the one to “fix” and work out since my parents separated, my mom just always expects me to be on her side and back her up no matter what, despite the drawbacks doing so has on me and my own relationship with my sister/siblings. She depends way too much on me and seeing as how I’ll be gone for college before too long, it’s not good for anybody. \n\nI just don’t want to care anymore. No matter how much I just want either side to understand each other.  But I just can’t anymore- it’s not good for me. Am I the asshole for backing out of this situation- even though my mom would have no one and the situation would still be just as broken? \n\nTL,DR: Mom and sister constantly fighting over what each of them want. I’m always the mediator, but don’t want to have to play that role anymore due to declining mental health. Am I the asshole for backing out of the situation? ",

I have also been friends with him for many years so he has seen my hair go through all of it’s phases. \n\nThe other day I bought some dark blue hair dye, I knew I didn’t want to do anything too drastic to my hair but wanted a change, so decided this would be a good colour to go for. I texted my boyfriend that I was going to dye my hair and he just replied ‘right ok’ - I knew something was wrong. He then went on to tell me how he prefers me with natural hair and looking more natural (no piercings ect). I instantly got upset and began to cry, I just feel that my hair is a big part of me, it’s how I express myself and it gives me confidence that I otherwise definitely lack.

      "description": " I have a female coworker named “Steph”. Steph and I have never really seemed to get along, but we work well together. We have clashed a few times over a myriad of issues, but we mostly make it through the day, and are both experienced in our field.\n\nSo anyway, one day an auditor came in for a surprise inspection, and unfortunately, I was dinged for a few items. No big deal really. My supervisor educated me on it, and I learned from my mistake. During this time, I thought of a pretty neat idea that all my teammates could participate in, so that we don’t repeat the errors I was dinged for in the first place. I would make “swear jar” type or contest in which all employees had to throw in a dollar every time a particular infraction took place. It was fun and everyone seemed receptive to it, and in about two weeks we had about $15 in the jar. It was undecided what we would do with the money, but for sure it was going to be for something fun for the whole team, like a pizza party or a team outing.\n\nSo one day I come into work and I notice that the jar was empty. I found out through some coworkers that Steph emptied the jar, and spent the money on “sodas for lunch.” Apparently, our supervisor bought everyone pizza one day, but no drinks. Steph was a little upset about this, so she used the jar money on beverages for the team. I was visibly upset about this and approached Steph the next time we worked together to ask to her to please return the money. She replied “Well, our supervisor neglected to buy us beverages for the pizza, so I used the money for that”. I reminded her that the jar money was not for that purpose, and to please return the money. Steph then replied “Once our supervisor pays me the money she owes me for the party rentals, I’ll return the jar money” (At this point I should mention that we had our Xmas party at Steph’s house. Apparently she rented some tables and chairs for the party, and our supervisor was supposed to pay her back for the rentals, but never did.) I told her that I have nothing to do with that, this is a separate issue, and she still refused.\n\nTime goes by, she got reimbursed for the chairs, and I repeatedly asked Steph to return the money, and she still refuses. For what reason, I don’t know. I tried everything, reasoning with her, publicly shaming her, etc. Finally, after many months, (seriously) I had enough and told our supervisor about Steph taking the money, and refusing to pay it back. Finally, after a lot of back in forth, Steph returns the money. But now, quite a few people at work are upset at me for “making a big deal out of it” and getting Steph in trouble. I personally don’t care about the backlash, and it’s the principle of the matter that matters to me. Some of my coworkers even told me “I can’t believe you made such a big deal over $15” And now I am second guessing my decision to tell my supervisor.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "So my little brother calls me 6 days before his wedding just to \"tell\" me about him having a wedding. He doesn't ask if I want to go, no invitation, nothing of the sort.\n\nHe says, \"Hey I'm getting married next Sunday and I just want to give you the heads up\"! I promptly congratulate him and because it was a last minute notice, I assume that it's a simple courthouse marriage. However, I was startled when he says he's having a wedding... WTF right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add to that, he tells me it's on a whim because he's shipping out for the Air Force in 8 days and wants to get married right before going. He is doing it for the benefits as you get more going in married so I can understand all that.\n\nHe also adds that the bride's family wants something big for their daughter so that is why they are having a wedding. Again, I can understand the thing with the bride and her family, but why tell me just 6 days prior to? Is it actually possible to prepare a wedding that fast?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would also like to add that I live overseas but very flexible so I can go to my brother's wedding even with the late notice, but as I continue to talk to my brother, the conversation is just chit-chat. Not once does he ask if I want to come. We chat for about an hour and the invite never came. So I got the message that I'm not invited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning, my mother calls and she tells me to just go. I'm reluctant but the benefits of going totally outweigh not going. So I go online and reserve a ticket. unfortunately, as I was reserving a ticket, I realized that my passport expired. How unlucky is that with just 5 days to go before the wedding!!! I'm pissed! \n\nNow I'm working on trying to renew my passport but it has to be a life or death emergency to get it renewed in a day. I even contacted an old colleague who works for the State Dept. but it doesn't look promising. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs family, this whole thing with my brother telling me about the wedding last minute and not inviting me really upsets me? He and his fiance had to plan this ahead of time right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, for the benefit of the doubt I bit the bullet and called him back and asked him directly if he actually wants me to go and he says yes.\n\nI tell him, \"thank you for the invite, I wish you said that last night! Btw, my passport expired but I'm working on it\". He tells me that it's fine if I can't make it because it was so last minute. I reply, \" Yes it is last minute but it would have been so much better if you let me know about your wedding much earlier.\"    \n\nI didn't expect anything after saying that but I think that was the trigger that blew him up. He was yelling so much that I could not understand most of what he was saying. From this point on, it's a one way conversation of him bringing up past drama I don't even care about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; so with just 6 days notice (5 days now) AITA for saying it would have been better if you let me know earlier?",

      "description": "Bear with me, this is a long story. I should start this off by saying I am a young male who met a young female in college a few years ago, pretty standard. \n\nWe met at the very end of freshman year, and became fairly close friends, her and some of our friends went out a couple times to grab coffee and talk about life. The next year, she transferred to another college about 40 minutes away and we fell out of touch. About a year later, a friend and I visited her for a weekend but we kind of fell out of touch again after that.\n\nFast forward to early this year, she commented on one of my snap stories and we started talking again. She told me about some rough drama she was going through with a shitty ex and her friends who encouraged his manipulative behavior, I’ll spare you the details. I gave her some advice and we started talking again pretty regularly, every day.\n\nAs for the dynamic between us, I always assumed we were just friends since although I’d consider myself a fairly good looking guy, she was like an 8.5-9/10. I naturally assumed she was out of my league and I wouldn’t have made any moves regardless, considering she just had a messy breakup. But then she started flirting with me. Just subtle stuff but I brushed it off since I didn’t want to jeopardize our friendship, and also because of the aforementioned messy breakup.\n\nPart of the advice I gave to her was that she was better off staying out of a relationship at the moment, because her friends were pressuring her to give another guy a chance, and she said he was a nice guy but she wasn’t ready for another relationship. Cue her friends getting mad at her, saying he was nice and he deserved a chance with her and she was being a bitch for shitting on this guy. Yeah, not very good friends. Anyway, she eventually did end up in a relationship with this guy, and stopped talking to me as much which insulted me, because if were just friends like I thought we were, talking to me shouldn’t be a problem. Either way, I stopped messaging back as much too because I didn’t know if her new guy was the jealous type and I didn’t feel like dealing with that.\n\nA few months later, which is also a few months ago, she told me that her boyfriend had just been taken to jail for an offense that she wouldn’t tell me. I tried not to pry, all I got out of her was that he could be in there for a long time. She started messaging me daily again, and I started responding again. After another month she told me she was officially breaking up with him since it didn’t look like he was getting out of jail soon. Now she was talking to me pretty regularly again I figured we would pick back up and be friends once more, but here’s where everything started to get fucky.\n\nShe started flirting again, more intensely than before. She would send me Snapchats of her trying an outfit on and then zoom in on her ass, and I never really knew what to say to that because I knew she was trying to bait compliments out of me, most of the time I humored her. However, she always did it at the weirdest points. I used to be able to hold a conversation with her just fine, but now every other Snapchat would either be a video of her making kissy faces at the camera or just a picture of a plant or some random shit with zero text. Like how the hell do I even respond to that? We were just talking about the Taj Mahal and then you sent me a video of your ass, I have no idea what to say. So I flirted back, figuring that’s what she wanted. Every time I would reciprocate though, she would immediately jump back into oh-we’re-just-friends mode. Friends don’t send friends close ups of their tits and make kisses at the camera, but what the hell do I know?\n\nI started to get tired of this getting yanked around, so I tried inviting her to parties and outings to gauge the situation between us, at this point I didn’t care if we were just friends or something more, I just wanted to know where we stood. Every time I invited her somewhere, she would say yes, and then day of she would stop responding until the time frame of going to the event had passed, and then make up some excuse like she got too high and forgot she had plans (You got high and forgot about plans for five hours? Okay, whatever). Finally, the fifth time I invited her to something, it was dinner with my roommate and I,and she said yes. I told my roommate if she flakes on me one more time that I was done with her, I had been filling him in on the situation and he agreed with my choice. \n\nDay of food plans, she messages me about dinner, asking if we’re still on. I said yeah, I’ll message you later tonight when we’re getting ready to leave soon. She said cool, sounds great. At 7pm I message her telling her we’re just about ready to go, and she replied that she had to run with a friend to a nearby town and that she would be back in about half an hour, and we can go then. I said that’s fine, as long as we leave before 8pm I can get a decent amount of sleep tonight, since my roommate and I had to get up at 4am for work the next morning. This is where I fucked up, I gave her a time frame.\n\nShe messaged me at 8:15 saying oh hey, sorry I’ll let you get your sleep, it’s past 8 so I guess we can’t go. I said no, it’s fine, I’ll just have Red Bull for breakfast, I’m okay with cutting into sleep time to hang out. She didn’t respond for the rest of the night. I told myself screw that, that’s it, I gave her so many chances to hang out and she has made zero effort to remain my friend. I cut her off, and haven’t messaged her since.\n\nSide note, this may be a fair amount of speculation on my part, but I realized that the reason she became so bad at holding conversations was that all those weird Snapchats I got from her mid conversation of her ass or some random object with no text, those were probably just blanket messages that could be mass sent out to a bunch of people. So my thoughts are that I’m definitely not the only guy she’s talking to and she flirts with me just enough to keep me interested before going back into friend mode. A small amount of evidence I have for that is I got tired of her shit for a bit so I stopped messaging her for about two or three days, then out of nowhere she messaged me saying that her and one of our mutual friends agreed they would totally sleep with me (not a threesome, individually before anyone asks). After I messaged her back, she then acted like she never said it and went right back into just friends.\n\nI should also add that I haven’t talked to her since she flaked for the last time, I’ve only opened her messages and haven’t responded for about a month. She hasn’t sent me anything asking why we don’t talk anymore, still just pictures of random shit with no text so I feel like she hasn’t even noticed. A part of me tells me that it’s good that I stopped talking to her and it’s the best thing for my own mental health, but there’s still a part of me that thinks I’m the asshole for overanalyzing shit and ruining a friendship. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "OK, a bit of a long story.  tl;dr at the bottom.  FYI for clarity, the story involves 4 men (all gay) and a dog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo  my best friend lives across the street and his boyfriend has a dog.  My  friend's boyfriend's dog are there at least 50% of the time, and I see  all of them a lot.  The dog is a puppy, cute and very hyper.  You can  hear the dog crying from one house to another a lot, when the owner is  away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA  few months ago, the dog was hit by a car.  I help find a vet, rush the  dog there and stayed with the owner.  Also in the past my friend, his  boyfriend (the dog owner) and the dog have been at my place (without me  being there) to use the hot tub.  The dog has chewed up some rubber  ducks from the hot tub, and shit in my yard in the past.  From the hot  tub, the dog my have left muddy prints in my house.  No big deal, it's  part of owning a dog.  I get it.  On two occasions in the past, I have  taken the dog running.  Once by myself, which involved a 2 mile drive  then a 7 mile run in public.  It's pretty much assumed other people are  petting the dog.  Because, as I said, it's a cute puppy and the dog  craves attention.  It's very sweet and has never hurt anyone or any dog ever  in the past ever.  Not even barked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo  I have a guest in town that I have a romantic interest in.  Everyone  knows that.  I took the day off work and my guest and I visited my  neighbor friend across the street.  My friend/neighbor works from home,  and he briefly said something like \"the dog wants attention\" and that he  was working at the moment in a group text.  I offer to take my friend's  boyfriend's dog to a walk in the greenbelt near by.  It's a walk 5  blocks away to a heavily wooded trail area.  We were gone 30 minutes or  so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOK,  I get it.  I should have texted permission from the dog owner, not have  gotten permission from the dog owner's boyfriend.  They both have dogs  and are a committed couple.  My friend didn't see any issue with this, and got the leash etc. etc.  The dog owner himself has a history of  overreacting. Even he would admit such.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, he loses his shit because his  dog is about a couple miles away in a safe, wooded area on a leash the  whole time.  His only real concern (his own words) is the dog could hurt someone.   Before I even took the dog out, the dog owner's boyfriend said in a  group text \"\\[Dog\\] sure could use some company he's bored out of his mind  watching me work\" and when the owner blew up, his boyfriend (my friend) texted  \"He's fine, This is fine\".  But then the dog owner himself then texts \"Why is my child  (the dog) with that ratchet man (my guest)?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDog  is returned safe and sound.  Still, the dog  owner rushes out of work  to our place.  Comes over to my house, I apologize in person.  But, still unhappy, he races  away in his car, pissed off.  Later that night the owner sends another  group text reading me the riot act.  He mentions my romantic interest  and says \"My dog is not a 'cute' little thing you can use to gain points  with whomever you are fucking for a few days\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLT;DR  - I walk a dog I spend a lot of time. The dog was a couple of miles  away tops, with the permission of dog owner's boyfriend,( but not the  dog owner).  No one was hurt in any way.  I get read the riot act, and  the dog owner personally attacks me and someone I'm seeing for it.",

      "description": "I'm nervous posting on here and I hope this is the right place to post this. Hope I get it right.  I'll try my best to give all the necessary information I can. I'm very self aware that I'm not perfect and I never claimed to be.\n\nMy GF (44) and I (44) have been dating for roughly 3.5 years. For about the first year, year and a half, we didn't live together. We'd go out and talk about whatever and I thought we really got to know each other well. I felt like we were on the same page on a lot of different topics. One of them being about holidays in which a gift or card of some sorts was the \"norm\". We both agreed that at our ages, birthday's were just another day, no big deal, unless it was a major mile stone (next one would be like when we turn 50). Valentines, sweetest day to us, is just a way for companies to profit off of people.\n\nAfter that, a new job opportunity presented itself for her. We talked and decided lets try living together. We've been living, in my home, for the remainder of our relationship. I've tried my best to make living accommodations for her so she feels comfortable. I moved out of my room so that she could have her own bathroom and let her decorate the whole upstairs (aside from repainting) however she wanted.\n\nBeing the person I am and knowing that she's had some crappy relationships, just like I have had in the past, for the first 2 years I actually went against what we agreed are \"just another day\". I would get her a birthday gift and cook her favorite meal and at least get flowers/card for her on the other 2 days. Now I know what my expectations are/should be, as we discussed them in the first half of our relationship. Without ever bringing it up or even using it against her, I never got really got anything. I think she may have cooked for me on my birthday the first year we were together.\n\nFast forward to 2019, over at least the past year, year and half, our relationship has been really strained. We never do anything together, we barely are in the same room at the same time. We've had a lot of arguments and can't really talk about anything anymore unless its a neutral topic. We eat together when one of us cooks or I bring food home to eat, as long as we're getting home from our jobs roughly around the same time. I used to plan it so food would be done in time that we both would eat at the same time.\n\nI feel like I've been rambling on, so I'll just leave it at that.\n\nSummary:\n\nI've basically had enough, feel underappreciated and have no desire to get her anything anymore even on special occasions even thought that's not really the person I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for not letting my girlfriend have a tv in the kitchen",
      "description": "My girlfriend moved into my house at the beginning of the year, January. When she moved in, my house was moderately modified to accommodate her furniture as well as an entire replacement of kitchen ware, due to her religious dietary needs.  Prior to her moving in, my house was meticulously renovated, designed, and decorated, as my profession is in architecture and I had always had a ‘vision’ for my first home. \n\nWhen I renovated my home a few years ago, I elected to not put a cable connection for tv in the two bedrooms. I never really watch tv, let alone cable television, so I didn’t see a need for it. Especially as I can watch Netflix through my tv in the bedroom. My girlfriend is really into cable television. All she watches are reality tv shows and the news. When she first moved in, I didn’t even have cable in the main living room tv, and when she moved in I called the cable company to come and install so that she can have her shows. We’re currently in the midst of installing cable tv in the bedrooms now too, per her request. \n\nRecently she’s now asked for cable tv in the kitchen. This is where I drew the line and said no. She got upset at me for it. The reason I said no is because my house isn’t very large to begin with (1,300 sq.ft.).  I think a tv in the kitchen will look odd and out of place. It’s not a large kitchen and having a tv there I feel just kills the mood and feel of my kitchen. Her argument is that she can’t hear or watch the tv while she’s in the kitchen cooking and cleaning, which she’s been doing a lot of lately due to her unemployment status the last few months. I told her hopefully she’ll find a job soon and she won’t be in the kitchen for hours on end because she’ll be busy at work. \n\nI can tell she’s upset. I just don’t want to have a small home filled with televisions, nor do I want to set the precedent of all this tv watching, and I really think putting a tv in the kitchen will kill the vibe and look of the kitchen I worked so hard to design. Am I the asshole for saying \"No\" to a television in the kitchen?",

      "description": "I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years. She's great.\nWe're currently living in a one bedroom place, but she'd like to get a bigger place with more people next semester to save money, and I think it's a great idea. It's a two bedroom two bathroom apartment in a nice area. \n\nBut here's the thing, her sister wants to live with her. In the same room. And our friend already called a room to himself. So where does that leave me? The living room.\n\nMy girlfriend and I are both college students that work while the other two only work, and I tend to do a lot of reading and studying in my room. She also said the rent would be split equally 4 ways, but I think the guy in the living room should pay a smaller cut. And then my girlfriend and her sister also want their mom to move up there. What the fuck even, I feel like I'm not even being considered. Apparently only 5 people are allowed to be on the lease, and I'd be in the living room with their mother while two people have a room, one guy has his own room, and two people share the small living room. \n\nWhen I bought up my worries to my girlfriend, she just said she's always wanted to live with her sister. I told her that I respected that, but that I can't live in a situation like that. Her sister is the one who applied for her, so I'm sol in terms of lease security. It honestly kinda hurts because I've stood up and supported her, and now she's insisting I stay in the living room. ",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy \\[19M\\] gf \\[24F\\] and I have been in a long distance relationship for almost a year. We've met up in person plenty of times, but its difficult due to the fact that I live in Kansas and she lives in Maine.\n\nI love my girlfriend, but just like anyone, she has her insecurities. From recent events, I am not quite sure she handles them very well. She has had a past of emotional and physical abuse from all of her ex-boyfriends and from her mom's ex-boyfriend. This abuse included punching her in the face, choking, insults, and outright ignoring her. As a result, she is very sensitive about what I say about her and whether I am ignoring her.\n\nThe incident that I am posting about involved a mean IG post by her ex targeted at her about how he is happy in his new relationship and how he thinks his new girlfriend is pretty and nice to him. The part that bothered my girlfriend the most is that he implied she was not nice to him during their relationship (despite the fact that he would punch her for snoring) and he never told her she was pretty during their relationship. On top of that, she thinks his relationship is a sham because she had next to no intimacy with her ex and the girl he is dating was a lesbian before they started their relationship. On top of that, she had been excommunicated from her group of friends for suggesting that dating a former lesbian was a bad idea.\n\nMy girlfriend called me at 7am as I was leaving for an 8am class (I actually had 3 back to back classes) and told me about what he posted. I thought it was horrible for him to target her like that especially after her friends had left her in the dust. However, I had class and I needed to go. At this point, she started crying about how she didn't want to be alone. I pushed that I should go to class and I will be there for her afterwards. I ended up missing my first two classes from talking to her, during which she said that if I leave I don't care about her and its over. At one point she actually paid me $100 to stay claiming I care more about money than her (what?). I paid that right back to her. I told her I HAD to go to my third class because I had a test (which was true). Afterwards, I ended up compromising with her that I would call into work later that day for my 5pm-9pm shift to be with her due to the fact that I had gone to class.\n\nI have expressed to her since all of this that telling me that our relationship is over when I'm just worried about my classes is hurtful, and she has apologized for that. However, she has insisted that in the future I should be willing to stay home if she is upset about a similar issue. To give her credit, she has helped me tremendously with my coursework and she does her best to make sure I stay on track, and I really do love her. I want to do the best by her, so tell me, AITA for not thinking that an upsetting, targeted instagram post should be considered an emergency?",

      "description": "Sorry for formatting, on mobile.\n\nSo this happened probably around a decade ago, I was around 8 or 9 and I had this “friend” Matthew, he was more of just a kid we hung out with cause we were kids and hung out with whoever we could in our neighborhood, but anyway, onto the story.\n\nSo Matthew liked to aggravate me, he found it fun to see me get in trouble for getting mad, and one day he went a little too far and got me REALLY mad about something, can’t remember what but I just about had steam coming out my ears. I had recently gotten a super soaker and had so much fun with it, plus it was summer so it was a fun way to cool off.\n\nSo I go into my house and get my super soaker and fill it with SCALDING hot tap water, planning to spray Matthew with the water. After it was full I ran outside to spray him, and I do a few times. He has almost no reaction probably because the air cooled the water before it hit him, and this only gets me angrier, so I open the super soaker and pour as much as I can on his back, he gasps in shock and does a weird forward bend to avoid having more on him, then he takes off (he was walking his bike home but he decided to ride after that...)\n\nAs he’s riding up the street he starts yelling for his dad, now his whole family is kinda nuts, his dad would often ride loud dirt bikes around the neighborhood late into the night, Matthew and his mom once showed up uninvited to my birthday party, his parents hated me and were just general assholes. So his dad hears him yelling and I go pale in the face and run into my house, meanwhile Matthews dad is screaming for me to “DON’T FUCKING MOVE LITTLE SHIT! I’M GONNA BEAT YOUR ASS!” Stuff like that. \n\nSo a minute later he knocks and my mom answers, I have to apologize to Matthew AND my super soaker gots thrown away.",

      "description": "This happened a little over a year ago but I am curious to see Reddit's opinion on this because half of my friends think I was the asshole, and the other half think I was doing my job...\n\nI am a former employee of Sprint, while working for Sprint I was a keyholder/floor manager. So I helped maintained the other reps in store, had special managerial codes and sat in all manager meetings. Anyways we had hired a rep in the summer of 2017 (Gonna call him Big D). Big D started and right away me and him had issues, he couldn't close his float the right way, he was a sleazy salesman who consistently messed up customer phone accounts which I had to always fix. So all around we never liked each other, but I put up with it. Until last fall. Big D was heading to lunch and was going around boasting about how he was going to get super drunk and messed up while on lunch so that his afternoon was easier. Well at Sprint there is a no drinking on the job policy, the only time you could drink was at store parties after hours when off the clock. As soon as I caught wind of Big D saying he was going to get drunk on lunch, I immediately reported it to my assistant store manager, store manager, and district manager. He obviously came back into work drunk, was immediately pulled into the main office and suspended while an internal review went underway. He was fired two days later and was jobless with two kids. I sort of felt bad but really didn't either cause he did it to himself. Last I heard he found a job at a grocery store... sooooo AITA for getting this man fired? Or did I save a lot of people from a headache?",

      "description": "I've known my best friend (I'll call her Stacy for this post's purpose) for about 8 years. She had a rough childhood, and I kinda grew up being her support system. She has always been very emotionally draining to all her friends, starts drama, etc. Over the years she has lost most of her friends (our mutual friends) because of this, but I've stuck around. Recently it's been getting more difficult to stick around.\n\nAbout 6 months ago, her shitty boyfriend broke up with her, and kind of to rebound she decided to start sleeping with a man who is twice her age. I am very uncomfortable with this, I think that this kind of behavior gets girls into very abusive situations, and she has a history of picking bad dudes. She can do what she wants, but she was constantly asking me for my advice. When I told her, she would say \"you're right but I'm going to do it anyway\". She starts sleeping with her ex, and asks me for my advice, I tell her, then she tells me she is gonna do it anyway. She starts doing drugs and skipping her college classes, then complains when she gets bad grades and a drinking ticket. She starts sleeping with her only other long term friend's ex boyfriend. When the friend finds out Stacy is doing with that, she gets mad, they \"friend break up\" and then Stacy proceeds to be extremely cruel to her on social media (calls her a c*nt publicly). Stacy calls me all the time to break down, ask me for advice, then tell me she will ignore it anyway. It's getting hard to watch her ruin her life and not be able to do anything. \n\nI've made the decision I don't want to be friends with her anymore. It's pretty easy to avoid her during semester as I go to college out of state and she is studying in our hometown. As of right now I still take her calls, respond to texts, etc. I come home on breaks and right now I'm making excuses to not see her. I have never cut a friend off before, the only time I've ever ended friendships is by growing apart, relationships were always mutual. I am very non confrontational. The reasons I just want to disappear are: I live across the country 75% of the time and it's not like I need to see her much, I also don't want her to have to deal with the stress of being called out like that or facing a \"betrayal\" from me. I was her best friend, I was always there for her, and I think it's easier for her to just think I'm an asshole ignoring her than to face me telling her exactly why I'm leaving, last thing is I am p scared to have that conversation. Ghosting seems logical to me but I know it has such a negative image. WIBTA?",

      "description": "Some background information. I’m currently a Sophomore in college, at the beginning of this school year I met a freshman girl and we hit it off really well and started dating around the end of September. \n\nThis is when my girlfriend tells her parents about me and instantly her mom does not like me, solely because I’m an atheist and she’s very Christian. I first found out about this when my girlfriend called and said that she was crying. She believes I’m trying to turn my girlfriend into an Atheist too. I’ve told her, through my girlfriend, that I respect her and my girlfriend’s belief and would like it if respected mine, though that did little to change her stance. It wasn’t until I offered to go to there church with them if I ever visited there home town that her mom seemed more open to my girlfriend dating me.\n\nCut to a few weeks later, here family is in town to visit and invite me out to dinner, which I accept. For the most part it’s a good time, up until they go to leave and my girlfriend’s roommate accidentally slipped that I’ve spent the night, to which they yelled at my girlfriend until she was brought to tears. Keep in mind that we’re both two consenting adults and I’ve never pushed her to do anything she’d be uncomfortable with, something she’s repeatedly told me she’s grateful for.  \n\nAfterwards, her mom starts calling her more and more, both to see if I’m over when I’m not “suppose to be” and to yell at my girlfriend about her grades. Turns out my girlfriend has been struggling through most of here classes, even failing one, but didn’t tell me. \n\nHer parents and I both had different responses to this. \n\nWhat I did:\n-Stop spending as much time with my girlfriend, always making sure she gets her work done before I come over.\n\n-Suggest my girlfriend test herself for ADD after she told me that she’s having difficulties focusing in class. (I have ADD and I explained how I have the same trouble when I’m not on my medication). \n\n- Push her to schedule an appointment with her doctor about possibly getting ADD medication.\n\n- Suggest that she talks to her RA for questions about where to get help.\n\n- Help her study in classes where I have knowledge about.\n\n- Push her to email her academic advisor to talk about future classes and if she should drop calc or not. \n\nWhat her parents have done (in the span of about a week):\n\n- Tell her to break up with me because I’m the sole reason she’s struggling with classes.\n\n- Belittle her and tell her that’s she’s not ready for college.\n\n- Threaten to take away her phone and her car.\n\n- Threaten to take her out of school before the semester even ends.\n\n- Tell her that Satan (and by extension me) is fighting for her soul. \n\n- Yell at her when she decided to drop calc, even though her academic advisor agreed that it was the best course of action.\n\n- Make her cry constantly.\n\nBecause of all this I increasingly get upset at her parents, saying how they’re hurting instead of helping. When my girlfriend told them that I’m doing a lot to help her, they say I have no idea what I’m doing because I’m only 20. To which I argue that I’m one of the best people to help her improve because:\n\n 1. I’ve gone through a lot of the struggles she’s going through the previous year and have a better understanding on how to adapt to college life. \n\n2. My girlfriend was the first in her family to go to college, so her parents have no idea what she’s going through or how hard it can people for people to adjust to college life. (Explaining how it’s not uncommon for freshmen to struggle their first year)\n\nI also argue that her mom is immature for taking her anger out on her daughter, something my girlfriend said she’s always had to deal with and that she’s use to. Saying how she does it because she cares.\n\nWhen I tell my girlfriend that I want to talk to her parents about this she said that I would only make things worse. But after seeing my girlfriend, someone I care about, going from smiling and laughing to crying every time her mom called (multiple times a day), took a toll on me and I needed someone to vent to. So I decided to talk to her cousin, who I’m friends with on Snapchat, about this. Little did I know that my gf’s mom was with her cousin at the time and saw some of the things I said, I’m also guessing that her mom told her cousin what to say back. \n\nNext thing I know, my girlfriend calls me telling how her mom is yelling at her and that her mom was extremely pissed. My girlfriend tells me how she’s upset with me for doing this and that I only made things worse, something I felt horrible about. \n\nWe’re still dating, but our relationship was strained for a few weeks, only starting to get better at the beginning the the month. Though last I checked her mom’s stance on me is that “I will never be welcomed in her home or her family”, and I share no love towards her parents.\n\nAm I the asshole for getting up and insulting my girlfriend’s parent’s parenting skills?\n\n\n",

      "description": "About 6 months ago our dog had to be put down, he was an 11 year old dog suffering from seizures  and general old age related issues.\n\nHe was a good dog but towards the end he was peeing in the house and generally destroying the first house we actually owned and while I loved him to bits it was getting very trying towards the end as I was trying to get the house nice and he was messing it up nearly as fast as I was fixing it up.\n\nAnyhow it's been a 6 months and my partner and son are talking about getting another dog, now in principal I don't have a problem.\n\nMy issue is we are all out during the day for school and work. I think it's cruel to get a dog and leave it alone all day, as a minimum it will be alone for roughly 7hours a day. I honestly think that once the novelty of a new dog wears off the new dog will become a chore rather than a pleasure and I really don't like the idea of having the poor animal going nutty from boredom for our entertainment.\n\nAm I the arsehole?",

      "description": "First-time poster, on mobile. TL;DR at bottom. Forgive the long post but I think all the details are important to be fair to both parties.\n\nThe title may make it sound like we’re fourteen but we’re both in our 20s. My friend (let’s call him Pat) and I have been friends for ~9 years. We met this girl (let’s call her Dana) 5 years ago at university. The three of us remained friends throughout university. Dana would always be the one to invite us to do something together. We have remained friends since graduation, seeing each other every once in a while. I have since moved to another state 1,500 miles away for work.\n\nThis past summer, Pat and Dana both had time off of work and decided to come visit me. We stayed in a popular city about an hour from me. Our first night out, we went out to the bar. We all got slightly drunk. In our Uber on the way back to the Airbnb, Dana leaned over to me and said we should hook up. I have had romantic feelings for her ever since we met. So, I obliged and we started kissing in the back seat while Pat sat in the front passenger seat. \n\nWhen we got back to the Airbnb, Dana went to the bedroom and told me to join her in a few minutes. I was waiting in the living room when Pat told me that he had strong feelings for her, that he pretty much loved her. He had never told me or Dana this. I told Pat I had feelings for Dana too. I don’t remember the entirety of the conversation. There was only one bed and one couch in the Airbnb so I told Pat I was going to share the bed with Dana, rather than sleep on the floor. I went to the bedroom and Dana and I resumed hooking up.\n\nThe rest of the weekend Pat proceeded to act weird (moping, disappearing without warning and not answering calls or texts). At one point, Pat told Dana how he felt. Dana decided to leave early because she felt uncomfortable with the whole situation, but mostly Pat’s behavior. Pat and I then went out to the bars.\n\nAt the third bar, after a decent amount of alcohol, Pat told me he never wants to be friends with me again. He said it was because I knew he liked Dana and hooked up with her anyway. I did not know until he told me the night Dana and I hooked up. We knew her for five years and he never told me, never asked her out or made a move, and never even initiated hanging out with Dana. It was always Dana. Pat has not been successful with women because he is very shy. I thought he had good chemistry with Dana and I even suggested he ask her out multiple times over the years, including the night she and I hooked up, but he never did. I honestly did not know he liked her but thought he should try as this is the only girl he’s ever been close with and he is too shy to ask out a stranger. He needed a more outgoing person, such as Dana, to initiate something.\n\nBefore Pat left, I tried to explain that I didn’t know he liked her but he wouldn’t hear me out. He reaffirmed that he never wants to be friends with me again, while I want to reconcile.\n\nTL;DR: I hooked up with a girl my (former) good friend loves. She and I were both slightly drunk. She initiated it. The guy and I have been friends for 9 years and friends with the girl for 5 years. I had no idea he loved her until he told me, after the girl and I already started hooking up. He now very much hates me.\n\nSo, Reddit. AITA?",

      "description": "So I have 3 friends. Michael, Johnathan, and Melanie.\n\nMelanie and I were talking about girls one day, and she mentioned how she’s been wanting to get back into the dating scene.\n\nThis reminded me of Michael telling me the exact same thing just the day before. I know from talking to her that Michael is Melanie’s type. I got really excited because I know they’re both looking, so I showed Melanie a photo and asked if she wanted his number.\n\nImmediately she was keen to the idea. I told Michael I gave her his number, gave him her Snapchat, and told him to give her a chat.\n\nThey’ve been talking for a month now, and finally went on a date and both have been texting me after the date about how much fun they had, and how great the other is, and how I’m a great wingman\n\nOnly problem is, I set them up, completely forgetting but having the knowledge that my friend Johnny was trying to date Melanie too.\n\nHe had been trying for about a month and Melanie was unresponsive to it. Shes been friendly with him, like close friends friendly, but not “I want to date” friendly.\n\nJohnny misconstrued it as “I want to date” and thought she liked him too, but wouldn’t do anything.\n\nat first I was hyping johnathan to do it, but then I set Melanie and Michael up and realized what I did. I stopped hyping Johnny and tried to steer him away from liking her with “I think she’s talking to someone. You should go for someone else, something would have happened by now man.”\n\nLucky it worked. He’s over her now, he was a bit upset because he realized she didn’t like him (they went to a bar and she went home with a different guy) and she never did like him to begin with. But holy shit I feel like an ass. It would be different if she found someone else’s, but i set her up. In the moment I forgot all about Johnny and was excited to setup Melanie and Michael.\n\nAITA for setting them up?",

      "title": "AITA for not supporting a toxic ex-friend through mental health issues?",
      "description": "This happened about 5 years ago, but sometimes I think about this ex-friend (T). We first met at a school club where we bonded over similar interests and read the same books. Basically, it was great. Then came high school and the pressure level is over 9000! High school was when she really became toxic. I’ll list some. Firstly, she started mocking her friends, which left me uncomfortable because they treat her sincerely. Secondly, I was failing tests, but I studied my ass off and improved my grades. Her response? \"Oh no, all of you are catching up to me.\" Secondly, I did a lot of volunteer work then. T did not join me, which is totally fine. But then a mutual friend (M) would sometimes ask me \"why exactly\" am I doing volunteer work. I began to suspect if T was behind M's weird questions, because T often showed disdain for volunteer work and humans in general.\n\nT, M and I called ourselves the three musketeers. Over time, they grew closer and hung out together without me. Once I had a bad day and called M to vent, only to find out T and M were going for a movie date together without me. M told me they didn’t ask me out because they \"didn't think\" I would be free. I was TA and flipped. We resolved that issue, but I overreacted big time. From there on, this trio dynamic was on the rocks. \n\nI gradually realized T was never happy for my successes. When I got into my dream college, she didn't congratulate me; she made it about how people were achieving their dreams but she wasn't. T applied for a medical degree but when I asked if she wanted to volunteer at a hospital, she told me she wasn't interested in helping others. Eventually, she didn't get into the course but a mutual acquaintance did. T didn't think that person deserved it and dissed her. T also cut connections with her long-time bestie (\"B\") when B became a Christian. T was nihilistic and saw it as a betrayal, calling her B things like a \"hoe\". \n\nFast forward to college, and I'm working on a project with... B! B asked me why T cut her off and I was honest with her about T’s opinions on B. When I finished, B then went on a LONG exposé about how T mocked me behind my back for 6 years. T gave me a nickname: \"fallacy in motion\". If I was too stupid to be her friend, then why did T keep me around? To make herself feel good? I also used to write fiction and we both wrote similar stuff. I was worried about seemingly plagiarising T but she told me I wasn't doing it. Turns out T accused me of plagiarism to B... among other things. That was the last straw. I went no contact on T afterwards.\n\n2 years ago, M asked if I could help her with T’s depression. M said that T's insults and bitterness was to cover her deep sense of inferiority to others. I declined on the spot. One question M asked me stuck with me: \"Don't you know she would also feel hurt that you stopped talking to her?\" \n\nAITA for not supporting a toxic ex-friend through depression?",

      "description": "So I recently went through my clothes and books to see what I could donate to the community aid centre. I eliminated about 80% of my wardrobe (jackets, shirts, sweaters, jeans, pants). Now I am 21 and have bought all these pieces of clothing as well as everything I own with my own money since the age of 15 when my parents started to refuse to pay for anything for me. \n\nNow as a child, my family often had to use this particular community aid store as we struggled financially. And now that I am at a point where I finally have stuff to give, I figured it would be only right to give back to a store that helps the less fortunate and employs many people with disabilities. \n\nAnyways, there was at least a few hundred dollars worth of clothes that my mom said she would bring to the drop off centre since she was going there. Yet, when I came home, I found out that instead of respecting my very clear wishes of donating it to the less fortunate, she gave it to her friend who is by no means struggling. \n\nI approached her respectfully and said that I was upset that she went against what I trusted her to do and that since they were my belongings that I paid for and I would’ve at the least appreciated she ask to give the clothes to her friend. But instead, she became her aggressive self whenever I mention something that bothers me and she called me a selfish jerk. \n\nTLDR; I got rid of most of my clothes which I paid for to donate to the less fortunate, my mom gave them away, without my consent, to her friend who is by no means in need of it.  And then I got called selfish for mentioning how it made me feel upset. ",

I swear this woman should teach a class how to mooch. She has been given free trips all around the world (NYC, Vegas, Newfoundland, Chicago..to name a few). She also has completely stopped buying groceries. She either eats out or weasles her way into free meals at people's houses. \n\nFor the last 4 years she arranges visits to see the grandchildren around meal times in order to get a free meal. She has NEVER visited her grandchildren unless it's a meal involved in the last 4 years. Sometimes she comes about an hour before a meal, eats, then leaves to go to another function, which leads me to believe she only came for the food not to see the kids.\n\nShe's a very picky eater. I've gotten to the point that I'm resenting feeding her. Ive started making food I know she dislikes on purpose to deter her but then my husband gets upset with me. If we order out when she happens to show up for a meal she will have the audacity to place her own special order. Example we order pizza but she wants a order of ribs on the side and you guessed it, never pays a cent. \n\nThen to top this all off, the woman expects me to wait on her. She won't even carry a dish to the sink let alone help me clean up after a meal. \n\nAITA for telling my husband I'm done and visits need to be place outside of meal times? He tells me most people wouldn't care as much as I so and that I'm being unreasonable.",

      "description": "I don't use Reddit very much and I learned about this sub from YouTube, so bare with me.\n\nAlso a bit of backstory, I came out in freshman year of high school and started medical treatment soon after. Everyone in my family is also a late bloomer and the women aren't very well versed in the chest area, so working out for a few months along with taking testosterone made my already fairly non-existent chest fats go away. Basically: I looked like a feminine cis boy even with my shirt off.\n\nAlright along with the story. I'm 22 and had been dating my (ex) girlfriend for a little more then a year. My girlfriend was completely fine with not having sex as I had stated when I first met her that I didn't like to hook up. About a week ago, she asked me why I hadn't ever tried to have sex with her. After she had tried to get an answer out of me, I  finally told her that I was peen-less. I had originally thought her to be really understanding, but she was really mad. She accused me of being a liar, a fake, a lesbian catfishing her, a whole lot of nasty stuff. Turns out she was really homophobic, which I didn't know because she didn't have any openly gay friends. She ended up blocking me on everything and told all her friends, who sent me a shit ton of hate texts.\n\nTLDR, I told my girlfriend of one year I was transgender and she didn't take it well at all.\n\nSo, should I have told her sooner or just kept it a secret?",

Because you thought your pain was greater than his, despite not being able to feel what he was going through? Depression doesn't always relate to your physical condition in such a simplistic way.\n\nand:\n\n&gt;That’s extremely shitty of you. A friend tried to help you and you were offended because his problems weren’t the same as yours? What a fucking asshole.\n\n\nVery interested in feedback because i've complained about it a few times in real life, and i really don't want to look like a dick if this is actually a thing I'm wrong about\n\n\n[Here's the context,](https://np.reddit.com/r/TooMeIrlForMeIrl/comments/9zhcb1/toomeirlformeirl/ea9qh5o/) but there's not really much more to it than what I've copied here.",

      "description": "I have been lucky to have many long time friends who have stayed close. We travel yearly together and get along well.\n\nThis has always been strained for me by one member, labeled X. While some of the friends have dropped out of college, pursued nontraditional lives, whatever, X has made a circus of his adult life.\n\nI will preface my problems with X with his current situation.\n\nX attends college, but has failed his way into a neverending cycle of GEs and nondeclaration. He is the child of self-made parents from an impoverished background. He has adopted strong right wing ideologies, citing his parents as evidence of his beliefs. He is out of shape. He has held one job not given to him by his parents, but he is decent at it. His significant other seems to impose very strong gender roles on their relationship, and manipulates him. She is not really a part of the circle, but I do note her as an influence on his demeanor.\n\nEnd his current situation, described as observed by myself and others around him.\n\nRecently I had a disagreement with X. We have them often. Generally, they are around how he behaves in public. I let him spout his political views and foul humor privately without objection. In vast contexts I have heard him use horrendously racist language \"in jest,\" only to voice very concerning and decidedly serious views on race and peripheral matters moments later. Multiple times he has been engaged in public by strangers who are disgusted by his displays. To his credit he does not ask for defense from his friends. I don't think anyone would help if he asked.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back came when I was sharing stories about my friends in college. I was discussing an event I attended for a friend, hosted by his ethnic club.\n\nImmediately X began making pointed jokes about my friend and his heritage. Furthermore, he made hard judgements and assumptions that were not jokes. He was vocally ashamed that I would associate with him.\n\n I blew up at him, and we are no longer speaking.\n\nSome of my friends within the group have told me to move on from the argument for the health of the friend group. They claim him to be joking, but I think it's rationalizing. I have never seen X accept humility in his conflicts with other members of the group, which are considerable in number. \n\nSo, this is how problems with X are generally resolved, since he is stubborn and frankly aggressive. The other party says, \"fuck it it's not worth it to cause this much trouble\" and acquiesces.\n\nI have accepted the bitter pill in these situations in the past. But it is clear to me now that he has become an issue in need of addressing. I have refused to bow in the matter. I have made my stance clear and stated that either X changes or he stays out of my proximity.\n\nIt has been a great source of stress to my friends, since it implies ultimatum between X or myself.\n\ntl;dr\n\nIs refusing to bow down in a significant argument and clash of ideals a dick move when it jeopardizes the stability of multiple friendships?",

So every 'me' and 'I' is actually my mom.\n\nMy ex, our kids and I went out of town to see my mother for couple of days, since she is in hospice. We all went to my sister in law's parents house for dinner. We all had a good time and our kids wanna head back to the hotel and go swimming. \n\nMy ex got his GPS working and was going to what it is saying, but then he begins wondering why the GPS was not taking him to the right direction that he wants to go. So after a little bit, he begins to get frustrated. So I decided to pull my GPS and help him out.\n\nAfter seeing the directions on where to go, I told him to turn the direction my GPS is saying to go, but he seems that he doesn't want to listen to me. I then got a bit angry and told him to turn. He told me not to raise my voice at him, which I wasn't, I was only just trying to help him, because I can see that he is frustrated and confused. Well, he seems that he doesn't want to listen. So I got angry and yelled at him to listen to me.\n\nHe then slammed on the breaks and told me to get out, but I refused. I started yelling at him and cussed a few words in front of my kids, telling him to listen to me. He still won't listen, and tells me to get out again. So, I slammed my phone on the floor, crossed my arms and I was burning mad, because I know from our previous arguments that he would never listen to me. He then made our daughter hold the phone and help him head to the right direction back to the hotel. Finally, he was able to follow it, and eventually, we had reached the hotel.\n\nSo, who was the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "A couple weeks ago I (20M) got into an argument with my current girlfriend (23F), I’ll call her Jen, about my ex girlfriend (22F), Megan, because she wouldn’t stop talking about her. Megan and I used to date for a couple of months. She became friends with one of my roommates, and goes out with her to the bars every once in a while. Coincidentally, she knew my other roommate from high school, so she had two friends at my apartment. \n\nWe ended things and I got a new girlfriend, but I still tried to stay friends with Megan so we’d talk often. Jen didn’t like this. We actually all three met up one night and had an adult discussion about it but Jen wouldn’t say to her face that she was upset with Megan texting or snapchatting me every day (because she always initiated the conversation with me), instead she just said it behind her back. I realized it wasn’t worth the time/effort so after at least a dozen arguments I blocked her from Snapchat after she took back her DVD player from my house so I’d have a “reason to” and that was pretty immature of me, which upset Megan. \n\nMegan would come over more often after this to “hang out” with my roommates and wouldn’t care if me and Jen were home. This bothered Jen a lot, and I had to continue listening to her complain about Megan even though I wasn’t talking or engaging with her in anyway, even if she was over. \n\nShe would say things like, I can’t get away from this bitch, at school (they have classes together at university), where she’s always wearing the stupid Burberry scarf you bought her in front of me, and now in your apartment? Why don’t you go out and tell her this is not okay? Tell her to leave. She’s not welcome here. I don’t like her. So this is where I might have messed up because I said, “why do YOU care so much about this girl? You sound really insecure and I already blocked her. I feel like this is all the talk about and I’m getting tired of it. Why don’t you leave instead?”\n\nHonestly, I was just really done hearing about Megan and I couldn’t stand it anymore. She was a daily conversation that I didn’t want to have anymore. So Jen starts crying and tells me that I don’t care about her, I don’t love her and makes a big scene when she leaves in front of my ex and roommates. I feel like a dick, but I wanted to ask reddit, AITA?",

I called my parents who are currently outside of the country leaving me to take care of my studies, sibling, house and our store and my dad vehemently disagreed with my decision saying that he's been on those roads in these conditions and they are extremely bad and who knows what kind of car you'll have to go with and that on Sunday I have to be here to take care of the store and stuff.

      "description": "She told me this a month after I lost my virginity to her. \n\nWe went from full on sex, to her not even wanting to kiss me. In a week. \n\nFor a month it was always “I’m not really in the mood” or “I’m on my period” or “Not now, later” For a month I blamed myself. Tried to find out what was wrong. Eventually she told me that she doesn’t like sex. Anything related, even stuff like kissing. \n\nI feel disgusting. My first time being fully intimate with a partner was a lie. She didn’t want me. I feel like I’m some sort of sexual predator. \n\nI have been in the other side. I’ve been sexually manipulated by a person and it was awful. Now I just feel like the manipulator. And I’m angry. Because she wasn’t honest with me. \n\nAnything intimate with her repulses me. Honestly anything intimate with everyone at this point. She made me feel this way and I absolutely hate myself. \n\nAnd I think I want to break up with her. I feel so betrayed. But I also feel like breaking up with her is judging her based on her sexuality. It was brave if her to tell me this. \n\nBut I feel disgusting.",

But I am not a jock. When I am not playing or practicing I am either playing video games, D&amp;D, or MTG. So I kind of live in both worlds but most of my friends are the nerd type not the jock type.\n\nOne friend of mine is constantly bullied by one kid, I don't know why but it is always him. The school has giving the kid a couple referrals and sent him home from school once but that's it and it hasn't helped.\n\nSo the other day I got sick of it and confronted the bully. I threatened to kick his ass and made him beg for my friends forgiveness on his knees in front of what seemed like half the school and he ended up crying.\n\nI have no interest in bullying him or anyone else again I just wanted him to stop bullying my friend. And I figured since the teachers telling him not to haven't stopped him maybe finding out what it feels like would.\n\nHis mom his pissed and wants me suspended and kicked off the teams. But my coach is definitely not going to let me get kick off the team and it looks like he is going to stop me from getting any sort of suspension either.\n\nI know the whole 2 wrongs don't make a right thing but am I still an asshole for 1 wrong in order to stop a constant wrong?",

(He was really talented tho). \n\nit was very cringy to look at, but i just went along and told her how amazing i thought the art was and how talented he was. \n\nShe said i could look at the page myself sometime if i wanted to check more of his art out, so i did.\n\nHe had some art where you had to be 18+ to view, so i logged in and viewed it. \n\nIt was basically furry porn, Scooby doo porn (yes ik), my little brony porn and then loli. \n\nHe had a bunch of drawings of a mother and  daughter (the daughter looked about 7 years old) that laid in bed while they were naked and the mother was touching her. It was disturbing and gross to look at.\n\nMy roomate is a lot older than me and i dont really think she's into internet culture.

      "description": "This happened about seven or eight years ago, but I still think about it almost every single day. \n\nI, 22 female at the time, had just graduated college and was living on my own for the very first time. Since I was working a crap job, I was only able to afford living in a neighborhood that wasn't known to be the best; in fact, it was pretty infamous in our state for being one of the worst. However, I was super excited to finally be on my own and start gaining some Independence.\n\nOne day, around 11 p.m., I was at one of those 24 hour gas station/convenience stores to grab a late dinner. It was pouring rain outside. I'm talking about the kind of rain that turns the world white. The kind of rain where you're completely soaked within seconds of stepping outside, even if you have an umbrella. As I went to unlock my car, I was approached by an elderly woman, maybe 65 or 70, and she said something along the lines of, \"I hate to ask you this, but would you mind giving me a ride home? It's raining so hard and I don't have an umbrella.\"\n\n She tells me where she lives, which is an apartment complex on my way home, about a two minute drive away from the store. Maybe 10 minutes walking. Most notably, a place that was known for his high crime area and drug uses.\n\nNow, my mom had been against me moving out. And she filled my head with all of the stories in the news about abductions, or Good Samaritans being lured into well laid traps. So I started thinking, is this about to happen to me? Will she lead me to an inescapable place, and I'm suddenly surrounded with no way to defend myself? \n\nI told her that I was sorry, but I was going the other way, and got in my car and drove an extra 10 minutes around to get home.\n\nEver since that day, however, I have been eaten up with guilt. What if she had no one else, and approached me because she thought I look friendly and would help her? How long did she have to wait at that gas station station before getting home? DID she make it home?  Did I make the right choice? \n\nSo please Reddit. Some days I feel justified, and some days I feel like a giant asshole. I just need to know. AITA?",

I've gotten 2 runs of more than 500 days but I relapsed in October and have been drinking about every other week since. \n\nWhen I was about 9 months sober last time i found a discord about being sober that i really liked. The owner of the server has seen me running a drug centric server and asked me to be a mod there. Things are going well and I get past a year. Then about 18 months in I have a massive falling out with my AA homegroup and get drunk. Since then I've been drinking and partying pretty much every time I get paid. I dont risk my job or house but I keep getting drunk. Thing is, I dont want to be sober forever. I have enough time before that I know the answers to the questions newcomers ask. But I'm not living the life I suggest. I feel like a fraud. So, am I the asshole for trying to help newcomers with advice I know works even when I'm not willing to follow it?",

      "description": "I'm new (30yo male) to living in a reasonable/nice/average apartment building filled with young people. Moved to new city because of job. I live in the apartment next to the laundry room on the first floor. \n\n*The rules of the laundry room goes: laundry hours between 7am to 11pm. \n\nThe noise keeps me up at night, doors slamming, people moving, laundry machines active. The landlord strongly suggests that I should call the police on other tenants (if I see them not respecting the rules). Which is apparently okay with the city and police. The landlord has put up signs, emails, directly contacted people through email and by talking to tenants directly. \n\nRecently I've begun turning off the machines if they're in use past 11pm. Last night I turned off some dryers at 11:35pm and the other tenants picked up their damp clothes at roughly 12:15am.\n\nIts a dick move I feel however I know everyone knows the rules because it's been made obvious and clear. Do I want to call the cops? Not really but obviously it's the appropriate thing to do. I'm thinking I'm fighting fire with fire. The international students across the hall from me continue to use it past 11pm even though my landlord and I mentioned it to them in person. I'm trying to get my beauty sleep by the time someone starts using the machines next door to me.\n\nTLDR: People aren't obeying the laundry room rules. Since I live right next to it and I go to bed early during the week I've started turning off the machines in use past 11pm and screwing people over with their laundry. \n",

I have tried in the past and even bought her a vape. She asked me if I even care. I told her not really and she asks if I would be sad if something happens to her.. I said I wouldn't be surprised if she had issues due to her smoking. She was upset and claimed I don't care if they died. I told her I mentally prepared myself for the death of our parents a long time ago because they really don't take care of themselves at all. She said I sound like a sociopath and started crying.. I told her I care about her and her well being but she was just so mad but honestly they are not that old where I have to take care of them tbh. It probbaly does not help my relationship with my mom is not that great. ",

      "description": "I (26f) currently live in a 3/2 house with 1 roommate (23m). I own the house and my roommate approached me through a mutual friend asking to live with me. I’m currently in school and figured I could use the extra money. I wasn’t looking for a roommate but really just did a favor since his previous roommates sucked. Seemed to be a good fit. Before he moved in we had a conversation about overnight guests. He said he has some friends who live out of state that may come visit him a couple times a year and they may stay for weekends. I told him that was fine. Had him sign a month-to-month lease agreement. While there are no explicit terms in the agreement, this conversation about guests seemed very straightforward. Now it’s been almost a year with very minimal issues. However, his friend who lives 4 hours away started coming over frequently. At first it was on days my roommate wasn’t working. Now the past 2 months his friend has been here at least 45 out of the 60 days. He is here while my roommate goes to work. This didn’t bother me at first, but now it really does. He showers here. (There’s a slight difference in the bill). Uses some of my things in the common spaces. Slows down the WIFI. Leaves the door unlocked when he goes out for a little. (this scares me because 90% of the valuables in the house are mine.) neither of them have ever cleaned anything in the common spaces besides the dishes they use, even though they do track in a lot of dirt. He stays in my roommates’ room all day long while my roommate is at work and sleeps on his floor. This is why I’m not sure if I’m being dramatic about this occurrence because the guest isn’t severely limiting the use of common spaces. I wouldn’t be as bothered if I rented this home instead of owned it. When I allowed him to move in I thought I had signed up for 1 roommate. Not 2. I honestly find it odd that 2 straight men just sit around all day in a bedroom doing nothing. What makes a 4 hour drive appealing at that point? I barely know this man who has pretty much moved into my home. I’ve politely expressed my concern to my roommate and my concern was completely disregarded. So, wibta if I limited his overnight guests staying? Would you be bothered by a man you barely know in your home being there while you and your roommate are out for the day? How would you bring it up again, if you think I’m being fair? ",

So, me thinking that this Thursday was not really Valentine's day, organised to meet with my bestie on that date. \n\nOh hell was I wrong in thinking that though. Upon telling my love this news, she sulked, threatened our relationship and then tried to guilt trip me into not going by saying things like \"You can go, just dont expect me to reply to any messages because I'll probably be crying by myself\" and the likes. Also a sprinkling of cheating allegations being thrown around on her part. Unfortunately this is a pretty standard routine with any fight between us but I love her so what can I say.\n\nI'd also like to point out me and my friend have known each other for close to 3 years and shes in a happy relationship. I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 17 months and as far as I am aware of, neither of us have done anything close to cheating.",

IM breaking up the family, not my sister who threatened to not attend my wedding because of a date. We have legitimate reasons to move it. We have already done enough for my sister, as my fiancée had to change her wedding colors because they matched my sisters originally. \n\nNow my sister has finally said she would come but my mother keeps saying “there will be a problem between them now”,”Christmas is going to be awkward now, I hope you’re happy” ??\n\nAm I the asshole?",

They’re more expensive than other places nearby, but they’re not a franchise and I like supporting a local small business. I usually spend about $50 every time I go there for a few subs and some drinks and snacks. I always get my subs with extra cheese. This time I went there and I saw an additional charge of $10.50. I asked what it was for, the guy said it was for extra cheese. I’ve never been charged for this before. I said that (politely) and he just looked at me. Whatever, I was annoyed but hungry so I just paid it. So now I’m up to $40.50 for 3 sandwiches. When I get home, there is a total of 1.5 slices of cheese on 2 of the subs, and 2 slices of cheese on the other. I call the store and tell him this. He said “yes, that’s extra cheese”. I explain that charging me $10.50 for 5 slices of cheese is exorbitant. He says “no you cheap.” I told him I will never spend money at that store again and in my cheese-induced rage I ended the conversation with a “go fuck yourself.” I am pissed about the cheese, but I feel like an asshole for cursing at him.

      "description": "So to start off I know presents aren't required, but they're nice and I try to always give something from the registry, even if it's small.\n\n Background: These friends are not super close, my husband knew the guy (N) from a previous job, but they're close enough that we invited them to our wedding. They couldn't come, but when I saw the girl (S) at my work, she said maybe we could do a \"spa night\" with some of my friends and that she could bring stuff, and that would be our wedding present. Of course I was like \"you don't have to get us anything\", but she insisted so I said yes. Fast forward to the \"spa night\". She rolls up with a bunch of Mary Kay stuff and instead of a spa night, my other friends and I were bombarded by an obvious sales pitch. Some of us even bought small things because we felt kind of pressured. \n\nThis month, S and N got married but we were unable to attend because we'd moved states. I'm also severely ADHD so I kept remembering and forgetting to get them a present. They got married yesterday, and when I told my husband he said that he didn't think we should get them anything anyway because of their \"present\" to us. He also would have rathered them have given us nothing, which I agree with. I know we can still send a present, but I kind of agree with him. We don't live in the same state anymore and we probably won't see them again because like I said we aren't super close. In addition to this we have another really close friend getting married soon and I'd rather spend the money on their present. So WIBTA if I didn't get them anything and just congratulated them on their big day?",

      "description": "I have a good friend with three kids, two of which are the same age as mine. When we had our first babies, we did everything together and were great support for each other.\n\nHer third child is still having naps during the day so sometimes it's best for us to hang out at her house. Which I dread.\n\nHer house is filthy. Not just 'I have three kids and haven't tidied up' kind of mess - way worse than that. Her couch is always sticky with some food stuffs and has crusted milk on the arms from gosh knows when. The floor is a mixture of sticky and crusty with crumbs, sand, food etc. \n\nThey can't eat at the dining table because it's a mountain of washing and so the kids eat on the floor in the lounge room, making even more mess. Instead of cleaning the mess off the floor, she lets the dogs in to lick it all up. Which creates more mess because the dog hair is everywhere. One time I came around, her one year old looked like he had a beard from the amount of hair that was on his face. I cleaned it off and she just laughed, saying he always has a beard.\n\nThe kids each have a separate room but their doors can't be fully opened because there is stuff everywhere. They have to stand on top of mountains of toys and clothes to get to their beds. The kitchen bin is always overflowing and the youngest is often found playing with overflowing rubbish that has fallen out the top. \n\nShe has a supportive husband so she doesn't need to go to work, plus has a nanny come in two days a week to help out. Her parents also come around a couple of times a week to fold laundry and clear her dining table. She's in good mental health and is a wonderful mother, but I don't know whether she sees how bad her house is getting.\n\nI really don't want to go around to her house and have started keeping track of her baby's nap times so I can suggest activities outside of the house. I like spending time with her and our kids get along great, but the filth just gets to me. I'm almost at the point of telling her I don't want to go over there any more. AITA? ",

I don’t judge because I don’t know what goes on in his life, but it was his responsibility to say something. My advisor’s class is not one to be taken lightly; the material is difficult (this is a senior undergrad or first-semester grad class in analog design), and procrastinating is the easiest way to at most a C, maybe barely a B if lucky and the average is low enough. I’d feel sorry for him having gotten a D if he were a better student... I wanna feel sorry for him, but I don’t... AITA? Also in my dept the minimum to pass is a C.",

      "description": "I'm in a relatively new 'relationship', and it's going ok. We get on well, see each other often, and have a good time together. From their perspective (as far as I know) everything is going swimmingly and we are on track to start moving forward, but I know that it's going nowhere. And yet, I've not ended it.\n\nThere are basically three reasons I'm not enjoying it like I should be, all of which make me think that I'm an asshole.\n\n1. I don't find them particularly attractive. \n\nThis is the big one, and the one that I'm really ashamed of. They've got a great personality, an amazing sense of humor, and 'get' me really well. But physically, I'm just not really into it. I think I should be able to look past it, but I just don't seem to be able to.\n\n2. The sex is pretty mediocre.\n\nPretty much a direct consequence of number one, but I feel like it's important enough to be mentioned. It's a big part of our time together and I just don't really enjoy it. I also obviously have to maintain the illusion that I do, which is frankly exhausting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my conscience is telling me that I shouldn't be dragging this out, that I need to stop seeing them before it gets too serious. But I haven't yet, and can't seem to bring myself to. For one, I do like them. They're a good source of fun, and definitely improve my life significantly. Selfish I know, but I don't want to lose that. We also have some good mutual friends, and I don't want there to be any splits in the friendship group. I don't think it will be an issue, but I don't know how invested my partner is in the relationship so I can't say for sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what is the verdict? Am I an asshole for dragging this out and wasting someone's time, or is it all ok as long as we are having a good time?",

      "description": "Hello everyone, not really sure of the rules or anything so sorry in advance.\n\nI recently (about 2ish months ago) moved in with my lovely boyfriend and our good friend. We are all in our 20ies, and this is our first move (second but still fresh for my bf). My BF works part time and has college part time, so is out most of the weekdays, but is very helpful with cleaning up when I ask, not necessarily just thinking by himself to clean if you know what I mean? Our friend works about 8-3:30 on weekdays (he can start/finish whenever, just has a certain amount of time a week he has to do). He on the other hand, is not good at cleaning up. I am currently not working due to health issues, particularly my chronic anxiety (I know it’s a bit silly haha). This means I am home most of the day every day. I do have pretty bad fatigue which means I can’t do too much stuff physically, and I get rather exhausted fairly easily.\nMy friend does not clean up, he only washes the dishes when asked. He is a wonderful human and so I feel awful for saying this stuff, and I feel like I couldn’t tell him how I feel because of that. However, he constantly makes mess everywhere and leaves stuff all around the house, I have asked him politely on a few occasions to put stuff away and the like but he always forgets or doesn’t bother. I understand he has a lot of work to do during the day, but when he’s at home it feels like he uses this as an excuse to not do anything, he has plenty of time. Both him and my boyfriend fail to even close cupboards after opening. I’m sorry it’s something so minor but is it really that hard to close a cupboard after opening it? And the food mess everywhere. It’s horrible. I spend about an hour every day just cleaning the kitchen alone after the two of them, only for it to immediately get messed up after they come home. Bags are just left in the living room floor when they come in. Cups everywhere. Clothes everywhere. Hairs all over the sink and bathroom floor??? I don’t understand how they even make so much mess. \nI’m sorry for ranting so much. But I’ve asked them so many times just to even wipe up a spill if they make one and then they don’t. They leave food in the sink to smell. The whole house is a mess and I hate it but as soon as I clean it it just gets so messy again, it makes me so sad. It’s like they come home and say ‘wow it’s so clean’ and then proceed to fuck it all up like they don’t even care. My friends room is disgusting, so I know the majority of it is him. I’ve seen him do it. \nI have brought this up to the both of them several times, they say they’ll try but they are busy most of the day so it’s difficult. /I understand/ that they work all day, but they are back by 5 at the latest and play games for hours, is it that difficult to clean a small mess after cooking, or close a cupboard. My friend said to me that because I’m home all day that I can do it, and that he doesn’t have much time so it’s difficult. He’s a good guy, but it feels like he expects me to just clean up after him just because I’m not working. I feel like I should because I’m not working so I have the time and I should be useful to them, but I don’t know. It feels like I’m his mother. \nAm I the asshole for expecting them to clean up after they make a mess?\n\nI’m really sorry this is so long and incoherent I just don’t know what to do. I feel so pathetic about it am I making a hue thing over nothing? Our flat just looks like a dump if I go a day without cleaning. Sorry I feel horrible to say this about them when they are such good people who are obviously busy. Am i just being selfish? Should I just accept this and keep cleaning? I just feel a bit anxious about the whole thing haha.\n\nSo sorry it’s so long.",

      "description": "Some background: I’m a veterinary nurse in Australia. I feel like I am biased as we have had a lot of very hot weather recently which has lead to seeing a lot of patients at my clinic for heatstroke - including some that have died. \n\nToday is a mild day. Only 27°C (about 80°F) but when I pulled into the carpark of my local supermarket I noticed this dog in the car next to me. He’s somewhat brachycephalic (squish faced) which are the breeds at greatest risk of heat stroke. He was also in the sun and was panting. \n\nTo the owners credit, the window was down a fair bit, at least 1/3 of the way but I had just done a drive in the sun with no air conditioning and was feeling uncomfortable. \n\nThe owner caught me taking pictures of her car (I took these in case I had to contact the RSPCA or police if she didn’t return) and had a go at me. She said she was only gone “two seconds” to which I said “it doesn’t matter.” And so on. \n\nIn summary - AITA for giving this lady a hard time when it was just a mild day? Is my nursing background making me an asshole extremist?\n\n[Panting dog in question ](https://imgur.com/a/bOD2doE)",

Most of the people there are 30-50+, and we're about 25 of us, although usually there's like a few missing every day.\n\nSince we've started the course a week ago, there's this mid/late 30s dude who just *won't stop interrupting* the lessons all the time. As in, he will bring up completely unrelated stuff, or talk about this or that, or bring a topic that was talked about 10 minutes before because \"he doesn't understand\".\n\nMost of the other classmates are getting tired of this, and the teacher isn't exactly a very good teacher in the sense that she's just...too soft. I'm not sure if it's because we're all adults or just her good nature, but she does kind of let the students step all over her a fair bit.\n\nI'm getting tired of this too, because it's not like he's adding anything to the conversation, but just being incredibly disrespectful, so, I ask, would I be an asshole if next time he interrupts multiple times, I said something? Maybe asking him to just stop interrupting? ",

      "description": "I've been sitting on this since December, but it still bugs me from time to time. This December I'm in the market to get a \"new\" car. I've been looking online for weeks and have narrowed my search. I take a day off work and start test driving and looking. I had been avoiding it, but there was one at the dealership that I felt was reasonably priced online, and had most of what I was looking for. So I drop by. The salesman let's me know it just arrived and isn't ready to be sold yet (so why's it online?) but he insists that I take it for a spin. \"Works for me\". Almost 1 hour later they have finally located the car in another lot that we have to drive too. Long story short, I spend 4 hours total at this dealership to test drive the car for 20 min. Anyhow, test drive goes well. I like it, I'm interested. We sit down to start looking at paperwork. 45 min, he finally has the right paper work. The price of the car is $2k more than sticker due to fees and taxes. (I get dealership fees, I get taxes. But two grand for a $14k car??). They are also only offering $500 for my trade in, where others had offered between $1,500 and $2,500. At this point, we are about $3,000 over what I expected to pay, and I'm irritated, so I don't even bother negotiating. I shake his hand. Tell him to call me when the cars ready and I might consider it(I hadn't found one I was ready to buy at this point). I leave and go look at another car I had found online while I was sitting around there waiting. I buy this other car the next day(guy gave me $2k for the trade in and dropped the price $1k. No dealership BS fees either). \nSo the dealership salesman calls and texts me the next two days. I don't reply. I'm too busy buying this other car, and I wasn't interested anymore. End of day 2 I get this voicemail: \n\"Mr. Xxxxxx, I know you're a business man. I'm a business man myself. And I call and text you several times yesterday, you asked me to do that, and you have yet to return my calls. That sir, that's just not what business men do, ok, in terms of trying to consummate something. Uh, you didn't want the vehicle, you know, you could have called me and shared that. I understand we get busy, I get busy too, but I always try to do what I say I'm going to do. But it's apparent you don't want the car because you never got back to me. I just didn't expect it to go like that. I'll talk to you hopefully in the near future sometime. Bye.\"\n\nKeep in mind, I test drove 7 or 8 cars, and not one of them left a scathing voicemail calling out my ethics. I've worked retail, I've worked outside sales. I get that sometimes it's part of the business for someone not to get back to you if they've moved on! So am I the asshole for ghosting the used car salesman?\n\nTLDR: test drive car I like. Price comes back way to high. Buy different car somewhere else. Never let salesman know. He leaves a bitchy voicemail.",

      "description": "Using an alt for obvious reasons. \n\nIt’s last Friday night. My wife and I run a small mom &amp; pop restaurant in the US. We are always busy on Friday nights, when we are filled to capacity we have 300+ in our restaurant. \n\nWe welcome people and groups from all background and all walks of life. We do not discriminate against anyone and take care of every customer like they are family. \n\nWe are mainly and chicken and seafood grill. We serve other items, but our main selling point is our hot wings and shrimp. \n\nThere was a family that came in last week from out of town with a special needs child. He was being very loud the whole time and screaming. I politely asked the family if they could calm him, as we were filled to capacity and the screaming was disturbing half the guests in our restaurant. \n\nHe calmed down, then about 5 minutes later he started back again except this time he was cursing and screaming racial slurs at an African American family sitting behind them. This is where I drew the line. The mother was distraught about it and apologized refusely, but I couldn’t let them stay. I asked them to leave, though I did give them 50% off their meal (I don’t feel like I should have.)\n\nI let the African American family eat for free and gave them a voucher for a free order of hot wings, which they said they would use soon. \n\nMy thought process is, they were using slander and racist slurs against a large percentage of our clientele. I couldn’t have that. \n\nAm I the asshole? My family tells me that I singled them out and embarrassed them in front of everyone, but if this was a national chain they were in doing this then they would have been kicked out immediately with no exceptions.

      "description": "Long-time lurker, first time poster. \n\nSome context... I (M34) have a best friend (F33), who’ve I’ve been close with for 14 years. We’ve never had any romantic involvement with each other and we’re solidly in a “love you like a sibling” type friendship. Recently, she got involved with a guy who was cheating on his GF to bang her. She went on about how close they were getting, how much she liked him, how much he liked her, etc. There’s other details that I won’t get into, but suffice to say that, from my perspective, it looked like this guy was playing her for sex. So I told her that. A few times. Fast-forward a few weeks and, surprise-surprise, the guy tells her that he’s staying with his GF and so they break things off. A few other things were happening concurrently with her - her own relationship with her (now ex) BF was falling a part and she had to move back in with her parents, a friend of hers died of cancer (after a year’s long struggle) and she had some weird skin reaction so her face was pretty busted for a number of days. This all culminated in some texts back-and-forth between us and I was breaking her balls about getting involved with some loser and that her face was gross (not my actual words, but you get the idea). It’s important to note that we definitely have a well-established dynamic of ball-breaking and that she had previously complained about her ex-BF for being too sensitive about such things. She’s since freaked out at me for what I said to her, even though at the time we were texting, I backed off and apologized once she told me she was offended. It’s been 2 days since that and she’s still going off on me and I keep apologizing and saying I wasn’t trying to offend, be mean, etc and that I was just breaking balls, but she’s not accepting it. I feel caught off guard by the whole thing, but do appreciate why she got upset in the first place (obviously she’s going through a hard time right now and I was a little insensitive and crossed the line), but the fact that it’s going on for days and now she’s basically not talking to me, unless to telling me to fuck off, is causing me to question myself.

      "description": "Back in high school (6 years ago) I used to get on a my friend’s school bus with and talk to them for a little bit while the bus was in the lot. Then I’d get off and go over to my bus before they all left the lot. I never caused any trouble. I simply sat next to my friends, talked for a bit, and then left (I didn’t really know anyone from my own bus).\n\nOne day, while exiting my friends bus, the driver shut the door, locking me inside. She told me that I was not allowed to leave the bus because I always come on and sit there and I don’t ride that bus. I told her that was unfair, and I was never told that this was a problem before — I had been doing this for almost 3 months with no issue. \n\nI tried asking her to open the doors, telling her that this bus did not stop near my house, and that my parents would be very upset if she forced me to go to the wrong stop. This led to an escalation, and she refused to open the doors.\n\nI was not going to ride this bus home to a neighborhood miles away from my house, so I decided to just sit on the stairs by the door in protest to force her to open the doors. I knew she couldn’t leave with me there, and I felt justified if she wanted to call an administrator over. Meanwhile, a line of students formed outside the bus door trying to get on.\n\nFinally, after maybe 30 seconds, the bus driver caved and opened the door. Immediately a large student came running towards me up the stairs, threatening me with statements like “Bitch do it again and I’ll fuck you up” and similar statements. The bus driver did not acknowledge this student’s actions, and continued to express her anger over my presence. I laughed at the ridiculousness of the situation and walked off the bus. \n\nI never went back on the bus, but me and my friends made a point to hang out right outside her door until the last possible second. We never had any incidents after that, but she always watched us closely.\n\nEven now thinking back on the story, I feel that my actions were appropriate. In my opinion, what she attempted to do was kidnapping, and would have left me stranded miles from my house. Even though I wasn’t supposed to be on the bus, calmly asking me to leave would have worked just fine. I wasn’t there to cause an issue, just to talk to friends. \n\nDisclaimer: This is based on my memory from 6 years ago. It’s possible I’m remembering some details wrong, but I know the group of friends I hung out with were not the type to cause trouble for the adults at the school. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Ok so throwaway account here on account of my age (17) and what I'll say here. \n\nThis is pretty long so I appreciate it if you're taking an interest in this.\n\nSo there was this cultural exchange program at my school in which around 16 foreign students came to my country for a few weeks; I hosted a guy who had previously hosted me in his country a few months back. One day, one of his peers approached me - I'll just call her \"Peggy\" - and started talking to me; I could speak her language (though as well as her) and I was super nervous.\n\nI usually become really serious and reticent when talking to pretty girls and here it was no exception. The first time Peggy talked to me I was thinking \"What the hell am I doing\" and \"I'm in over my head\" non-stop. I don't think I'm really attractive or charming; this girl was the exact opposite. \n\nPeggy and I talk on several outings and since our conversations gradually get more suggestive and her friends are encouraging me to do something, I invite her to my friend's pool, hoping to do something intimate with her. Peggy agrees and seems to be enthusiastic about it. The pool party would happen to be one the same day as her and her sister's birthday.\n\nI had never had real physical intimacy with anybody before. The closest thing to this that I ever had was when a girl that I \"dated\" a few years prior kissed me on the cheek; that blew my mind back then but ultimately meant nothing and the relationship was too toxic/broken to continue. This thing with the pool could have been my first opportunity to do something like kissing or maybe something that went even further. I don't think I was ready for sex yet but I know I wasn't against the notion; I was actively aiming to do something sexual with Peggy.\n\nSo the day before the pool party rolls around. I get told that one of my classmates (I'll call her Yanny), who's hosting Peggy's fraternal twin sister, is planning a surprise birthday party for both of them the next day. On account of this, I have to cancel the pool party. And they're all leaving in two days. \n\nI cancel with Peggy (much to her chagrin) and I have to tell her that I don't know what's happening the next day but that she had to be there. The next day I show up to Yanny's affluent house with the student I'm hosting, and Peggy and her sister arrive in the evening. At this point her friends are actively encouraging me to try and do something with her at this point and so one of her friends does me a favour and gets them to play hide-and-seek.\n\nI ask Peggy if she would like to go for a walk; I unlock a padlock to the house's driveway gate and me and Peggy leave out onto the street. We walk, talk, and eventually make out - this blew my mind and it was an amazing experience, being in fact so amazing that neither I or her notice the dozens of text messages and frantic phone calls we'd been getting from everybody back at the house. \n\nWe stop once we notice people running outside looking for us and a car drive around as well. Yanny's elder sister pulls up in her car and tells us to get back the house.\n\nIt turns out we'd been gone for like an hour and they had been waiting on Peggy to cut the cake and sing happy birthday to her and her sister.\n\nI was absolutely petrified. We went back to the house and I tried my best to hide from everybody out of pure shame. I apologized profusely to Yanny and her family for making them so anxious. She was extremely embarrassed and so was I; everybody knew of what had happened and even the principal of her school was there at the party. \n\nYanny's parents were probably extremely pissed since they made sure that, in the remaining two days they were in the country, that the students couldn't go on an outing without adult supervision. The next day there was a small dinner for the students at the school and I could tell I was being watched. Yanny's dad, Yanny's mom, and Peggy's \"host dad\" were conspicuously positioning themselves so that they always knew where I was. Just as I managed to go for walk with Peggy again, Peggy's host dad started calling for her and saying that they had to go home. I don't think that normally he would have done that and he did it solely to prevent her from doing anything with me.\n\nPeggy ended up leaving and we've parted ways probably forever. \\**Sigh*\\* It's been like 2 months and I still feel awful for embarrassing her in front of all those people - and at her own birthday party, no less. I also feel pretty raw at the fact that I hosted this nice student and the whole time I was chatting up his friend (and took her out at her own birthday party like an asshole) under his nose.\n\nIt feels cathartic to express everything I've just said. I wanna know; I am the asshole or what?",

      "description": "Basically we just moved in together less than 2 months ago and my partner is blaming not being able to sleep in the new house on having to share a bed with me. He's never been in a relationship or lived with someone before now and I think that he just needs to give it some time so he can get used to the new space and sharing a bed with someone but he thinks the solution is that we sleep in separate rooms. This really has me feeling hurt because the best part of my day is waking up beside him and being able to snuggle up before work and I just feel like he isn't giving it a chance. The other part is that the spare room isn't a spare room it's my lab where I work on all my biology experiments and do my writing and there is no room for a bed there without me giving up my hobbies and there is one other room but it's his office and he isn't willing to give it up for the extra bed and is putting it on me... I think the solution here is to give it some more time for things to settle and maybe to get him a pair of earplugs. ",

      "title": "AITA for not letting my brothers brother in-law take a kitten",
      "description": "So to start this off, we need some backstory. My brother and his wife went through some hard times a couple months ago. Back in May he started having a lot of trouble with his back, he's young so it was very surprising. He ended up getting diagnosed with a couple pretty bad things (won't go into detail). So during this, they ended up moving in with me and my parents (I'm a minor so I still live at home). Our houses are next door so it's not a HUGE deal. But.. we ended up starting big renovations on their house right before this, so their house was semi inhabitable and they no longer had the money to pay for it since he lost his job because of his back and her job barely pays (less than $500 monthly). \n\nSo they've lived here for 9 1/2 months now. It's been hard. We had to rearrange bedrooms and just change some things around. But nothing too hard. (Here comes the good part).\n\nHer family is pretty crazy (its recognized by most everyone so I hope it doesn't sound biased) and so is she. They expect everything and don't want to give in return. So she has this attitude the whole time, we'll make dinner, she won't even say a thank you and then she'll leave her plate on the table and walk away (most times being quiet through dinner). So this goes on for a couple months.. in just about every aspect of life... (note you: my parents are currently paying nearly every bill of theirs, house payment, electric, phone bill ect.) and shes never even thanked them for a thing.\n\nBACKSTORY OVER: HERES THE AITA!!!\n\nThey brought their fixed cat and unfixed cat over (both females). Well surprise surprise, their car got pregnant from our unfixed males. So they don't even take care of their cats, my mom does the litter, I feed them most of time. He works, so I get that.. but she just recluses in \"her room\" the whole time. So now, their cat gave birth and they're almost age to be able to give away and her sister and brother in law want one. They already have a cat.. and they lock in the bathroom, and when it's not locked in the bathroom it's being terrorized by their two big obnoxious dogs (80+ pounds). Since me and mom have been the ONLY person taking care of them, we claimed the kittens as her own. So her sister asked for the prettiest one of them all (he's a beautiful grey and white long hair) and I said no. I've been taking care of them and I don't want any (especially that one) going and being terrorized. Her sister got mad and claimed them as \"(sisters names) cats\" so it's her choice. I still refused and theres a bit of an argument going on now...\n\nTL;DR: Brother and sister in law moved in with us and their cat got pregnant. They haven't taken care of the kittens at all but want to claim them as their own and send them to a home that I don't think it would be treated well\n\n\nSo AITA for not wanting the cat to be treated bad and thinking I have the say since I take care of them?",

      "description": "Maybe this is a little tame for y’all, but here it is.\n\nNew city, new dog park, first time there. I bring tennis balls with me even though most dog parks have them laying around. My dog needs a LOT of exercise and won’t return balls that don’t smell like her slobber. We get to the park and I start throwing. Her first ball get taken by another dog, I say “it’s all good, that’s why I bring two”. Start throwing the second one, after a couple throws it gets taken by another dog. My dog is pretty polite but sly (stray for the first year) so instead of challenging for her things back she’ll try to sneak it back. Anyway, both dogs are growling at her when she shows that she wants one back. She goes back a forth, and one of the dogs drops the ball and growls/barks/snaps at her. The both owners are watching this and just chatting about something else. The owner of the snapper says something like “guess that’s her ball” in too friendly of a tone. I just stand there for at least a minute, so that someone does something (they know the two balls were the ones I brought and it obvious my dog wants one back). I say “could I get one of my balls back?” In probably a semi-frustrated tone. A third owner says “there’s plenty around the park”, I say “she only likes the one that smell like her”, then the two thief owners wrestle the balls away from their dogs and give them back.  They all kind of scoff and I’m thrown a bunch of shade the rest of the time I’m there. Besides maybe ostracizing myself from my new park, AITA?",

      "description": "A couple friends an I went to our local carnival a couple weeks ago. Everyone knows that carnivals are known for ripping you off and rigging games, so we weren’t surprised when we showed up and found out they weren’t selling bracelets for the rides, but we had to pay for every ride we went on.\n\nThis immediately ruined the mood but we decided to only pay for one ride, and take a bunch of pictures then just walk around and hang out like normal teenagers.  \n\nTwo of my friends saw this basketball game where you shoot and can win jerseys, but you could tell it was rigged. They didn’t care, and we were all having fun. Then I went to do this game where you are supposed to hang from a bar for 2 minutes. I lost of course. \n\nSo now this is where I am curious if I was an asshole. We walk up to this toddler like game with basketball hoops. We were in line and the lady told us to wait. We did, she came up to us then did the thing where they pretend they are making you a deal by offering less money to play their game.  I could tell this game wasn’t really rigged, but it was definitely a rip off. So I warned my friend and told him, “hey  be careful, we all know all carnival games are rigged”. \n\nShe flipped her shit. She went on a rant about how she hears about carnival games are rigged all the time, and that they can’t be rigged or the game will be taken down.  Then I walk away but my friends stay. I hear her say after, “ I was going to offer you this __ for 20$ but you know...” then glares at me.  They ended up walking away, and it really ruined the mood. We left shortly after. My friends defended me after, but didn’t really say anything as it was happening.",

      "description": "Okay, so this happened some time back. Right around age 30, all of my best friends from high school started getting married. The most most successful guy in our group, Kurt, announced his engagement, and that it would be a destination wedding. He and his fiancée would be renting several adjoining beach houses, where the wedding itself would be held, and where most of the guests would stay. My friends Karen, Gina, Gina's husband Tim, my fiancé Ron and I were all offered accommodations there, which we eagerly accepted.\n\nThe time came to leave, and the five of us all piled in a car to make the 12 hour journey.  It was a long drive, but we were a tight-knit group and and kept the hours in the car fun. Still, it was a relief to finally arrive at our destination.\n\nWhen we pulled up to the address we were directed to, we were suitably impressed. It was a massive, four story house, directly on the ocean. We eagerly spilled out of the car and were greeted by our host, the groom. He welcomed us inside and offered us the tour.\n\nWe piled into the elevator (!), and began at the top. Kurt began leading us from room to room (or, suite to suite, more like), pointing out the sumptuous spaces and remarking on who would be staying there -- college friends and  work friends, mainly. I don't remember exactly, but over 3 floors there were between 10 and 12 bedrooms total, most with their own en suite bath. \n\nWe finally reached the bottom floor -- the basement. Kurt stepped down a short hallway, extended his arm and said, \"This one's your room.\" The five of us crowded into the doorway. We were greeted by the sight of a small box of a room, outfitted with a pair of twin bunks. Stunned, I opened my mouth and said the first thing that came into my head: \"There aren't enough beds!\"\n\nImmediately, Gina, Karen, Ron and Tim started admonishing me, insisting to Kurt that this was just great, and thanking him for providing it.  I was embarrassed to be the only naysayer, but I doubled down and reiterated the obvious. \n\nLook, I got it. We were the oldest friends, the ones he least felt the need to impress. And we were a very close, easygoing group; I had absolutely no issue with the five of us being put into one room. But sharing a twin bunk bed, or, what? someone sleeping on the floor?  when all the other guests were kitted out in luxury stung a bit.\n\nEventually, Kurt was able to dig a rollaway bed out from somewhere, so the problem was solved! But my friends (while relieved to have the 5th bed)  thought my response was ungracious, that I made my friend feel bad unnecessarily, and reminded me our stay there was free. So, AITA for pointing out to our host that he had not provided enough beds?",

My sister and I have to decide between ourselves who gets what, and obviously, we both want to larger room. Her reasoning is that she practices dancing in her room (she dances for a studio) , that I will only have it for 1.5 yrs before I leave for university, and that all I do in my current room is sit at my desk or on the bed, which is fair enough in all honesty. \n\nMy reasoning is that my desk doesn't fit in any of the gaps, making placing it quite awkward, and I'm only going to have it for 1.5yrs, so after I've left she can enjoy it for another 5 or so. \n\nMy parents have taken her side and called me selfish for 'thinking I take priority' - is this true? I'm not looking for anybody to settle our debate, I just want to know whether I'm in the wrong or not :)\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n",

      "description": "I already posted this somewhere else but it fits here as well. \n\nOur parents died when I was young so my my two older sisters raised me and my other sister. We were always short on money so they couldn’t afford to buy us a lot of things. However on my 15th birthday I was given my first pair of vans and they were white. My sister had a boyfriend at the time being 17 and all so he invited her to a family party and she asked me if she could burrow my vans. I’ve always hated sharing and didn’t want to let her use them but I was in a good mood and told her she could. It had rained for a couple of days so I asked her to please take care of them and not get them muddy. She come back on the next day evening and since she had a part time job she left but my shoes were left on the doorway completely muddy. Well the mud was dry already but they were white shoes come on. I didn’t even have time to confront her about the issue but I was so pissed and annoyed at her that she couldn’t even do the simplest thing. I was alone that day in the apartment and thought of a way to get back at her for my self satisfaction. We all know of that hack of using toothpaste to clean white shoes so I scrubbed them for like half an hour with toothpaste and her toothbrush and I’ve never done something so petty in my life. I don’t regret it till this day and haven’t told anyone personally. I guess at some point I did feel regret whenever she was nice all of a sudden but I end up taking it back. \n\nAlso I forgot to mention that she’s those kind of people that believes they’re always right and will disagree with you about anything. She’ll belittle anything you like or show any interest in and I hate that about her. I’m pretty sure if I hadn’t let her burrow my shoes she’d have made my entire weekend miserable. ",

      "description": "First off, this is first time posting so go easy on me. \n\nSo I work nightshift at a open kennel dog daycare/boarding business. We have a no kennel policy so the dogs have to be accessed beforehand hand so that they can roam the facility freely, all the while under watch of employees and separated by size and age. Since its \"no kennel\" there is someone in the building at all times and we have back up nightshift possitions to ensure there is someone there at all times.\n\nThis past week was spring break for most highschools in my town so the numbers for night shift skyrocketed. Normally during the week the numbers are under 10 dogs. But this week the numbers have been anywhere from 25 to 40. Because of that they had the night shift and backup come in so the night would go smoothly. Me and another coworker, call them (coworker 1) clocked in 47 hours over the weekend working a 6pm to 9 am shift, a 4 pm to 9 am shift, and a 4 pm to 7 am shift.\n\nThat Saturday was the first i heard of the numbers going up and the backups being required to come in, when they normally are not needed. So i freaked out and yelled at some coworkers becuase i had important plans that had to be canceled because of work. The thing is, i was happy to work because its a big money making opportunity, i just would have liked to know about the big week and weekend coming up so i wouldnt have made plans.\n\n The following monday numbers went down a little so I wanted to give coworker 1 a break due to the long weekend we had, and because i was head nightshift and coworker 1 was backup. I did the same the following Wensday for another coworker (coworker 2). \n\nIts now friday and i was told the numbers are going down for the weekend and backups should not be required. I ask coworker 1 if they could handle the night since they were head nightshift and i was backup. To which they responded with \"yes i think so.\" Then not 10 minutes later texts me asking to switch shifts with me because their car was in the shop and didnt know how long it was going to take. I ask her if she could ask coworker 2 because they had only worked one night shift this week and i had already worked so much. Coworker 1 told me coworker 2 said that they \"cant\" with no other context. \n\nThe thing is, coworker 1 has been known to make up reasons to get out of coming to work. So my suspicions are high because they ask me the day before to cover their shift for the same reason.\n\nI ask my manager about they situation and they simply responded with, \"we need you to come in.\" \nI have yet to respond and feel like im getting dumped with the shift no one wants.\n\nSo AITA for yelling at everyone for the lack of communication and not wanting to cover coworker 1's shift.\n\nThanks.\n",

      "description": "My mom has been planning a trip to Indonesia for months, which I’ve said no to going on every time she’s asked. She keeps putting off buying the plane tickets for it, in the hopes that I’ll eventually come around, but I have no desire to go and consistently say no. \n\nThe reason I don’t want to go is because we stayed in Indonesia with her family for 8 months when I was 10, and the memories I associate with it are of puppies dying and my mom’s family treating them badly; people over there don’t like dogs, so they leave them outside, throw sticks and rocks at them when they feel like it, will feed them by throwing a handful of rice and watching them fight over it, etc. The last time we went back, I started crying when I saw the newest litter of puppies, because I knew they would probably be dead once we were gone. The whole thing is a long story, but basically the place just reminds me of bad memories and I don’t like being there. The heat, mosquitos, and lack of indoor plumbing sucks too, but i’d put up with that if it were somewhere other than Indonesia. \n\nMy mom and I didn’t have a great relationship when I was growing up, but we’ve been on better terms in recent years. My dad has told me that this trip is really important to her and that I should go to make her happy. The last time we went to Indonesia (April 2018), I was forced to go despite saying no over and over, and my dad told me that if I don’t want to go the next time, I can say no and not go. Now that I’ve said no and it’s the next time, both my parents want me to go anyway. I don’t want my mom to be sad because I don’t want to go with her to see her family, but I also hated going there the last time and would much rather never go there again. \n\nWIBTA if I don’t go?\n\n",

In my mind, its not my issue should you not be ready to take orders and that is something that as the business you should be prepared to handle properly. If the fries aren't cooked or someone forgot to drop new fries to replace the cold stale ones, that affects everyone in line not just the lead car.\n\nEspecially in the case where there are no other cars behind you and they STILL ask you to pull forward, I politely decline and reference the fact that there are no other cars behind me and that I am comfortable waiting at the window for my purchase.\n\nAnd by extension, I totally understand when there are situations where you made a significantly large order and its gonna take time to prepare. It may not be 90 seconds from window to window to make 4 happy meals with 2 Value meals to go, I get that but I'm a single guy and I'm normally just ordering for myself. What I'm talking about is normal activity, 1 order of a burger and fries and a drink.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting to pull forward and simply wait at the window in line?",

My parents said they would plan a small family get together to celebrate, but that never happened.\n\n\nFast forward to today.\n\nMy brother will be graduating in a few months.

Thee gap isn't huge, but we are not close and do not really talk outside of family functions, and even then we don't talk much. \n\nI did ask him to be an usher in my wedding and he accepted then complained (behind our backs) he wasn't made a groomsman (even though my wife's brother was the only other usher.) \n\nI know in a few months my nuclear family will ask me if I will be attending his graduation. To me, it seems silly for me to celebrate someone else's graduation more than my own, so I really want to say no. If pressed, I could say that you didn't go to mine either and make a joke of it, but I'm fully expecting backlash. \n\nSo would declining the invite be an asshole move?\n\nI'm personally hoping it falls during the week so I can say \"I have work\" and be absolved of responsibility.",

So has A, and this may be me reading too into the situation, but I feel like they constantly are flirting with them and every day tells them how beautiful they are. \"I love you\"s, sending little wedding ring emojis, and gushing to the rest of us in front of S how gorgeous and amazing they are are common occurrences on an everyday basis. Maybe they genuinely don't mean to be flirting and are just talking about how great S is, and this may also still just be feelings of jealousy because I still feel towards S, but I can't help but feel like A must have some sort of attraction to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd again, S doesn't really understand, so they don't really encourage it or discourage it. They respond happily, but I feel like it's happily in a friend manner, like how they'd respond to me when I'd compliment them and such back before I told them how I felt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it really hurts me. I know feeling a certain way typically doesn't make me an asshole, but I'm worried it's started to cut into my actions. Now I lowkey try to change the conversation or steer them off course when this starts to happen, and I've even gotten a bit curt with A, which I feel guilty about. It's to the point where I left a group chat when it was going on because I just felt so awful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know a lot of this stems from personal insecurity, and the fact that I don't have many friends ATM. But it still really resonates how time and time again, they say that S is their favorite, most treasured person, and that they're so in love with them. It just... hurts. I'm starting to feel both really bitter, despite being fairly certain S doesn't feel romantically towards them, and also really insecure about my friendship with A. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for starting to get tangibly upset by beginning to impede on their banter?",

      "description": "I am over 18 and I still live with my parents. They are the worst. My only escape is my computer drawing and animating. One day,my parents somehow figured out my password to my Microsoft account, changed it to a children account and added me to their Microsoft family. I hadn't noticed because they hadn't done anything. Until today. They set a screen time limit on MY OWN computer. I saved up for months for that computer. I worked many late shifts to earn extra. Then they set a screen time limit. This locks up the computer at a certain time and only an adult in the Microsoft family can unlock it. I was animating sometime when my computer says \"times up, you can ask a parent for more time or to wait\" I was confused. I wasn't in any Microsoft family, I thought. So I checked my Microsoft account. It says I am a child account. I'm confused. I check in the family section. Low and behold, there are my parents Microsoft accounts as adults. And I'm a child. I walk up to them and say \"Unlock my computer and make my account an adult account. Now.\" They ignore me. So I repeated while raising my voice a bit. They yell at me for yelling at them. I say again, \"Unlock my computer.\" They say no. Then they take the computer out of my hands and hides it somewhere. I'm still looking for it. Now I'm yelling at them. They took my property. Then they say \"you will do what I say in my household.\" and I called them assholes. Then they said that actually I am and everything in their household belongs to them. AITA?",

      "description": "Using a throwaway account just for my safety.\n\n\nBasically I’ve lived with my mom my entire life. She’s abusive, physically, emotionally, sexually, and verbally. My mom has tried countless times to get me to hate my dad. Because he was in the military, he moved around and my mom was not willing to stick by his side. \n\n\nThe last time I seen my dad before recently was 2 years ago. Then 5 months ago, he got in contact with my mother who then failed to tell me he moved back to -our home state-. Fast forward to 3 months ago, he found my social media and messaged me. He then said something along the lines of “For someone who really hates me you seem to be understanding”. That’s when i was confused because?? what??\n\n\nHe tells me my mom said that I SAID I wanted nothing to do with him. So i confronted my mom about it and she denied denied denied until finally she knew she had to tell the truth. Since then, I’d occasionally meet with him and his wife (technically my step mom) and go out to do something. They’re actually really nice. But here’s where everything goes downhill. My mom now wants to move. I don’t mean something small like Los angeles to Vegas. She wants to move from US to Canada. \n\n\nNot to mention she’s never said anything about wanting to move. She says my dad is no good and he’ll just wind up breaking my heart and go have a new daughter since he has a new wife. I argued that he’s not like that and i could stay with him and in return, she beat me. My dad has a room for me at his house and says i’m welcomed anytime. I want to know AITA for wanting to go. Because my mom raised me alone and i know i am a burden so i’d seem selfish for wanting to go with my dad. \n\n\nI don’t know what to really do if you guys could help, i’d appreciate it a lot!!",

The daughter was quiet the entire time and I overheard the father tell her to sit down and be quiet and no more play time.\n\nI felt like a dumbass but not only that I pissed off about 40 angry people who were late to their destination.\n\nTL;DR: I called the cops on a potential pedo and it turned out that he was just a father with his young daughter.

      "description": "My mom tells me 2 days before my daughter’s birthday party that she has a new boyfriend...who is my age. I let her know he’s not welcome at my daughter’s party. Firstly, I don’t accept the relationship due to the age diff bc she did this once and the man went around my hometown telling people he was dating me, that I was a stripper and then ends up at bars hitting on my friends after they break up. So embarrassing. Secondly, I feel no need to ever meet any of my mom’s boyfriends,especially not during this event, as she’s had a relationship that lasted longer than a year and a half MAYBE twice in my lifetime. (I’m 30) She initially tells me she’s bringing him anyways or she’s not coming. Eventually, she agrees to come alone. Morning of the party she tells me she’ll be late as she has to do some things for my grandpa. She never shows. Doesn’t call, text, nothing. It’s been a week. I still haven’t heard a word. I ask my grandma to tell her to make sure she pays her part of the phone bill (she’s on my plan) and then my mom texts me and says, “I take it you don’t want to talk to me.” I got sad bc I love my mom but I told her last time she had a bf my age if she ever did that again I wouldn’t be in her life. I feel like she chose this random guy over me. What’s worse is I feel like she chose this guy over my daughter. If my daughter were older, this would have hurt her too. My moms not the type to have a relationship without shoving it in your face either so I just want nothing to do with. AITA for not speaking to her for skipping my daughter’s party and because I don’t accept this relationship? ",

      "description": "So this happened a few months back. I had this friend let's call her TA, we've been quite good friends, shared similar interests but I always felt she is entitled but I didn't mind, let her do her and I do me right?. \n\nI was at my friend's birthday party and my friend wore a dress which was similar in Color to a dress she wore to her birthday, I was posting clips and pics of the party on my Insta story and she DMs me saying 'That girl is wearing the same dress as me' she even sent pics of her, I just humoured her and ignored it with a 'lol'. \n\nTime skip to a few weeks after that party, we were at a friend's cafe and we got into a discussion about double standards, I'm a skinny guy but quite comfortable in my skin, she was on the bigger side of the scale. I was telling her that I get called skinny a lot. And that's where the double standard comes in, people don't mind  calling people skinny but calling anyone fat is a huge no no. And I personally am not attracted to fat girls. Then she starts going on a rant about how calling girls fat is misogynistic and that I'm objectifying women, she even went as far to say that the word fat doesn't even exist in her dictionary. I was getting really pissed off at this point and I asked her clearly \n\nMe - So you find nothing wrong by calling me skinny?\nShe - yes\nMe - But I can't call a girl fat?\nShe - yes\nMe - Don't you see the double standard there?\nShe - No.!\nMe - *facepalm*\n\nShe has been calling me skinny quite a lot in the entire conversation. I told her that she's fat and I find that unattractive(I wanted to provoke her), this is where she blew up and starts saying that I'm a misogynistic male who objectify women and she wouldn't ever date a skinny guy coz that's unattractive. I try to tell her that, that's my entire but she won't listen and keeps calling me a misogynistic pig. I have given up at this point and straight up told her that she's an insecure woman and not to project her own insecurities onto me. I asked her again if she truly believed if the word fat doesn't exists in her dictionary and she was yes 110%. I saw that this was not going anywhere and left to buy some cigarettes, when I came back she was leaving. I heaved a sigh of relief. \n\nWe had another spat on Instagram DM about the same issue and she brought up something personal that I shared with her, which she used to shame me. She ended up unsending that message and I called her out on that but she didn't respond to that later she blocked me and put me on blast on her Insta story, my friends showed my a screenshot of her story but I don't wanna deal with her anymore and ignored it. \n\nSo AITA for calling her fat, while she had no problem calling me skinny?

      "title": "AITA for getting mad at my wife for leaving our babies’ dirty diapers all over the house?",
      "description": "We’ve got two babies, only about a year apart, so the last 2 years have been non-stop diaper changes.  Since day-1, my wife has had a bad tendency to do diaper changes anywhere other than the changing tables (even the additional one I went out and bought to make it more convenient for her), and just leaves the diaper wherever she happens to be - lots end up on the floors, some on the night stands, desks, tables, countertops... you name it, I’ve found a dirty diaper on it. We have multiple diaper pails, all easily accessible, and she still barely ends up putting them in there (often even find she’s set a diaper on top of the lid of the diaper pail, instead of taking 2 additional seconds to open it and drop it in).  \n\nAfter asking her about it several times, and making “mommy’s hiding dirty Easter eggs all over the house” a daily passive-aggressive inside joke, I decided to test her and refused to clean up the diapers she leaves myself. Literally dozens of dirty diapers all over the house, until she finally decided it was too much and threw most of them out (not even all of them). Did this several times, all same results.  \n\nSo I recently kind of flipped my shit on her about it. Our bedroom was smelling nasty, and took me a while to find an old dirty diaper under our bed that was in disgusting condition.  It felt like the last straw breaking my back, and I criticized her for being messy and lazy in general... Now she’s mad and I feel terrible for potentially being the asshole, but... am I really the asshole, though?",

      "description": "AITA for how I reacted \nI feel like my boyfriend will put everything before me.\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years, we work shift work and live about 45 minutes away so we have limited time to spend together. He came over to stay the night after work on Tuesday, knowing I would have to be at work at 11:30am on Wednesday. I asked him if he wouldn’t mind coming to my place as I had 2 double shifts in a row. \nUnfortunately on Tuesday night I was up all night with the flu, barely slept in the same bed, taking up residence on the couch not wanting to wake him when I ran to the bathroom to vomit. \nEventually he woke up and found me on the couch and sat with me for a bit, then went and got me some fluids, and went home. He had the next two days off and I know he needed to get some work done (he is doing an online course). I asked him at that time can he come over on Thursday if I’m feeling better “he said maybe if it will make you feel better”, so he spends the day doing work then goes out for wings with some friends and they play board games at night. \nHe messages me at 11:30pm when he is about to sleep and again I ask if he can come over the next day. Again he says maybe he can do it. \nFlash toward to today, I’m feeling a bit better but not 100% so I ask him if when he is done his school work if he will come over.\nHe says he wants to watch baseball at 3pm, I tell him he can watch that at my house with me! And he can bring his work over for after(I have class work I need to do as well) he says he won’t get any work done. And his whole plan was to do school work and watch baseball. At this point I’m a little upset and I ask him, where was this plan when I was asking you yesterday, if you’d come over.\nHis response was “it was his plan and he didn’t communicate that to me like he should have” \nNow I’m pretty upset, I feel like baseball, is taking priority over me. I rarely ask him to put other things before myself, and I know school work is important. But it feels like he is willing to sacrifice his schoolwork for things he wants. I am also frustrated because when I asked him why he didn’t tell me this was his plan from the get go if it was “all along” and he said it’s cause I would have been mad at him yesterday. \nHe is known to be horrible at communicating about things and he have run into this problem numerous times. In the messages he tells me to leave him alone numerous times, and swears at me.\nI do not reciprocate swearing or telling him to leave me alone.\nNow he is trying to back track saying I don’t want him to do his work, when I initially asked him to come over when he was done his work, and he was the one saying he was watching baseball.\nThis isn’t the first time something like this has happened.\nAm I the Asshole for feeling upset about being a priority and lack of communication? \n",

      "description": "So my ex girlfriend went to on a Disney trip and couldn’t be on her snap because her dad is crazy about having phones out on family trips so she left me with the responsibility of keeping her streaks, which I find stupid (keeping streaks). \n\nWhile I was keeping them I found out that she was cheating on me with a guy I really hated. Let’s just say that her name is Alexis and the boy is Brandon. Alexis lost all my trust and lied to me for weeks and I exposed her for it and ended it right there. \n\nSo after two years of high school (now Juniors) we grew closer and started dating again. I have had many loyalty issues since then but never cheated while dating her. Around christmas I stopped having feelings for her but decided not to break up due to the stress of finals and Christmas. But around January I broke up with her. I never gave her my christmas present because we never hung out FOR ALMOST A MONTH. \n\nOn February 5th I started dating “Lindsey” because I actually feel happy with her. Alexis is upset because I essentially moved on in a few weeks which I understand. But then she talked shit about Lindsey and Lindsey doesn’t like that so she made me block Alexis. I still believe Alexis has a good heart so me and Lindsey got in a giant fight about it which resulted in me doing it against my will. Lindsey has my snapchat so she could see if I blocked her or not. Now Alexis is depressed and told her mom she hates coming to school and my mom told me this looks bad and Alexis is sweet but I can’t unblock her due to Lindsey, I don’t want her to be mad at me I love her. \n\nSo should I unblock Alexis even though she hurt me and talked shit. Me and Alexis have already talked about all this and she yelled at me in the hallway and I yelled back and I told her me and Lindsey weren’t dating because I didn’t want to hurt her feelings but she found out otherwise. \n\nAm I the asshole?

      "title": "AITA for telling bf I didn't like his gift?",
      "description": "This is the first year that he's gotten me a \"real\" gift for my birthday.\n\nThis morning I woke up and there were flowers on the table and a card. And in the card was a gift certificate for a gel mani pedi at a salon I've never been to.\n\nSome things to note:\n\n* I've expressed \"I can't remember the last time I got my nails done\" a couple times, but always followed with \"I need to ask my mom if she wants to go for manipedis at (usual spot)\". I don't get my nails done alone, and getting my nails done is so rare that I don't go to unfamiliar salons. Each salon in my area has its own vibe and its own set of unspoken rules and it's stressful going somewhere new.\n* I NEVER get gels. I've gotten gels once in my life and it DESTROYED my nails.\n* I gave him a list of gifts I wanted. New pajamas, jewelry, something from this cool curio shop down the street that he used to get me stuff from, a chess set, some board games.\n* I've told him before I don't want \"experience\" gifts. The last one he gave me was a trip to the shooting range for an intro class even though I have no interest in learning to shoot a gun. Every time he does an \"experience\" gift he misses the mark.\n\nI just felt my heart sink. It was sort of thoughtful I guess? Like I said I mentioned once or twice that I wanted to get my nails done with my mom. So I can see why he might have gone for that. But it also felt kinda like he just hadn't gotten me anything and stopped by the first salon he saw on the way home from work. And I know I won't use it.\n\nSo I called the salon and talked to them and they said that it could be refunded no problem, which was a relief because some salons don't with gift certificates. But I still wasn't sure if I was going to bring it up to him or not. I really didn't want to hurt his feelings and I think he really did try to get me something thoughtful. But it's also not something I could have returned stealthily because he'd see the amount refunded to his card.\n\nWhen he woke up I thanked him for the card and the flowers. He asked directly if I liked the gift and I said it was very thoughtful and I appreciated it. He said \"So you didn't like it then?\" And I said \"It's more that I won't use it and I feel bad that you spent your money on something I won't use. I love you and I know it came from a good place and I'm grateful, but I can't get gel nails and I don't want to go to a new salon all alone.\" And his face fell and he looked crushed. \"Fucking waste of money then. Great.\" I explained that I called the salon and they said they would refund it and that it's not a big deal. That the fact that he thought of me means more to me than the gift, but that I also just really hate knowing he spent money on something that would sit in a drawer and never get used if I didn't tell him the truth.\n\nSince then he's just been kinda quiet and I feel like a total tactless asshole.\n\nLay it on me Reddit, how much of an asshole am I?",

      "description": "   First time posting and it took me a few minutes to figure out, so bare with me on this.\n   My husband and I have been married for over 12 years. In that time each of our siblings have had children&lt;we have 12 nieces and nephews now&gt;. We love our nieces and nephews but we are always glad when they go home or when we leave from visiting with them.\n    Recently my MIL surprised us with a visit and preceded to drop hints about children. She brought up the fact that a cousin to my husband is having a baby after no one thought she would have kids. Then my MIL went on to tell my husband how she had bought him something to help him with his s-count&lt;this isn't the first time someone in his family bought him something like this&gt;. This made me and my husband look at each other like...really, you did that MIL?\n    The visit progressed some, getting off topic of babies but MIL rounded out coming back to me, asking me about my drinking. I rarely drink, though I did at her house for Christmas, but other than that, its not much&lt;my friend and I are convinced my MIL wants me to get drunk and conceive a baby that way&gt;. She continued on by saying how she keeps waiting for that phone call from us about having a baby, and how she wants to see a little version of my husband running around.\n   We pretty much had to tell her if it happens then it happens, which fell on deaf freaking ears. She kept at it till I finally said we would decide by my birthday if we would try seriously for a baby, as we were not in a good place financially at the time.\n    She seemed disappointed and left not long after that.\n   I love my MIL and she has been very good to me when I needed someone to talk to but lately its every time I see her. In November, she brought it up in front of the family at a funeral dinner, asking if we had thought about kids.\n    A few days after her visit, I saw on social media that another of my husband's cousin and his wife are having twins. I know that will be the discussion for the next time we see her. I'm honestly not in the mood to deal with a baby discussion with anyone in my family or my husband's. \n    I love kids but at this time in our lives we just want to be able to do what we want, take trips and enjoy our marriage but really, am I the asshole for being so undecided?\n    ",

      "description": "AITA - For wanting to cut contact with a best friend, now recent bride?\n\n\nThis friend of mine (26F) has been fading away slowly. It wasn't a day over night thing. For the past 3-4 years she started to become distant. Everything would be the same when we were together, but she took a lot of time even to reply to texts (months sometimes), would make plans with me and others and later ditch on all of us. She was always flakey, but got worse over time. Giving not even a single excuse, would cancel lunches, dinners, meetings. Last minute, usually.\n\n\nWe share the same circle of college friends, so It's very hard for me to be the one to set up the fire. Calls and texts only happened to ask for information on things. Or small favors. Or big favors. But of course, I liked her very much and I'm still very fond of the good years and good moments we shared. But I never had a heart to heart talk. I should have had, but I didn't want to stir things up. Or maybe I should have let her go a long time ago. But, I didn't because I don't usually quit on people easily.\n\n\nShe moved back to her home town (2h train distance) in January 2018. I barely heard from her ever since. I reached out and asked her if everything was ok and wished her good luck on an issue connected to her job. I heard from her twice this year. Yesterday was the second time to tell me over text the following: \"Im getting married. It will be In April. Be my bridesmaid. I will tell all you need to know in January 2019.\" On a Whatsapp group we share with the other bridesmaids and fellow friends. Apparently, I was the only one who didn't even now she fell in love, got into a relationship and eventually got proposed. And this isn't even recent, she was proposed a while ago. Yes, everything was unpredictable and incredibly fast. Not her style of behavior at all. Again, I was the only one I didn't know anything at all. \n\n\nAnd now you say: well she was in love. Friendships change. Yes, and I would give her all the space she needed, naturally. But, I was the only one in the dark and for no reason. Beware, we were very very close. Both single children and clicked wonderfully on many levels. Travelled together. Confidents. Drove her to college many times. Always being there for her when she needed. \n\n\nI wished her well of course. And congratulated her on this new stage of life. \nHer reply to me in private? \"I kept you in the dark for so long, I was hoping you wouldn't go so mute about my marriage. You are too chill. But thank you for your good wishes.\" Passive-aggressiveness to a level I never even seen before. Specially from her. Also, marrying in such a short period of time? Very atypical. She is the least impulsive woman I have ever met.\n\n\nNever even shared how they met. Or even his name. Nothing at all.\n\n\nI'm already shattered and grieving this friendship. Hell, I even cried. I don't have any siblings, but it feels like loosing family. I have been thinking non stop over this. What have I done? Why does she think I'm a doormat thats puts up with all bad behavior and goes along with it? I should have had a talk a while ago. Why the distance? \n\n\nAll this mixed signals and ghosting on her part now makes me wonder if she cared as much as I did. Maybe not. Definitely not. I feel used and confused above all.\n\n\nSo, AITA for wanting to cut contact and not even attend the wedding?\n",

      "title": "AITA for thinking my Wife's picky eating is selfish?",
      "description": "So let me preface that my wife does NOT have sensory issues with eating, she does not have ARFID because I realize that is a REAL issue. \n\nLet me preface this that we've been married for 8 years, have 1 kid (4 years old) and this has pretty much been a battle for the entire marriage. \n\nBasically the issue is two-fold, my wife does not want to try any foods besides what she likes (Which is mostly unhealthy foods) where-as I like to try different things and prefer to eat healthier meals. For anyone that has a picky spouse....this doesn't really work very well to just \"hold your ground\", especially with a kid because you cannot make two separate meals each time you cook. Also it doesn't really actually benefit me to do so since I usually am the one cooking (I get home earlier so it makes sense, although sometimes I do get salty about it).\n\nThe problem is basically that she refuses to try new things, any indication of trying something healthy and it's \"I don't want to eat that\". Most people would say \"Well let her make her own things\"....that doesn't work out well when you have a kid to see. Also I receive the guilt trip \"Well what am I supposed to eat then?\" etc..., it doesn't help that she's pregnant currently (3 months, but this is NOT a pregnancy thing for what it's worth) so im stuck sort of doing everything anyways. The second part to that is it's making our kid a poor eater and picky (Which was my greatest fear). \n\nSo now the kid really only likes a few things (Sound familiar?) and that makes it an even bigger pain in the ass. She also complains about her weight (before the pregnancy) but the problem is she eats fast food EVERY single day for lunch. I feel like it's impossible for me to eat healthy now (Outside of Lunch and breakfast). The fast food thing leads into my next problem which is $$$$$$.\n\nSo the secondary problem is her eating fast food for lunch everyday is EXTREMELY expensive, she also wants to go out to a lot of restaurants as well. We aren't poor by any means but I try to keep a strict budget that she is constantly breaking (and not by a few bucks, were talking 3-4 hundred a month OVER). I've basically been forced to eat the cheapest shit imaginable every day for lunch to at least reduce the blowback. 7-8 bucks a day doesn't seem like a lot, but I constantly remind her that this is adding up to be multiple hundreds of dollars a month in just lunch. For anyone that wants to jump in and say im trying to control her im not, I think eating out is fine...but when it ends up impacting our budget (Our food budget is skyrocketed simply from this which just is not sustainable) then it becomes a matter of just budgeting. I haven't eaten out for lunch in I don't know how long, not to mention I have to put in the extra work to meal prep just so we don't spend any money.\n\nAm I the asshole? If I sound salty it's because I am...but I really don't know what to do. I know \"it's just food\" but the money portion of it is more important to me than just missing out on trying meals, but honestly it really is a bummer to eat the same thing over and over when I want to try healthier eating. God forbid if I wanted to be a vegetarian or something.",

      "description": "So this is something that's been nagging at me for a while. \n\nI had recently gotten out of a relationship and going through the loops that does for a person. While out drinking, I sent a texts to my friend to see if she would go see an expensive play with me, \nsince the people I was out with were talking about it and I wanted to see it, and I was in a state where I could afford it.\n\nShe kindly refused stating that was way to much for her and she'd feel bad puting it on me, after a back and forth trying to convince her to just go with me, I drunkenly said that she should just give me a chance. \n\nFor some context, I've been friends with this person for the passed five+ years and about a year or two prior I asked her out but she rejected me, but after a brief period of not talking we managed to remain friends afterwards. I since got into the relationship I mentioned before. This whole exchange probably happened a month or two after I became single. \n\nAfterwards she asked if I what I meant about what I was saying and I said it \"should be pretty obvious\" and that \"I wasn't giving up\". She immediately follows saying that \"our friendship is over, because I am not interested in that\". \n\nWe end the conversation there and the following day I wake up and write up an apology, stating I was selfish, and not thinking about our friendship and just rolling from my break up. I did state I would still like to test the possibility, but I understood if she didn't want that. \n\nShe responded saying she accepted the apology, but stated we can't just be friends if I was going to keep trying to change her mind on the matter. She stated that I had tried to convince her three times, with the first being the time I mentioned, the second I'm not being sure about but I believe it was a conversation we had a few days earlier about relationships and me asking why she didn't like me before (she stated she saw me as a friend and didn't want to ruin that). That conversation was never pointed in a at of asking her out however.\n\nI asked to see her in person so could talk and clear things up, but she said she couldn't do that right now. So I tried to explain my thoughts on why I did what I did. We hadn't really been talking to each other for a while, then she popped back up in my life shortly after the break up so it was a pretty natural response to have the thought in my head. Additionally after the first time she rejected me we never really talked about it so there wasn't ever really a sense of closure, so I was hoping by talking we can close things up and move on from there. \n\nShe then states that she appreciates what I said, but doesn't really comment on what I had to say,  only that asked for space once and that she wants the same and that if I can't have my closure she's sorry. \n\nWe stopped talking at that point, two weeks later I send her a text saying I had a birthday gift for her and that I'd like to be able to arrange something to get it to her, but she never responds. \n\nA few weeks later, and about a month since the fight, I ask if I could get the gift to her somehow. She responded with this:\n\n\"when you asked me for space I gave it to you. Yet I don’t get the same respect from you. I asked for space and therefore it is up to me to decide when I have had enough space. So, no, I don’t really want the gift.\"\n\nI just told her I'd leave it at that and we haven't talked since. It's been a few months now. \n\n\nRegarding the request for space, when she first rejected me I asked for space for myself since being rejected isn't nice and I didn't really know what there was to be said at the time, asides from respecting she wasn't interested and doing what I could to get over it. When we did make some form of contact the matter was never really addressed and we just kind of continued being friends. I honestly don't remember how much time passed between the two points. I feel like the situation is very different in this case.\n\nIn hindsight I realize it probably looked like I was trying to ease my way into her life, but I actually ordered the gift before we even had the fight, but I feel like that is a really unfair assumption of me since anyone who knows me personally knows I'm not that type of person. \n\nI do want to clarify that what I mentioned were the only exchanges I had with this person. I didn't pester them and the two week periods before messages were just that. \n\nAITA for the way I handled this situation?\n\n\n",

      "description": "Saw a similar trending post and reminded me of something that happened to me last year.\n\nI go to a high school that requires students to bring their laptops so every student has one of them. One lunch break, my group was just chilling and out of no where my (now former) friend approached me and said she had something serious to say. She told me that I broke her laptop the day before and that she was wanting me to pay for it. The thing is I did not remember doing any sort of damage to her laptop, all I remember was accidentally nudging her laptop because she placed it next to me. But she claims that my elbow managed to not only crack the screen but also apparently messed up her whole operating system. She was pissed at me because she was wanting to buy a new laptop but now can't because her parents don't trust her with a new laptop. She demanded that I pay for repairs even though I was confident I didn't do shit to her laptop. I cried during math because I just hated the situation. During this time, I didn't have a part-time job yet so I asked my parents if they could pay for it. My parents asked me what happened, and I explained what happened and that I was confident I didn't break it. My parents trusted me and said that they will we did not have to pay for laptop. I messaged my friend what my parents said and that we refused to pay for repairs. The next day however, she acted like I never sent the text and reminded me that I had to pay and that she texted me her parent's bank account number. At this point I was just so over it and ignored her messages. AITA for not paying?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Friend accused me of breaking laptop even though I'm confident I didn't so I refused to pay when she demanded I did. ",

      "description": "Sorry for the long post, I just need to get this off my chest and know whether I'm an asshole or not.\n\nI was bored one day after school and I didn't have a ride home. I could take the late bus but it didn't come for 2 hours, so I decided I'd walk the few miles home. Anyway, walking home requires that I walk on the side of a main road, where the speed limit is pretty high, so I walk on the gravel area on the outside of the shoulder, on the left side of the road (I wanted to be able to see oncoming traffic). \n\nAbout 200-30 feet behind me, I hear skidding \nand I turn around and see that someone went off the side of the road because they were following too close to someone and the person in front of them give them a brake check. So the front car (blue) stopped near the car whom they brake-checked (red). By that time I was walking toward them. A few seconds later I see a woman get out of the red car and start yelling at the woman inside the blue car, who was also yelling through her opened passenger door. Neither car was damaged, and it was obvious that no one was hurt by this point, and the women were arguing and pointing fingers at each other and shit like that. Neither of them saw me walking over there to help, so I figured I'd just continue walking home because I had to pee anyway, and I didn't know what I could do to help. \n\nSo what I'm asking here is: AITA for continuing on my way? Should I have helped them push their car back onto the road again? Bonus question: do you think I caused the skid-out by walking on the gravel?",

      "description": "This is going to be a crazy post and will make some of you a little confused so bear with me. I have a serious conundrum with my marriage and wife that I need help with. \n\nTo start, I am unable to have children. An accident when I was a kid basically sterilized me and I cannot have babies of any type. My wife and I have been married for 5 years, together over 10 and she was more devastated then I was to hear that I could not have children. She has been dreaming of having a baby since High School (We are childhood sweethearts). I had said earlier on in our relationship that I wasn't comfortable with surrogacy, so the idea of her being pregnant went up in smoke when we found out I was infertile. \n\nWell, after discussion, we decided to try IVF with a sperm donor for my wife. I was very uncomfortable with this when I was younger, but after realizing I was possibly ruining my wife's dream of being pregnant, I decided that I was being completely selfish. We saved up and did the IVF treatment and we were incredibly excited. However, after all the work and money, the treatments did not take and my wife did not end up pregnant. She was completely devastated, and honestly this caused a really huge depression for her. \n\nWe had no money left for IVF and she was completely distraught. So, after much discussion, and admittedly some alcohol, we came to the idea of finding our own sperm donor. We settled on someone we both knew that would be okay with it and discussed with him the basic idea of what he would be doing, etc. Sex would not be involved in anyway of course, and it would be completely \"medical\". We knew his physical background, genetic information, genealogical, etc., and he looks similar to me to boot. \n\nNow, during this time, the donor (Who I will call John) had expressed the idea of him being an \"uncle\" to the unborn child. My wife was okay with it, and we agreed that he could be in the child's life if he wanted to be. We have all of this in text form and written as well by the way. Furthermore, we made a deal of no child support of course (My wife and I would never do this anyway). \n\nMy wife got pregnant after the \"procedure\" (And yes, I know how redneck this sounds) and we were elated. Overjoyed. John was happy for us as well. The last few months have been amazing for my wife, and she has never been happier. We announced on FB a few days ago, and she was beaming all day. I am absolutely excited myself, as I didnt think I would ever get to be a father myself. However, some problems have arisen that we were not expecting. \n\nSince the \"procedure\", John has gotten into some trouble with the law. At first, it was nothing serious and I didn't think anything of it. Since then, John has progressively gotten into more and more trouble. He has lost his car, his job and more due to drug offenses (Marijuana. He worked in a hospital prior to this). Because of the arrest and resulting loss of his job, he lost his car due to not paying the bill and he was eventually arrested again after getting too drunk at a bar and causing a fight. His life is quickly spiraling out of control. \n\nJohn has messaged my wife on Facebook these things and she wants to invite him to live with us until he can get back on his feet. I am completely and absolutely against this idea in every way, shape and form. While I am sad that John lost his job due to a Marijuana arrest, he did make the bad choice of taking it with him into the hospital. While it sucks he lost his car, he and only he made these choices. I have flat-out refused to allow him to move in, as I believe he is not going to be good for our pregnancy and him living with us will only invite stress into our lives and marriage. Furthermore, I have told my wife that if he is going to continue this lifestyle that he cannot be around our child, as I do not want any bad influences. \n\nMy wife thinks I am being too coldhearted but I am not so sure. AITA? \n\nTL;DR: Sperm Donor that provided sample needs living quarters and help, am I being an asshole for saying no? ",

      "description": "Wall of text incoming.\n\nBackstory: I've been friends with this girl since 2012, and it's always been a platonic relationship. Last year, we stopped talking for a few months due to an argument we had regarding one thing or another. But around January our friendship went back to normal, but I noticed that she would usually stop replying to me after a few minutes of talking (we live in different countries now). \n\nNow, I'm not the type to force anything on anyone and I just assumed she's been busy due to work or whatever. So, I jokingly told her that I was planning to buy her one of those penis shaped chocolate things that say eat a dick on the box (The Don, I believe it's called) for always leaving me hanging. And she replied that the reason was because her new boyfriend doesn't like her talking to other guys.\n\nSo, I said it was fine. I understood. And she replied with \"Really.\". To which I replied that I'd be crossing a line if I got mad. And for some reason, she kept pushing it like \"Are you mad?\" and eventually, I cracked. I told her that it didn't matter what I felt because in the end it isn't her boyfriend's decision whether she talks to me or not and it's her decision in the end and that the part that affected me was that I thought our friendship actually meant something to her, when it turns out she has no problem with it being over.\n\nSo, yeah. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "TLDR: Step son’s mother wanted to put him in a daycare that is 7 minutes from her and 80 minutes from us. DH told her he would pay for half if she chose a daycare that was more in between that we could actually utilize (and there is a suitable one almost halfway between us). She said no, she’d rather pay on her own and sign up with the daycare of her choice. Since making this decision, she has gone on and on and acts like she’s a victim. \n\n\nWe live about an hour and a half away from my step son’s bio mom. About 6 months ago we were looking for a daycare for SS. BM wanted to sign him up for a particular one, and lied to us about it being a Christian daycare. We don’t really care, I mean we’re atheists but we live in the Bible Belt so this is a common thing. The daycare wasn’t an issue, but the fact that she lied was. My MIL is the one that asked us if we knew, and then BM launched a months-long campaign against her for not “respecting her privacy” which makes me laugh. \n\nDH has 50/50 custody, so it isn’t like BM deserves more convenience because she has him more days or anything. She doesn’t even have more weekdays, we do. \n\nThis daycare is also over an hour away from us. Specifically it is 7 minutes from BM and about 80 minutes from us. When we were figuring everything out, DH told BM he wouldn’t be paying for half of a daycare that we can’t even utilize, since there were other suitable options that are more in between and doable. Rather than being close to her and far from us. Until she got hung up on this one daycare, the plan was for them both to pay half. \n\nI think this is pretty reasonable. There is a daycare that would have been perfectly fine that is 30 ish minutes from her and 50 ish from us. That’s the one we suggested. Still an annoying amount of driving but it was more fair. \n\nShe ended up deciding that she’d rather SS just go to her daycare of choice on her days and she would pay for it all. We asked her if she was sure, reiterated that she could choose a different one and only have to pay half, etc. \n\nShe has since brought up the fact that she’s paying for daycare multiple times in an attempt to guilt DH. His response every time has been, “You made that choice, you didn’t want to compromise at all. You made the choice not to have my help financially.” \n\nShe has also tried to make him look bad to MIL over this and has posted on FB about it. I knew she’d pull that back when she made her choice, so MIL already knows what’s up and she feels the same as us, that this was BM’s choice so she can’t be upset by it now. \n\nThe CO states that they’re supposed to both pay half, but it also says that DH is the one with the power to choose where SS goes to daycare and school. So my thinking is that she can’t really quote the CO when she doesn’t want to follow it herself. \n\nShe went on another rant about this a couple of days ago and I’m just so tired of hearing it. She chose this! \n\nHow do you guys feel about this? Are we the assholes here? ",

      "description": "This happed a few days ago but I just discovered this sub.  \n\n\nI was at a busy fast food restaurant known for its above-and-beyond customer service.  In line in front of me was an elderly woman (EL).  When it came to be her turn the woman working said she could take the next customer, but the EL could not or did not hear here and was not looking or paying attention.  I gestured to EL and said something like, \"oh, you can go now\".  No response.  The woman working says she can take the next customer.  No response from the EL.  I then proceeded with what I thought was a quite large and obvious gesture to EL trying to let her know it was her turn, waving her forward as politely and respectfully as possible.  No response.   \nI'm really patient and not really in a rush.  I also have been going through some weird mental health stuff lately so my thinking is a bit slow.  I was not sure what to do and I figured she would move eventually so I just decided to wait.  \nThen after like five seconds this woman a few in line behind me said, \"Help her, tell her it's her turn\".  (said with a bad/rude attitude)  \nI said, \"I tried.\"  \nThe woman behind me says, \"You did not try, you just waved at her.\"...with like...a lot of attitude. I bite my tongue and the woman loudly lets EL know its her turn.    \nSituation over.  I know it should not have bothered me, but this really made my good mood drop.  It put a dark cloud over my lunch. It really seemed like this woman was being a jerk to me for doing a worse job of helping EL than she would have.  Plus...it's not my job to help her? I kinda figured someone working would take action sooner. AITA for not trying harder to help EL? AITA for thinking this woman in line behind me is a real asshole?",

Forced my to 'love' playing the violin for 14 years, claiming it would make her mentally ill if I did not. She pretended to have anxiety issues when I listened to any but her approved music Mozart, Händel, Beethoven.\n* She refused to accept any girlfriend I have ever had telling me I was better than the 'too common', 'asian', or 'too Catholic' girls I dated. But when I did not date anyone told me that she would never date a loser like me.\n* She insisted at my wedding to tell everyone that she did not approve of my wife and cried several times. The wedding had to be in her tiny village when I by then lived in a different country and most guests had to travel far to get there.\n* She refused to attend the reception we held in my wife's home country claiming health reasons that suddenly started when we got engaged. \n* When she learned that aged 20 to 24 I suffered severe depression and had suicidal thoughts and saw a therapist, the only thing she asked was for me to assure her that the therapist did not blame her.\n* visited me 2 times in over 15 years of me moving away away from home to an nearby country. She was retired throughout while I visited two to 4 times per year and every Christmas even if it meant my wife had to celebrate by herself because she could not get time  off work.\n* She kept telling me she told me so when my wife did not become pregnant within a year after getting married even though I am dead set on not having children.\n\nNow this said mother is suffering from dementia now and I am visiting again for Christmas. We, my dad, her, and I went to see a musical of 'A Christmas Carol'. \n\nI really dislike musicals or anything in a theatre as it's the sort of thing I had forced down my throat as a child whilst prevented from going to the cinema or any pop/rock music concert. But I agree to go along because it makes her happy and could well be her last Christmas.\n\nI cried a lot mostly because I realized how my mother had never loved me unconditionally, how she had made me care for her anxiety issues about my dad leaving her or told me I had to help her get  a divorce as a chld.  I cried because I knew my mother is too far down the dementia route to ever understand how I felt and how she had made my wife's life a living hell. \n\nMy dad who had enabled her antics all my childhood and who would scold me if I said infront of her how I really felt asked me after the show if I had cried. \n\nMy reply was \"I did but not tears if happiness\" and that I'd prefer not to talk about it. His response is \"you are an asshole\".\n\nAm I?\n",

      "description": "My son recently turned 3 years old and has been fighting diaper changes to the point that my husband and I have to chase him down and catch him and then it take one person to hold him in place while the other one changes the diaper. On my last day off (Tuesday) I got fed up with it so I decided that it was time to start potty training. I made a post on Facebook, basically saying what I just stated here.  \n\n\nMy husband's aunt lives with us and we give her room and board in exchange for her watching our son while I work part time. This is typically two days a week from 8 am until 1 pm, and he goes down for a nap at noon...so we're talking 8 hours a week that he's awake. Well, she was out all day Tuesday and came home just before our kids' bedtime, came into the living room and says \"What's this I see on Facebook about Leland potty training?\" I told her that as recommended by a lot of experts and worked well when our 6 year old potty trained, we'll be keeping him home for a few days while he goes naked from the waist down to make it easier for him to get on the toilet quickly. She asked if he'd be wearing a diaper when she watches him and I told her \"No, that delays progress because he's spent the last 3 years pooping and peeing in a diaper so it will confuse him by sending mixed signals.\" She stormed off down to her bedroom and slammed the door, clearly incredibly upset about the news.  \n\n\nI completely acknowledge that with her being our childcare provider, some advanced notice would have been ideal. I made the decision unilaterally in a moment of extreme frustration. But, she refused to talk to us all that night and has spent the last 2 days locked in her room, giving me the silent treatment. I've had to miss my last two shifts at work because she won't talk to me and ultimately I made the decision to resign because my son has been making great progress and I no longer feel like I can count on her for childcare since she can't even talk this out like an adult.  \n\n\nSo, acknowledging that I could have handled the situation better, was I so much of an asshole that her level of reaction is justified?",

      "description": "Before I begin, I shall use an **example name** as follows: **Brian Alex Sherman Felix Smith.**\n\nDISCLAIMER: ONCE AGAIN, THIS **ISN'T** MY REAL NAME.\n\nSimply put, I simply hated my name for four reasons.\n\n(1) My parents had always called me Felix, which as you noticed would be the fourth word of my name. So is my *given* name Felix (as they call me) or Brian (as per the order)? Which parent names their child only to not use their actual first name? IMO my parents are complete assholes for doing this. No other kid from school or the block has parents like this, except for most of my Muslim friends, whose name starts with Mohammed/Muhammad/Mohamed and their first name would be whatever is after that word e.g. Mohamed Salah would be addressed to as Salah.\n\n(2) My full name does not split evenly. I have five words in my name (as per the example). It's a headache filling out official forms. What do I put when forms ask me for my first/given and middle names? How do I even split it? Brian Alex // Sherman Felix? Brian // Alex Sherman Felix? Or Felix (as per 1) then Brian Alex Sherman? See? If I dropped two words from my four-word clusterfuck of a name I would be able to have a lesser headache filling out forms.\n\n(3) It's \\[My actual name is\\] too damn long. Too many letters. I have had so many comments from then till now. It's not bullying, don't worry, but it's just that I prefer short and sweet names.\n\n(4) Having to correct people *every single time* my name is read out. Every *Brian* I heard was corrected to *Felix.* I hated doing that. I want things to be smooth.\n\nI had a family friend whose daughter went ahead with the name change to drop her old identity and the (estranged) reluctant mom disapproved of this action. Daughter initially aimed to drop her entire old name but eventually and reluctantly gave in to her mother's demand to retain the first word of her old name.\n\nI was always told, especially by parents and elders, that every person's name has a special/religious meaning, and in a sense every name given is a religious blessing. All five words in my real name (and the daughter's old name) carry religious meanings. Therefore, a name change in their eyes is a stab in the family's back and \"losing one's spirituality/religiosity\", which are no-nos in my community.\n\nIt would be nice to drop my entire identity in favor of a new one. The middle ground (which is most feasible as it is a possible compromise but I doubt family would be okay with) is dropping two words from my real name to create a nice first-middle-last. But those two words to be dropped carry religious meanings. It's a real headache - on the surface it can be done by informing government and educational authorities and paying a fee, but deep down it's like killing a man.\n\nSo, WIBTA, or am I justified in doing so?",

      "description": "On a throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI've been friends with J for 10+ years, one of my closest friends but part of a wider friendship group (If it's relevant we're late 20s - early 30s). \n\nThings haven't been easy in either of our lives recently. I was supportive of him when shit hit the fan in his life, although not to the level he wanted. The situation was really complex but basically a girl he was casually dating reported him to the police accusing him of raping her. On the night in question they were both wasted and he claims to have no memory of what happened. Since I'm not law enforcement, judge or jury, I didn't feel I could get involved further as nobody can know for sure exactly what happened on that night except the two people involved, J and the girl. It is not as black and white as \"he's a rapist asshole\" or \"she's a lying false-accuser\", especially given the amount of alcohol that was apparently involved.\n\nJ didn't like my stance on this, said I was saying he was a rapist. I believe innocent until proven guilty, but come on dude, if you were so drunk you can't remember whether or not you raped someone, you gotta admit that's a little problematic. \n\nFor the record he wasn't arrested or charged, he was just invited to the station for questioning by the police as a person of interest. There was found to be no case due to lack of evidence. So while it was undoubtably not great, it was also not life-ruiningly traumatic either and our friendship went pretty much back to normal.        \n\nThen a few months later I hit a rough patch. I went through a break-up and since I was living with my ex, I ended up crashing another friend's (not J's) couch. My depression worsened, I lost my job and then I was hospitalized at the psych ward for 2 months. During this time, J was noticeably absent in my life, despite him being aware of all the shit I was going through, not once did he reach out to me, offer support or assistance (even just 'that sucks man, I've got your back'), you know, just be a friend. \n\nOne day when I was in the hospital he called me and spent literally 20+ minutes chewing me out, telling me what a shit person I am, all the many ways I had apparently wronged him and others, being generally offensive \"so now you know how it feels to be abandoned by your friends when you need them\".\n\nI was just fucking done with him at that point and I no longer wanted him in my life. Once I was discharged from hospital I moved to a different neighborhood and changed my schedule up so technically I don't have to see him again. \n\nI've maintained that if he wants to apologize for his behavior and genuinely make amends and I would consider seeing / speaking to him again as it's causing a rift in my friendship group. He hasn't made this effort yet and it's been months. \n\nMy friends are important to me, I'm not close to my family and since the breakup and all the other shit they're my support network. They don't want to take sides and think both me and J are being prideful assholes and should put this behind us. I just can't. AITA?      ",

      "description": "It's not quite what you're thinking.\n\nI'm (28M) married (27F) for four years. Good relationship, I trust her.\n\nAround a year ago, I went on a three day business trip. A friend of hers (very gay woman a bit younger than us) was in town, and I knew they were going to hang out. No big deal.\n\nWhen I got home for my trip, at some point in conversation it became apparent that my wife's friend has spent the night. Again, no big deal. But we live in a 1bd apartment so I asked, 'where did she sleep?' Yeah turns out they shared our bed.\n\nNow at the time, I wasn't really upset. I didn't accuse her of cheating. But I did express that I felt it was kind of inappropriate. She of course told me that nothing happened, the girl was like a little sister to her, etc.\n\nNow here's where it gets weird. Flash forward about six month, during casual conversation I mention an actor that I found attractive - she agreed, one thing led to another and she admitted that over the past few months she had realized she was bi. She didn't want to tell me because she didn't want me to worry about her being attracted to some other woman, all she wanted was me, etc. I took it well and we moved on.\n\nBUT one year later I'm still worrying about that night. The timing works out.\n\nWas I an asshole to bring it up in the first place? If I mention it again will I be an asshole? Help me decide.",

She has crazy moodswings. I never know what to expect. Its uncomfortable as hell.\nShe has forgot my birthday twice, guilts me into giving her money (even though Im a poor student living on my own), didnt help or speak to me when I was dealing with anxiety/depression at 14(had to go to the psychiatric ER alone...), moved out when I was 15, scolds me for having low confidence (even though she never did anything to install it in me growing up), doesnt know what Im up to in life or even seems to care that much. \n\nI dont have any good example as far as parenting goes and Im terrified I wont be a good mother myself as a result. She has gotten better with age with regards to my younger siblings, but with me she was terrible.

      "description": "I’m gonna call my (former) best friend Mary, and her bf John. We’re all in our early twenties, but I’d been friends with Mary since high school.\n\n\nA bit over a year ago she and John started dating. She’s currently abroad in college, so they’re long distance. She told me it’d mean the world to her if the two most important people in her life would become friends too. So she introduced us. \n\n\nJohn and I hit it off really well. He’s become one of my best friends, but I made it clear from the start that I’m ace, and I just don’t swing that way. I know it shouldn’t matter, but I still wanted to avoid any potential awkwardness.\n\n\nI started hanging out with John occasionally. I made sure to tell Mary, just in case. I didn’t think she’d get jealous, but I didn’t wanna *not* mention it in case it would look like I was keeping things from her. And she seemed perfectly fine with us meeting up.\n\n\nSo around the same time though, she got really busy with school. We almost exclusively communicate(d) through messenger, since she’s abroad, and she told me how much her career means to her. She asked me to tone down my texting so she could focus on her exams. I was happy to oblige, because I’d seen what prioritizing friendships can do to your grades. And recently all she’d been talking about was John, and how much she missed him.\n\n\nSimilarly, John also talked a lot about how much he missed her. So I tried to be supportive on both fronts, I didn’t want my friends to be lonely. In the long term it kind of felt like I was bearing the brunt force of their relationship, and I should’ve taken a step back. At the time I thought I was being helpful, though. \n\n\nEventually it got so much that I decided to take a break from messenger. I disabled notifications, etc, and made a point of only checking my messages once a day or so. I think I shouldn’t have been so vague about my reasons for doing this, though. Mary asked me if I was passive-aggressively mocking her own departure from messenger a few weeks prior. I told her, no, I had my own reasons. \n\n\nFast forward to August, and John invites me to his birthday party. Mary’s not in town, which makes me kind of anxious because I didn’t know John’s other friends that well, and I’m a pretty introverted lady.\n\n\nAnyway that night we end up at another friend’s place, playing karaoke till about 2am. John’s friends all leave, but none of them live in the same general direction as I do. I don’t wanna walk home alone, and I don’t wanna pay for a taxi, and I think John feels the same way. So we crash in that friend’s living room, and that’s that. (I should also mention: on opposite ends of a very large sofa, though I can’t say why neither of us stayed in one of the then-vacant rooms. I didn’t wanna impose, but I can’t speak for John. Anyway, I thought it’d be fine.)\n\n\nMary was not amused though. She yelled at me, as much as you can yell at someone over text anyway. She accused me of cutting her off in favor of John, and of trying to steal her man. I was taken aback. I told her my side of the story—everything I wrote down above—but she wouldn’t listen. She told me I deserved the drama.\n\n\nI’m a pretty calm girl, normally, but in that moment I lost it. I told her I wouldn’t talk to her till she got her shit together, that I wasn’t responsible for her insecurities, and then I blocked her. I was feeling a range of emotion that I was utterly alien to me then, but it was overwhelming. So I just. I cut her off. \n\n\nWe haven’t talked since.\n\n\nSo, Reddit, Am I The Asshole?",

      "description": "My husband and I are in the process of moving into an upscale apartment complex, and because one of my biggest pain points with our old apartment complex is that we couldn't use our balcony due to smokers, one of our biggest selling points for the new apartment was that the entire facility is non-smoking.\n\nToday is our second day moving in, and it seems like there are more smokers in our new building than there were in our old complex.  Yesterday, we saw two separate ladies walking down the hallway smoking, and as soon as we walked out of our apartment this afternoon, I could smell smoke.  When we go downstairs, we see that the person smoking is our new downstairs neighbor who lives immediately below our apartment.  He introduced himself and he seemed really nice, so my husband thinks it is a bad idea to report the smoking to the leasing office since the new neighbors will know it is us who reported them.\n\nRegardless, I am planning to go to the leasing office tomorrow to discuss our options.  I re-read our lease, and smoking in non-designated areas is terms for eviction.  If I had to guess, they will probably just send an email at first asking residents to stop smoking, but I plan to keep complaining if this continues.  I really don't want our neighbors to immediately hate us (and I don't wan anyone to get evicted), but I also don't want to live somewhere that smells like smoke all the time.",

      "description": "My boyfriend’s sister came to visit us for spring break. His sister is great and we get along pretty well, so I was excited. She would be staying at our house for 9 days. She asked us to bring her girlfriend we had never met. We were a little apprehensive at first, because we didn’t know the girlfriend, but his sister begged, so we agreed she could stay at our house.\n\nThe first day they arrived was nice, but things went south pretty quick. The girlfriend would leave messes all over the place, drop her dirty clothes on the floor, leave used tampons exposed on top of the trash, messed up our Netflix and amazon prime algorithms by watching things without our permission, and listen to music/tv on max volume, at odd hours of the night (when she knew we had work early in the morning.)\n\nAdditionally, she ate almost ALL of our snacks. I have no problem with sharing food, but she ate almost everything in the cupboards. She also would smoke and juul in our place after we asked her not to. She went in our bedroom and riffled through our things while we were not home. Some money went missing from our room but she denied it.\n\nThe real kicker was when she invited random friends to our house while we were not home. We came home (boyfriend’s sister was out visiting another friend, so she had no idea what her girlfriend was doing) and was greeted by about 10 people who were smoking weed, cigarettes, juuling, a huge mess of alcohol and pizza boxes. We asked them to leave and they gave us an attitude but eventually left. The girlfriend was pissed that we made her friends leave. We asked her not to this again.\n\nBut 2 days later she does it AGAIN. Invites even more people, who in turn leave a bigger mess and went through our personal things. I told them all to leave and one of them called me a “stuck up bitch” while the rest laughed. I had had enough and called my boyfriend (who was still at work) and boyfriend’s sister and told them what happened.\n\nBoyfriend comes home and screams for them all to leave and pretends to call the cops. They leave quickly after that. I was so pissed that I told the girlfriend to pack her shit and leave, as she was no longer welcome in our home. She argued that she couldn’t afford a hotel and we were disrespecting a guest and were somehow homophobic ? She ended up staying at a hotel. Boyfriend’s sister was really apologetic and helped us clean up the messes.\n\nI told a friend what happened, and she said I should have just let her stay there for the remainder of the week and I was an asshole for kicking a broke college student out at night.

      "description": "~~pretty sure the answer is yes but lemme explain cause I want a genuine answer?????~~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so I'm in school, obviously. I have a decent amount off friends and semi-decent grades (my math and science are kinda sucky at the moment, but we'll get to that later). Most of my friends are decent people; They can take critique, they have a sense of humor but can still have serious conversations, they're good to vent to, they aren't bigoted in any way, shape or form, just generally nice human beings. Except for one friend. We'll call her S. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS is a very strange person. She was born and raised in Philadelphia, but moved it L.A. (where I live now) a year before I did. Upon first meeting her, you'll quickly realize she's not really an awesome person to hang out with. She's loud, obnoxious, and doesn't take no for an answer. After hanging out with her for maybe a week or two, you'll see she's also rather gross hygienically. This girl OPENLY PICKS HER NOSE AND EATS IT, **LICKED MY PHONE ONCE**, also \"made out\" with me without my consent. Then, if you're a POC who acknowledges that they're POC at all, a member of the LGBTQ community, *especially* trans people, or probably a number of other things I haven't figured out yet, she'll \"jokingly tease\" you for it. Here's a list of various shit she's done to me that involves her bigoted behavior:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Refused to call me by my chosen name (I'm a trans guy) even when everyone else including all our teachers do\n\n\\-She made fun of the Swahili words used during Kwanzaa **on the day of mourning for our ancestors that my family has**\n\n\\-Tells me me being trans is a phase\n\n\\-Tells her parents it's a phase\n\n\\-Makes fun of my trans-ness with her parents when I'm right there and can hear her\n\n\\-Makes fun of my mental health issues\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's other shit she's done that I absolutely hate, but I'd go on forever if I listed everything. The thing is though, I still hang out with her. Trust me, if I had more of a choice, I wouldn't, but my mom says I have to (my parents are also unsupportive of my transition, so there's not much complaining I can do). Even when I told my parents about this stuff I thought they would care about, they just brushed me off. I'm still forced to go to dinner with this girl once a week. My house is pretty far away from school, so she usually drives me. I feel like I'm using a girl with no friends other than me to avoid having to walk 3 quarters of a mile. Sure, she's kinda mean a lot of the time but she doesn't really notice so idk what to do... I feel really bad about it.",

      "description": "Long time lurker but had to create a temporary account to post since others know the main one.\n\nBackground: I live with my parents and I asked if I could have a dog and they said as long as I can afford him and his necessities and take care of him, they wouldn't mind. They emphasized the many facts that they will not help me in any way (buying stuff, dog-sitting, training, etc) which I didn't mind, I have always wanted a furbaby and I wanted the responsibility of training him to be the best doggo ever.\n\nThe first few months was all great, I learned so much and implemented everything I've learned from dog training courses, videos online, advice from friends who have dogs, all that good stuff. Since my doggo is a fairly large breed, it is more difficult to address some issues. I've tried positive reinforcement all the way but it only went so far.. so my private trainer suggested to use a pinch collar. I was hesitant to use this but after a few training sessions with this, the obedience changed for the better and the issues gradually got easier to deal with such as tugging during walks. The trainer suggested not to let him play with other dogs yet since he is still trying to master obedience.\n\nSo after the 6 months mark, my parents grew to love the dog soo much that they started spoiling him like crazy when I am not present. My mom would give him treats non-stop cause he would give those cute freaking puppy eyes.. My mom calls me cold-hearted because I would ask the dog to do tricks (obedience training) before I give him a reward. I want to enforce the training so he is not spoiled and has to earn his treats even if the command is something simple like \"sit\" or \"down\". My parents also love to walk him, but they don't enforce the pinch collar during walks. So the dog is tugging left and right, he's leading them everywhere, he's eating crap off the ground, he's plopping on the ground and refusing to leave, etc. \n\nAt this point, this dog KNOWS who and when he can take advantage of - he would basically revert back to the behavior prior the pinch collar if hes around my parents. My parents would complain to me, asking me why he's acting this way and why he's such an angel when he's with me. They would compare my dog to others asking why can't I train him to be obedient like other dogs. I told them bluntly that it is because they don't enforce the training, and that I do. They still didn't listen to me after I told them this fact. \n\nI found out that my mom has been letting him play with other dogs on walks, even after I told her not to yet since we are still trying to master obedience. She lets him off-leash and he goes running towards other dogs.. I told her that I don't like if the dog is off-leash unless it's in an enclosed area. What if the other dog he's running towards is aggressive? What if the other dog's owner doesn't like dogs being off-leash? She then continues to call me crazy, and that I am making the dog unhappy. One of the main reason that I am overly upset right now is because my mom told me that the dog saw other dogs from the other side of the park and he went running towards them- leading to the fall of my mom and letting go cause of severe leash burn. I've tolerated so much regarding about the dog but my mom just continues not to listen and tells me that I'm being a bad owner and that I don't care about his well-being. I got so fed up that I regretfully yelled at my mom and now she's crying.. and giving me the silent treatment. All my dog training literally went down the toilet.\n\nSorry for the long post, but AITA for yelling at mom because I just want her to enforce the training so he doesn't go all crazy and takes advantage of her? I know she just wants the dog to be happy.",

      "description": "Sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes. I'm one-eyed typing this right now cause I am so tired. This one's long and convoluted, so buckle in:\n\nTL;DR: Told a mentally unstable girl that I want absolutely nothing to do with her despite knowing she is potentially suicidal.\n\nJust moved to a new town where I knew only a handful of people. About a month ago I went on a weekend trip with those few friends and met \"Sara\" who was also new to town and would soon be working in the same place as me. This woman has known my friends for years and all seemed well at first. \n\nI immediately noticed that Sara can be pretty insecure and sensitive, to the point that she reads into stupid jokes. Someone mentioned as a joke old people having a smell of moth balls and plastic couch covers. Later it happened to come up that Sara was the oldest in the group and someone joking said \"I thought I smelled that\" or something dumb like that. Everyone laughed, even Sara, and we moved on. Some 12 hours after we'd all been drinking all day later on this other girl \"Emmy\" who we also just met, seemed to be having a good conversation with Sara and referenced the joke. Not even told Sara that she actually smelled or anything. She just brought it up and Sara starts calling her a bitch and being very rude to her for little to no reason. Asking her why she thought that and calling her stupid. Sara was to the point of tears and Emmy seemed very confused and apologised although I could tell she didnt think she had to. They squabbled for several minutes before Emmy and our mutual friend \"Beth\"  left the room to talk in the kitchen. Sara continued to talk about it, crying and pissed. \n\n\nSo the kitchen is right next to the living room. You can literally hear everything that Beth and Emmy are talking about, and they're talking about desserts because Emmy and Beth both like to cook. In the living room Sara is upset saying she knows they're talking about her. Saying she isn't stupid, she knows how Beth feels about her. (Beth and Sara have known each other for years) my friends and I tell Sara that she is mistaken, they're talking about baking and we can literally hear them.  She is not buying it and she passes out drunk. The next morning Sara has no recollection of any of this. We all laugh it off cause we were drunk. Drunk people do weird things\n\nThis was the first incident.\n\nSara and I became fast friends at our new job. We were both new and we hung out together. But Sara quickly became way more attached to me than I was to her. Not to anything extreme but she would talk with me as if we had known each other for a substantial amount of time. Our coworkers were convinced we were best friends and  did not believe me when I was said I had known her for two weeks maybe. \n\nSara likes to drink, but I wouldn't say she necessarily drinks to excess a lot. She told me she needed to take pills for a medical reason and she \"technically shouldn't be drinking on them\" I notice she'd be at the bar for only a little bit and then seemed wasted after a few glasses of wine or light cocktails. She also became needier and craved my attention. If I talked with anyone else she would accuse me of ignoring her. \"Guess I'll go home.\" \"I literally feel like I am invisible right now.\" \"Did you even hear what I just said?\" But I'd be talking to a mutual friend or the bartender, but she'd seemingly get jealous which seemed insane. \n\nI could tell that Sara needed for me to be a a source of comfort. Sara would divulge things about her exboyfriend, her mother who passed some years ago, or talk about work. Sara told me some pretty detailed stuff about her life, but nothing too overtly inappropriate. Just casual things you would tell a very good friend. But she told me the same stuff several times. Not usually in one night but over several nights she would bring up the same topics for us to dissect, but I'd no idea how I was supposed to analyze the same conversations several times. She'd want my input on things that I dont know how to sympathize with or understand. I am not a good person for comforting or telling that stuff to because truthfully I do not care. There is nothing that makes me care less for a person than them wanting me to be their emotion buddy cause I am not like that, I find it exhausting. Sara didn't want time apart from me, we had to do everything together or she was hurt.\n\nSara also asked me if people were talking about her. She thinks \"so-and-so\" hates her. They didn't even know who she is. \"Whathisname\"  said something rude, no Sara they said \"this\" you **heard** \"that.\" \"That Guy\" is staring at me. No, I'm pretty sure he is watching the TV behind you. \n\nIt was our friend's \"Tom's\" birthday, Beth and Tom are an item, have been together for years and Sara adores Tom like a brother. Sara bought Tom a birthday shot, Beth said jokingly \"Birthday Shots? That mean!\" She was being playful. Sara had me dissect that simple phrase for the next week and a half. \"What does she mean? How was that mean? Why does she hate me?\" \n\nBeth didn't return Sara's text one time and Sara sat in her room with me crying upset because Beth hates her. Sara talks about their background how they have a history and Beth has never really liked her since they worked together five years ago. I didn't know any of this but apparently they had beef some time ago and Sara just wished they would clear the air. When I asked Sara their beef she's vague and says I wouldn't understand. \n\nTwo weeks after that we all go to the bar as a group and I am talking to Tom and Beth about our manager who fucking sucks. She has a name similar to Sara's and Sara thought we were talking shit on her. Sara goes off on Beth for this at the bar. It was a verbal berating and Beth rolled her eyes and left with Tom. We go out to smoke and cool down thinking that things have settled. Sara asks our friend, her roommate \"Aly\" to go into the bathroom. They're in there for fifteen minutes. They come out and Aly is freaking out because Sara was killing her good time.\n\n We decide to play darts for a little while and Sara comes up to me. \"Well what about that?\" I wasn't sure what she was talking about because it had been nearly an hour since Beth and Tom left. Sara starts railing me because I didn't have her back in the situation and she would not let up. She is crying calling me a bad best friend, asking me how she was in the wrong, asking me why I have betrayed her.\n\n This literally goes on for another hour, she is completely blacked out. I shut down at one point and tell her that I would speak with her the next day about it. She would not stop. I got so mad and told her to take the bus home. I yelled at her and I do not yell or get angry very often at all. She is sobbing crying, asking if we are gonna call the cops in her. She is making a scene and it is embarrassing. Eventually she gets up and Uber's home. \n\nAly told me the next day she had no idea any of this happened. Sara remembered nothing. Aly had to tell her of the whole thing and Sara says that she remembered it differently, but she had to have Aly tell her the details. She sent Beth a text saying sorry, but she wanted to explain her side. Beth says they have no \"background\" the weekend trip we took was proba ly the most time they've ever spent together. All these years they've known each other, they've never been close but they've never been enemies.  Beth does not want to be around her at all. \n\nSara avoided me for a day and half and when we did see each other I had just gotten off work and she was drunk. She \"apologized\" to me, but wanted me to also admit that I didn't have her back. She says that when she feels betrayed it hurts, and I hurt her. She says I wasn't seeing it from \"her side\"\n\nI did nothing wrong. Beth did nothing wrong. I told her I did not want to be around her anymore. I do not want to be friends with her and we will see each other around cause we work at the same place, but we are not friends. I told her she needed to stop drinking and should probably seek mental health resources.  I will not associate with her from there on out. Aly says that she  could hear her sobbing herself to sleep that night. Sara told Aly that she had told me things she'd never told anyone else and that we were like siblings. \n\nAs of today I have known her for 26 days. \n\nAnd finally  here is where I now think that I might be an asshole here:\n\n More than anything I can feel she is trying to make a connection with people. If we are at a bar she can have a conversation with anyone. She is really kind when sober and really engaging conversationalist. She can relate with whoever and share a good laugh. She is reaching out for a hand to hold. And I refuse.\n\n Sara is on an arsenal of medication for her mental health. Aly accidentally saw how many pills when she was looking for a tampon and Sara has to take them everyday or she is a risk to herself and others. She has had nervous breakdowns in the past and she does not deal with things well. She is depressed and I think for the most part she just has a rotating group of friends because people don't stay around her long enough. No one has shown the care to just make sure she is alright. They dip out and she feels worse about herself. It is clear to me that is girl is headed to a bad end. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but I am fully convinced that this girl is not long for this world.\nAly has told me that she has already said \"Maybe I should just kill myself.\" \n\nOf course I don't want that. But I do not want this girl in my life at all.\n\n",

However I implore you to look at this from my point of view. I start with the statement that there are 3 things I find particularly unsavory. \n\n1. People calling my place of work and expecting an earnest or fun conversation, when I am unable to consent to that interaction prior to the phone ringing as it is my WORK PHONE and i have no choice but to answer it. \n\n2. Suprise visits from literally anybody ever or at any time, and \n\n 3. Anyone having any sense of expectation of me 'hooking people up' , doing favors or randomly having requests.\n\n I was annoyed when you called the first time asking about printers, as again, you are calling me, and expecting me, not the woman at the front desk whos whole job it is to make sure the right calls go to the right place, to put you in contact with someone who can get you the answer you want. Which in the case of 'company' is hilarious to think you'll get anywhere here, as if you recall 'boss' has the say in 9000% of what happens with everything, as well as somehow still succeeding in wrapping me up in whatever you're doing.\n\n In this, you called me at my place of work twice now and in this instance politely expect, not ask, me to get you into the building that you otherwise would not be permitted to enter. This puts me at risk for termination, at a job that I genuinely hate but depend on to live and soon will be necessary to keep for my mental stability (ala antidepressants). \n\nIn our conversations, i try my best to convey that this is not an appropriate course of action with my tone, and my contextual suggestions. \n\nI hope you are able to understand. \"  \n\\-OP",

I haven't said anything to anyone because I don't want to be a dick, should I just move on?\n\nEdit: I should also add I consider an activity a gift, but I'm just sitting at home with my boyfriend getting high like every day. I mentioned maybe going hiking but I guess we are staying in. My sister also hasn't said anything to me today. Am I just too sensitive? ",

      "description": "I'm on mobile so excuse the format\n \nShort back story. Around 20 years ago we found out that my dad had a daughter from previous relationship. Cool what ever I always wanted a sibling since I was an only child at the time. \"My sister\" I'll call her \"E\" totally flipped her shit at the thought she was my dad's daughter and bad mouthed him all the way until she was around 20 something and was married to an abusive drunk guy. She started to call my dad asking for financial help. My dad tried to be a part of her life ever since he found out, at the time E was probably around 9 years old, but she didn't want anything to do with my dad back then. \nSo fast forward 10+ years and she is suddenly calling him dad and saying she loves him. Things got so out of hand that my dad was basically giving her about $2k a month for her to survive while her husband didn't work and basically lived off my dad. My mom and I convinced my dad to get a DNA test just to make sure she was his since there where alot of rumors about E's mom being the friendly girl in town. So turns out E isn't my dad's daughter. Ok cool we have no responsibility to help her. She eventually left the dude and found some one way better. \n My dad still keeps in regular contact with her and the other day she asked my dad if they could come over to my farm and look at the animals and ride some horses. My dad didn't even bother to ask me. So the pulled up to my house this past weekend. She gets out the car and is calling me \"brother\" I told her I wasn't her brother.\nAs we are at the barn she tells one of her kids to ask his \"grandpa\" if he can ride a horse. So I called her out and told her to stop calling my dad her dad. That she never saw him as a dad and only reason she ever called him was because she needed his money and nothing else. She didn't even invite him to her second wedding. Words got exchanged and I told her she needed to leave my house and never come back. \nMy dad is now mad at me and is demanding I call her and apologize to her. I told him no I'm not apologizing to her and I don't want him to bring her to my house again.\nSo am I the asshole for calling her out on her b.s?",

      "description": "**TLDR;** My friend is upset that I'm applying for jobs in another country (to move with my boyfriend). She sent me a very petty message, and instead of replying, I blocked her from messaging me on FB.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some background:** My friend has always been very possessive of my time and attention. Generally not an issue since I can also be a very dependent person, but it regularly comes back to bite me in the ass when I hang out with other people over her, or if I'm in a relationship. She actively tries to get me to break up with people and has admitted that she has never been happy to see me or any of her other friends in relationships because it means she'll be alone. There are some pretty severe jealousy issues at play, and we've gotten around most of them by just...not talking about my relationships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, she is aware that my boyfriend and I would like to leave the country. Permanently. It's a very slow work-in-progress/pipe-dream, and I adopted it after meeting my boyfriend because honestly...it sounds great. It was very out of character for her, but she was supportive when I told her. I could tell she was being careful not to say anything unkind and genuinely trying to see the good points in this move and I appreciated it with all of my heart. While I hate how possessive she can be, I understand that it's something she's aware of and battling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The situation:** Recently, she referred me to her workplace. She knows it makes me uncomfortable since her office is insanely social, but we talked it out and decided that I needed the money and could handle some social awkwardness for the sake of my rent and bills. I've just been offered the job, and accepted it. I let her know that I was also interviewing and applying at other places that fit my needs a bit better and she seemed chill about it. Understood how pay and commute were important deciding factors for me, yadda yadda. But then I told her I was applying to a job in another country:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Me****: I'm gonna apply to this amazing job overseas.*\n\n***Her****: Oh cool! Too bad you're too poor to make that move.*\n\n***Me****: If they sponsor me, I could get help with that. Admittedly, odds are slim.*\n\n***Her****: Yeah. And you shouldn't move until your health is in order.*\n\n***Me****: ??? My health is fine. I'm diagnosed and medicated. Other countries have doctors too.*\n\n***Her****: It'll still take a long time to see someone. It's better to wait to move until you've figured it out.*\n\n***Me****: I don't have weird meds. I can get a couple months filled to hold me over if I need to. Or even go without meds for a minute. I'll be okay.*\n\n***Her****: Okay, good luck!*\n\n***Me****: Thanks, I'm excited!*\n\n***Her****: Who knows. Maybe you'll get it and you'll be able to leave and take your boyfriend with you and give him the life he's always dreamed of. Sounds neat. I'm working so ttyl.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was fuming, so I blocked her from messaging me on FB. I didn't outright block her profile and she can still hit me up over text or other social media. It took her several days to even realize she was blocked and she continued to send me texts without me responding. I finally answered to let her know I needed space and she says something to the tune of \"It's okay if you need space, just don't ghost me.\" That pissed me off even more tbh. We clearly both wanted space, but as soon as she's done wallowing, I'm expected to just be open and available? Grahhh.\n\n  \nI can't help but see this all as selfish behavior on her part, and I don't regret blocking her the way I did. But...AITA for that?",

      "description": "Ok, so for some context; my mother and her family are AVID supporters of Trump and believe that Rush Limbaugh is right, and this is exactly what my mother has said, \"99.99% of the time\". I am not here to discuss politics, but that and the fact that I am a registered Democrat and have very different opinions and views from her are pretty important info for all of the following. This might get a bit long, and I apologize if it does.\nSo my fiancé and I had just finished dinner after seeing a play that his younger brother and my niece were part of at their school. So I decided to check Facebook to see if my sister had posted any pictures of my niece, and just to do some of that classic, endless, pointless scrolling before I decided to get up and actually do something. I see I've got some notifications, so after saving some photos from my sister, I decided to check them. Lo and behold, it was mother tagging my brother, fiancé, and I in comments on posts in a Rush Limbaugh group, posts that were bashing Bernie Sanders. I'm just like, ok, she's entitled to her opinion, whatever. But I would prefer to avoid anything political on Facebook, because my family doesn't debate, they argue and tell you why you're wrong while refusing to hear anything from anyone who disagrees. So, I text her, asking her fairly politely to please stop tagging me in such things. No harm done, right?\n\nWrong. She starts unnecessarily blowing my phone up. Basically, I asked my mom nicely to stop tagging me in a republican facebook group, she took it personally, bringing my father into the argument somehow, and being overall ridiculous, all within 28 texts and 25+ missed calls from her, after I told her I'd be away from my phone to shower. She's being very petty, and I orignally posted this with the text convo, but it exceeded the word limit so I'm redoing it without. If anyone would like to see the messages, let me know.\n\nI've been diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder for some time now, and even though I have drastically improved and gotten better with some outside help, these situations always stress me out to the point that I am a trembling, anxious mess. She makes me feel like I've made no progress at all with my mental health. Which, in my opinion, is not a healthy reaction to my mother trying to call me so many times.\n\ntl;dr - Asked mom to stop tagging me in comments on political posts in a group I don't care for, she took it personally and blew it out of proportion, so I ignored my phone, trying to do what was right for me so I didn't stress out over it all unnecessarily.\n\nI'll stay on for a while, in case anyone needs any more specific information to form an opinion, but I need to know so I can calm my nerves; Am I the asshole here? Did I do something wrong?",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago but it drummed up a lot of controversy and I still sometimes look back and wonder if what I did was the right thing.\n\nSo I used to run a 'Math Monday' program in my senior year of highschool. The concept was pretty simple- Every monday, I send a math problem to the school (there's a mailing list with all students and faculty) and the following Monday I announce the winners. It was just something I came up with which I thought would be fun. The first few weeks went ok, but one day, a new student decided to ask the riddle on StackOverflow and tried to submit someone else's solution as his own. His solution was slightly edited in some places, and he specifically stated in the email he sent to me that \"this is *my* solution\". It was a pretty clear cut case of plagiarism.\n\nThe Math Monday program was still in its infancy. I had sent an email about the rules beforehand but I hadn't considered cases of plagiarism in the rules, so I considered being more lenient.\n\nAs I saw it, I had 2 options:\n\n1-Talk to him about it privately. Don't make a big fuss, just quietly let him know its not okay to cheat.\n\n2-Expose his plagiarism to the school to send a strong message that plagiarism is never okay.\n\nAs you can tell from the title of this post, I did the latter. I spoke to a few friends about it beforehand and they thought I should send the email so I did it.\nThis kicked up a lot of drama at school the following day. \n\nEventually, the student who cheated sent a shitty apology mail saying he didn't know cheating wasn't allowed. It was a very poorly worded apology and just reading it made me cringe and feel bad for him.\n\nHowever, things get even worse. The head of Administrative Affairs( dont remember his exact title, but he's a highly respected/feared faculty member that nobody messes with) replied to the cheater's email basically roasting him for his insincere apology. This made everything 10 times worse and I immediately regretted making things escalate to this level when I could've just given the boy a personal talking to. The fact that he was a new student still adjusting to dorm life) it was a boarding school) made things worse still.\n\nThe strict teachers all supported my decision but most of my friends gave me shit for doing it. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "Hi,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am sorry if this is not a regular am I the asshole thread. I personally suffer from anxiety and I contemplate at everything I do and how it is perceived as I never want to be an asshole to anyone. Also, this is a throw-away because I do not want the attention I guess on my main account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that out of the way, I'm just going to write some stuff. I love my nephew and my entire family, but I try to stay away from my nephew. He gets easily energetic due to his form of autism. I have a personal history that gave me my anxiety at a very young age and I believe I have paedophobia (fear of children) because what had happened can be considered traumatic. I get extremely uncomfortable when I'm around him and at times he's had the pleasure of either a) Wacking me in the private area or b) headbutting me in the private area, which makes me extremely anxious to even think about.\n\n  \nI've tried telling my sister I feel like I have a problem with children when he was born (my nephew is currently 4 Y.O) but she laughed it off, and I've told my parents a lot to try and remove him from my room as my room is the only place I ever feel comfortable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne time, my nephew and my sister came over one time because our mom agreed to babysit. My nephew came into my room when I was asleep and I was woken by a hit in my private areas, and then left me with my nephew who was climbing on top of me whilst she was watching. I pretty much pulled her to the side and said that she has to teach him not to go for any area of the genitals, but I do admit I was shouting at her because I had literally just woken up to a blow in the balls. Thankfully my nephew wasn't in the room but I do admit my action of shouting was unjustified. She left from my room and said she didn't want me to see her nephew anymore and burst into tears and I was pretty livid for the rest of the day.\n\nUsers of /AmItheasshole, AITA in this situation by trying to remove myself from these situations? Thanks for your responses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So me 20m and my lady 19f have been dating for almost 3 years now, we've had issues up until this point but we talked things out and things got better.I eventually noticed she has this huge anxiety about those people who are close to her leaving her, while at the same time treating those people like crap,snapping at them swearing and blowing tiny things out of proportion\n\nthis ended up with me being like,ay  maybe WE need therapy,or just you idk but the issue is she needs more cash flow before we can go do anything like that.(I'm not claiming I'm perfect here btw,just saying I noticed a few fucked up things she was doing and I figured there may be some trauma she needs to work out with someone as I've gone through counseling myself after one of my parents died when I was a child\n\nnext comes the issue of getting a job.She ended up landing a part time job at a grocery store, cool better than doing nothing(6months after getting put of high school she said she didn't want to do anything so she wouldn't) so she gets this job and the second she does constant bitching  about the job ensues, and all these super dark negative comments pertaining to EVERYTHING (like you know people who look for the silver lining? Imagine opposite of that) which I can understand complaining to a point,but this was constant, and then I tell her,hey you know what would fix these complaints of yours and like a lot of other problems? Why don't ya try working somewhere else,talk to the people causing you problems instead of avoiding them.To which she got upset and said \"YOU'RE JUDGING ME, AT LEAST I'M NOT A FUCKING  BUM. I HAVE A JOB THAT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING\"\n\nit's been like this off and on for like 1.5 years now I believe.I'm at my limit it feels like she doesn't care about finding some different kinda job to try to make more money (which I would like to add I'm not asking to be spent on me I have my own money, she always has issues with money,\"HOW WILL I AFFORD COLLEGE, MY CAR COSTS TOO MUCH\"dear students loans or you could work in school there's options!And the car she got was from a family friend that had low miles bought WAYYYY below actual value.)My breaking point was today,she was checking for a job and her friend applied for the same job,her friend got a call for an interview before my gal did, and as she looking through her emails she skips past this one(after reading half of it out loud) about a bank teller position that pays $14.5 an hour full time that wanted to interview her.I asked her why she didn't get back in touch with them and she said this \"I DESERVE THAT JOB (hospital administration) AND I CAN'T BELIEVE MY STUPID FRIEND GOT THIS JOB(more rants about how she's better than her friend)and I'm just like flabbergasted.I think I need to get out of this relationship it feels toxic and like I'm the only one who wants to fix things, additionally I had thought of breaking up before but I wanted her to get therapy so she would be safe and OK if I did so\n",

      "description": "So I have a \"friend\" that I have been friends with for 10 years now. I'm 18 as is he and we met in 2nd grade. We both graduated in June and he went to college a little over and hour away from where we're from. \n\nMe and my others friends started boxing a couple of months ago and we've been sparring on the weekends. So I texted this particular friend and asked him if he would like to spar on the weekend. He said yes and I told him that he would have to buy handwraps and a mouthguard and he said that he could do that. We texted a little more about when we would pick him up from college and we decided that my brother and I would drive to his college which is an hour away on Friday, then when we got back to the town we're all from we would go to the store and buy all the stuff he needed and then spar at my house. \n\nSo come friday we drive up to his school, pick him up, and on the way back to where we're from he tells us he forgot his wallet. At this point we're like 10 minutes away from home so we decide we could do it the next day. Then later I'm on snapchat and see his story. He's at a party getting drunk and high with his other friends. I don't think much of because he's been my friend for 10 years why would he lie about something so insignificant. \n\nThe next day comes around and I text him and ask him if he was ready to be picked up and go to Dick's (sports store). He texts me back and says he's at a funeral and probably wouldn't be able to make it. \n\nAt this point I start thinking. So I check snapchat again and look at the snap map which is basically a gps tracker that tells you where your friends are. I look at it and it says he's in his way back to where he goes to school. So I text him and ask him if he's at the funeral right now. He texts me back and says yes. Then I ask him where the funeral is. He says it's in a town 40 minutes south of where we are from. Where he goes to school is an hour north of where we are from. So I begin to connect the dots and come to the conclusion that he is lying. I double check the snap map an hour or so later, he's at his school. So he 100% lied to me about having a dead relative so he could get out of boxing me and use my brother and I as a free ride.\n\nThere are two things I don't tolerate whatsoever no matter how small the infraction is. Fucking with my money, and disloyalty to me, or any of my friends. (Some people think I'm an asshole for this but for me it's based solely on principle).\n\nThis \"friend\" of mine, cost me money (two hours worth of gas), and completely lied to me about his aunt dying. \n\nFor those who don't know sparring is usually relatively light and you're not trying to injure your sparring partner. However my plan is to pretend to be his friend until we step into the ring and completely beat the shit out of him for 12 rounds while he's expecting light sparring. \n\nFor reference we're both 6'2, he's 150 pounds and his only for of exercise is smoking weed, I'm 165 pounds and workout 2-3 times per week and work a very physical job. So he doesn't really stand a chance.\n\nTLDR: A long term friend of mine lied to me about having a funeral so he could use my brother and I as a free ride home from where he goes to college and now I plan on beating the shit out of him.",

      "description": "For most of this semester me and my friend were hoping to get an off campus apartment starting next year. We were looking into different options. We preferred to have a third roommate to save money but we can’t seem to find one so we thought a two bedroom apartment would work.\nWe have been looking for apartments for a bit now, and found a few nice places. But yesterday he got an offer from two of his other friends to live with them. This place is nicer than the places we have been looking at and is cheaper because there would be three people living there. My friend told me this and I got a little sad. But he assured me he wouldn’t say yes to them unless our plans fell through.\n\nToday, I made some calls to a place that he found, a 2 bedroom place in a nice neighborhood. I even scheduled a tour. I told him this and he seemed dismissive of the idea. When just the other day he really wanted to check this place out. We talked back and forth for a while and I got the vibe he really wouldn’t be happy with any options that I gave him. He started talking about how the other place he got offered to live was nicer and how his mom and gf would much rather him live there.\n\nI got upset and told him that it sounded like he didn’t even want to try to make it work where we could still be roommates. I also told him we could talk later in person about it. I called my mom for some advice. Normally I wouldn’t mind that he got a better offer. But he’s my only option for a roommate next semester and we’d been planning it for a few months. So if he took the better offer I’d be left high and dry. My mom was upset about it too.\n\nI tried to put myself in his shoes and think about what I would do in his situation and I really couldn’t decide what I’d do.\nLater that day my friend and I talked. I told him in the end it’s up to him but that he’s really my only option for a roommate next semester. He said he feels bad and it sucks he’s in this position. He beat around the bush a lot and made excuses that I knew before the better offer was made, wouldn’t have mattered. I told him he needs to tell me what he’s doing so that I can figure out what I need to do. After some conversation I told him I would be upset, but it wouldn’t ruin our friendship. And he told me he would probably be taking the other offer. I told him I was upset but understood.\nLater that night we were together and my mom called me. I told her what happened and she got angry over the phone. She said something along the lines of, “that’s really not fair, you guys have been planning this for so long and now he’s leaving you in the dust”. My friend heard all of it. He felt really bad and told me that we would work something out so that we can room together.\n\nI honestly feel bad now, I told him I would be okay but my mom being upset is what made him feel bad. I love my mom for sticking up for me but I don’t want him to room with me out of guilt. \nAITA?",

I do most of the laundry and I don't want it to pile up more than it is or have to do it so frequently , so I ask my husband to please hang up his towel on the hook to dry \n so he can use it again just one more time before it's washed again. He usually leaves it on our bed or the floor of our room so only uses it once, and if he does hang it up like I asked, he says its gross and he would rather use a fresh one. Like I said this leads to a lot of laundry or worse us running out of towels when we need them. This is thankfully the only the only problem I have with   him, he's gotten much better over the years about putting his dirty clothes in the hamper instead of crumpled on the floor. He showers more frequently than I do, so I'm usually without a towel, it happened this morning which led me to write this post.

      "description": "So a few months ago my gf and I traveled out to her parents town to be able to see her sister be baptized and for her to get family pictures. Anyways, through some very poorly and not concrete texts we had decided that I would stay out in their motor home as they had no room inside and that my girlfriend could sleep with her little sister. \n\nSo everything was good until it was about time to go to bed. Now I had been dealing with an ulcer which gave me incredible heartburn and I would constantly wake up at night in incredible pain and have to take xantax to calm the pain. Since I was staying outside and I knew they would most likely lock the doors I asked my gf to ask her dad if there was a way I would be able to get inside, for instance the door code, if I needed to use the bathroom or take my medicine. To which he responded that he \"didn't know the password and to ask her (step) mom.\" Now this was weird because how could the guy that could look at the camera for the doorbell not know the password?\n\nAnyways, we didn't think too much about it, and decided to go get me settled in the motorhome and watch Netflix. We also texted her mom and asked her the same thing to which she responded that she didn't know and to ask her dad. Now this was confusing, and honestly I was getting pretty upset. \n\nNow to preface this, we had tried to come to house early where we were locked out and her sister(18) was able to come home and unlock the door with the password. We asked if we could know the password and she said no because it was her password.\n\nSo fast forward, we ended falling asleep, and I woke up at 4 with terrible heartburn and was unable to get inside so we both just stayed out in the motorhome. Cue the morning, where we received texts from her stepmother on how disappointed she was in my gf and wouldn't accept any apology.\n\nSo not only, was I tired and sick but now I was angry because we had been lied to and then treated like children. So I, in my infinite wisdom, decided I was going to let her mother know of my disdain. I was riled up. When we went to door I shook the handle and then knocked. When her sister answered she said you couldve just knocked or rang the door bell. I said something disenchanted. Ended up getting into an argument with her mother who said that she was blameless and put it all on my gf for making her out to be the \"evil stepmom\". I ended up leaving the house in a fury because they would not budge. \n\nNow they keep holding it over my head even though I apologized to the mother.  I am now engaged to my gf and they have told lie after lie to try to break us up. \n\nTL;DR gfs parents locked us out of the house with no way to get back in, I got mad, they accept no responsibility and keep holding it over my head.

      "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend that I am not going on any more picnics with her?",
      "description": "For some reason, my girlfriend really loves picnics. Recently, now that the weather has gotten sunny, we've started going on picnics around three times a week. I'm honestly not that big of a fan of picnics because it seems like too much of a bother to pack a hamper and lug it all the way to a park and all that. The amount of work it takes to go on a picnic has only increased because my girlfriend has started asking me to help her prepare food. I love my girlfriend, and I appreciate her. But a part of appreciating someone is letting them do what they're good at. In my girlfriend's case, this is cooking. I could talk for days about how good her sandwiches are, especially the type with crusty bread and olive oil. For the two years in which we have been dating, cooking has been strictly her domain.\n\nThe trouble started around three weeks ago, when she asked me to chop the veggies and eggs for the pasta salad. I was okay to oblige but her requests have become bigger and bigger. I was tasked with pretty much assembling whole sandwiches, frying chicken, and baking cookies. My girlfriend knows that I don't like cooking, and I thought she knew that it was her job. I've never asked her to vacuum because I know that it's my job. I eventually told my girlfriend how I felt about having to cook for her and I thought that we both had a rational and fulfilling discussion. She may have seemed a bit reluctant about cooking for picnics herself, but she did agree that we would both stick to our own jobs. Unfortunately, she lied. Yesterday, before a picnic, my girlfriend asked me to open and cube a watermelon. I reminded her of our agreement and that's when we started arguing. My girlfriend is very mild mannered, I've never heard her actually get into a temper before. I was very taken aback and a bit miffed that she would go back on our agreement and then proceed to yell at me. We ended up not going on a picnic and I ordered a pizza for the both of us. I told her that going on picnics were more trouble than they were worth, especially because we had gotten into an argument over it. It's hard to tell when my girlfriend is in a bad mood because she hides it so well, but yesterday she broke down and cried. I don't exactly feel in the wrong but it's fair to say that I feel bad about it. AITA? ",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey guys,\n\nI've had issues with employment the past year. Who knows why. Anyways, my friend helped me find a new job. I took a job that he didn't want, so he recommended me in his stead to the foreman of the job.\n\nGreat. Yesterday, was the first time I'd been working for a while. I really pushed myself and I think the foreman noticed. Gave me several pats on the back and even let me go 3 hours early while giving me the full days pay. Sweet. Well, my buddy decided to tag along for this morning. Great. I started working and he got really pissed. Told me I was working too fast. He told me to slow down to save work for him. I told him that that was not the person that I am, I do my best whatever it is. He went off and called me an ass, faggot, bitch, etc. I understood that today was the last day anyways, and clearly, there was a great deal of work left to be done. I could see that he and I definitely had the work cut out for us.\n\nMy friend ended up basically hiding for the whole job. Making it look like he was doing something productive. I hate that shit but I totally get it. The pay is terrible.\n\nI tried to contact him to help him to give him a ride home but he told me not to contact him again (not in those words). He is a decent guy who has helped me a lot. I just don't want to see the friendship end. It is not the first time that I pissed him off by doing something I thought was right or by questioning his appraisal of things. \n\nIronically, my friend and I were of only a few employees asked back to come in tomorrow for extra work.",

      "description": " Me (23F) and my ex boyfriend (23M) have been broken up for over 8 months now. We were dating for 3 years. Our relationship has been great until the ending when I started to not trust him anymore. I have listed a few of the reasons why below\n\n​\n\n\\- He started talking to this girl at his work that started to like him. She confessed her love to him and he told me he did not like her. Later I find out that over the few months they were friends, he never once mentioned me.\n\n\\- He wanted to go to the movies with her and her and asked for my permission (obviously I said no). I appreciate him asking me, but throughout our 3 years of dating, he never wanted to go to the movies with me.\n\n\\- He came over to my house and told me he doesn't love me as much as he used to, but doesn't want to break up. Apparently he felt this way a few months before telling me.\n\n\\- He would never allow me to go to parties with or without him.. Which was fine because both of us don't like parties. Towards the end of our relationship, he started to go to parties with his one friend without me and did not care about my opinion. His friend told him that he kissed someone when my ex says he did not.\n\n​\n\nI ended up breaking up with him. It was so hard to let go. He realized he messed up and noticed how wrong he was. Meanwhile he was telling me all of this with a hickey on his neck from a party he went to when when we first broke up. We gave our relationship another try. After a week I saw no change and he just seemed back to his old self and not showing much affection. So I broke up with him again. While I was crying in the car breaking up with him, he told me to hush because he heard a nice exhaust driving by.\n\nFast forward 7 months and he still texts me every now and then saying how much of a mistake he made. I know its genuine because I can tell how hurt he is by us not being together. I know he learned from his mistakes. He hasn't been the same without me and now I feel like I was being too harsh for breaking up with him after 3 years. I feel bad about not wanting him back, but I will always have love for him. But then I think about all of the things he has put me through. AITA for this? Should I have continued with our relationship and tried to work things out when we have been together for so long?",

      "description": "So, a little backstory- I’m currently a freshman in college and I have a particularly problematic dorm mate that we will call Q.  Since September Q has harassed girls on our floor, cheated on his girlfriend in high school, said racist and sexist things, always brags about his money, and is just generally kind of an asshole.  I was friends with him for most of the first semester of college, until we got into a particularly heated argument where he unwarrantedly insulted me for something personal that had happened in my past several years ago, an event that I confided in him.  Although It was heated, I thought that he crossed the line by bringing something personal up, so I blocked him and stopped talking to him.\n\nFlash forward several months later, we got new whiteboards posted on our dorm doors.  Everybody has their own board where they can write messages or draw something funny.  One of my friends who visited from high school decided to put my high school name “X” on my white board in marker.  A couple of days later, a dorm mate pointed out that Q had posted a picture of me on the front of his door without my permission.  The photo in itself was not that embarrassing (Although it does show me at a fraternity although I’m only 18) and the text on top was about my high school.  All it said was “Hi I’m u/ananiacc and I went to X high skool!!!!,” but in the mocking font you see in spongebob memes (Alternating capital and lowercase letters).  I knocked on his door to ask why he posted this mocking picture of me on his door without my permission, and he said that it was funny.  I was completely baffled as to why he would do this, as we have not talked for months since the argument, and we are in no way good enough friends to joke with each other like this.  I asked him to take the picture down and he refused to as he “worked hard on it,” so I just took it down and he retaliated that he would put it back up.  This was the straw that broke the camels back, and I started to yell at him about how much of an asshole he was.\n\nI reported this to my RA, who had a talk with Q about his behavior.  Q said he didn’t see why I was so offended, and when the RA pointed out the mocking font, he asked the RA if he could put up the picture again in a normal font.  Again, my RA told him he could only do it with my permission.  After that, he talked about how I actually offended him by displaying the name of my high school on my door (My high school is ranked high academically), as he thought I was being elitist and looking down on him.  He then talked about how he thought he was being bullied by the entire floor, as everyone avoids him.\n\nAfter seeing how isolated he feels from our floor, I feel that yelling at him may have made things worse, and am worried that I was the asshole for refusing to reconcile with him and just accept the joke.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "A quick backstory leading into this:\n\nOver the weekend, my wife tells me that she needs me to reschedule my streaming on both Monday and Wednesday because she has a \"team meeting\" on both days from 8-11. (Stream time is 7-10) I figured okay, whatever, she wants me to occupy my stepson while she's not here. On Sunday, she says it again and says she has a meeting with her \"team\" to finish work. At this point, I'm assuming she's talking about.....work, like her job. She later makes spaghetti for dinner, nothing else is talked about related to this team meeting or work. We spend 3 and halfish hours watching a movie or two, in the living next to each other and then go to bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday: I do my usual thing, go to work, come home (6pmish), find something to feed the boy with...original thought \"Bruh corndogs!\" Open the freezer and stop. Why not just eat the left overs instead? So I take them out and he and I eat the leftover meal. Fast forward to 7:30p (40 minutes later than my wife would normally be home) And I shoot her a text asking if she wasn't gonna be home until after the meeting. She responds that she's at a pharmacy and the work she thought she had to do on Monday, was completed Sunday and she forgot to tell me about it. Turns out this work meeting, is school related and she would've been home anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to after she gets home (7:50ish), in which she sits in the living room playing mobile games or watching tv. I'm in \"my room\" working on stuff. Around 11p, I'm about to shower and head to bed, she calls me into the living room and says. \n\n\"Next time, if I cook anything, how about you leave it for me to eat? I've been sitting here for four hours hungry and now I'm grumpy.\"   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy response: \".....you could have texted ahead that you wanted me to save that for you\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnter a 3 hour argument, where we're both complete assholes to each other ending with me waking up to a 5.pg text. (She does that when she says she's done arguing but still wants to say a bunch of stuff without me being able to respond)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore going to sleep, on the topic of the leftovers I essentially summed it up to her that: She could have texted me. I could've texted her. We both failed. But this isn't an acceptable answer and I'm a \"selfish unappreciative asshole\" and have apparently lost all eating privileges in the house; which in a very asshole (childish) fashion, I will accept and follow through on.",

      "description": "Some pretext, I’m 17 and I’ve been dating my gf for 3 months and recently one of her close guy friends (she’s been friends with him longer than I’ve been friends with her) just now started flirting with her. He’s called her his girlfriend “jokingly” and has consistently send her Goodmorning texts and FaceTimed her to do homework. She told him to stop flirting a few times but now she doesn’t. She doesn’t flirt back but she also doesn’t tell him to stop because “it’s rude to keep rejecting someone over and over”(her words exactly). I personally think it’s disrespectful to her for him to keep flirting with her because she’s told him to stop and she’s in a relationship with me. Also it makes me feel like she doesn’t respect our relationship enough to make it clear to others there are boundaries. I wouldn’t care if it was a stranger complimenting her at the mall when I’m not there or something, but the guy knows she’s dating me. Am I being an asshole for getting really mad because she won’t tell her friend straight up that he needs to stop flirting?",

      "description": "Hi all,\n\nSo I was in a new town for a job interview and decided to unwind the night before by going to a hookah bar/cafe.\n\nSuffice to say it was a nightmare, I had to reorder my hookah 3 times (walking up to the counter the last two times) because they never actually wrote down the ticket and the servers would just go start shmoozing with the regulars. Then I waited literally 1.5hr for a soda I ordered when I walked in and had to wait another 45 minutes on top of that for a small food order. Fortunately after telling them I’m diabetic was starting to pass out it only took them 15 minutes to grab the soda from that point.\n\nWhen I finally got my cat food meal and ate it I went to pay. I was first charged for the wrong bill and had to spend 5 minutes convincing them that no lone human being could have actually consumed the amount of food/4 hookahs I was charged. When I finally get the right bill they’ve added on a 25% service fee because my “party” (they sat me in a booth with other people, I don’t know a single soul in the state I was in) was more than 3 people.\n\nI go ahead and swipe my card because they won’t budge on that and I have an Uber in the parking lot waiting for me at this point. There’s some sort of error. Rinse and repeat, same error. Swipe a third time and I get the same error, but after signing. They tell me I’m good to go though and that it happens. As I go to leave a bouncer legit prevents me from exiting saying I still haven’t paid up. Since they couldn’t print me a receipt I have to go hunt down the manager who tells them it’s cool.\n\nToday I checked my credit card statement and I see 3 charges and 3 equal credits from this restaurant. As far as I’m concerned if they contact me I’m good for the money but I’m not going to go out of my way to pay them. AITA?",

But over the past 2 years, it went from okayish to bad and now its the worst I’ve seen it. The crazy part? She seems to not care. She washes her face, minimal make up, all the little things. But its getting worse almost by the day. I love her but my attraction level to her is at a very low point.. we’re both mid-20s and to be honest, this is a pretty big issue. I’ve told her countless times, in a very plesant tone, that I think she should see a doctor for it. She shrugs it off as her “diet needs fixing” or more water. Well ok..but she never makes the changes then. I love her but her not really seeming bothered by it is making me uncomfortable. AITA?\n\nTLDR: my girls acne is making me lose attraction. I say go to a doctor and get it fixed. She claims its diet but doesn’t make any effort to change anything and I am not a happy boyfriend; attraction level at its lowest.

When she comes back, we set up the table and chairs, and head inside. She says nothing about the rest of my money, which is a little strange, but I pay it no mind.\n\nThe next day, I wake up and notice she’s not home, not a problem, I’ve been taking care of my little sister for a year now so we pass the time until she comes back, when she does come back I greet her, hug her and go back to my room. After a while, she calls me to the living room, and says “Thank you for the gift!” I’m sort of confused by that and say “Oh, the table? It’s alright.” she then says “No, no, I’m talking about this!” as she points to her wrist, at an Apple Watch, I asked her “did Dad give it to you?” she answers “Oh, no! I just thought that, since it was with me already, there’s no problem! I just borrowed it.” I kind of give an awkward laugh and say something along the lines of “that’s cool” and scurried off to my room.\n\nToday, she came to me asking for a $400 MacBook (she already owns a laptop and a desktop pcs) as I was leaving for work again, I didn’t flat out DENY her but wasn’t stoked about the idea either m (and I think she noticed), the thing that pissed me off the most is that I REALLY like medieval stuff and i was saving up to buy a dull arming sword, but she is adamant about me not getting it because I “don’t need it”, well, SHE doesn’t NEED a MacBook either!\n\nTL:DR Mom took $100 from me unannounced, doesn’t want to let me spend my hard earned money the way I want because i “don’t need it” and wants me to buy her a $400 laptop she doesn’t need.",

      "description": "Hi everyone, so my wife and I just had a baby, who is a girl. We have given her a female name and occasionally dress her in pink clothes or a bow, but otherwise have been raising her with very little gendered anything. I'm not going to give her exact age but she's young enough that she has zero concept of gender whatsoever.\n\nEveryone in our family is very excited, including my cousin. (All adults in this story are 30-40 years old.) My cousin, who we’ll call Alex, is always someone I’ve gotten along well with and is one of my favorite family members. Alex has gone through years of exploration and trauma regarding their gender identity and currently identifies as gender non-conforming and uses female pronouns.\n\nWe have gotten along with her really well through the whole pregnancy except for the fact that she refuse to use she/her/hers pronouns for the baby. We have decided to use female pronouns for the baby because we believe that those are the pronouns that the baby is most likely to identify with as she grows up. Alex firmly believes that children should be allowed to choose their own pronouns when they are old enough to articulate them. My wife and I strongly feel that if our child doesn’t identify with her pronouns that we will fully support her by using whichever pronouns she wants. We also fully intend to let her engage with a full range of toys and experiences throughout her childhood that aren’t defined by being “girl” activities.\n\nWhen we are in conversation and refer to the baby with female pronouns, Alex will respond using they pronouns. It is uncomfortable and also seems to be implying that the way we are raising our child is abusive or unacceptable. At best it seems passive aggressive.\n\nI want to ask her to stop but I want to be sensitive to her trauma around gender issues? Am I the asshole? And if I am not the asshole, is there anything I can do to respect their experience while still using female pronouns for my child?",

      "description": "So a little bit of brief background to the circumstances around my current situation. Two years ago my husband and I moved to a new city for him to start his surgical residency program. I have seen firsthand how grueling and demanding of a schedule the residents have as I see it every day. I hardly see my husband half the time and we live in the same house. There's one female resident in his \"class\" so we have been hanging out and doing stuff together. Over the course of the 2 years I've known this girl \\~50% of the time when we've made plans she's either been late (showing up to the restaurant 30 mins after we planned to be there, I show up at her house for a movie night and she's not there yet) or I don't even hear from her until an hour or so after our planned meeting. It's annoying, as I'm someone who likes to be on time/have a planned schedule, but as I said before I really do get it and try to be understanding.\n\nSo to the event in question. We had made plans to try out a new restaurant about 2 weeks ago. I had a terrible week at work; I was going to be out of town for a few days and had nothing ready. Thursday morning I texted my friend and explained that I really needed to be able to pack and get stuff ready on Friday and asked if we could reschedule. She was totally cool about it and said we'd try another time. We rescheduled for last night. I have Mondays off so I spent the day doing my various day-off chores and was super excited about dinner. I even made sure to eat a really light lunch in \"preparation\". We planned to meet at 6:30pm. I texted her at 4pm to ask if she was still good to go… Two hours later I still hadn't heard anything. My husband was getting ready to head home and asked what was going on. I told him I still hadn't heard anything, and he laughed and said she probably overslept (she was on 24-hr call Sunday). He gets home at 6:30pm and at this point I'm hungry and over all of it. I know that even if she texts me right then it'll take her an hour to get ready and go to dinner. I decided to just give up on those plans and we go grab something quick to eat. Just before 7pm my friend calls me. She says she fell asleep and just now woke up. I asked if she wanted to try again for later this week, and she paused and asked if it was too late for tonight. I just said yes and anytime later this week would be fine. We have plans to try again Thursday.\n\nI know she's exhausted and has a lot on her plate, but my husband is in the same program and if we make plans to do something he sets an alarm and makes sure he's awake. I keep going back and forth between feeling like I did the right thing to decide to blow off dinner last night, to feeling guilty that I canceled on someone for the 2nd time. It's been bothering me since last night... AITA?",

I tell him that it annoys me that he'd treat my boyfriend like that. My friend proceeded to block me and start talking behind my back to my boyfriend. I was just trying to protect my boyfriend because he has a history of mental health issues and I didn't want him to relapse again. Now my friend is fussing at me saying that I hurt everyone and it's my fault that my boyfriend was depressed.\n\nTl;dr: told friend to apologize to boyfriend for making him upset, friend refuses and starts talking crap about me to boyfriend and is insulting me ",

One of said friends enjoys hooking up with people through online dating apps, and while this doesn’t bother me (I even use those apps myself from time to time) it really irked me today.\n\nHe’s been implying / joking all day that he plans to hook up with random people during our stay here. I had no problem with this, until late in the night (1am, we’re tired as hell and about to sleep) he suddenly declares that he’s bringing some random guy to the room and if we didn’t mind if they hooked up in the bed or in the bathroom (which is right next to my side of the bed).\n\nI made it clear that I wasn’t comfortable with this, that I didn’t like the thought of him and a stranger (who we really don’t know anything about) getting sexually involved so close to me. It’s not jealousy or anything like that- I’m just not comfortable with it happening while I’m in the same room.\n\nI offered to leave and go somewhere else while they did the deed, even considered booking another room. He said no, that I should be able to stay here, so the only choice left was for him to leave and hook up somewhere else near our hotel. He left begrudgingly, and my other friend said that I was exaggerating, that I was being too serious about the situation, and that I should lighten up / relax about this stranger coming to our room. However I’m just not comfortable and I can’t change that.\n\nSo.. reddit, am I the asshole here? :/ ",

Not that she drinks too much, but any small amount can get her fucked up. I believe this is a result of one of her meds. My mom is also 56.\n\nAnyway, we recently moved, and ever since then, shes been on every dating site talking to random dudes 24/7. In the past 6 months, shes probably gone on over 20 something dates, and shes likely banged 3 of those people. \n\nShe recently met this one guy that I cannot fucking stand.\n\n Info on the guy: has a house in Maryland (we live in PA) with a boat. Has three DUIs (no more license) and lives with his mom in PA during the winter I guess. He smokes and drinks way too fucking much. He was a marine, but got kicked out or whatever for getting shot or something. We can call him Jim. \n\nSo my mom meets this guy on plenty of fish. She ends up going down to this random fucking strangers house 2 hours away, for the weekend. I did not agree with this at all, but she didn't seem to give a fuck. The name she has this dudes name in her phone as \"jim boat\", and does not shut up about how he has a boat.\n\nA couple weeks my mom invites this dude to our house one weekend, and they proceed to have loud fucking sex like I'm not even in the fucking house. After the dude leaves, my mom says hes not coming back, but she was full of shit because he came back new years eve. Meanwhile I went out with my friends. When I came back at one am, my mom was drunk off her ass bitching and whining about how the dude needed to leave and how I needed to call the cops because he wouldnt. Long story short, the dude leaves and my mom goes to bed. One other time, jim comes over at like 2am on a fucking weeknight and starts having loud sex with my mom. Keeping me up till 4am when I have work in the morning.\nAnd to top it all off, I got back from babysitting last night at 12:30, and Jim is sleeping on the couch, bare fucking nude. \n\nI brought up my concerns with my mom but she doesnt listen, and says that her 18 year old son shouldn't be telling her how to live. I cant even come up with a good reason to be angry right now. AITA for being angry at my mom?",

      "description": "Background: My girlfriend of 2.5 years recently found out that she has a sensitivity to lactose.  It's to the point where she can get too sick to fully function the day after a lactose-heavy meal.\n\nAt first, she used to be really diligent about eating her lactose-relief pills before eating.  For the past few weeks, she hasn't been using her pills at all, despite eating very lactose-heavy meals.  To help her, I've even started keeping a package of them with me if we were out and she forgot hers.  This has become more of a waste of space than anything.  I've been letting her know for weeks that she needs to be using her pills if she's consuming all the dairy that she does, but she always claims that they taste bad.  I've told her on multiple occasions that I don't like seeing her sick all the time.  Cue a few weeks of her constantly feeling unwell, and now she's completely sick (not going to school).  She once again had lunch yesterday without her lactose (pizza if you all cared) and I got upset with her when she told me.  I told her that I will no longer support her decision to ignore her lactose pills, as I feel as though I'm partially to blame for not holding her accountable before things got to this point.",

      "description": " \n\nThis was last year, and all fake names. Done my best to present the whole truth, except the fake names.\n\nI broke up with my gf 2 months before exam period, and whilst she was angry at first, we were doing well fixing our friendship by the time exams rolled around. The day I finished my last school exam, my best friend (Fred) told me that my ex-gf (Maria) and he were together now. At this point, I didn’t really know how I felt, so I told them it was great and they deserve happiness. I got home, and then found I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t play guitar, watch tv, write or draw, anything, because I couldn’t get them out of my head. I confessed this to Fred, and he still wanted us to try to be friends, especially as we had holiday plans, so I committed to trying to make it work, especially as they both meant a lot to me.\n\nA week later, Fred, myself, and another friend (Andy) went interrailing across Europe for 3 weeks . It was mostly fine, I was on good terms with Maria and Fred as individuals, but seeing them interact was getting harder. At the 2½ week mark, I started experiencing this dropping feeling lying down in bed, like I was on a rollercoaster but completely still. I later found out this was related to anxiety and stress. This really freaked me out and I started talking to Maria, saying I was having all these problems and I didn’t think I could be friends with Fred. I eventually calmed down and went to sleep.\n\nThe next day, Fred and Andy kept asking if something was wrong, and I brushed them off. Then later Fred asked me if I still wanted to be his friend, and I knew what had happened. I asked Maria if she had told Fred about last night and she said yes. I replied with a flurry of angry messages and then asked for space so I could deal with F+A. Both F+A were relentlessly interrogating me, asking if it was true and if so, why. I told them to drop it, knowing that it would wreck this holiday and make the last 4½ days even more hellish. We went out to dinner, walked there talking about normal topics, and as soon as ordered, they started questioning me again. I couldn’t handle it anymore, so I told them it hurt too much seeing with F+M together and I wasn't able to emotionally heal with him around, so I needed to stop being his friend. This led to them both criticizing me, saying I was giving up our friendship for nothing and this was all my fault as I had given them my blessing. I was so shocked by F+A blaming me, and lack of sympathy for what was very hard for me. I gave them money for my meal and left. Once I got back, I messaged Maria, saying this is why I didn’t want her to tell Fred. She then accused me of being childish and a terrible friend to all of us and that she didn’t want to speak to me. This was also the last time we ever spoke.\n\nThe last few days were extremely tough, including me storming off in Milan alone and also trying to catch an early flight back home. It was bad for me, but I still feel guilty, AITA here?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I removed my late grandmother’s jewelry box from my bedroom?",
      "description": "I received this jewelry box in late 2015/early 2016, when my parents split up and I had to make a room at my dad’s house. He had moved into his late father’s house and there were a lot of my grandparents belongings there. One day I came home from school and my dad told me to look in my room for a surprise. On my dresser was this jewelry box. It used to belong to my grandmother, my dad’s mom, who died before I was born, but whom I’ve heard was a wonderful woman. \n\nIt is, unfortunately, not the most... beautiful jewelry box. It’s HUGE, maybe a foot tall and six inches wide. It’s shaped like an armoire, with a curved top and this kind of murky brown pine colored wood. With poorly done stained “glass” (plastic) that’s just painted to look like stained glass. It’s also pretty non-functional too, with weird shallow drawers and a big, tall empty space that I couldn’t really use anything for, but as a teenaged girl at my dad’s house I took what I could get. (Girls living with their fathers part time can probably understand this). So I used it throughout high school, and then left it there when I moved to college.\n\nSince then, my family has moved around a bunch and I’ve upgraded my home room to something a lot better. I’ve been living away from home at school for most of the year for a few years, so I’ve accumulated a lot of my own things to furnish/decorate my own apartment. A couple of those things happen to be a very beautiful hand carved wooden box that a friend of mine gifted me that I use as a jewelry box, a smaller ring box as a gift from my cousin, and a really gorgeous larger jewelry box that I got as a Christmas gift from one of my best friends. \n\nNow that I’m about to move back home, I want to make my room feel “mine,” and want to bring back all of the things that have sentimental value to me in my room now, and display them in my room there. These three jewelry boxes are so beautiful and very sentimental to me, and they have served me well here, and I want to bring them home. \n\nMy grandmother’s jewelry box is not very useful to me, and isn’t really beautiful to look at either. And I know it means a lot to my father but, to be blunt, I’ve never met her. I don’t know her at all, so I don’t have a huge attachment to the box. I don’t want to throw it away or sell it, though. So I was starting to consider moving it from my dresser at home and putting it in storage, and replacing it with my other jewelry boxes. But I’ve started to feel badly about doing this, because it is my late grandmothers and my dad would probably be upset if he noticed it was no longer in my room.\n\nI think it may serve a better purpose when I move into my own place, maybe as a decorative piece in a guest room or something, but right now I’d like to have other things in my space.  \n\nSo, WIBTA if I stored my late grandmother’s jewelry box and put other sentimental items in its place?

      "description": "Hi everyone. I'm using a throw away account for obvious reasons and am typing this on mobile so please forgive any spelling errors, spellcheck has it out for me. \n\nI recently left a long term relationship and am out on the dating scene again. I've been using dating apps and online dating sites since I find I usually have better luck talking to people also interested in dating. Like everyone else, I put what is important to me in my bio. One of my few deal breakers is kids, I dont want any and I dont want to date someone who had them or wants them. There are many reasons for this, but it really boils down to incompatibility. Wanting children vs not puts us on very different paths in life. I hold to this rule no matter what, if a guy has a kid in his bio I pass, if i find out he has them/wants them after talking I walk away. I'm in my mid twenties and am looking for a guy around my age which means some guys will already have kids so I keep this in my bio to preemptively weed them out.\n\nThis doesn't stop guys from lying or matching with me just to complain about how I am selfish, rude, too dumb to know what I want, am missing out on the greatest joy in life, etc. I can deal with internet trolls and usually just brush it off. \n\nRecently, however, a friend of mine set me up with a single friend of hers from college. He seemed nice and I trusted her judgement that he was great and we shared lots of mutual interests. We went on a first date and things were really great. He was funny and sweet and liked the same sports teams. I was really interested in him and had a great time.\n\nOn our second date I decided to test the waters and asked \"where do you see yourself in 5 years?\" Which is my go to question for probing their interest in a family. Most people who see families in their future bring it up when talking about the future. His response was fine, he wanted a promotion, to move to a new city and settle down. I was a bit disappointed that he wanted a family but didnt react since I didnt want to ruin the date. We kept talking about our city and why he wanted to leave and he said to be further from his ex. Turns out he has a young son from a previous relationship and was having trouble co parenting so he wanted to move away. Super big deal breaker for me. His attitude at that point was terrible, really just venting about his parenting woes, and he could tell I wasnt interested anymore. The date wrapped up and we went our separate ways. He asked about a third date and I told him I didnt know what my schedule was like. I wanted to let him down easier the next day than right after I found out.\n\nLater that night he started texting me asking what he did wrong. I was honest and told him that kids were a deal breaker for me which is when he went off. I got a whole string of abusive texts about how I was bigoted and didnt know how hard it was being a single parent. That I am a bitch for not dating single dads and that no one would want me if i wouldn't give them children or raise their existing kids. I usually dont let this kind of thing affect me but this particular bad date hurts worse since he actually got to know me and before he had a kid he seemed like a great guy.\n\nI got a text from him today apologizing and talking about how he was just frustrated since he gets turned down a lot. He wants me to give him another chance and claims that his kid won't have any impact on our dating which I dont believe to be true. \n\nSo am I really the asshole for refusing to date an otherwise good guy because he has a kid?

      "description": "Lemme give you a short backstory; My brother found a cat and our parents let us keep her. Well, she was pregnant when we found her and gave birth to 4 healthy kittens. Our parents wouldn't let us keep all of them but we begged, they gave in but made us compromise that we can only keep two. one for me and one for my brother while the mom will be the 'family cat'. We agreed and picked our own. My cat and i bonded well, he would come to me when I call his name but if someone else called his name, he wouldn't go to them. there has been countless nights where he would sleep beside me and never get in my way. Sometimes i would open the window (my bedroom's on 2nd story) and he would be there waiting to get in so he can sleep with me.  \nWhen I went to college, my parents would always tell em how he always look for me atleast once or twice a week.   \nAfter I graduated, he was too old to relocate so I thought it was best for him to stay there because he sent his entire life there and he was starting to get old as well.\nI always visit home for the holidays and he would greet me.   \nThis year has been his bad year, the old age had finally got to him to the point he's limping, blind in one eye, and peeing in the kitchen. It was his time to be put to sleep soon and I agreed and made plans to be there for him when they put him to sleep. \nMy mom just texted me and informed me that they want to put my cat to sleep before i get there because he started to pee in the kitchen almost regularly.  \nI tried to reason with her (just two more weeks) but she wouldn't listen so I blew up at her about how unfair it was because she didn't keep her promise of waiting for me to get there and how thoughtless she was.  \nI just thought back of last Christmas when he already had arthritis and he still limped upstairs just so he could sleep with me, the thought of it already made me teared up because he went through al of that just to be by my side and I couldn't be by his for his last moment.  \nI know my parents is getting the brunt of caring for him and having to clean up his mess but I just wanted to be there.\n\nSorry for a long post so reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "A few months ago, my friend bought this video game that he apparently LOVED. In the weeks leading up to my birthday, he said that he loved the game so much that he was planning to buy a copy of the game for me so he'll have sometime to play with. \n\nI was open to it, but I know my friend--he's the king of empty birthday promises. We don't exchange gifts regularly; I've gotten him Christmas gifts sporadically over the years and he's gotten me...well, nothing, really. I'm not a very materialistic person, anyway--I'd rather just hang out with my friends than have them buy me things.\n\nMy birthday came and went. No game. Honestly, I had forgotten about it until we were all celebrating HIS birthday at his place months later and he finally produced the game he promised me.\n\nTurns out, he had bought a game that had been released in Japan but had not yet been released in the US. THIS is when he offered to buy a copy for me. But instead, when the game released in the US, he bought himself a localized version of the same game.\n\nMy gift was his used Japanese version of the game. \n\nI cannot read or speak Japanese and he knows this. He recommended using Google Translate to play. I hate to seem ungrateful. But in my opinion, this isn't a gift. This is recycling. He didn't buy this FOR me like he previously said. He gave me something he no longer wanted because he bought himself a version more relevant to him.\n\nNeedless to say, I never played it. To me, having to translate a game while I play it sounds tedious. I'm a pretty busy person as it is, so I barely have time to play the games I DO enjoy. I'm not upset. He's still one of my closest friends. But recently, he asked me if I ever played his game. I tried to lie and say that I had, but it was pretty clear that I hadn't. I think that upset him a little bit.\n\nAm I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "At the start of February, my fathers mother, who we will call Joan, was 80 years old. She was horribly sick and My father forced me to go to her house to see her on the bed while she was on oxygen with my brother.\n\nThrough out my 16 (17 in 6 days) years of living on this planet, I’ve never met this women since the first thing I can remember. So I was just so weirded out going over there. I said hi blah blah, and apparently the only time she was in my life was when i was born and that’s that. \n\nJoan basically left my father to raise me and my brother by himself and my mother. So i never grew any attachment to Joan.\n\nIn the end, it was inevitable, on February 14th, Valentine’s Day Joan passed away. I was spending time with my girlfriend, rushing to buy her gifts cause I couldn’t go to the bank to get money out of my account since Sunday. My father called me to come home because of her death, and I told him i can’t as I’m riding my bike to rush to get all the gifts for my girlfriend, but that I’ll be back in 15 minutes. So instead of running to Walgreens, Walmart, dollar store, and 7-11, I go to Walgreens and 7-11 so i can get home faster. So i didn’t get all the gifts i wanted to get my girlfriend but i still wanted to help my dad as I know it’ll be harder on him than me.\n\nA couple days later he tells me about the funeral, and how it’ll be on February 23. Now I told him that i didn’t want to go and that I couldn’t either way because of a test Monday, but he said I’m forced to go. He then says that I want to see him suffer because I don’t want to see my grandmother, the woman that i never knew in my life. Now my brother, who’s in college for Nursing, has a test as well, and he had a work on the day of the funeral, but he had enough time to call off. He uses his excuses that he usually says, saying he has school and work and all that, which what he really does is play games.\n\nSo I’m supposedly “lying” about my work because I want to see my dad suffer and I don’t care about family. \n\nThe funny part is my dad, who uses Facebook for his political views and rants, talked shit about me on Facebook, saying how much of an asshole son i am, and how much I am a disgusting disappointment I am. Now this isn’t the first time he posted something on Facebook where he talks shit about someone, as i might post to r/JUSTNOFAMILY of the story where my dad decides to call my aunt a “libtard” for kicking him out of her house on my cousins birthday for calling my cousins friends the N-word.\n\nSo In the end I’m forced to go.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI can’t study for test, forced to go to funeral, dad talks shit about me on Facebook, and I’m probably going to fail a test.",

Just shaking people and getting in people's personal space constantly) in every situation with everyone and people make sure to tell him to stop but he never does. Hes generally a okay person but along with the constant loudness, breaking of personal space boundaries, and being too \"extra\"(overreacts to everything) i decided to kindly tell him that he couldnt go with me and my friends to the movies after he asked by explaining that it would be awkward because we all dont really talk to him that much after highschool ended (1 year ago). He then said okay and uploaded a 3 minute story about the whole situation on snapchat and tagged me and my friend. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'm at university and I have a friend group of about 15 people in a large iMessage chat. In light of finals, one of them, let's call him Mike, suggested we go to a Mexican restaurant on Saturday night to cool off. Saturday morning, he puts in the chat, \"like this message if you're coming to dinner\". I like the message around noon when I woke up and realized around 2 that I couldn't go with the amount of studying I have to do (I also just felt shitty and was taking a mental health day). I remove my like from the message, which my roommate sees as a notification (i.e. \"Engispoon unliked the message \"...\"\"). She also decides not to go and also unlikes the message. \n\n5 minutes before everyone is leaving, someone asks where everyone is, to which my roommate replies \"Engispoon and I aren't coming, don't wait up\". A few of them get very mad, going off about how inconsiderate it is, considering that Mike made reservations for a group of 10. However, this is the first we've heard about reservations having been made, as we have a tendency of rolling up with a large group and not really caring if we have to wait. I reach out and try apologizing directly to Mike, explaining that I thought the notification was enough and I wasn't previously aware reservations were made, but am given the cold shoulder and he is still very upset, openly admitting to being extremely hostile.\n\nMy roommate offered up dinner plans for tonight and is met with no response (very unusual) except Mike who says \"sure\" then \"actually, no\" a minute later. It's clear everyone is still divided and they are not trying to forgive us.\n\nAITA or are they just being immature at this point? There was obviously a communication error on both ends and I tried apologizing but it hasn't seemed to work.\n\nTL;DR: We made dinner plans which included reservations which I didn't know about. Thought a notification for cancelling was enough but the organizer is still mad. ",

      "description": "Okay, first time ever making a post so I apologize in advance for any errors. \n\nBasically, my close friend had financial difficulties and opened commissions to help her get by. I'm also struggling with money but I had a bit saved, so I asked for a slot and paid up front. It was only about £15 when converted, which was do-able for me, and good value for the work she does. \n\nI paid for this in April of last year, and she still hasn't done it. \n\nThe asshole part comes in when I tried to chase her up about it, because she reopened commissions again without ever finishing mine. I messaged to ask if she was going to finish mine, and she said she lost a lot of files in a computer error, and that university had basically taken control of her life. She says she still has the reference pictures on her laptop, so I have no idea if it did get lost in the error or if she never started it. \n\nShe seemed upset and annoyed in these messages. \n\nI said I understood, quickly reminded her what I wanted, and implied I wanted it finished before changing the subject because I hate confrontation. This was in November. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to remind her again to finish my commission? I'm not usually the type to care but her re-opening commissions whilst mine has been abandoned for nearly a year has pissed me off a little. ",

      "description": "Long time lurker, first time poster so the formatting may be all over the place. \n\nContext: I'm 22 and recently moved out of home. This is the first year I've expressed interest to my family that I may not be joining them on Christmas. They initially planned on celebrating across the country so I made my peace that I would be spending it alone. Plans changed and they are celebrating it 3 hours south of where I live and work (I will only have 25th and 26th off work, which isn't a huge problem just long hours driving to back home).\n\nUp until recently I had planned to surprise my family and join them on Christmas Day, as a sort of present for my mum. However recently I was verbally abused and almost got into a fight with my Step-Dad (will call him SD), and now I don't feel comfortable going. \n\nSD was in a pickle one night, had way too much to drink and needed help getting home, of course I offered to Uber to where SD was and drive him and his truck home as he didnt want to leave it there overnight (thousands of $ worth of building materials on the truck bed). Our agreement was clear over the phone, and until I arrived I was under the impression he was ready to leave. 3 more rounds later (none of which I joined in) I was hearing the same abuse I've copped from SD for 5 years, along with little niggle punches and hair pulls. I know how to cope with this stuff because of how often it happened when I lived at home, but we were at a bar with his mates who could hear the whole thing. I kept suggesting that we leave as I had other plans that night but he was relentless and kept chewing my ear off. \n\nAlmost 2 hours had passed when I finally snapped, he'd just introduced me to someone he knew there and was yanking my hair up and out of reaction I went to jab him back (my big mistake). SD's a good fighter and knows where to punch when he needs to, apparently I punched him in the solar plexus and instantly I copped one back in the same spot. He then flipped his shit at me and told me to \"F*** off\" to which I did and left him to figure it out himself (pretty sure he just drove home...)\n\nSince then, he has told me that I will have to be the one to resolve what happened that night, I disrespected him and that if I didn't, I would not be welcome at Christmas. \n\nI've been talking to my mum about it, and shes telling me that I will be ruining Christmas if I don't come, and trying to guilt me by telling me that it may be my grandmas last one (she has Alzheimer disease).\n\nAITA for not wanting to come to Christmas because of him?",

      "description": "This girl and I have been best friends since 7th grade. Went to different colleges, but managed the distance via gaming, voice chats, and occasional visits. She was someone I could see myself being lifelong friends with, until recently. \nHer husband and I got off to a terrible start. She moved in with him early on and one day, I was in her area with some relatives. While we were trying to decide where to meet up, this guy who I hadn't even met snatches the phone from her and demands of me \"Just get your ass over here\". I got mad and told them both how disrespectful I thought that was. We wound up meeting at a restaurant without him, and he apparently liked to read all of her texts, so my opinions were no secret. \nOver the next few years, he and I have tried to get along for her sake. But he's never dropped the whole \"she hates me\" dialogue, and always blamed my opinion of him on that first impression, despite the fact that he's left a bad taste in my mouth the entire time I've known him. Cursing her out in front of our friends, making her cry the day before her wedding over some shoes, not taking her mental illness seriously, and yelling at her for feeling like she might not want to live are just a few examples. Granted, his more extreme outbursts happened when he was under considerable amounts of stress. I still don't condone his actions. He thrives off of shock value, to the point where his sense of humor is just excessively vulgar. He also enjoys ranting, yelling, and sometimes mansplaining things he knows little to nothing about. That being said, I know that I'm very blunt, and there have definitely been times where I could have done a better job of ignoring him and biting my tongue. I tried bringing up my concerns with her before she got married, but she had made up her mind, and I respected her decision.\nDuring the wedding festivities, her family and college friends spent a considerable amount of time trash talking my religion. I said nothing, because I know people are unlikely to change their views on things that they feel warrant so much hate. I'm Christian and she's pagan, but her and I have always been respectful of each other's beliefs. \nI love my friend and have nothing against her. But neither my husband nor I can stand to spend time with her husband, who is now a permanent part of the package. The other people in her life are also very different from me, which wouldn't be an issue if they weren't so aggressive about pointing it out. \nShe invited me to her birthday party later this month, and I really don't want to go. I'm considering just allowing our friendship to fade with time and distance, instead of trying to sustain it.",

Most of the commentators accused me of being my misogynistic sexist even though I have never said anything that degraded the female sex in a way. I honestly would call someone a bitch and a whore and any other profanities to vent out my frustrations regardless of gender. Some users understood what I was going through and offered some advice but most of them have a hive-mind notion of sexist \"incel\" in the making. The moderators decided to lock the thread and gave me a warning for \"using misogynistic language to describe someone who doesn't enjoy your harassment\". First of all, I wasn't even harassing her, I offered my condolences to her in the past for my part of offending her by giving her something nice. And it happened only once. And if this is considered \"harassment\" to them, I don't even want to know what they would consider \"respect\". \n\nThe rant in question: https://old.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ajll9f/this_putana/",

      "description": "My girlfriend hates saying sorry, she believes she does everything for a reason. There is always the “sorry” you throw around but not when she does something wrong. Today as a joke she grabbed my phone to get my attention and be funny, fine. We do the whole chasing my phone thing for 5 minutes and then I ignore it and just try to cuddle with her but she is still in “hiding phone as a joke” mode. She never knows when to stop, I’m trying to hug her and she keeps pushing away thinking I’m going for my phone and this goes on for 15 minutes. She just won’t take the hint, I even blatantly say I don’t want the phone just hug me but she goes out of her way to hide my phone.\n\nShe isn’t the “smartest” person I know so I ask her for my phone back because I am worried where she put it( she is very clumsy and she could leave it in a place it could break” \n\nShe refuses to let up, and now I’m just worried where it is. She realizes it’s not a joke anymore and shows me she hid it under my shoes that I slide on, somewhere I could literally step on it...\n\nShe gets up and says she feels “weird” which she always does and instead of saying sorry she just gets up and leaves. \n\nAm I wrong for being upset? Or am I overreacting? She does this all the time and never sincerely apologizes. I really didn’t care for my phone, I don’t hide from her and she even has my password and all. I have left my phone at her place tons of times unlocked so it’s not a hiding something from her and she knows.\nIt’s just frustrating when she doesn’t know when enough is enough.\n\nTLDR: AITA for being upset when my gf hid my phone irresponsibly as a “joke”?",

      "description": "My girlfriend of 2 years has put an ultimatum to me today after dropping major hints this year that she wants a baby; “Get me pregnant or I’m leaving you”.\n\nFor context my girlfriend was pregnant last year, but WE decided that we weren’t ready so had an abortion. I was with her for every step of the way but she now uses this against me “I had an abortion for you”.\n\nFinancially we are in a hole, she wrote off her car at the beginning of this year and pressurised me into buying a new car because she “didn’t feel safe” driving my old one, which in her defence had broken down on me once before. This left me in a £10K debt.\n\nShe is desperately unhappy in her current role but refuses to even try to find a new job, let alone one that provides maternity cover. Honestly I think she lacks the confidence to find a new job because she feels her criminal record (which is now spent so she doesn’t have to mention it) is holding her back.\n\nWhen she was 18 she was groomed into smuggling drugs from Jamaica back to the UK *for context\n\nAlso we have only been together 2 years which I feel isn’t THAT long to consider having a baby right now.\n\nWe are 29 and 28.\n\nHappy to answer any additional questions but I am mainly looking for some perspective, she says that I am dictating the decision on her having a child which makes me feel really guilty.",

We are a straight couple and this makes me second guess our whole sexual relationship. I feel bad for even thinking that he could be gay for doing this, because I know that having sex with a women is heterosexual, no matter who puts what where.  \n\nI feel like an asshole for being so turned off by this aspect of his sexual history. I’m sure it will pass. But I look at him differently now. Like he isn’t as manly as I thought he was.

Things started getting weird when he invited me to his place. \n\nBefore we got there he told me „my sister had a huge fight with her boyfriend and her and their kid will stay with me until everything is sorted out. Don‘t worry they’re not here right now, just don’t freak out over the baby stuff around the house.“. I thought okay, fine, it’s great that he’s helping them out. Doesn’t bother me in the slightest. We get there and after a while he takes out his phone and shows me picture of him with a little kid „So I don’t know when you usually talk about stuff like this. But this is my daughter.“. Y‘all he is a father and _lied_ about it until he couldn’t hide it. Like, was I never supposed to find out? How exactly did he think that would work out?! I didn’t know how to react, so I just acted like it was no big deal, until I had time to think about how to proceed. And I saw more red flags from that point forward.\nHe‘d say weird stuff („I‘ll be gone for 6 weeks“, „I‘m not actually [his profession]. I‘m still a student“) and then immediately say „I‘m just kidding, I wanted to see how you react.“ Like??Who does that and to whom is it benificial??\nEvery time we‘d meet to cook/bake at my place (I did most of the work. Ever single time.) he’d be clumsy and spill stuff everywhere and wouldn’t even offer to help me clean up. I always had to do it myself because I didn’t want to scrape dried up pasta sauce from my kitchen floor a day later. Now I am totally aware that I should have talked to him about all of this, but still, what the heck?!\n\nFinally, around a month ago, there was an instanced where I was sick and didn’t text him back for an hour („I don‘t care when you text me back, it’s so annoying when people get upset over that“). And he texts me something along the lines of „honesty is important, if you want to be friends just tell me.“. Just because I didn’t immediately text back while having a fever. We talked back and forth and at the end I told him I wasn’t feeling comfortable, that I wasn’t the right one for him and wished him good luck in the future. Am I the asshole here? I know that I could have handled this better.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "If you read the title you might be thinking: “of course, you are cheating.” And while i agree with that, this is a bit more complicated.\n\nSo my friend is not dating this girl. They haven’t done anything together, they talk quite often but they say they are not in a relationship with each other. I have no idea if they have kissed or anything(i dont think so, but there is a chance). And they haven’t done more than that (if they have done it).  My friend tells me sometimes about her, but he says that he doesn’t want a relationship EVERYTIME. \n\nSo last friday night he asked if someone wanted to hang out. I said i wanted to but all the other people in the chat said they didn’t want to or didn’t have time. So we were together, and this girl was coming too. We decided to meet up at a supermarket and drink something or whatever. \n\nFast forward an hour or so, we have talked a bit and were sitting in a playground. We had a bottle of Bacardi Razz and 0,8 grams of weed. We drank something and smoked the spliff (weed with tobacco). We talked more and decided to go to a lake, drank some more (already tipsy and stoned). In the end we finished the entire botlle with three people, i had drank the most even though i never drink and never have been drunk. Might be important. \n\nFast forward even more, (here comes the ‘bad’ part for me) after we chilled at my friends house me and the girl left. Talked some more and then went to out own house. This has been quite some time, we met up at 2230 and now it was 300. We had to split up on a road, but we went to a little park and then talked some more. In the end i asked for a goodnight kiss, this was mostly meant ironically, but she had no problem so we kissed each other on the cheek and hugged for a bit. \n\nThe next morning i got a message from my friend who heard it from the girl and wasnt really happy with it. I kind  of denied it but he said i shouldnt do it. It sounded like he really didn’t like it. So i am kind of stressed if this is going to be bad for our friendship and if i am really wrong so be fair.\n\nA short explanation or tl;dr:\n-friend is close friends with a girl but doesnt have/want a relationship (yet). \n- we were pretty drunk, my first time drinking a lot.\n- kissed the girl when we cycled to our homes, not very intimate.\n- the girl is very nice and looks very good, but i am not really interested in having a relationship. \n- the friend isn’t very happy, for understandable but also weird reasons. \n\nPlease be fair, i really want to know if i am wrong or if my friend should just say he doesn’t want me to be intimate with this girl and be more clear.

      "description": "Mobile - sorry for formatting\n\nThis happened like a year ago. So I used to do highland dancing with my brother. I'd compete, do shows, etc. But after 2-3 years of dancing I started to hate it. My dance teacher didn't like me, I had no friends at the studio, and my younger brother was actually better than me, so I felt like a failure. Anyways, I had told my parents and my dance teacher that I was not going to compete anymore. I said I will keep dancing to stay active and do some little shows for fun. I emphasized this a lot. Only for fun, and only small shows. I still wasn't liking it though. I had awful balance, was darker-skinned and shorter than all the others and I overall just didn't fit in. So one day my mom is telling me about this show my brother and the other girls are doing at some boating club or something. I felt like the tone was weird, and I was right. She told me a girl had gotten sick with the stomach flu and they wanted a replacement. I said no, I told you I wanted to stop and it was stressing me out. She said she TOLD THE TEACHER I WOULD ANYWAYS. WITHOUT ASKING ME. I burst into tears, freaked the fuck out, and basically had an anxiety attack. she told me this the literal night before by the way. I didn't even know the dances and routines, like AT ALL. I go in for extra classes that night and the next day and get a shaky grasp of the routine. I go to the show, sweating, hyperventilating, etc. We do the dances and stuff pretty well. I think me and another girl both made a few mistakes. The dance teacher singled me out after and got upset at only me. I was sad and felt unappreciated. I go home that night, cry, fall asleep. The next day I post a pic of my dance shoes on my instagram story with the caption \"ur supposed to ask the backup dancers before u make them backup dance lol\". I know I fucked up. I know it was awful and mean and I was a terrible person. I didn't mean for anyone to see it, I was just sad and upset and felt betrayed. So the next week my fam and I go out for a nice dinner. My brother then says, AT THE DINNER TABLE that my dance teacher told him that she hated me. SHE TOLD MY BROTHER AND NOT ME, IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE DANCE CLASS. She had somehow seen the story, but she didn't have insta, so somebody showed it to her. I knew they didn't like me but I didn't think they'd do that. I almost cried at the dinner table, and when we got home I went upstairs and cried. I was scared and angry and sorry for what I did, so I right away delete it, email my dance teacher and the girl I filled for that I was really sorry, I didn't want to offend them, and that it was kinda a jab at my mom. I never went back to dance. The girl seems to have forgiven me, and she is honestly the sweetest person. i think she was the only one who didn't hate me there. I then basically hid from my dance teacher for a few months, never going to pick up my brother, never going to his shows or comps. My mom forced me to come see her at the studio christmas party. I bought her some cookies from Scotland in a cute highland dancer-patterned tin. She seemed to have forgiven me, kind of. I've seen her a few times since. \nmy question is, did I do something wrong? Everyone is siding with her, but i was literally forced into something I didn't want nor know how to do, then berated when i fucked it up. What the fuck?",

      "description": "Long post but please hear me out :(\n\nI have a chronic disease that often causes lots of pain. Yesterday was my girlfriend's birthday, and the past couple of days have been pretty bad to put it lightly. The day prior I took her out to eat, took her shopping, and then took her to her favorite little park that has a waterfall. I was trying my best to keep it together, but pain like this is going to show no matter what. I apparently frustrated her because I complained quite a few times about how much pain I was in and with the pace I had to walk (part of the pain right now is in my leg and I have to limp around so I walk pretty slowly). That night I went to bed pretty early as my disease causes me fatigue (and we did quite a bit that day) and that is the only way for me to escape the pain besides drowning myself in painkillers and the like.\n\nThe morning of her birthday I slept in again for the same reason, and I know this upset her very much. I didn't wake up until around noon, which meant half of her birthday was already over :(. When I woke up I gave her her gifts (everything she told me she wanted: a new ring, shoes, some makeup and a bouquet of flowers). After that, it took me quite a while to get ready and we didn't end up leaving the apartment until around 2:30 to head to her family's house (when she originally told me she wanted to leave around noon). At her family's house I didn't really talk much and didn't participate in all of the things they were doing because of my pain. \n\nAfter all of this we had to head to her grandmother's house as she was leaving for a trip and she wanted us to take care of her dog and watch over the house. While packing my stuff I admittedly snapped on her a little bit as I felt like I was reaching my limit and was having to carry around a couple of pretty heavy things which increased my pain even more. \n\nThis morning she told me that I \"ruined\" her 21st birthday and she feels like I don't care about her. She texted me \"one day...my fucking birthday...that's all I wanted.\"\n\nNow in addition to the pain I feel fucking awful. It hurt so bad to hear that I \"ruined\" her 21st birthday and I kind of fell silent after that because I didn't know what to say which just made her more upset with me.\n\nSomeone please give me their opinion on what is going on here. AITA?",

      "description": "Some background first:\n\nI have a disabled kid in my class who I'm friends with, but not close friends with. He can walk somewhat fine, but he's on crutches for the rest of his life and moves very, very slowly. He used to have somebody come to school with him and help him and make sure he's fine, but she recently left during the summer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, now that the person that was helping him left, it's up to his classmates (aka just me and my other friend) to help him until they find a replacement. Basically, he just wants us to help him carry his books/food around and help him up and down stairs, which is perfectly fine by me even though he does move pretty slowly and it takes quite a while. Nobody bothers to help him except us two, and we'd feel too bad not helping him either, so because of this, his parents realised that they could just let us help him for the entire school year and further on without having to spend time finding someone else. Of course, this annoyed me, but it isn't the reason I'm bothered by helping him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER, I noticed that recently he's been walking a LOT slower, taking his time, sometimes even standing next to a wall doing nothing, while I'm already late to class. At first, I didn't say anything, but I started politely telling him that I was late and needed to get to class quickly. But my friend and I started to tell him that it was bothering us when he would stand doing nothing when we have things to do. Again, up until now, I was fine with helping him no matter what because I didn't wanna be rude and forget about him, even if he was standing still/walking a lot slower than normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here's the reason I'm suddenly annoyed by this whole thing. After my friend and I helping him this entire semester, being late to classes, etc.. We found out that he could do everything by himself completely fine, and he didn't need help this entire time. I don't know why he kept us helping him the entire semester, maybe it was because he didn't want to be lonely while moving around. I still occasionally help him if I don't risk being late, but he's mostly stopped asking for help now that we've found out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to help him?",

      "description": "This is my first time writing ever on reddit but it's been bothering me for ages so I thought I'd ask here. Anyway,  I am F24 and my SO is M23. We started dating in high school when I was 16, I knew he wasn't motivated by anything and I thought I would be okay with it (16 stupid and in love).  I go to school,  now working 2 jobs as a preschool teacher and tutor and he delivers pizza.  I never minded his work and never looked down on him for delivering pizza. We've been in our line of work for 3 years.  I have driving anxiety and don't have my license.  So he picks me up and takes me to both jobs.  I give him about $60 in gas a week and pay most of his car maintenance. Breaks,  tires,  battery,  axle alignment,  tickets, you name it.  I felt it was right as he would drive me places, and I knew he couldn't pay for it on his own.  I work 45-50 hours a week,  he works 8-16. I've offered to help find him a better job because I know he has a great work ethic and a charming personality but he shrugs it off and says he's been trying.  It's been months with only working a max of 16 hours a week. I thought at first he was depressed and lacked motivation so I took him on dates, learned to play his games,  try his hobbies with him,  even offered to move him in with me (I live alone) as he said that his family stressed him out.  Mind you I knew he had no money and I supported us both anyway.  He said no because his TV is too big for my room and he wouldn't have any place to play online as I don't have wifi at my house. (I work 12 hours a day and come home and sleep so I never needed it + I have hotspot). I'd pay for all his meals everyday for years and anything else he needed.  Then I began to feel like I spoiled him too much and said I'd only pay for gas and maintenance to his car which was still hundreds of dollars. That led to arguments about how I don't appreciate him and his efforts and its my fault about the car and that he never asked me to buy his food and take him on dates.  He also said I don't understand the struggle of looking for work as all my jobs and achievements were given to me based on my personality. \nAt this point we started arguing so much more and I fell out of love. That was months ago.  I care about him deeply and don't know how my life would be without him.  I talked to him about how felt and that I believe he has so much potential but feel like I'm enabling him. I admit there were certainly times that I was frustrated and have been condescending.   If I left him his paycheck would be enough for his lifestyle.  I feel like we're both wasting our time but he insists he couldn't love anyone else and I'm all he has ever known. I don't know if I should give him another chance even though I'm not in love but hope it comes back or just cut it and hope he finds his way on his own. He's been my best friend and my biggest supporter and felt like I owe it to him to stay until he gets on his feet. Would I be the asshole for breaking our 8 year relationship over him not wanting to find a better job or go to school? AITA for getting frustrated? ",

      "description": "My best bud had been dating this girl for a little under a year. After the first time his gf cheated, he was devastated. He was crying a shit ton. She, who felt really bad, begged for him to give her another shot. He did and within a month she cheated again. This time he fully broke up with her. She felt super bad and begged again. He had more resilience this time, but was on the verge to giving in (they would be hooking up occasionally and still talking, but not officially back together). While she was still trying to win him back, she slept with another dude. Now, my best bud finally got some sense and cut her out completely and blocked her on everything. So what does she do? She comes to me, knowing I’m the best friend and I’m the only way she can get to him.\n\nNow I gotta give a little background. Her family is kinda messed up. Her mom went through a divorce, started dating another guy, and after living with this new dude for a few years, cheated on her boyfriend and the boyfriend found out and kicked her and her daughter (my buddy’s ex) out. The mom didn’t have a job, so now her and her mother live in a crap apartment in a bad part of town and are struggling significantly. They don’t have a steady income, and now the ex works full time on top of college to help pay for living expenses.\n\nNow back to when she texted me. She said how she’s depressed and has no motive to do anything at all, she can’t find reason to get out of bed in the morning, all that Jazz. Now I don’t know if she’s actually suicidal but her friends (some of her friends are people I’m friends with) say that she has been seeing someone for her mental health and are fairly confident she is suicidal. Upon knowing this information, and receiving a text from her to help her out, I respond back to her something along the lines of she deserves to be miserable, and if she doesn’t clean up her act soon she’s going to be in the exact same place as her mother because of what she does.\n\nTyping it out now, I kinda feel like the asshole. But then I remember what she put my buddy through and how she literally had plenty of opportunities and ruined them all. AITA?\n\nSorry if this is poorly written, I did it kinda fast.",

      "description": "Background:\n\nI'm still very young 14. My brother and I are still Christian as it is what we grew up believing (I feel we have become atheists since we dont go to church and my father who is also Christian we only visit once every 2 weeks) since my mom met her boyfriend she has converted to Muslim for him (this does not bother me). My mom is also vegan. My mother also does not cook we have a helper who cooks for us ( not Muslim)\n\n\nMain:\n\nI fight with my mother over what we buy when we go shopping. We cant buy bacon anymore even though it will only be for me and my brother (she is not hardcore Islamic we still eat pork when we are at restaurants with her). We dont buy normal meat at the shop anymore we have to drive to a Muslim butcher and buy meat there (dont really care ) . This has become a problem as when I visited my father the food my stepmom cooks taste different. I think it's the difference of the meat as most of what she uses like pork and mixed sausages (my favorite) are not halaal. When I told my mother why cant we just buy meat at the normal shop just for me and my brother she says the halaal meat won't taste different but she doesn't even know as she has been vegan for 3 years now. It also irritates the living hell out of me whenever I ask for something and her first response is 'is it halaal', I understand it may not be halaal but it would just be for me or my brother. She says her boyfriend might find it rude but she never even asked him and I dont see why her new believe requires me to give up bacon.\n\nExample:\n\n2 weeks ago I asked if we can get frozen pizza it's not halaal I told her she then she says no. I asked her why not it would just be for me and my brother she says no louder and gives me a glance (the glance said a lot) I felt like if I asked her agian I would get my ass whooped in front of all the other shoppers.\n\nI'm I an asshole for thinking this way? Or should I just learn to live with this? \n\nIt won't kill me if I have to give up eating pork but it won't kill her either to allow me and my brother to still enjoy it\n\nI love my mother and respect her choice I just need to know if I'm an asshole for feeling like I'm entitled to get what I want\n\n(My first post)\n",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom\n\nSo on the spring of 2016 I found out that my college girlfriend got pregnant. She wanted to have an abortion but as a christian I felt that this was against my beliefs (btw I’m not pro-life, I feel like the option to abort should be there for people that don’t believe what I do but this is what I thought was right for my child). I was graduating that year and already had a pretty well-paying job lined up so I felt that I could provide for my kid. In the end me and my girlfriend came to the agreement that the baby be born but that I would be a single parent since she did not want to have a baby this young. That fall the baby was born and after that she moved back to her home state (she went out of state for college) and I got my son. At the time me and my girlfriend were 21.\n\nFast forward two years and I just feel so tired and secluded from the world. My only friend is my son, between work and him I have no free time. All I do on my free time is go to the park with him, watch kids shows etc. My mom live kinda far away but she visits every few months and lets me have some alone time but it’s not enough. Also I basically have the same job I had when I graduated college with a slight salary increase, I have not been able to take any initiatives at work to qualify me for a promotion due to my parent responsibilities and a lot of people that started after me outrank me now. And I can’t date, like who wants a 23 year old guy with a kid.\n\nI just feel unfulfilled and alone and it has started to take it’s form in a little bit of animosity against my son and I never want that to happen. I want to be a great dad that loves his kid but I don’t think I can be that, I’ve tried for two years. You always hear about this undying love you’ll have for your kid but I just never had that.\n\nSo WIBTA for putting my son up for adoption? I would have to make sure he actually get’s adopted into a stable family like I grew up in and not into a foster home  (don’t know how I would go about that though). The thing that makes me think that I am an asshole is that he has started to form an attachment to me and that it would be unfair on him to leave him and unfair on his grandmother that also has a good connection with him. But what makes me think I’m not an asshole is that I think that his childhood would just get worse the more lonely and unfulfilled I feel and that he’s better off with a more stable family. Please give me your perspective.\n\nTLDR: I am a single dad that feels like he’s personal life is interfering with his ability to be a father, WIBTA to put up my two year old for adoption?",

      "description": "I've never considered myself high maintenance, but I may have to change that. Today, I had plans with my boyfriend to get lunch and go swimming. I didn't plan on going with him in the first place, but when I mentioned it last night, he wanted to go too. Well, today, he laid in bed until he had work at 3pm. \n\nI spent the night at his place and at noon, I told him I was leaving for lunch soon if he still wanted to come. 30 min later, he hadn't moved and I was leaving. He told me to text him when I was ready to go swimming because he still wanted to do that. Well, I finished lunch and texted him that I was ready to go at around one. After getting no response, I told him I was leaving and he could meet me there. \n\nHalfway there, I got a call from him saying that he was gonna stay home because he was worried about being late for work in two hours. (Context: from his house to the pool is about a 15-20 minute walk and he works 5 min away from his house). So I went by myself. \n\nHe asked if we could get dinner after he got off of work, but then at 7, informed me that he had to go to a meeting and asked me if I could wait. I told him I was hungry so if he wanted me to wait, he had to text me with a DEFINITE ending time for the meeting. (Our dining hall stops letting people in at 8:40pm.) At 8 I went to dinner by myself. No text or anything at all until he called me at 9:30 saying he was getting food from my favorite restaurant and offered to bring me some even though I already ate. \n\nObviously, I accepted, figuring this was his way of apologizing, so I met him at his place and we ate at 10. Well, he talked to me for a few minutes and then went to go play overwatch with his friends. He asked if it was ok first since I usually play with him too, but I didn't have my laptop. Of course I said it was ok, but he played for 2 and a half hours. He is a loud talker, but when he has headphones in he fucking yells so loud. At one point I managed to fall asleep despite the noise and he literally woke me up, said nothing, and went straight back to playing his game.\n\nEventually I told him I was gonna leave because we have class tomorrow, but he made me wait for his match to finish. Then took the longest goodbye. It wasn't sweet long, it was just him staring at me and standing in front of me so I couldn't leave.\n\nI wouldn't be upset if he'd just said he was busy or at the very least stopped making plans that he would inevitably cancel last minute. I'm getting more and more frustrated and I've mentioned it and he'll apologize, but nothing will change.\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend blew me off all day for some reasonable and some unreasonable things and I wanna know if I should be upset.",

      "description": "So, I dated a guy for a while and he happened to be a musician. While we were together, he made roughly 25 songs, all of which are on my iPod.\n\nFast forward about a year, and I was showing one of my playlist to someone I've been seeing for \\~2 months, non exclusively. One of my ex's songs came up and she thought it was a really good song, so she asked me who it was by. I told her the name, and thought that was that. A few days later, she texted me asking why I still listened to my ex's band and why I didn't tell her it was his band. Apparently she looked the band up so she could download their music herself, and saw his photos with the band and put two and two together (I don't delete photos off of my instagram, even after relationships have ended, so I assume that's how she knows what he looks like). Anyway, I told her I didn't think it was a big deal, and she said that it was obvious I wasn't over him and that maybe it was best we don't see each other anymore unless I'm willing to delete the songs. I told her that I really like his music and I don't see the need to clear out songs that I enjoy, no matter who they were written/performed by. \n\nIs this weird? My ex and I are still friendly, but we rarely talk, and it's been a year since we broke up. I'm over him, and that I didn't think anything of keeping his music on my iPod, since I genuinely enjoy his music (&amp; I'm friends with everyone in his band anyway, and I like to support my friends). I did delete two songs right after we broke up, because they were about me and our relationship, but I didn't see a necessity to delete the ones that had nothing to do with me. Anyway, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA For suggesting my mother return her cat?",
      "description": "I (21F) live with my parents (51M and 48F) and recently we have acquired another cat. \n\nWe had one cat originally, his name is Titan and he is 10 years old. He is basically my cat as he sleeps with me/ spends all his time with me. \n\nOnto the cat in question, my mother visted a shelter one day and absolutely fell in love with this giant ragdoll. The shelter had only had her for 5 days so they didnt know anything about her behavior or disposition. For reasons that will later become obvious her current name is Lucifur she has been here for 2 weeks so far I think.\n\nWhen Mom brought her home she immediately let her out of the cage to just roam.\n\nThis cat is beautiful and completely friendly to all people, not my cat. She hates him with a firey passion. Every time he enters the room she either pounces on him or starts this loud whining that lasts minutes. When she sees him, no one can touch her anymore or she hisses at you. My mother is still in love with this cat. \n\nI get it, shes really friendly and cute. If she wasnt trying to hurt my tiny old cat I would have no issues with her being here. But that is not the case.\n\nShe has bitten me because I picked her up while she was trying to get to Titan. Its an incredibly deep bite that required intense antibiotics and a tetanus shot. Thankfully shed had her rabies shot prior.\n\nToday I took Titan to the vet to check up on some medication hes taking for allergies. He has lost almost a lb since his last visit and become dehydrated because he is terrified to leave my room. I have to feed him in my room or hell starve, even then he hardly eats because hes staring at the door like hes worried shes going to burst in and attack him. \n\nHere is the AITA part. I was incredibly upset by the fact Titans health has begun to suffer because of her so I texted the family Via group chat and said \n\n\"Titan has lost more weight and is dehydrated because hes too scared to move around the house. \n\nEither introduce them properly by locking her into a room and using the method or we return her to the shelter \"\n\nMy mother got really defensive saying its not her fault and that she wanted the cat in her room but no one ever put her in there. \n\nThis would be fine except she adopted Luci and then left at 6 am the next day for 4 days for work. My father didnt even want another animal so he would not have been ok keeping the cat in his room if my mom wasnt there. So we did nothing. \n\nI think we should return her because no one seems to even try to introduce them correctly. I got bit because my mother decided to feed them together and I tried to save my cat from being beaten.\n\nTL;DR My mom brought a new cat into the house and it is terrorizing my cat. He has lost weight and become dehydrated because of this so I told her to either train her properly or return her to the shelter.\n\nAITA because I told her we should return the cat? ",

      "description": "I apologize in advance if this is choppy, I just found out and I'm still reeling and I guess venting a little bit here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy best friend, who we'll call Hannah, and I have been friends for almost 10 years. We're both women and are in our mid-twenties. I've been on family vacations, her parents call me their second daughter and I call her parents 'mama' and 'papa'. We've both agreed that we're each others person and best friend, and until today I didn't think anything had changed. \n\nI am in the process of getting my estate put together and wanted to make her a beneficiary, so I opened messenger to ask for the best address for her (she's an officer in a military branch so she's not really permanently affixed anywhere) and I saw an unread message from her telling me she didn't tell anyone but that she got legally married over a month ago and they're just waiting for the right time to have a big party. I don't go on messenger often, and when she's on a ship she doesn't get cell service. I rarely use messenger but try to check it every couple of days in case she's messeged me. \n\nI'm so hurt by this. I'm trying to remind myself that this isn't about me and that I should be happy for her, but I'm not. She and her now legal partner (they don't identify with a gender) have been together for just over a year, they got married after dating for 14 months. Hannah has been known to become head over heels for everyone she's dated, and there have been at least three other serious relationships where she was convinced they were the one and were going to get married, etc. I don't understand the rush, but I would have supported her if she had told me what she was going to do and she knows that (I knew she was going to propose and helped her engineer it). \n\nWe're both very busy people (I own two businesses) and have the kind of friendship where we might not necessarily talk for weeks at a time but when we do it's like no time has passed. I don't tell her every minute detail of my life, but I couldn't imagine getting married and not telling her. It's making me question our friendship and I'm not sure if I should include her in my will (which I think is just an overreaction but it's how I feel right now in this moment). \n\nAITA for being upset about this?

She made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about \"sending it back\" if it was a boy.

She refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. Family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. \n\nNow that it's been nearly a month I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. It's just such an overreaction. I told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. She cried and called me an asshole. I told her she needs to get a grip.

      "title": "AITA for leaving my friend when she was dealing with depression?",
      "description": "My friend and I have known each other for about a year now, but we stopped talking a couple months ago. She's been suffering from depression and social anxiety for a while before I knew her. Whenever shit hit the fan, for whatever reason, I was her go-to guy when she needed to vent or needed help even though she had closer friends. I have no idea why she did this, but I didn't hate it. I was happy to help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of the time she'd be perfectly fine. Maybe 2-3 times a month she'd have a breakdown and every day besides those, she'd be fine. But it only got more and more frequent. Around 2 months into our friendship, her boyfriend of 3 years broke up with her, which would obviously hurt her for a while. From that point on, even when she was in a good mood, I could tell she just wasn't the same. The times she needed my help became very frequent, which is to be expected. She needed someone to cope with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple months after that, her now ex-boyfriend said he started dating someone else. This made her even worse because to her (and I assume many other people), finding a new date a couple months after a 3-year relationship is pretty fast. I still helped her when she needed it, but I didn't think I was doing anything special. Like, it may have helped, but any other one of her friends could say the stuff I was saying to her. Just imagine your most cliche therapist lines. This will be important later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a couple more months after this, she wouldn't be as hurt as she was before, but her mental disorders were clearly worse than they were when we first met. We would rarely do the stuff we used to do every day for fun. When I would try to talk to her normally, she didn't really seem into it, so most of our talking came from her breakdowns now. Plus, all together, we talked way less then we did even a month from this point. From what I saw, it seemed like she wanted help rather than just someone to vent to; however, most men seem to want to help rather than just listen, so I'm not so sure on that. I felt like I couldn't help much because I didn't know much of her situation between her and her ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I asked her one day if she could tell me the story between him and her. I told her she didn't have to tell me right away, whenever she felt ready. She'd been ignoring more for about a week (most of the time she'd at least talk to me and be unenthusiastic about it), but she didn't reply at all to that message. I expected her to at least reply with something like \"I can't right now but when I'm in the mood.\" or maybe \"I really don't feel comfortable talking about that\". Her not replying to that, a couple other messages before that, and just talking to me less and less, in general, made me think she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. Like I said before, I felt like any of her other friends could do what I did so I didn't think she needed me. I'm now getting 3rd party information that this wasn't her intent, but she's not all that worse without me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main reason I chose to stop talking to her is that we completely stopped doing the stuff we were doing originally, the stuff I became friends with her for. Every time I tried to give her advice she wouldn't seem to take it, and she'd fall back to me again and it turned into an endless loop. And since I thought anyone else could do the generic therapist gig I was doing, I felt like it wasn't worth it for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for leaving in this situation?",

      "title": "AITA: I’m angry because my sister keeps bringing up stuff I did as a child.",
      "description": "My sister and I have always been very close. She’s six years younger. As a child, I was introverted and had difficulty making friends, although I did have a few friends/cousins around. My sister, an extrovert, had friends also but she kind of looked up to us and would rather spend time with the older kids. This means she would always be around when we played (inside or outside), went on bicycle rides (we had to take turns carrying her around on the back seat, or just hung around. And we had to include her every time because she was my little sister.\nI guess this made me a little mean. We would make her the butt of jokes, make her run around to fetch the shuttle when we played badminton, make fun of or belittle her in front of anyone, and make her run to the corner store for snacks because I was too lazy. That is, I made her work for the “privilege” of spending time with us.\nOn the flip side of it, we were latchkey kids with my mum always working and dad always overseas for work. I had to take care of her, made sure she ate, entertained her while we were by ourselves, made sure she did her homework, shielded her from any family/parental problems, and taught her how to keep the parents in a good mood. I would not be lying when I say I played a part in raising her. Even as we grew older and I started working, I would support her emotionally and even financially.\nI’m in my thirties now, and we’re still very close. A few days ago, out of the blue, my sister says she still hates me, and I quote, for “bullying” her when we were kids. She has brought this up before, and I had apologized profusely for my behavior when we were younger. She had accepted my apology then. But she brought it up again this time. I apologized again and told her that I was a child myself with psychological issues that flared strong later. But she said she had been hurt for the longest time. I had made her feel like an outsider, took advantage, and manipulated her because she was younger. She was not going to forget or forgive.\nThis broke my heart. I understand that stuff that occurs during childhood stays with you for the longest time. I know that I had hurt her and that had a profound effect on her childhood.\nHowever. Somehow my guilt has turned to anger. I feel as if everything else I did as a sister is forgotten because of this one aspect of our relationship. I don’t deny her feelings, but I’m just so angry and pissed off that she would choose to hold on to this.\n",

      "description": "Okay first off, this is a throw away. Second of all, I know this sounds childish as hell but hear me out.\n\nI recently had a major jaw surgery which has lead to me having my mouth wired shut so everything heals correctly, and I can't open my mouth at all. The day I was discharged, the nurse gave me a pack of straws that are just like normal straws, but have a very narrow bit at the end which slots through the tiny gap behind my wisdom teeth so I can slurp up my soups and smoothies and stuff.\n\nSo today I woke up around 5pm after finally getting some sleep with the help of some painkillers, grabbed some soup and went to take a straw and it was gone. The last straw in the pack was gone and I instantly start worrying because there's literally nothing else I can use to eat until my next appointment. I asked around the house and my step-brother says it was him and that he didn't think I would mind. \n\nI tried asking him what the fuck was he thinking, I was only given enough straws to last until my next appointment and he just starts laughing, mocking the way I talk because I can't open my mouth, all I can do is move my lips, my teeth stay clamped shut. My dad hears all of this and comes in, tells me I'm overreacting, that my appointment is on 2 days and my step-brother doesn't know any better. He's literally 2 years older than me and acts like a 6 year old, it's so frustrating.\n\nJust some things I want to add, the packet that the straws were in were clearly labelled with mine and the hospitals name, and they clearly don't look like normal straws. My step-mum tried using a syringe, soup went everywhere.\n\nI will say that the shitty liquid diet, lack of sleep and the terrible discomfort of this whole experience may have added to my frustration, but this incident honestly frustrated me so much that all I wanted to do was cry. I can't even stop by the dental hospital because it's not open on the weekends.\n\nI've been thinking about it for a while now and I feel a little guilty and embarrassed about making a big fuss about a straw, but at the same time I don't care because without it, I can't eat. I'm torn.\n\nAm I an overreacting asshole?",

      "description": "Hello, I will try my best to be as objective as possible with this, but of course this is coming from my pov, which is where this community could help me. First, I will try to give some backstory to fill in some information. I(26m) have been dating my (20f) girlfriend for around 4 months now, but we have known each other for just under a year. We have had our fair share of complications in these past 4 months, mainly dealing with trauma from both of our pasts but we we're always able to come to a conclusion and move forward. This bonding and the progress we made through conquering our own demons has brought us very close and I would like to clarify that I am not worried about her leaving me for the ex in question. This person is someone who emotionally and probably physically abused my gf (I was told that it came very close to being physical but I have not heard all of the details so this part is unclear. Was also told he would beat his mother...). My gf's mother told me in private that their family was very worried about my gf's safety and they thought they were going to lose her to this person. The entire family seems to feel the same way towards this ex.\n\nThis Monday my gf and some friends went on a vacation and on the first night got quite drunk/high. The whole night we were texting/calling. All of our conversations were very lovey dovey (lol) and very light hearted. On Tuesday she told me that she texted her ex because she wanted to check in on him, which I told her that I didn't think that this was a good idea because 1) why feel the need to text and ex and 2) a person who has caused so much harm to herself and her family. After some back and forth she told me she would tell him they can't talk anymore and \"fix things.\" Last night we talked on the phone and she told me they were texting all day and she told him they can't talk but he said no and that she can't just end things with someone who was such a large part of her life. I basically said that this is driving a wedge in our relationship and will cause things to fall a part, which she agreed. Not much else was said except that we would discuss things further tonight but it seems like things have come to an end.\n\nAfter speaking with some women in my life the census seems to be that I have not done anything wrong but I want your outside opinions. I feel, for lack of better words, that these decisions she is making are plain stupid and causing unnecessary collateral damage. Am I not being understanding of her past trauma? Am I not being rational and instead acting as a jealous bf? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My wife has very evidently had a bad day, and she doesn’t hide it well. Our daughter (8) watches a few TV shows (Spirit and Pokémon, mostly), and is so in love with both of the shows that she talks about them regukarly. (Before anyone gets upset, she also reads a ton, TON of books (she’s recently gotten into Harry Potter) and plays outside with her cousins every day. We regulate her screen time.)\n\nAnyway, my wife today claims that whenever our daughter speaks, she’s talking about her shows, and it’s driving my wife absolutely bonkers. Yesterday, my daughter started talking about Spirit, and my wife interrupted her to say, “Stop, can you PLEASE talk about something else? Every time you open your mouth lately you’re just talking about one of your shows.” It made me very upset with my wife to stifle our daughter this way, but my daughter shrugged it off and went about her merry business.\n\nFast forward to about half an hour ago when my wife and I were talking about why she’s felt so irritable lately. She expressed some recent motherly frustrations, relatively common stuff, then mentioned the TV stuff again (how our daughter never talks about anything other than her shows). I reminded her how rude she’d been the night before, and how she’s actively showing disinterest in our daughter’s interests. My thought it, yeah, they’re dumb TV shows, but so what? She’s a kid, and that’s what she’s into right now.\n\nMy wife said she doesn’t care about Pokémon, she doesn’t know them, she doesn’t get it, etc. I told her that’s not the point, that she *could* care by asking our daughter about it, etc, and my wife replied with, “You just don’t get it, never mind, ugh.” I (as I often do) didn’t drop it right away and reminded my wife that she doesn’t get to choose what our daughter remembers from her childhood. At that, my wife pulled a deep sigh (restraining herself from fighting), got up, muttered, “Fuck you,” under her breath, and went upstairs (slamming the office door when she got there).\n\nI can tell my wife had a bad day today, so I probably shouldn’t have pushed. That said, it’s also not okay with me that she actively expresses disinterest in the things our daughter is interested in. AITA for this exchange?",

      "description": "Longtime lurker here, never posted tho! So yeah, I met this girl Sarah close to 2 years ago now, at the end of my last semester at uni and we really hit it off. We started dating after casually going out for a bit, and we ended up dating all the way up until early November 2018, when I found out that she had some sort of FWB type bullshit with a guy we knew at uni, and I broke it off, cold turkey and basically told her to go fuck herself. It still hurts like shit, since this was a fairly long term thing, age considered, and she didn't seem that guilty to me.\n\nWe do however have mutual friends so we see each other sometimes, and I kept her on my social media stuff, which is how I found out she was flirting with some new guy, Tommy. Tommy's actually a nice enough dude, and since I can't say I trust Sarah one bit, I messaged him telling him about the cheating and all the bullshit she did. He didn't believe me, but we met last month at a party, in which I pulled him aside, and told him all about her, and by the end of it, he seemed pretty turned off on her, and he cut it off a few days later.\n\nDespite this, and the fact that things seemed somewhat serious between Tommy and Sarah, she had a new guy just last weekend, at another party. This guy was pretty decent, and when I caught Sarah looking my way with a shitty expression, I just lost it, and told this new guy all about her. They got into an argument, him saying something about diseases and storming off. The room was divided, some were on my side, some were obviously pissed at me and Sarah was FURIOUS. \n\nShe basically went on a huge rant about how I'm a jealous asshole who can't let things go, and all this shit about me being controlling and possessive, so I just kind of left in the middle of her lecture. She's DM'd me on a bunch of apps, basically berating me/asking me why I did that, to which I've not really responded outside of a \"K\", or a thumbs up. A couple of her friends have said similar shit, and called me sexist and all that bullshit. \n\nSo, is she right? Am I a possessive asshole, or was I in the right?",

      "description": "Neurodegenerative diseases are nearly impossible to cure,especially if patient and their relatives are economically in medium or lower class.\n\nFor example,one dose of SPINRAZA-medicine for SMA patients- contains literally 7-8 drop of cure,and it costs estimatedly 140.000$.\n\nI live in Turkey and for me it means a drop of this costs 100.000 lira.There are 3000 patients estimated in Turkey and if I collected right information,a patient needs 4-5 dose and after that only 3 times a year for all his/her life.\n\nCompleting the estimated math and adding it to 3000 people,because all patients deserve curing,it estimatedly adds up to 20 BILLION liras without remainders.\n\nTurkey spent 25 billion-again,without remainders- to medicine.ALL the medicine in whole country.\n\nThis is just basic numbers for JUST treating SMA patients.I didn’t even calculate their respiratory and alike machines,accomodation,application of medicine and such.\n\nIn my defense it might be more or less expensive,but it won’t go up or down for 10 billion or something.\n\nThese kind of disease can be spotted in amniosynthesis(or amniocentesis) or different scans of genome.I know it can harm,even kill the baby,and i know i can’t understand what that means but if you spend not even 20 billion on uprading tech for genome scanning it definetely WOULD make difference.\n\nI am not a cruel person.I always thought abortion saves both parents and children.I spent 2 years with joy and sadness with cerebral palsy patients and I befriended a lot.I lost 2 friends in this 2 year and i know what they live and how they live.I even had a friend that said “I wish I was aborted.My mom and dad had genetic predispositions and they never thought about it.” He died 3 years ago.\n\nIn conclusion,by spending on research and development and planning parenthood i believe there would be much difference.Therefore,i dont want their curing.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(Dam panel beaters are expensive) \n\nNow throughout our relationship my girlfriend suffered through depression and I would carry the weight of that on my shoulders both financially and mentally. During our relationship there was a period where she got really unhealthy, this caused many fights between us, as she would lie about going to work. Eventually she lost her job and I would have to cover her rent and living expenses for 2-3 months.\n\nAnd now that this has happened they want me to pay 700 in damages to the car.

      "description": "So a bit of background, I am one of four daughters and I hold position #3. I'm just gonna name my sisters by their order (#1, #2 &amp; #4) \n\nWhen we were little, our parents got divorced which then sort of triggered my mothers mental illness of bipolar due to her unresolved childhood trauma. This got her to pull away from me and my sisters so we had to learn to take care of ourselves. We were aged between 12- 4. #1 &amp;#2 did most of the washing and dishes and stuff were as I took care of food and taking care of #4. Out mother did still cook and clean and take care of us but I dont believe as much as she needed to.\n\nEventually she started getting aggressive towards #1 and would slap her across the face when she was very angry at us all. If one of us was in the wrong she would yell at us whilst we were cornered in our room (the four of us switched and shared 2 bedrooms).\n\nFast forward a couple years #1 gets pregnant at 18. At this point we have been forced to move houses a lot and we were all in high levels of stress. In a fit of rage my mother ended up kicking #1 out of home. My mother kept telling us that it was #1s choice to leave.\n\nThings escalated from there and #1 and her daughter no longer speak to our mother dude to fear. #2 is angry at #1 and says that she has abandoned us. #2 &amp; #4 currently have no contact with #1\nBy this time I was 15 and I had grown to be a tall a physically strong female. This is when my mother started taking out her anger on me instead.\n\nFast forward again, I am 18 and my mother would hit me on a weekly basis. I've had to step between her and #4 many times. She would insult me and my sisters constantly and when we got upset she told us we were over reacting. I would not be allowed to go out and see my friends as much as I liked or go and relax in my bedroom and my mother would get upset saying that \"we are just like #1 and will abandon her\" \n\nOctober 2018, she didnt speak to me for two days because I went to a friends for three days because I was exhausted. Then I decided that I couldnt handle this anymore and said to her that I want to move out soon. \n\nShe started yelling at me saying she hates me and that I am a horrible child who wants her to kill herself and that she want me out of the house that night. Accompanied by lots of other not so great things. \n\nSo I leave that night with a couple bags of my clothes and I'm now staying with a friend. \n\nI know my mother is sick and she doesnt mean what she says sometimes and I have now left her with #2 and #4. She wont hurt them because they are small but am I the asshole for leaving my mother when she is sick? And leaving my sisters to deal with my mother?",

About three months ago everything became too much and I took an overdose. One of my roommates found me and I was really out of it but still conscious - I had thrown up quite a bit. They called an ambulance, and we waited. \n\nI don't remember much but I recently found out that they rang some people for advice &amp; they were told i was being inconsiderate as one of them had an assignment due tomorrow and they were still working on it. She told me that while waiting for the ambulance I was complaining about being in pain while she tried to work on the project &amp; it bothered her. \n\nWhat really bothers me is that when the ambulance came, neither of my roommates came to the hospital with me so I was left alone on a hospital gurney for hours with no one. \n\nAt the time I didn't think about it much, but i'm feeling really low again at the moment and my anxiety keeps bringing my mind back to this and I just kinda feel like shit about it all. I know i shouldn't expect them to drop everything for me &amp; it's not about that. I just feel really hurt and like i was (and am) nothing but an inconvenience. This isn't a pity party attempt - i want an honest opinion to try and figure out of I have a right to be upset or if it's my anxiety/depression making me feel like this. thanks.\n\nSo, Am I the Asshole for being pissed and upset at them?",

We decided to upgrade into a larger apartment at the place they were already at. (upgraded to 1.5 baths and only $100 more from what they were paying) \n\nWe move in and everything is great for the first month. Until they start leaving piles of dishes in the sink, cat food (wet smelly tuna) on the kitchen table and never cleaning them, and using \"my\" bathroom (they have their own bathroom with a huge mirror in their master bedroom and they agreed to give me the other one) and leaving a huge mess of towels everywhere and leaving makeup all over the sink, and toilet. They also started a huge argument over my dog. My dog is male and male dogs tend to be dominant over the female dogs they’re with. When we take them outside he will pee on her pee (dominant male dog thing). So they neglect their dog and leave her out of the cage when one of them is home and she will have accidents all over the house, and in their room. The bedrooms are small so I would let my dog out to have room to move around the house, but when she has accidents he will “mark his territory”. They argued with me and told me I either need to lock my dog in my room or get rid of him. I didn’t want to cause a big argument so for the past 3 months he stays in my room when I go to work. They still continue to neglect their dog and when I leave for work I see piles of poop in their room as I pass by or wet spots on the floor. There’s been times when they don’t clean up after the dog. Once I came home from work, changed and was barefoot and walked to the kitchen. I stepped in a wet spot and I asked my male roomate why the floor was wet. He was playing video games and without looking over says “oh I saw her squat in that area an hour ago” and says nothing and doesn’t even try to clean it up. The entire apartment except my room smells of dog poop and pee, cat food or dirty dishes. AITA for wanting to leave? ",

It honestly feels surreal even now. I was bullied for my looks and speech so I never thought I could have a girlfriend. Having someone I like besides me when we go to the theatre or on a walk is the best thing ever.\n\nI tried to be the best boyfriend possible. But I couldn't help but shout at her yesterday. She has this thing where she tells me to keep on saying the words I had trouble pronouncing, and then proceeds to laugh till she cries. I told her I didn't like this, but seeing her get joy sorta made me feel happy in a weird way too, so I went on with the 'joke'.\n\nSince we had dated for about 2 months, she was gracious enough to invite me to a family dinner yesterday. She had a joint family, so about 17-18 people of various backgrounds, shapes and sizes. It was a really daunting task for me since I have terrible social anxiety but I thought I did a great job introducing myself.\nIt was great till 2 full hours. Then my GF told me to narrate a story of how I asked her out. And I kinda pronounced suck as shuck.\nShe then laughed and said that was the sole reason she brought the topic up. Made me tell the word again, and her whole family laughed. I told her to change the topic, but she then told me to keep on with the words, and made me say about a dozen words so that everyone could laugh.\nHer uncle's kept asking me different words too. I felt horrible and told her I wanted to go ASAP. But she took her time...when we got out to part ways, I instantly shouted at her saying she shouldn't treat me like that when she knows I hate it. She told me to calm down and discuss it without overreacting.\nI apologized and said I couldn't do that and went home.\n\nShe isn't picking up my calls or anything now, I don't know.\n\nWas I too much of an asshole?",

      "description": "So i started a new job back in October. Business casual office environment. \n\nThe lady who sits across from my desk is a very nice lady who gets a long with everyone. She is a very religious person, this will come into play. \n\nSince i started I noticed everyday she calls the same person for about 45 min. I started hearing the conversation more and more. \n\nIt turns out she has been calling “Jesus” on the phone directly. She believes she is talking to THE Jesus. I’m not a believer myself but I assumed most religious people wouldn’t have Jesus’s number on speed dial. \n\nFor the last few months he’s been asking money from her for purposes of getting into heaven and to help the needy. If you take away from the obvious fact this man is not Jesus and is taking advantage of this nice lady, it is a noble cause to give money to I guess?\n\nI haven’t said anything yet to her, but I would really like to tell her she is being scammed from a man claiming to be Jesus and taking advantage of her beliefs. Would I be the asshole?",

      "description": "**Context: I've had two best friends since grade 4. I was lucky enough to get a really sweet gig when I was 21. Since then I helped get my two best friends hired in the same department right before I was promoted to the Team Lead. This is where things started to go downhill.**\n\nWhen we were all under the same leader, there was a lot of camaraderie and mutual disdain for management. I was given a great opportunity to lead the department and I took it very seriously. This meant I had to start reprimanding my two best friends for shit I would've laughed about before. I could see one of my friends, who I shall rename as Mike for privacy reasons, was starting to not like this new arrangement.\n\nWe hired a fourth guy into our department, who was around our age, and everything *seemed* to moving in positive direction from my point of view. Shit hit the fan when I noticed that Mike and the new guy were just standing around and talking about BS for over an hour leading right up to our scheduled 15min break. I pulled them aside saying you guys should NOT spend that much time not working right before getting a break. It looks bad and hurts our productivity (our work has strict due dates). Mike flipped OUT on me saying it's bullshit that now all of a sudden I care when before my promotion I would spend a lot of my time Redditing instead of working. I pulled him aside, calmed him down, and agreed that we both should try to focus more on work during work hours.\n\nI think that's when things snapped for Mike. I learned much later that he was routinely going into MY bosses and complaining about my work ethic and abusing my power. I gave the guys their annual performance reviews, which I felt was fair, but Mike and the new guy decided to band against me and said that my reviews were not representative to their actual performance and that I am trying to sabotage potential raises.\n\nI learned this during MY performance review. I was devastated that my best friend was ACTIVELY trying to fuck me over in my position. That killed me. I approached him after, asking why didn't he just come up to me with these complaints instead of going over my head. He denied ever doing it and said he think I'm doing great.\n\nAfter only a year in this new position, I heard of another opening in a neighboring department. I LEAPT to this opportunity as I have never been this unhappy and worried about my future in a company before. I got the promotion and bailed. Mike became the new team lead.\n\nI haven't spoke to Mike, non-professionally, in over a year. I've heard he has been going through tough times, but I can't get over how he fucked me over in this position.\n\nLast week his dad died. I saw his FB status claiming how miserable he and how he has no one to go to for comfort. I have chosen to ignore these.\n\nAm I the asshole for abandoning a long friendship over work related drama?\n\n**Tldr; Became the team lead over my longtime best friend. He started to not like having me as his lead and spent months talking shit to my bosses about my performance and leadership abilities. Once I learned this, I bailed on the department and the friendship and haven't looked back even though he has been struggling lately.**",

      "description": "I had a few days off from work bacause I was starting at a new job. The last weeks / days of my old Job were very stressful for me. We had a lot of work to finish and on top of that, one of my colleagues was on holidays (colleague A) and the other one was on sick leave (colleague B). Therefore, despite my plans to leave work earlier, I stayed the whole day and not just half a day on my last day. It was not that much of a problem, because I was really looking forward to my days off. However, I didn't have the time to write a long e-mail containing information about the status of the project, e.g. which parts of the projects had already been completed and which parts we had to continue working on. Therefore, I told my colleagues that I will be calling them on my first free day so that we have the time to talk about all the open topics. We talked about them and I got two more calls from my colleagues on different topics that we haven't talked about. I did not see that as a problem because - as I said - I did not write down the final state of the project as detailed as I wanted and offered them to talk about important work related topics if they have any questions. For more context: Colleague A will be leaving the company, too. Therefore, another colleague - Colleague C - will be taking over his role in our company and will be joining my \"old\" team. At this point I also need to point out, that I have a very good relationship with my colleagues. We often meet each other after work and do a lot of activities together. This also applies to colleague C, and this is where everything begins. \n\nOn my first day off, I received a message from Colleague C, which included \"gossip\" from the office. I replied with a very short text message, whereupon I received the answer \"you're welcome. I just wanted to inform you. Now enjoy your days off, you've already had a lot of stress,\" to which I replied: \"Thank you. That's nice. I will\". But it didn't stop there. I had four days off and every day I received more messages with office related topics. I didn't even answer the last messages. On one hand I think it is nice that he wanted to inform me about all the new information from the office, on the other hand I really wanted to enjoy my days off without messages or calls with work related information that are not important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, on my last free day we plannes an acitvity with some of my colleagues (including colleague C) on which he had the chance to inform me about these topics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, would I be the asshole if I told him in a more direct way to please stop sending me unimportant work-related messages on my days off, or should I just leave it at that because my vacation is already over?",

      "description": "This happened this last weekend and I have been told I need to apologize for the situation, but I honestly don't want to and need some perspective. \n\nMy grandparents told me how they were leaving most of their assets to my uncle and my female cousins and then proceeded to ask me for how I felt about it. For once, instead of lying and saying that was a great plan, I respectfully and calmly told them how I felt. Upon me giving my actually opinion when asked, I was lambasted by my uncle and my parents who told me it was inappropriate for me to voice dissent for the decision that was made. Instead of making a scene or arguing I simply left. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that I have been doing nearly everything for my grandparents for the last seven years including their asset and wealth management. I never got paid a single cent, never received a single gift, or as much as a single thank you, meanwhile my cousin sisters got their college tuitions paid off, vacations, and extravangent gifts year after year. Furthermore I am the only one out the four grandchildren that even visits them more then once a year (I used to meet with them weekly). This is not to say I deserve anything by helping my grandparents but I find it ridiculous that I should have to say I am happy that all portfolio work I have been doing will be given away to people that have not helped in the slightest. \n\n Given the circumstances of this conversation with my grandparents I notified them that I would no longer be managing any of their assets and would find someone suitable that would be able to manage everything for them at a fee. This has turned everyone in my family against me, with everyone calling me greedy and selfish for not fulfilling my \"familial responsibility\". I think I did the right thing by walking away from this situation, but at the same time I feel terrible for doing so simply due to my grandparents decision on how they wanted to will their assets. AITA? ",

      "description": "The background: I'm in college, most of my friends are in dorms, but me and my roommate live in a flat. Therefore, we have much more space to hang out and occasionally there is a movie night or something at our place. \n\nThis girl is a friend of my best (female, but not that important) friend since high school. One time she came to my place to hang out like everybody else does and I really liked her. After that I asked my friend if I could get her number, but she told me that I may want to take it a bit slower because she always thinks things go awkward when there are boys and girls liking each other in groups. She did not allow for me to get her number, she said she would rather get to know me better before.\n\nAfter that she still came a total of 2-3 times to my place to watch a movie or something and last time she told me directly that she had a nice time.\n\nThe semester is now over and there is a club near me that has an after-party for all the exams. We start by drinking at my place, she comes. She doesn't usually drink at all, this time she did. I drank a bit more, but people, including her, have seen me in a much worse condition. We go to the club, we dance, we have fun and since she keeps coming to my place (I never invite her directly, my friend handles the organization), one would think that she doesn't have a problem with me liking her. So I go on and try to dance with her and after that she stays near me without any signs of discomfort or anything. \n\nThat is all I did with an intention to do something with her, because, as I said earlier, she gets worried a lot and I'm aware of that. Later I offered her some drinks, maybe bumped into her semi-intentionally and so on.\n\nAfter we leave the club, I get a (maybe angry) text from my friend saying that I can't be that annoying and that's not how it's done.\n\nToday in the morning she explained to me that it wasn't so bad, but it may have been too much for girl that's a bit shy and that she had on a face showing some discomfort.\n\nSo I feel like a total asshole for doing that and even worse because if it was assholic I may have fucked it all up.\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nTL;DR: on a night out I tried doing something with a bit shy girl I like, it might have caused a lot discomfort to her, but what I did wasn't actually a lot",

If I ask her to be quite, she'll lash out and say I don't care and don't love her and want to end the relationship and just cry and scream.  \n\nThe most hurtful is when she said she could've kissed this guy and that if she had wanted to and talk about the people she saw that she used to make out with when she was single and had a clubbers lifestyle of going out every weekend. \n(I truly believe she hasn't kissed anyone or done other things while in our relationship) \nBut she says these things because she likes the idea that she can still be found attractive but not won't pursue anyone attempts at flirting, just likes attention.  \nWhen I tell her I don't want to hear about all these people and what she could have done but didn't, she flips the fuck out and cries and yells at me. \nWhen she sobers up or sleeps it off she's an entirely different person but when I know she might drink too much and get this way, I absolutely dread when she gets home. \n\nSo to deal with this I'm thinking of some ultimatums to tell her,  depending on advice. \n\nI'm thinking, \nTell her she drinks too much when she goes out,  she can sleep on the couch or I will and use the spare shower and bathroom until the morning. \n\nTell her I'm not going to be home and stay the night at a friends or my families home,  \n\nTo NOT drink any straight spirits (Tequila and Vodka) but she's an adult so it's up to her. \n\nOr the big one if it happens too much again, she clearly can't respect how I feel and what she puts me through and I'll end our relationship or give us the dreaded 'break' if she wants to go back to being a single pringle to mingle bingle. \n\nSo before posting I'll say, she's really enjoyable during pre-drinking and great to be around but she can go way too far. \nI've told her numerous times when she goes too far she's very horrible to me and she's apologized profusely as she knows she can get bad, I tell her this when she's sober.\n\nShe might get this bad once or twice a month, depending.",

      "description": "I [31F] recently connected with a guy on a dating app [30M]. I hadn't met him yet, but we'd had several conversations over the course of a few days and entertained the idea of getting coffee or drinks, the usual online dating icebreakers.\n\nHe was attractive in his pictures and he seemed upbeat and positive and fun. Now, one thing that came up at one point was that he was from the same hometown as me. Which was cool, although we didn't know each other, figured since we were the same age group we probably knew some of the same people. I'm actually still friendly with a lot of people I knew from high school.\n\nLater on in another one of our conversations, we kinda played a little \"hometown geography\" asking each other who we know from my high school. Well, I asked him. At first he seemed excited, throwing out a bunch of names, all of whom I knew except maybe one. My ex boyfriend was actually among them, hah. I mentioned that, didn't seem to faze him, it was just kind of a 'small world' scenario. Then I mentioned being close with a number of them still (just girls, not my ex). Then his tone changed a bit... well, first he mentioned that he wasn't really close with anyone from high school anymore because 'we've all gone our separate ways'.\n\nWhich is fine, but then he dropped this bombshell on me. Well, two of them... \"High school was kind of a dark time for me\" and \"I disliked a lot of people\". That kinda raised a red flag for me since it kinda shattered the upbeat and positive image I had of him, and not sure it would bode well with me still being in touch with a lot of friends from those days. Also felt like a bit of an overshare for someone I had yet to meet.\n\nStrangely enough, it seemed like he regretted it immediately and wanted to save face, and actually went on to mention he was happier at the other school and had some great friends and it was a better fit for him. He then changed the subject to our potential date which happened to be that night, asking if we were still on for tonight.\n\nStill, though, something didn't seem right. I told him I don't think it'll work out or that we'd get along well since I really enjoyed high school and was close with all my friends, and wished him luck.\n\nHe did not take it well. Well, at first he reiterated what he said about him being happier at the other school and that he was 'over it' and that he 'didn't understand why it mattered' and that that was 'a lot to infer from that one statement'. I felt that I didn't owe him an explanation and just said I don't think it's a good fit. Again, he did not take it well, called me 'superficial' and 'wished me luck' in a condescending manner followed by a short rant.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

I'm going to take both my kids there for a few weeks, but will unfortunately miss the wedding. One of them has school that starts a couple days before the ceremony.\n\nWhen my wife realized I was taking both kids she decided that she'd maybe take a trip to Europe at the same time with her parents, who have always wanted to go (though not to my country, if it matters). \n\nThey're super flexible on the dates for their trip, so I asked her if she wouldn't mind taking one kid back home with her to start school, allowing me to see the wedding with the other child and fly home the day after.\n\nMy wife said no. Her reasoning is that if she knows the kids are gone for a few weeks she wants to be free to make her own plans or possibly choose not to go at all. I didn't push her, because it's her prerogative, but I'm secretly annoyed. I'd like to think I'd have done the reverse for her. ",

      "description": "This happened many years ago when I was much younger. I have mixed feelings about it to this day.\n\nAn ExGF and I had a very tumultuous relationship for over 2 years while we were in college. It was bad enough at several points that my Mother asked my ExGF to stop talking to me. We were abusive toward each other because we each wanted to control the other. It was obviously unhealthy, but we were young and brave and “in love”. I think back on that relationship often and wish I could have done many things differently. Especially when I left her alone in the city after she came back for summer classes and wanted to get back together with me. \n\nWe managed to break up for a few months during the end of our junior year. It seemed like it was finally over. I took some time to heal, spent time reconnecting with friends that I lost, and my family. Eventually I met someone new and we began to talk. That summer, ExGF tried to come back into my life, and I allowed it more than I should have. We spoke, met up, and we did have sex again. At the time I was talking to another girl but not yet in a committed relationship. \n\nIt came to a point when ExGF started to push for us to get back together. I gave it a lot of thought and knew that it would be better for us to remain apart. She enrolled in summer classes so she could come back to the city and be close to me. At this point I told her that we needed to remain apart and that I was talking to another person and that I was interested in seeing where it goes. ExGF had a serious breakdown that was difficult for me to see and handle. I walked away from her and left her in her dorm alone. I haven’t spoken to her since but years after, my Mother revealed to me that ExGF confided in her and asked her for support through that difficult summer. \n\nI’ve felt terrible about it since. I haven’t heard from ExGF for the many years since and I’m certain we’ve both moved on from that period of our lives, but I want to know, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA For no longer wanting to drive my boyfriend to the airport?",
      "description": "Every Monday I wake up at 5 to drop him off to the airport for work. He works a week and then I pick him up on Friday evening. It ruins my whole sleep routine and ends up with me waking up at 1pm on Tuesday. I know he works hard and is stressed so I want to make it easier for him. So even though it was annoying, I was initially fine with it. \n\nThen last weekend I was invited to drink with other students in my class. I asked if he could drop me off and pick me up. He was willing to drop me off, but wanted me to take a bus home instead so that he could spend that alone time chilling, gaming and drinking. \n\nNow, I can usually do that with no issue, except that the location of the party was at a place where buses weren't so common and I would have to walk a distance. I had previously scratched up my knee so walking long distances hurt. Plus the buses stopped a distance from our house. \n\nWe eventually came to a compromise that he would drink very little and pick me up from the bus stop in our location so I wouldn't have to walk so far. \n\nI didn't think much of it and understood to an extent that he wanted to chill after such a stressful period. But on Sunday after we were both groaning about having to take up early, he jokingly said he was lucky I dropped him off. A part of me got really annoyed at that statement. I don't go out much and it annoyed me that when I finally did, he had already chosen to make his own plans for that time instead of picking me up. While he takes for granted that I drive him twice a week and it affects my sleep.\n\nAITA for wanting him to find his own arrangements now?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to tell my girlfriend that if we don't have more sex ill have to leave the relationship?",
      "description": "AITA for considering breaking up with my girlfriend over lack of sex? Been with this girl for a year, at first things were great. We were affectionate, both confessed our love for each other, had sex all the time. During this time though she would always say that she wasn't an affectionate person and that she had never been this affectionate with any previous partners. Ended up moving out of my flat to stay at her parents house while a flat she bought at auction was getting work done on it, and the plan is to move in there after. Still had sex often but not as much as when I lived alone (understandable living with parents) but we did still have sex. \n\nFast forward to now. No sex for 3 months. we argue every time I bring it up. She's told me she thinks its the contraceptive pill she's been on, but its the same one she's always taken and Ive researched this and its highly unlikely to be the case. Now she says she's just too tired all the time. but hasn't gone to the doctors (she says she has been too busy with work and the flat).  She is not affectionate anymore. When i've brought this up and said I don't feel loved anymore she's adamant that she loves me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter two months of no sex I suggested blow/hand jobs if she wasn't in the mood because I was just horny all the time. I was called selfish and the idea got thrown out pretty quick and more arguing ensued. I trust her fully and 100% don't think she's cheating, she has some of the best morales I've ever seen in a person which is one of the reasons I love her. If I knew it was due to a health issue/problem I would 100% stand by her and try get through it together. But having no explanation, and cant talk with her calmly about it without arguing because she gets so defensive is making me really unhappy in the relationship. There has been no intimacy in 3 months and its killing me, taken all the fun from the relationship, and its like she doesn't care anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo was thinking this weekend to meet up, go out and at the end of the night try it on. If i get the usual reply, give her a sort of ultimatum... something like \"I love you, but the lack of sex is ruining our relationship, I don't feel as close to you, I don't feel loved, and I don't feel like you care about whats going on. I don't know how long i can stick around feeling like this.\"  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you need more info can answer questions in the comments\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He held off till the first weekend after.\n\nI found out Saturday night that they were engaged.  Having heen previously married myself i was going to let them enjoy this time to themselves. I knew how chaotic the next few days would be with phone calls. The next day was my last day with my kids for a few days so i was primarily focused on them and packing for a last minute trip i was being sent on early the next morning.\n\nDay 1 of my business trip, not even in my hotel for 20 minutes, i get a text from my GF saying her dad had called her to ask why i hadnt texted her sister to say congratulations.  He said he was disappointed and surprised saying \"it was disappointing since you may want to be apart of the family.\"\n\nNow i will be the first to tell you, i suck at multi tasking, but im feeling like im being held to standards that im still learning.  I was raised with different values and am disappointed they would immediately go to \"disappointed\" instead of just asking why?  Oh you lost track cause youre busy?  Ok.  Instead it was like they felt snubbed.  \n\nAm i the asshole here because i wasnt johnny on the spot with the congrats text?",

Friends know my account and I'd rather not have my family's dirty laundry aired to our whole community. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, my parents are in their early 60s and have been married for 40 years. My mom has jokingly said years before that if my dad ever cheats on her, she doesn't want to know because they've been together for so long and she doesn't want to split up. She's said that if he does do anything, all she asks is that he never tells her to spare her the heartbreak. My dad would laugh and call my mom overdramatic. It was all very lighthearted/jokey and I never thought she meant it seriously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell to keep things short I found out that my dad was indeed having an affair in recent months. It's this woman from one of his hobbyist clubs and according to him they slept together twice and that's it. I sat on this information for a few days and ended up telling my mom. I just knew that if it were me, I'd want to know what my husband did. Well, she blew up...but not at HIM but at ME. She's mad at him too but seemingly far more mad at me. She said that it's on me that she's feeling like this and why couldn't I just respected her wishes when she's said it before to all of us. I couldn't believe what I was hearing and my siblings and I all think she's a bit delusional now. Well, except for my husband, who thinks I overstepped and was definitely TA. I don't agree but would like some thoughts here. AITA?",

      "description": "Just for some backstory, my girlfriend and I had been dating for about 7 months now. For 5 of those months, we had been working on a long distance situation, as both of us go to college about 3 hours apart. For both of us, the other was, essentially, the first serious relationship we had had.\n\nJust a few days ago, I received a call from my then-girlfriend saying that she wanted to confess to something she had done. Just a day after I had left, she had been catching up with a Male friend who she had been friends with for quite some time. While they were hanging, she started to get a bit emotional, hugged him while talking about how difficult the long distance situation is, and after one thing lead to another, she kissed him.\n\nAt first, I only wanted to know why. I asked her if it was consensual, and she said yes. I then asked if she had been wanting this, to which she reluctantly also agreed to. She then went on to say that she had been meaning to ask me for a break, but knew I wouldn't like that much and never asked. She truly did feel bad about what she did, and I respect her immensely for coming up about it.\n\nBut my only reaction was to say \"I'm sorry, but I'm through. Goodbye.\".\n\nI haven't contacted her since. The only reasonable approximation to contact I've had was to tell her mom that I wished the both of them the best, but that I didnt know how often I would be in contact with her from then on.\n\nMy girlfriend had been going through some rough times recently, and I had been doing everything I could to help her, so i knew what she did was not out of hate or spite. She simply got too emotional, and ended up releasing on someone whom I had known for quite a while. I know there was no ill will, but she still broke my trust in her and went with someone else behind my back, so AITA?",

      "description": "So I wanna start this off by saying I’m happily married,  love my husband more than anything in the world,  but unfortunately he suffers from mild sleep apnea.  I don’t blame him at all or fuss at him about it since it’s not something he can control and he does wear his cpap every night he comes to bed.\n\nLast night however his snoring was especially bad and I could not fall back to sleep once he came to bed,. To clarify he went to bed sometime around or maybe a little before 3 since when I checked my alarm it was around 3:30.\n\nNormally when this happens I nudge him to make him roll over and in the event that that fails I wake him up as gently as I can and ask him to roll over so I can get back to sleep.    It took maybe 15 minutes of this to actually get a response out of him which was just him lazily opening an eye to look at me before falling back asleep without moving and resuming his snoring.  I will admit this did make me a little upset and I shook him a bit harder than I normally do and told him in a stern voice  for him to roll over.\n\nNow this did wake him up, but he looked at me as if I had just cussed at him and in the moment I did feel pretty bad about it since he can be a pretty heavy sleeper at times.   I apologized immediately and got out of bed letting him go back to sleep.\n\nFast forward several hours later and he was dropping me off at work (we share a car) and he started telling me about this dream he had and asking me what I thought about it.   Meanwhile I had been awake and stewing for  several hours about how Wednesday is his day off meanwhile I work a double between our family’s store and another job downtown resulting in me telling him that I didn’t have the energy to talk right now.  (I will admit that there was a bit of an edge to my tone)\n\nWe were pretty much at work at that point and as he dropped me off he quipped that I had been acting like an asshole all night so he’d give me some space.\n\n\ndo you guys think he’s right?  I keep thinking that maybe I should’ve  handled it better but at the same time I’m just so dang tired and wasn’t in the mood to be bubbly and charming. ",

      "description": "Hi everyone!\n\nI go to the same place for breakfast every day and get an omelette.  It’s cafeteria style where you get your food then bring it to a cashier where they look at/ask what’s on your plate and ring you up accordingly. \n\n\nA few days ago there was a cashier I’ve never seen before. It’s pretty busy when I go and they try to whisk you through the line and take payment as quickly as possible. She looked at my plate, rang me up for “oatmeal” and took the card I was already handing out and charged me before I could even really say anything. A bowl of oatmeal is $2.50 instead of $6 so I just figured I’d take advantage of the small mistake in my favor, especially cuz I eat here every day.\n\nThe next day I ordered the same omelette, went up to line,and in between the person in front of me leaving and me getting all the way to the front she had already rang me up for “oatmeal” and was handing out her hand for my card. I have been in line when people have disputed the cashier before and nothing seems to unite strangers against you more than ruining the 5 seconds/person flow they usually have, so again, this time more afraid of the strangers then happy about a small thing going in my favor, I took the discount.\n\nNow for a third day she looked up at me, smiled, said “I got you! Welcome back” and pressed “oatmeal” and charged me the $2.50.\n\nAITA for taking advantage of this for 3 days? Should I say something tomorrow? Does she know what she’s doing and just likes me? Or does she really just think the oatmeal button says omelette? \n\nPeople order both pretty often so she Should have to be using both buttons.\n\n",

      "description": "So for context, a few years ago my aunt and uncle got a new car and offered to give their old car to my uncles son, who didn’t want it , then they offered it to my other cousins and they declined as well. Finally they offered it to me, and of course I said yes I could really use another car! So they give me the car within a month it needs a new transmission and various other things costing over 3 grand and over the years I put at least another 2 grand into so at least 5 grand total. I drove this car everyday and put lots of miles on it, and the same with my other car which I knew was on the verge of needing a very expensive repair, so I planned on selling them both and getting something decent with lower miles. My dad opens his big mouth and tells my uncle I’m planning on selling the car he gave me so without even consulting me my uncle decides apparently with my fathers approval is going to take the car back and give it to his son who didn’t want it the first time around... I love my uncle and he has been very good to me but this was really out of character for him to just decide this without discussing it with me... so I can’t really argue because I don’t want to cause family drama. His son flys out I pick him up from the airport take him to the dmv and send him away with the car. I get a call a few  days later asking me why all these problems with the car have not been fixed? This is when I got upset and told him you know what? I didn’t want to put any more money into this car I already put in over 5 grand because I was planning on selling it, and I reminded him I that I told him before they took the car back that I put lots of miles on it and it’s far from perfect condition... am I the asshole for getting upset with him after he had the audacity to question why I didn’t give him the car back in perfect condition after he didn’t even discuss it with me first? So now of course that major problem with my other car that I knew was going to happen happened and now I have. Nothing to drive because I can’t afford the repair, when if I could have followed through with my original plan I’d be driving something decent right now. The whole thing is it ruined my plans I did a patchwork repair on my other car because I knew I was going to sell it but since I ended up having to continue driving it it’s fucked, and had I known at the time I wouldn’t be able to sell the car my uncle gave me I would have had my other car repaired fully with a warranty when I had the money at the time...",

      "description": "Am I the asshole for asking my husband not to grab my boobs? He rarely initiates a kiss with me, or cuddles with me, or never cradles my head in his hands anymore, but usually goes straight for the boobs, fondling them and burying his head in my chest. He does this as soon as he gets home from work. He does this while I cook. I've asked him to stop repeatedly, that I don't like it, that it makes me uncomfortable. Especially when I feel he ignores my face just to bury his head in my boobs, like when he comes home from work without saying hi or kissing me hello. We've been married 5 years, but this behavior probably started within the last 2 years with increasing frequency.\n\nHe does this again tonight, tries squeezing them, and I start to shrink in on myself as I again ask him to stop. He asks why. I say it makes me uncomfortable. Again he asks why. I repeat my phrase. We do this about six times. He says that's not a good enough reason, and we're married, and I should stop being such a prude. My reason that it makes me uncomfortable is not enough, and I have to provide further justification as to why I don't wish to be grabbed at - justifications that I've provided in the past, but I've realized it's my body - I shouldn't have to provide a justification beyond \"it makes me uncomfortable,\" right? \n\nNow he's being all pissy (didn't talk to me for an hour) , asking semi-sarcastically \"is it okay if I touch you now?\" before kissing me goodnight (for once - I usually kiss him goodnight) and basically makes me feel like the bad guy.

It seems like the person is taking advantage of a cause close to the hearts of many to make a lot of money. To me, 20% of profits is way too low to be considered “fighting for a cause”.

      "description": "So every year, I throw this little party at my place, and I invite a bunch of different friends over. It's nothing special; we play some video games, have some food and drinks, and just catch up and relax. We all have such busy schedules, so the party's just an excuse to see everyone. In college, I met this one friend and decided to invite him. Despite being a little shy at first, he fit in really well with everyone and had a lot of fun!\n\nAs time went on, the two of us got closer and more comfortable around each other and he's been to these parties annually ever since I first invited him, so he's been getting more comfortable in this setting as well. I should also note he has this really awkward obsession with the game *Cards Against Humanity* (CAH), and is always trying to get as many people as possible to play, even if it's clear nobody else wants to play. Nothing evil; just awkward at times.\n\nLast year's party, however, he began crossing some boundaries. I'll keep it as short as I can--he comes to my house and wants everyone to play CAH. And I mean EVERYONE. He had about 10 people playing, but that wasn't enough; there were some people in the other room not playing, and some people not fully engaged. He was visibly angry at this, so he felt it appropriate to raise his voice at them and tell them they're being \"dicks\" for not playing. I get yelled at too because I would play for a few minutes, then leave to prepare food and talk to the other guests.\n\nI spoke with him about it, but he doesn't even remotely see the problems in his actions. He actually thinks he's the victim, saying, \"oh, well it's just that I spent all this money on these cards and I was just looking forward to everyone having fun playing!\"\n\nFor me, this is unacceptable behavior. Yelling at my friends, yelling at me, taking advantage of my hospitality so you can push your own agenda. Despite it being months away from when I typically throw the party, he's already talking about how excited he is to \"break out the new cards,\" and \"having everyone play.\" I mentioned that I don't think I'll be throwing a party this year. This is a lie. I do want to keep the tradition alive, but I don't want to throw a party if it'll be a repeat of last year. Another friend of mine mentioned I should tell him he can't come if he acts like that again, but I also don't feel right threatening him, \"hey, don't do that again or I'm not inviting you.\"\n\nHe's still my friend, but I genuinely do not want him at these parties anymore. It's enough stress and work as is, and the last thing I need is someone making me and all my friends uncomfortable for a selfish reason. Talking to him about it doesn't work, and I will not put up with him yelling at everyone again. Though not including him kills me on the inside, because he does have a lot of fun at these parties, and he never gets any other chances to play his CAH.\n\nTL;DR Dude was acting very rude at my house party, talking to him didn't work, and now I don't want to invite him to the next one. Am I an ass?",

      "description": "So I (19M) am at university. I have only had sex with one person before, who was my long time girlfriend. We broke up 1 year ago.\n\nI have never had a one night stand before, and I was afraid that it would make me feel depressed because of all the stories I've read about how post orgasm makes some guys feel worse. I have had issues with depression before, so I was weary about hookups.\n\nWell I really decided to try and get laid to see what it was like. After a few weeks of going out I finally got the chance to get laid with a girl I met on a night out. Anyway I bring her back to my place and we do the deed, and I manage to orgasm.\n\nAfter orgasming I feel a wave of depression hit me...and a wave of existential crisis. ''What the hell did I just do?'', ''Is this the meaning of existence....just to fuck? There's no meaning here'', ''This is all meaningless'' all rushed into my head...I didn't know what was happening, I felt like my existence was meaningless.\n\nI tell her to get out, she asks why, and I start screaming ''GET OUT!!!!! GET OUT OF HERE!!! LEAVE ME ALONE!!!'' ''AAAARARHHH!!!''. She packs the fuck up and leaves. I felt like I was having an existential crisis.\n\nAfter going to bed I wake up and felt a lot better...realized I might have over-reacted. Was it a normal reaction? Has anyone else done this before? **No, I did NOT take any drugs. I had a bit of alcohol, not enough to be wasted though.**",

      "description": "TL;DR at the end.\n\nGF and are currently renting out an apartment with my dog from my aunt. She's grad student and works part-time and I work full-time usually from home. The apartment is actually an extension of aunt's house but we have our own bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen. It's an excellent spot for each of us - a short drive to downtown as well as a short bike ride to campus and GF's place of work (GF doesn't drive so she bikes or takes the bus). My aunt’s been very generous and let's us rent out the place at a fraction of the cost that she regularly would. I also have a Great Dane. She is a bit smaller than the average Great Dane, but still big as dogs go and pretty energetic. She's very attached to me as Great Danes are, and enjoys our current living place - there is a large yard for her to run around.\n\n  \nMy aunt decided she wants the dog out and said that we get rid of the dog in 30 days we must leave or find another place. Aunt didn't mind the dog at first, but she's started to get annoyed with them since she doesn't like having it around the house. I've already decided I'm not giving up this dog. I've had her for 5 years and she's honestly helped me get through a lot of shit. Not to mention the dog is very attached to me and I'm afraid what will happen to her if I were to just leave her. I've been looking into other living arrangements, but rent would triple in price compared to what we pay now. It wouldn't be unlivable, but we definitely wouldn't be able to save as money as we have been, and we'll be on a tighter budget. GF cannot understand why I would give up this place, doesn't think it's worth it and pretty pissed at me. Apparently, her sister offered to take the dog in, but her sister lives on a ranch almost 3 hours away so it wouldn't be very convenient for us to visit. GF’s only option is to choose another place with me and splitting rent.  \n\n\nI tried to explain it won’t be like we'd be out on the street; we'd just have less money to do fun things and less in savings. I'd even drive her around to her work and classes whenever she needed. said I was wrong for choosing the dog over what's best for us, that we could really need the money we're saving now in the future and sending the dog to her sister's is the best deal. I maintained that the dog is important to me and I can't just get rid of it like that. She said I was an asshole for not taking her compromise.\n\nSo AITA for choosing to live with my dog over continuing to rent this very affordable and convenient location for my girlfriend?\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend and I are renting a very convenient and cheap place from my aunt. Aunt suddenly decides she wants my dog out but I'm unwilling to let the dog go so we'll have to move somewhere less convenient and much more expensive putting us on a tighter budget. GF says it's a terrible idea and thinks I'm an asshole for considering my dog over our future. AITA?",

We wanted to finish it over the weekend with another musician and I said I was in. \nThursday night, however, Joey said we were going out of town Friday and Saturday evening, two hours away. I told him I couldn't do it Saturday night because I was already attending a friends party (my car was in the shop so I would've had to ride with him). I asked if we can stay local and write so I can uber at night but write all day. He wouldn't cooperate so I decided to stay to attend my friends party.\n\nWhatever, right? We can finish the song later.\n\nJoey proceeds to stop messaging me. Leaving me on read when I'm trying to figure out why he was ignoring me in the first place.\n\nI guess he decided to bring my boyfriend into it, because later that day I get a message from my bf asking me why I \"bailed\" on Joey (they're good friends). I explain and show him the screenshots of the texts. He doesn't know why he is freaking out so much, either.\n\nAfter over a week of leaving me on read, Joey responds saying that he was mad at me because he \"absolutely hates getting bailed on by women\"...\n\nSeriously? He's 30. I didn't bail on you. We had no definite plans. And you were the one who wouldn't compromise. Grow up.\n\nWe haven't talked since, but this time its mutual.",

She will occasionally ask my father to chip in financially to help with the child and their needs. Dad doesn’t mind helping out here and there, however, SM gets agitated when mom calls and asks for things.  Mom will also sometimes ask for assistance with something related to garbage sibling, and SM would freak the F out if she were to find out.\n\nDad has asked that I call instead of Mom if the child needs anything (or if there is a garbage sibling situation) and he’ll pass the money or info or paperwork, through me. \n\nOn one hand; I’m an independent adult and have no interest in being the middle man in the continuing bull my garbage sibling  inflicts upon all of us.  I don’t want to get caught up in the drama, and I hate calling dad to ask for money (sometimes a large amount of money) even though it obviously is for the kid. (or paperwork or something for the sibling I have no contact with) I don’t want to share in the responsibility for any of this that has nothing at all to do with me. \n\nOn the other hand, my parents are both being decent people trying to do right by a kid that doesn’t deserve any drama.  They’re asking me to make a few calls (when I talk to them both pretty regularly anyway) to make things run more smoothly. And they are both adults completely capable of deciding when and how to engage or help garbage sibling and that really isn’t my business.\n\nBut I really just don’t want to be involved like this. \n(And when I mentioned it to Mom, she snapped at me that it is Dad’s request.

      "description": "This is going to be a long story with many details so here:\n\nTLDR: my high school boyfriend cheated on me with two of my best male friends, which all of my friends knew about and encouraged but never told me, so I outted him.\n\nThis is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nWhen I was 11 I became best friends with Andrew, Jackie, and Carrie. We hung out constantly for the next 3 or 4 years throughout school and outside of school.\n\nWhen high school came, they pushed me out of the picture. Wouldn’t talk to me or engage with me. I tried but they didn’t put in any effort and didn’t give me any reason.\n\nI became friends with Dan, Anastasia and Taylor.  Dan was openly gay and we rode the bus together to school every day for grade 11. Anastasia and Taylor were an open Lesbian couple. \n\nI started dating a boy named Devan and introduced him to Dan. They became best friends right away (see where this is going?). \n\nDevan was really popular and Andrew, Carrie and Jackie picked up on this. They tried to reignite our friendship by inviting me and Devan over. Then they stopped inviting me. \n\nAnyways, fast forward to our one year anniversary.\n\nDevan plans this super thoughtful date for us and I really enjoyed it. However the next day, he calls me to tell me he’s breaking up with me, not giving a reason.\n\nI find out that Devan had been cheating on me with Dan (who, it’s important to add is HIV positive) for pretty much our entire relationship. I also come to find out that he’s been sleeping with Andrew. \n\nI go to Anastasia and Taylor super upset, having just learnt this, and they told me they knew and wanted him to discovery who he really is so they didn’t tell me. Realizing they aren’t any help and just betrayed me, I go to Carrie and Jackie, who tell me the same thing about Andrew; they knew all along and thought they made a better couple than me and him anyways.\n\nSo a few days after the break up, it gets around school and people start asking me what happened. So, being betrayed and hurt, I told them Devan was gay and cheating on me (didn’t specify who).\n\n\nThis was about 7 years ago but I still struggle with it. Since then, i suffer from severe social anxiety, I don’t have many friends because I have horrible trust issues, and when I approached Anastasia, Taylor, Jackie, and Carrie in the recent past, asking for clarification, they tell me to just get over it since it was so long ago. No one has ever apologized to me for this.\n\nSo again, I will repeat\n\nTLDR: my high school boyfriend cheated on me with two of my best male friends, which all of my friends knew about and encouraged but never told me, so I outted him.

He gets into the other shifts potluck foods and if someone brings in something for everyone to try he eats the majority of it.  So our morale group has stocked food in the freezer as a courtesy and we have asked everyone to put money in a specific place when you pay for it, its not on a donation basis and we dont take I.O.U's.\n\n So come today the first day the food is available this guy doesnt have change to pay for it and drops in the I.O.U.  and several other co workers witness it and one speaks up and says something. Well when i get informed that this happened i gather the person and his supervisor and we go talk in the back. He tells me yes he dropped in those I.O.U's its no big deal im over reacting about it, and nobody said it was a bad idea or he would have stopped.\n\n\n\nSo im mad because hes trying to say these co workers are lying. Even though i trust them more than him. But in all honesty here, i dont trust him at all he lies about alot of stupid little things and breaks alot of rules around the work place. I feel like im totally justified for getting pissed off. \n\nWe say dont do that and he goes and does that on day one, and then lies about some of it and calls the other people liars about speaking up.

      "description": "been lurking for a while/first post/on mobile/the usual \n\n\nI (f23) am in my last year of undergrad. Through random social circumstances, I reconnected with a guy that I went to high school with who also attends my university. We started a FWB situation pretty much straight away after that, and have been seeing each a few times a month since the beginning of fall semester.\n\nJump to about 3 weeks ago. I was scrolling on the Instagram explore page and see a picture of my fwb and a girl. I click on her profile and wow. From the looks of her post history, they’ve been seeing each other since at least November. Vacation photos, holiday photos, everything. I decide not to say anything about it to anyone, and didn’t hear from my fwb until...\n\nFast forward to this past weekend, and I get a message from him asking me to come over. I’m thinking okay, maybe they ended things. Nope. I go back to her profile again and there’s a new post from the night before! \n\nI debated what I should for a few minutes and decided to...go to his apartment. My (maybe flawed) reasoning was that it’s not my relationship, and if I wasn’t snooping through instagram I never would have known about the other side of this.\n\nSo after all this my question is, am I the asshole in this situation for continuing to sleep with him? \n\n",

So back when I was just finishing up college, I was part of a nudes group on fb that a irl friend had invited me to. I was having some body image issues at the time so I actually really enjoyed posting and getting feedback and helping others with their images. \n     One day my Irl friend posted about a crappy situation that happened to her on a dating site, where after she rejected a guy asking her out he called her a fat whore and blocked her, she posted on the nudes group asking for some support. After a little while the comments were overwhelmingly what I considered a little hurtful with other women commenting that men are \"vile and trash\" and straight men are garbage and worthless and evil etc. Etc. \n    I found the thread kind of hurtful and commented that although I was horrified that someone had done that to her on the website I didn't think it was fair for the comment section to condemn an entire gender calling them vile worthless garbage. I immediately got slammed saying I was hijacking the thread and taking away from victims who were well within their rights to attack their suppressors and I was acting like part of the #notallmen movement. \n    They banned me after I made a couple more comments defending my comment and it still bothers me to this day. I don't think I was the asshole but I still think about it. I'm open to a new opinion about it. \n\nSo Reddit was I the asshole? ",

      "title": "AITA For asking neighbor kids to get off my lawn",
      "description": "So even writing that title makes me feel old. Here's the deal, I really love kids and I'm happy to see them do all sorts of craziness in the name of being a child...but I have a set of issues going on with a neighbor's kids. \n\nFirst, let me say that my spouse and I moved in to this house in a neighborhood specifically to get a bigger yard to provide a buffer between us an neighbors. We have rescue dogs that are nervous and upset by loud noises (high pitched screaming from kids is a particular trigger). They bark and even though they've learned the \"quiet\" command, they're still shaking and on edge if there are loud noises around the house.\n\nOur house is built in to the side of a hill. There's a large part of our yard in the back that is flat which butts up to some neighboring yards. When it snows the kids from one particular house play in our yard (there are many houses with kids around who play outside who are lovely and cause absolute 0 issues, including yelling loud when they play...it's literally just these three kids from one house). They sled down our hill, tear up the yard, and leave their toys in our yard for days. To be on the hill they have to be right on top of the side of our house, close enough that when they scream (seriously I've never heard kids scream the way these three do) it's as if they're right in our kitchen. \n\nIt's important to note that last winter my husband asked the kids personally to stay off of our hill please. They did for the rest of the winter. We saw the parents come out and direct them to where the property line was and to stay on the other side of it. This resulted in the kids playing in another neighbors yard almost primarily (which I feel bad for...she's an older lady who lives alone with mobility issues and I worry that they're bothering her more now). The kids spent all last winter literally playing ON the property line between our yard and the older lady, as close as they could get to our yard without actually being in our yard. They tore up the space between our yard and the lady directly behind us, that come spring no grass grew in that space all year. These kids also race tiny dirt bikes for hours on end around their house, but conveniently never actually in their own yard. They eventually wore a path in the grass that when through 4 other yards that weren't their own.\n\nOur first big snowfall happened last night and the kids were out on our hill again, despite their changes made last winter. We've now gone over to personally ask the parents to have the kids stay off of our lawn. They begrudgingly agreed, but I don't have faith that it's going to actually fix the issue long term, as last year was an example. I am loathe to take this any further up in escalation in the future, but I feel like I'd have to if it continues. That feels not very neighborly of me...but then again so does disrespecting a neighbors wishes regarding their property. \n\nMy problem with the kids on the hill is this:\n\n1. It's a liability issue. These kids are violent with each other (I've seen the biggest one whack the largest one in the head with a metal baseball bat...more than once). The parents are very clearly careless with their safety (the parents do nothing to assist the kids when they've been hurt and quite literally shut the door in their kids face while they're crying loudly enough for me to hear it in my house quite a ways away). I am concerned that if there were an issues with the kids getting hurt on our property, we could be sued or asked to pay for it in some way. I do not want to have to inspect my property regularly to make sure it's \"kid safe\".\n2. Our dogs are upset, which is stressful for them. Additionally, I have damaged vestibular nerve which makes loud noises like barking dogs and screaming kids incredibly painful. I understand that these noises happen and don't expect strangers to change behaviors to accommodate me, but we moved to this house for many reasons but the location was a primary attempt at limiting the pain via a buffer between houses. We literally have no issues with the multitudes of other kids or families in the area, even ones that live physically closer to us than these kids. \n3. We enjoy the look of a pristine snow fall. This was our first nice one this year...and when I looked out the window it looked like an army had descended on our yard...additionally they leave their toys and sleds behind for days at a time. Sometimes until it thaws and even then don't pick them up.\n4. We are going to build a fence for the dogs in the spring so that they can enjoy the yard more (currently they get walked on leashes). I'm concerned that if we do not establish boundaries with the neighbors now, the kids will harass the dogs through the fence or try to pet them, resulting in nipped fingers (again dogs with issues that we take great pains to work with and work around so they can have a good life). \n\nAITA for expecting parents/kids to A) ask for permission to be use someone else's property and B) telling kids to \"get off my law\"? WIBTA for escalating the situation further if the behavior continues?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Throwaway because people at work are reddit fiends. \n\nPrologue:\nI live at the corner unit of a town home building that has pretty thin walls. Thin enough to sometimes hear a neighbor snoring when he is sleeping in another room, which is not the master bedroom. I soundproofed the whole downstairs, just did not get to the 2nd floor yet. This is how the layout works in our building so atleast the master bedrooms don't share the same wall. Recently got a new neighbor. Guy that is around my age: late 20s or early 30s. Super nice guy that says hello and smiles everyday. He is a pretty good neighbor only had 2 parties in the 3 months he has lived here and he is pretty respectful about ending the party around midnight. \n\nLet's jump in. \n\nSaturday 11:30pm.\nMe and my wife are getting back after a night out. Pulling into our street we see around 5-7 German cars parked all around the street. We know already based on the past our boy is having a party. Cool. We love it, as we like to host many parties in the summer ourselves and are pretty cool with a younger neighbor that will not mind us when we turn up the music, ect. \n\nLike always the party ended around 12:15. Respect. I can tell the guests were pretty hammered due to constantly falling on the walls, shutting the door loud as fuck, ect. That's cool. I get it. We stay up till around 2am watching Netflix. I fall asleep. \n\n4AM:\n\"Wake up, I think I'm going to call the cops.\" My wife wakes me up with this phrase all of a sudden and I right away think somebody is trying to break in. Not a cool line to wake somebody up with imp. My wife explains to me the neighbor has been yelling at his wife and cursing her out in Russian for the last hour while I was sleeping. (My wife is not Russian but can understand a lot of it, enough to make out he was saying \"this is all your fault you suka\" , which is bitch is English. She also heard super loud thuds/noises throughout the whole upstairs. (Not sure if stuff is being throw, but what we assumed is aggressive fighting going at it from room to room. My wife described it that is sounded like he dragged her from room to room, she kept on trying to run away. \n\nI start hearing the thuds as well as the yelling and crying. My wife told me she is getting anxiety just listening to this and Def can't sleep at all. \n\nWe call the police to do a check up right away. (If nothing dangerous is occurring, it's a simple check up. 3 minutes in we hear the police come by and everything gets quiet. \n\nThen it hits me about 2 weeks ago I specifically placed my Arlo WiFi camera to face my street because a neighbor kept leaving annoying notes on my car about our association's parking which is another story. Right away I turn on live mode. Bam: we got front row seats to this. Grab the popcorn. We see 2 squad cars right in front. It looks like they are just the back up as the cops parked across from each other so they can chat with the windows down. There are more cars due to the lighting in the street and I'm pretty sure there is an ambulance as well because the street is lit up way too well (scene lights, there is always an ambulance dispatched to a domestic violence call) but we can't see anything due to the camera cutting off the view. \n\nA few seconds in we see the girl with her girlfriend and a suitcase leaving the driveway and getting out of the cameras view. Everything gets quiet. \n\nWhat I thought initially was that maybe he just got too drunk and they will take him in overnight until he sobers up, which is pretty common in domestic calls like that. \n\nThe thing is. My neighbor never came back. His car has not moved since Saturday night and is all frozen snowed in. Not a peep from the unit. It's Wed now. \n\nSo not sure what really happened could be a couple things. \n\n1. He is a  Eastern European dude with a pretty strong accent so we were thinking he might not even have papers. It's a far stretch, but it's pretty common for where we live in the U. S. Among the European population. We are Europeans ourselves. \n\n2. Perhaps police found some drugs after the party I don't know, but I am aware what happens at European parties like that and it's very plausible. \n\nObviously I don't think I am a complete asshole for calling the cops but there is no way I would stand for domestic abuse at that level and hey if nothing was wrong the gf would deny all accusations and I'm sure the only thing that would happen is he would be locked away for a night to sober up and it would have been just documented. \n\nWe are just wondering honestly what happened and I thought I'd share it with the internet. He only has 2 neighbors and obviously one of us called. I don't really care if he finds out that it's me. I will update if I find out anything new. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Mom planned a trip for my kids to visit her 6 months ago. They are supposed to fly down in about 3 weeks. Today she messages me that my stepbrother(who I hardly know) will be visiting and his trip with his teenage sons will over lap my kids trip. \n\nShe lives in a trailer that is small and only has one guest room. \n\nI told her that I’m uncomfortable with this and would have to know and be okay with the sleeping arrangements in order to protect my daughter. \n\nI told her the reason why is that I had a close friend who’s 8 year old daughter was assaulted in a similar situation. Both her parents were at the house sleeping even when this happened and it affects me and my wife’s comfort with these situations. \n\nShe is immediately offended and accuses us of being overprotective ( we probably are on some things). I told her I would call tomorrow and we could discuss it. \n\nAfterwards I found out my wife already mentioned the assault when we were planning the trip and how she was nervous. ( my wife held the poor girl while she relayed what happen to her)\n\nMy wife wants to cancel the trip and I’m leaning that way as well. Are we being crazy here?",

      "description": "A neighbor got a dog a few months.  It's a cute little puppy and it seems the dog is the responsibility of the neighbors son who is about 12-14.  I don't know this neighbor, I didn't even know they existed until the dog appeared.  Well, recently I noticed piles of dog shit on another neighbor's lawn.  Then after a few days it was all be gone and the cycle started again. I don't know who is cleaning it up. It could be the dog owner is picking it up every couple days or it could be the home owner is.  I don't even know if the home owner minds. For some reason, this is driving me crazy.  I walk my dog past the poop lawn every day and my dog likes to pee in this area. I don't want my neighbors to think this is my dog's shit. I almost (more on that later) always pick up after my dog. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here is where I need you help:  My dog is a super good boy but for some reason he will not go to the bathroom in our small backyard.  I live in a place with an HOA and there are common grounds throughout our neighborhood (in fact the front lawn where the neighbor's dog is shitting is technically common ground but we all treat our front lawns as our own).  Sometimes as night I will let my dog out and he will run to a common area that no one ever goes to and shit.  He usually does it in the woods so it's not a big deal but I'm sure he has also done it in the common space.  Usually it will just get mowed up by the landscapers.  I go into this common area quiet often and have never seen anyone else in there and have only seen my dog's shit once or twice and I pick it up when do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole hypocrite if I take vengeance?  Is my indignation righteous?  I feel the circumstances are different because they are letting their dog shit in space that everyone sees near their neighbor's house.  Also, they are walking their dog when it happens.  They are right there, just pick it up.  I used to pick it for them just so I didn't have to deal with HOA blow back but I got sick of that real fast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should note that I haven't spoken to the perpetrators yet because I am petty, passive aggressive and possible a coward.",

      "description": "Hi everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond time posting here. Sorry if this gets long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been in a relationship with this girl for 10 months. Throughout this relationship we have grown very strong as a couple. We love each other very much and have admitted that we are each some of each other's best friends without a doubt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe both attend a rigorous engineering university which requires us to study long hours throughout the week. My workload is much lighter than hers at the moment, due to the fact I'm trying to bounce back from a rough semester. Her schedule makes her busy and recently it's been difficult for us to find time to hang out together. It's left me frustrated, because I really love and care to see her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last time I saw her (which was yesterday) was for only thirty minutes at a restaurant in our university, and while it was enjoyable for the both of us, she was trying to study and told me she needed to go to a study room to focus on a couple of tests she had later that week. I assume the loud atmosphere and myself was probably distracting her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCue to Valentine's Day, the day this post was written. I have no classes today, and she told me that she would be able to spend some time with me. We discussed and agreed to do it in the evening after she was done studying for her exams. I went to get some flowers for her and got ready. She continuously studied from mid afternoon to 11 at night. At 10:30, after waiting around for a while, I got fed up and texted her, saying: \"*Hey look, it's getting late. Although I really want to see you, I hate to say that maybe we should do this later*.\" She responded basically by saying that she is sorry and was caught up in her studying; a few minutes later she texted again saying that she needed sleep and would be going home instead (we've only slept together on special occasions, and tonight simply wouldn't have worked). I complied with her and understood her frustrations. She said she wanted to hang out with me but just needed some sleep. None of us escalated the situation and kind of left it at a standstill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was (and still am) a little bit upset that nothing came out of this evening. We have established that school is a priority in our relationship and it still should be, but I still feel kind of upset about this whole ordeal. To make matters worse, this weekend (which happens to be a 4 day weekend due to President's Day in the US), she's traveling across the state with a few of her friends in an impromptu road trip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suppose my frustration comes out from what happened above: we have not been able to get together a lot recently, we were unable to spend Valentine's Day together, and now she leaves with her friends for a road trip. We generally don't hang out on weekdays so I probably won't see her until next weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo do I have a right to be frustrated despite me understanding that we both attend a vigorous university? Should I just let it go? And, most importantly, would it be asshole-ish to explain to her why I've been frustrated recently?",

      "title": "AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend of 2 years?",
      "description": "Last night I broke it off with my girlfriend of two years. \n\nLast week, she told me that she wanted us to “chill out” because she needed her independence and needed to work on her anxiety. I interpreted this as her suggesting we break up, which she didn’t deny - she simply said she was uncertain. \n\nMy girlfriend and I put 100% into this relationship. We had good chemistry, we were making progress, and we had really high highs. \n\nWith those high-highs came really low points. Her uncertainty is a regular thing, coming around any time she is anxious or insecure. She talks to me about it everytime, and I try to see past it, but I have become increasingly conscious of what I do and what I say, so I don’t cause another one of those situations.\n\nThat has worn me out over the past two years. I had told her about this months ago, and everytime she tells me she’s uncertain, I tell her that it may be best if we do take some time apart. I haven’t actively talked about my feelings the last few months, in fear of sending her off into a tailspin.\n\nLast night, after thinking about it for a few days, I sat her down and told her that I honestly thought it would be a good idea for us to break up. She was shocked, said it came out of nowhere. \n\nThe issue here is that she’s staying at my house for two weeks while she does placement for her course. It had been organised for a month. She otherwise lives an hour and a half away, making it difficult for her to get to placement from her own house. \n\nBreaking it off last night meant that she has nowhere to stay. I offered for her to stay until placement is done, but she understandably said she would be better off at home. \n\nWhat this means for her course in general, I don’t know. I feel guilty about it, as she may have to cancel her placement and try to do it somewhere else. \n\nIn addition, a lot of people will say that you don’t need any specific reason to break up, but I have two questions anyway: \n\nAITA for breaking it off without giving it one more shot and telling her that I was feeling that way? \n\nAITA for breaking it off in the middle of her placement? \n",

      "title": "WIBTA if I got my boss fired for nepotism?",
      "description": "I've worked in a fairly popular chain restaurant for the past 3 years. I'm a shift manager and mostly enjoy my job, but my boss (GM) has been really difficult lately. Thing is, GM has been pretty cool in the past and accommodates my school schedule since I'm in college, and I'm very thankful for this. I've become sort of close with her and even got her husband a job with my dad's company.  However, things have gotten difficult lately because GM has hired her husband and made him a manager, her two children, her niece, her son's girlfriend, GM's best friend (who then became the Assistant Manager), the friend's daughter, and a few of GM's daughter's friends. They all work on the same shifts, too. This is illegal, right? Plus, GM has been taking HUGE advantage of her position. I could go on and on, but here are some highlights:\n\n\\-GM's family and friends get very obviously special treatment. For example, GM's daughter and her friends will show up literally hours late, but GM will clock them in so it looks like they were there on time and get paid for it. \n\n\\-GM and Assistant Manager clocked in last week, left to get their nails done on the clock, and lied about it. GM actually regularly leaves for hours while clocked in, and I tried to call her on it once, but she said, \"I'm the boss, I can do that.\" Her husband and Assistant do this frequently, too. \n\n\\-GM demoted a manager in training because GM heard that she disagreed with so much of our staff being GM's friends and family. Everyone who isn't friends or family complains about this, though, not just the one person. Also, we aren't, like, sworn into some weird loyalty oath and I don't think the trainee deserved to be demoted for disagreeing with the GM. Punishing someone for this seems manipulative and power-hungry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has all come to a head now that GM heard from Assistant Manager's kid that I said something pretty serious that I really didn't, and GM is now starting rumors about me like it's middle school, calling me messy and fake and \"warning\" people about me. I've known her to do this with other employees too based on gossip, and it's caused huge problems and caused multiple people to quit. She hasn't confronted me about it, but she's apparently telling people that she's trying to get rid of me.  She's actually threatening to fire MULTIPLE people for complaining about the friends and family staff. One of us is already gone. We're just trying to work, and I feel like we're being punished for making legitimate complaints. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything in me is telling me to contact our higher-ups, but since, like, five people who work with me live with GM and some are underage, I'm worried that if GM loses her job, they'll suffer too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... WIBTA is I called someone about this? Is it necessary for me to be an asshole, or should I just suck it up since I'm looking for a new job anyway?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We're living together now, and this has been a problem for about 6 months and I'm finally at my fucking breaking point. My boyfriend thinks it's really funny to fart on my stuff. I'm not talking about being near something already and just happening to fart on it, I'm talking about when he stands up off the couch, walks over to my shoes or my coat, and deliberately farts on them. He's even tracked down and farted on my CAT, who was struggling to get away from him the entire time. \n\nI've told him to stop and he doesn't. I think he takes my protests as a joke, since I don't really make a big deal out of it and just tell him to stop. But now I'm fucking losing it. Yesterday he stood up from where we were cuddling on the couch, walked into the kitchen and picked up my cat, then jammed her up under his ass and started farting on her. I yelled at him to stop and he got really offended that I was \"sharp\" with him. We fought and he eventually accused me of being mad that he's \"being a human with a bodily function\". I told him that I'm not mad about the farting, I'm mad about how he will deliberately fart on my stuff!\n\nHe slept on the couch last night and wouldn't talk to me this morning. I'm at work now and I want to make sure that I'm not just being a crazy bitch over a 22 year old dude making fart jokes. \n\nTldr: Boyfriend goes out of his way to stick his ass into my stuff and fart on them, including my cat. I lost my temper and yelled, and he's accusing me of not respect that he's a human. Am I the asshole for getting mad about his \"fart jokes\"?",

      "description": "Me and my GF were sitting in some chairs when a man approaches us and asks if we were interested in coming to a discussion group before asking if we wanted to join his group at church. I told him i wasn't religious and when he turned to her, she said \"I'm gay.\" (She is pan). The man responded \"we take everyone\" before leaving us. \nI turned to her and asked her if why she had to be so rude about it and assume the guy hated homosexuality. She responded that she needed to be ready for anything and she's met a lot of Christians who aren't ok with lgbt stuff. I know there are those people who advocate against homosexuality but I imagine most Christians (especially younger generations like the man that approached us) are fine with that kind of thing. I also think it's an asshole move to assume ill intent in someone, even if you think they hate you. \n\nLet me know if I'm the asshole.",

The band director told us to split up into groups and we would test on certain days before or after school. We were supposed to be on Thursday morning.\n\nCome today and during class, my band director informs us that we could test during class so that we don’t have to test before or after school. So I talk to my group and four out of six of us say that we want to go. One person wasn’t at school. So one girl (calling her girl A) didn’t want to go but everyone else did. We never really decided on whether to test or not so when the band director asked who wanted to go, I raised my hand to ask if we could go but when I looked at them, they were saying “no” I continued to raise my hand so that I could ask if I could go alone. \n\nAs soon as soon as he said no, I dropped my hand and instead asked if I could join another group. Enough people wanted to go who were held back by their groups that the director just began to pick people. So I went today instead of waiting behind because one person did not want to go.\n\nNow girl A is upset with me. \n\nAm I the Asshole? ",

I’d like to add that NONE of those items were frozen food items, they were mainly perishable items, cheese, meat and produce. \n\nAfter she started to walk away, I went over and gathered them all up, I walked past her and said “don’t worry, I got it” \n\nAs I walked away, I guess she realized she was caught and yelled “cuz that’s your fucking job” \n\nI told her it wasn’t my job to follow her around the store and clean up her mess.

During our carpool meeting last night I found a ride with some other members of the club who were offering a ride. I offered that we all split the gas cost for the round-trip, as per usual. What I didn't know is that driver doesn't have a 4WD vehicle or snow chains.\n\nToday he requested that we split the cost for the chains among us ($20/person for the $100 chains). I responded by saying that I don't really see why we have to all pay for this chains that he is going to end up keeping for his car at the end of the day. During the carpool meeting last night, the board members even reminded everyone that if you offer a ride you need to have 4WD/AWD or chains for your vehicle, so I assumed that the driver already had a suitable car. Being a poor college kid I already had trouble scrapping up money for the trip, so I only offered him $10 which he got pissy about.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "A little background, I was swamped with tons of work today and asked my husband if he would be able to clean our gecko’s cage as she had pooed today. He proceeded to do so and an hour later I decide to take a break and lay down on our bed. Only I can’t nap because of a REALLY STRONG smell of shit. So I look over and there’s a pile of my freshly washed intimates that he’d thrown on the bed to sort later. I think “holy crap, did I leave skid marks or something on these??” I go to sort threw it but stop when I realized what it was. He’d grabbed the cage liner and left it on my clean underwear and a pillow. I’m horrified and ask him why there’s gecko poop on our bed. He can’t answer me, just apologizes and grabs the liner and throws it away in our trash bin. As a germaphobe, I just sit there shellshocked. He comes back and starts putting the underwear up in my drawer and I scream at him because:\n1) He didn’t wash his hands after he touched the big fat poop.\n2) Now the rest of my underwear has gecko poop essence on it. \n3) Gecko is in quarantine until she’s clear of Giardia. So it’s not even a solid #2 \n\nAfter I yell at him, I grab everything off the bed and from my drawer and throw it in the washer. He’s now in the other room acting hurt. I can’t understand why a rational person would just nonchalantly throw poop on their bed. On the pillow they put their face on. The underwear that cover’s their wife’s goods. He doesn’t go to school and he hasn’t had to go to work in 5 days. Meanwhile I’m here doing 16 hours at school and working 2 part time jobs to support us. I just don’t understand how someone can be so non-functional. I’m trying to formulate an apology but I honestly can’t because I’m so disgusted I want to cry. It was really big and messy poop that had soaked through the liner. \n",

My girlfriend put me to bed early in the night. The next morning, I wake up very hungover and thirsty. I see that there is a water bottle on my night stand with a sticky note that says \"water\" on it. I thought this was weird at the time, because what else would it be? Very thankful that I didn't have to get up to get water, I proceed to chug the \"water\" only to quickly realize that it was actually vodka and then vomit all over our bed. At that point, my girlfriend woke up and was very angry at me. \n\nI felt very bad, I didn't realize at the time that my girlfriend had left the bottle there, so I got up and cleaned everything up even though I felt like dog shit. She denied putting the \"water\" there so I just thought one of our friends did it. It was a shitty thing to do, but I got over it until later that day one of the people there that night tagged me in an Instagram video of my girlfriend basically setting up the prank. It shows her pouring vodka into a water bottle and saying how funny it's going to be while her friend filming it is telling her she's being a dick and she just laughs and says \"hair of the dog\" then howls.\n\nI confronted my girlfriend about this and she thinks the video is hilarious and sees no problem with it. I told her if she really didn't remember doing this, then she has a drinking problem. It was a very cruel thing to do. She said I was overreacting and being sensitive.",

      "description": "So basically this girl was really keeping my best friend (lets call him SK) on the fence. She was from Columbia and came her for her PhD. My best friend started spending all day with her, he drove her around since she didn't have car, he would always buy her drink, she crashed his car and he had to fix it and all that jazz that comes along with being lord friend zone. Everyone thought that they were dating because they were always together but I knew my buddy wasn't hitting that.\n\nThen turns out this señorita (initials GB) has at least 5 or 6 other guys on the hook and apparently they were all friend zoned, but less than my friend. SK was fine with this arrangement because he knew he was the main guy and she will eventually end up with him. I knew that she was using all these guys and I didn't like her and I made it clear to her that I didn't like her and that she's not fooling me. \n\nSo one day another friend of mine (KA) throws a party and we are all there. KA is dating a guy (JJ). Apparently in that party GB and JJ start talking and hit it off. No one knew what was going for atleast a couple of weeks, except that we were seeing alot more of SK since he wasn't with GB all the time. And KA had started seeing another guy (she didn't like JJ and she isn't a serious relationship type anyways and JJ is super Christian).\n\nSo after a couple of weeks we all find out that GB and JJ are dating through a Facebook post, it was literally a relationship status change and everyone is like we thought she was SK's girlfriend. Apparently not. And SK was like whatever, we were just friends, I didn't like her. I personally found it to be hilarious.\n\nNow GB and JJ are just a running joke in my friends circle because no one likes them. And it's quite evident that GB is also using JJ to get a green card because they were married in 6 months flat. And once I posted a picture of SK in a restaurant with GB and JJ in the background sitting on another table with the caption \"SK's long lost love\" or some bullshit like that on Instagram and GB found out that we make fun of her like this and got mad at me. I don't care and she can go fuck herself.\n\nI find it hard to be nice to a lying using bitch like GB, nobody is perfect but I really hate it when girls use other people, mostly because I have been used by girls too and bullshit radar is fine tuned. But right now I'm trying to deal with my emotions and behaviors to be a better person. So if someone wants to tell me something about myself after reading this, please feel free to do so. I have behaviors that I'm trying to fix.\n\nTl;dr: girl uses guys, marries christian guy for green card, Christian guy dating another friend before, i be bitch and post on the gram, i be good, am asshole?

When college started, these people stopped being friends and hanging out with me once they joined a fraternity or sorority. I then decided that I would only buy alc for friends that are true friends, ones that don't take advantage of me.\n\nStory:\n\nAt the beginning of the school year, I told Sarah [19] about the story at orientation, of how people only texted me or hung out with me when they wanted alcohol. As the school year went on we partied together and quite honestly, it was horrible for me. I have never had a pleasant experience drinking with Sarah because she would actually start being mean to me and even insulted me on what kind of underwear I wore.\n\n**From a 3rd person perspective of someone sober, that was at the party:** He noticed that Sarah was being mean to me, like when I was insulted over just my underwear, and looked at me in the eye whenever I would take an insult. \n\nThe other night Sarah texted me to buy alcohol for her on Friday around 9 pm, I said \n\n    \"lemme finish up some homework first\" she replied, \n\n    \"It'll only take 5 minutes!!\" and \"it's not like I'm not asking you to stop doing your hw.\" \n\nThat is when I just couldn't hold it back anymore and texted:\n\n    \"I kinda feel used... I'm all for buying you the alc but it seems that I only get a text when alc is needed\"\n\nSarah then replied:\n\n    \"Thanks for being a real one🙄\" and \"I see where our friendship stands👍🏼\"\n\nFast forward one day later:\n\n    Sarah in person: \"Just to let you know, we are no longer friends.\"\n    Me: \"Oh... because I didn't buy you alcohol?\"\n    Sarah: \"Yes.\"\n\n**AITA** for not buying alcohol for my \"friend\" which resulted in ending our friendship?

      "description": "To make things short my stepson was out and he left his laptop wide open on his bed. I was taking in his laundry and couldn't help but notice a certain image out of the corner of my eye, so I took a glance and a glance turned into more once I saw what it was. Basically it was this forum full of photos making fun of the recent attack, people insulting muslims and hateful crap in general. I was absolutely horrified and I immediately phoned him and demanded he return home right now. I took the laptop and put it up in my office, then had him come in and proceed to show him everything I had seen and asked him what it was about. He was immediately indignant and refused to address anything I asked of him, telling me he didn't post what I saw and had nothing to do with it at all. It became very heated and he ended up storming out of the house.\n\nHe may not be my biological son but I have raised him for many years and this is not the path me or his mother want him to take. I proceeded to pack up most of things (consoles, games etc.) and waited for him to return. When he did I told him that he had two options, I could either sell all these things and donate it to charity dedicated towards ending this sort of shit, or he could come with me and offer to volunteer helping out the local muslim community. I thought these were both fair choices, and my wife and I agreed this was the best course of action to help him learn. Instead when he finally arrived home later than night and saw all his things missing and listened to what we had to say to him he proceeded to go ballistic and shout at the both of us. He said a lot of hateful things towards the both of us, ending up in calling his own mother a \"cuck\". At that point I found it hard to restrain myself and told him to get out and stay out until he agreed to either option and learnt some respect for the both of us.\n\nHe's seventeen years old, so legally speaking he's not in any trouble not being at home, and he has plenty of friends he can couch crash with (although I did call their parents to let them know about the situation). That said I am rather worried they might just be helping radicalise him to begin with.\n\nIt has been two days and we still haven't heard from him personally, although from what I hear he is staying with friends and safe. Now that the dust has settled, I wonder if I was out of line. I didn't expect him to stay gone for so long and I didn't intend to create a cruel punishment, just a learning experience. My wife and family are backing me up completely here but I wonder, AITA and did I go too far?",

      "description": "Here's some context:\n\nIn Australia, the Reserve Bank has set limits on how much you can use a particular coin. I.e., there is a $5 limit on using 5c, 10c, 20c and 50c coins, a $10 limit on $1 coins and a $20 limit on $2 coins. This is not a WELL known law, but it is a law and often, cashiers refuse payment. There's a video that gets reshared every 6 months or so of a guy trying to pay $100+ in fines with 5c and 10c pieces and gets super shitty when it's rejected. He videoed it, shared it, and then got heaps of support.\n\nHeres the link to the article: https://tendaily.com.au/news/australia/a190103snv/outrage-after-shop-refuses-mum-paying-10-in-50-cent-coins-20190103?utm_content=tnq-facebook&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook\n\nTL;DR of article, lady takes $10 in 50c coins to a shop, gets told she cant use it, goes home to get correct tender, goes back to shop to finish transaction, goes home and complains to company on FB and was told the same thing, and is now sharing her story to shame the company.\n\nI got into an argument with some people who thought that the cashier and company were in the wrong and that they should have accepted the coins, regardless of what legal tender laws there are.

      "description": "Hear me out. \n\nMy boyfriend has been talking about wanting to study in the Netherlands ever since we met. However, he had to retake his A-Levels exams and therefore missed many deadlines for uni applications, limiting his choices; not to mention he also didn’t score high enough to earn scholarships so many places were out of his price range. He considered just attending uni locally instead where he has a chance of doing a twinning programme in Australia, so he applied and got accepted. It’s important to note that he also gets a pretty big family discount at this uni. \n\nThe problem is this uni is pretty lacklustre in terms of facilities for his course which really worries him. He began applying to unis in the Netherlands and actually got accepted into all 3 that he applied for (I’m so proud of him!). While the facilities there would be far better than the ones here, the major concern is that a huge loan would have to be taken out in order for him to study there. Other concerns would be our relationship, him not being able to fly back during breaks due to air tickets being so pricey, and just generally him being away for 4 years with a 7-8 hour time difference. \n\nPersonally, I’m conflicted. I know I don’t have much of a say in this, but I really want him to stay not only due to our relationship (I realise that I am selfish in this regard) but also because his parents are old and I’m worried what if anything happens? However I also really want him to go to the Netherlands if that’s what’s gonna be best for him because I want him to thrive in life. I’ve told him all of this before, and I also made him promise me that he wouldn’t base his choice around me. \n\nI’ve tried my best to not let my personal feelings get in the way of any discussions we have regarding his final choice, but one day something in me just snapped and I said some really mean and hurtful things, and basically just tried to guilt trip him into staying. I have since apologised, he accepted my apology and we made up. He subsequently decided to just attend uni locally; I was really worried that this choice was affected by our fight but he reassured me that it wasn’t, and that this is his choice entirely. However I just feel really bad about it because I don’t want him to regret this later on and then resent me for it. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for maybe affecting his decision? Was it wrong of me to take our relationship into consideration, or tell him about what I thought? I’m still so conflicted, please help. ",

      "title": "AITA for thinking my friend could falsely accuse another friend of rape?",
      "description": "\nMy boyfriend and his friends go away for a weekend and this year I am able to go. I was told the weekend was solely devoted to getting as drunk as possible and hanging around having fun. At the time I was invited, I was the only female going and asked them if it was okay if I could bring a friend of mine. The OK was given, I asked, and she said yeah. I’ll call her E. \n\n\nSometime between late November and mid-December, E expressed to me that she had an “intrusive thought” (her words) of being drunk and woken up in the middle of the night with a guy on top of her trying to have sex. She said she knows it’s happened to other people and it could happen to her as well. I responded as compassionately as I could to reassure her that she would be fine and god forbid something did happen, I would hold the guy accountable and get authorities involved. At the end of the conversation it seemed that all fears were soothed and things would be fine. \n\n\nThat was until I got a text from E a few hours later saying she was going to meet a guy from Tinder in the near future.  That wasn’t my problem, E is an adult and can do what she likes. My issue is with what was said next. She communicated that she had planned on watching movies with him and “getting dick” (again, her words). There was no other context, no clarification as to when this encounter would happen. I assumed (I know, I know) that it was going to be happening the day of them meeting for the first time. I was livid. In my mind, E had just accused these guys I consider friends to be predators and was fearful of them raping her, but was totally fine with hooking up with this Tinder guy she had never met before and had no fear of being assaulted by him. E never mentioned the fear of being assaulted by Tinder guy. \n\n\nAnother piece of information: E has told me that she’s attracted to not one but two, of my boyfriend’s friends who would be with us that weekend. I’ll call them T and J. J has a girlfriend and T has been single a few months now. T and E talked, but T wasn’t interested and it died off. E has expressed wanting to hook up with T but T is not that interested. T has said however that if he was intoxicated and feeling E, he would hook up with her if she still wanted to. I warned against it but we’re all adults and can make our own decisions.\n\n\nI didn’t express my concerns and hurt with E about what she said until the next day when I felt that I could respond calmly. I asked her when she planned on hooking up with Tinder guy, where, and how and why I was upset that she thought my friends could be predators. She backtracked. Suddenly it was , “oh i’m not going to have sex with him, i’m scared of him too,” and so on. I felt a tad better, but a few days later that fear of mine popped up again. The conversations seemed weird to me and it didn’t seem like she cared that I was upset about what she said and was just trying to save face. It then crossed my mind that E could be actively seeking drama. I wanted to give E the benefit of the doubt, but the thought that she could ruin someone’s life because she was drunk and regretted hooking up with them was constantly on my mind. (E has said before that she doesn’t want her first time to be a hook up. If that were to happen I don’t see why she wouldn’t regret it later, especially if T doesn’t engage with her the way E wants him to. I know that some false accusations are indeed because the female was upset and vengeful.)\n\n\nDisclaimer: I’ve never seen E really intoxicated so I don’t know how she is. She doesn’t have a history of lying or exaggerating things that have happened either. Doesn’t mean she wouldn’t.  And mixing that with alcohol is not a good idea. At all. I could say the same for the guys, I’ve never seen them assault someone, but it doesn’t mean they wouldn’t. (just playing devil’s advocate here) There is also no history of assaults, physical or sexual, happening during this weekend in the past. \n\n\nI rescinded E’s invitation for the sake of my sanity and so I can have a good time. Was it wrong of me to think she could possibly do that? Am I wrong for prioritizing my experience when she has no history of doing seedy things? ",

      "description": "I'm 23, girlfriend is 27. This is my first real relationship while she was married and had quite a few sexual partners before me and she did things like threesomes and maybe even orgies. I have a lot of learning and I think I have some insecurities because she's very good looking and I'm kind of fat and not good looking. I know that if I demand too much she can leave and have a new hook up in literally minutes while it could take me months or years to even get a response on tinder. \n\nWe have a really good sex life and I look forward to it so much and she's very giving and honestly she's down for sex any time I want it, maybe she wants it more. When I found out that she used to do things like an@l and group stuff I asked her when we could try it and she told me that was in her past and she had outgrown it. For the most part I'm cool with that and can deal.\n\nBut here's where I feel it gets weird. When she gets even a little buzzed around her older friends, she talks about all the sex stuff as if it's great memories and she wants to do it again someday. And all of this is right in front of me. As an example we were out with her friends tonight and she got drunk and next thing I know she and her friend were cuddling and giving each other back rubs and nuzzling necks and all the while they were saying things like \"remember when we did this in Mexico with those frat guys?\" and much worse but I won't get gratuitous. But they both agreed it was the \"best time they ever had.\" Her fiends boyfriend was there and I found out they had a threesome with him too when they were in high school and all three were bragging about and I guess joking that they should drop me off and go relive a good memory.  \n\nWhen we got back to my place I asked why she won't consider having a threesome with me which was bad timing because of how drunk she was. And she told me she's explained to me that's her past. I said well it's sort of disrespectful to talk about her past and talk about having threesomes now that wouldn't include me. She said if I couldn't tell the difference between a joke and acting on it, I'm an idiot. I told her that was really mean and she said she hated me and called her friend and boyfriend to pick her up. Now I've been swearing it out for the last 4 hours freaking out because she won't respond to my calls or texts even though I said I was sorry.\n\nSince me asking again why she won't do certain things with me is what caused the fight, am I the asshole for thinking she should do the same things with me that she did in her past?",

      "description": "I’ve been a massive fan of a certain rock group and especially thier lead singer since I was in middle school (I’m 23 now). My ex boyfriend is working as a tour manager and got me a literal behind the scenes tour of backstage when they stopped in our city. \n\nI didn’t get to meet the band but literally saw everything else, sound checks, food spread, and on and on. Ex asked if I’d like to see the tour bus and of course I said yes. He let me into the “bedroom” of the lead singer and there was like a Tupperware thing full of underwear (instead of a dresser) and when my ex wasn’t looking I grabbed a pair and hid them. \n\nI’m pretty embarrassed because that is not in my personality but I’m also like in the grand scheme of things this was sort of harmless but I still stole. I waver between this is what anyone would have done to this was just being a silly fan girl to I am a complete asshole. \n\nSo I’m asking here; am I the asshole?",

      "description": "We live in Baltimore, MD for reference. \n\n\nEveryone in my guest list for my wedding (this was in June for timeline reference) had their airfare covered so it was at no cost to them. I begged her to go as she was the only friend I had on my side attending (we had a 15 person limit)  she only had to pay for the $30 dress she bought and was planning on returning anyway, as well as the $80 hotel she was splitting (so $40 from her pocket) with another friend. She was unwilling to fly there and back in two days even though that’s what was planned for 4 months, and she seemed ok with for that four months leading up to the wedding. She changed her mind two days before saying she couldn’t miss her dads birthday, which was the very next day. I said ok, didn’t mind, didn’t put another thought into it because I understood this could happen as she does not like to travel.\n\n\nFast forward to this weekend. BFF has another mutual friend’s (ex friend of mine but she’s still talking to my bff) gender reveal in Philly (a two hour drive). That’s all it is, a gender reveal. But she’s planning on driving there to meet the girl and her friend group to celebrate the pregnancy/gender. I’m a little salty she’s willing to drive to the gender reveal in her Jeep, and pay for the gas, but was unwilling to fly for free to my one and only wedding with an expense less than $100. Am I the asshole for holding resentment over this? Do I need to let it go?",

      "description": "So, I work somewhere where I send a lot of e-mails throughout the day. Some of these e-mails require action to be taken by the recipient, and sometimes they can be a bit time sensitive. It’s nothing life or death, and in my line of work I deal in dollar amounts that rarely exceed $200, so it’s not like there’s big money on the line.\n\nHowever, when I send one of those “action-required” e-mails, I usually give a courtesy call to let the recipient know that I’ve sent them one of those e-mails, and then I kinda just give them a breakdown of what they need to do from there. My job doesn’t require me to make those calls, I just do it because people tend to appreciate it and it often expedites their response.\n\nThat being said, if I notice that the recipients name is something foreign-sounding (By which I mean any name that isn’t something I immediately recognize as being common/familiar), I never make that courtesy call because I don’t want to be stuck in an awkward phone conversation with someone who I can’t understand.\n\nDoesn’t matter if it’s an Arab name, Asian name, or an Eastern European name. Basically, anyone who doesn’t have a name that would be considered “normal” in an English speaking country doesn’t get a courtesy call.\n\nI know the majority of these people would probably be easy enough to speak to, but even one call with someone who I can’t understand a damn word they’re saying is too much for me, so I just don’t risk it.\n\nThe way I see it is that I don’t need that kind of hassle in my day-to-day, and my current practice has made it pretty much a non-issue (not to say that old white dudes from Nebraska can’t be damn near impossible to understand too sometimes). In addition, those courtesy calls aren’t required, I just do them to make my job easier. Having a 15 minute conversation with a man from Belarus who speaks unintelligibly (to me, chances are I sound weird af to him too) does nothing to make my job easier, therefore defeating the purpose of making those calls in the first place.\n\nTo be totally honest, I have no real intention of changing my ways even if everyone says I’m an asshole, because like I said I just don’t want the hassle and if that makes me a dick I guess that’s the cost of doing business. That being said, any insight would be appreciated.\n\n",

      "description": "(Using an alternative account)\n\nI’ve known this friend since high school (~5/6 years ago) and we were pretty close then. But as we went on to do different things/fields after and into different universities later on, we kind of drift apart. Totally normal in my opinion. \n\nA bit of (a long) backstory but you’ll understand why: \n\nShe has a tendency to always make fun of me when we were classmates in high school. She made fun of my height (Apparently I’m too short. She’s not /that/ tall, just slightly taller than me). My tanned skin (because apparently she’s fair and I’m slightly toasted because I used to play sports under the sun). How I “suck” at our second language (because apparently watching dramas in our second language without english subtitles and throwing around words you learnt from those dramas makes her better at that language than I am). She still finds ways to bring me down till today. \n\nAnd the thing that annoys me the most is her texting. She used to spam me with 20/30 texts at a time telling me about how her crush (crushes actually. She changes really quickly) is in front of her and she doesn’t know what to do. How he looks like, what he’s wearing, how handsome he is every single Sunday for about a year or two. And it’s frustrating because it’s the same narrative every Sunday and you see the same texts for a year. I eventually ran out of responses to give and she’ll say like “Oh sparetangerines i’m so sorry for spamming :( I’m just really into him, he’s so good looking.” Always talking about herself again. She also likes to text me first and then not reply or say things like “oh sorry for the late reply I was watching my drama/playing games”. And I’m here thinking “okay you texted me first and I replied out of curtesy and you actually have the decency to ignore my texts for very long time while I see you on twitter/instagram talking about your drama. Thanks man...” And recently we got into different universities and she met a new bunch of friends. Okay, totally normal, because so did I. She’s always talking about them on twitter and instagram, but yes, normal to me because it’s her usual habit. She always makes it very obvious that I’m the second option after them. \n\nSo, I know i’m nice and I usually let people step on me and pretend it didn’t happen. But now, I think it has to stop. I’m so tired of it. \n\nShe recently asked if I wanted to hang out with her on her birthday. I’m free but I feel like saying no because \n1. She takes birthdays very seriously. I once didn’t wish her and she texted me saying something like “hello it’s my birthday today. you didn’t forget right?” I WAS APPALLED. She didn’t even remember my birthday btw and she was talking to me on my birthday and only realised it when the day was almost over. And she says “birthday month” so.. yeah I think you get what I mean. The whole month is for celebrating.\n\n2. As said above, she “documents” everything on instagram. She’s probably expecting a present from me since birthdays are so grand for her. I straight up told her that I have no money so we shouldn’t do anything expensive together. But i’m sure she’s still expecting something. She’s also probably going to Instagram this day and say “thank you sparetangerines for celebrating my birthday with me!”. So pretentious... She’s quite cheap and she has never given me anything. I’m not calculative but shouldn’t a friendship be reciprocal? I used to send her cards but she has never sent me one. Anyway, no present for her even though she’s probably expecting one. \n\n3. I’m her second choice. Or so I think i’m her second choice this year on her birthday since her university friends cannot make it. Because recently, she places her university friends above anything else, which shocked me. Everyday that she has school, she Instagram stories every moment they’re together. She hardly goes out after school, but with them, she goes out almost everyday, and spends a ton when she’s with them. Which makes me wonder why didn’t she celebrate with them instead of me.\n\n4. About texting, she texted me first (as usual) asking if I want to hang out on her birthday. I said ok. It’s been unusually long (she’s on her phone all the time. she’s phone obsessed) and she hasn’t given me a reply. I wanted to overlook all that has happened and settle the venue and time with her but since she hasn’t replied, I’m thinking of taking back my okay and pulling a petty card and say that I’m not free. Because I’m so tired of this bull crap.  \n\nSo AITA for (possibly) choosing to say no to a birthday friend because of how she has been treating me all these years? ",

      "description": "\nOk so I'll give some context first. I suffer with anxiety and am currently attending college full time until the end of June in which I'll be finished there and I do love my dad and he loves me. Ever since I left school though my dad was really getting on to me about getting a part time job so he can stop paying my mum as much child maintenance as he was doing. At this time my mental state was going downhill big time I stopped eating, going to college and seeing friends and family in my spare time, you get the picture. So my answer to him was that I'd get a part time job when I finish college because I'm only there for 2 years. He didn't like this answer and really put a lot of pressure on me to get one every single time I spoke him. This caused me to break down several times in which he thought that I was \"using my anxiety and mental health as an excuse.\" Anyways he stopped after a while because he saw it was getting to me and now fast forward to present day.\n\nSo these past few months I've started taking new tablets and I'm in a much better place both physically and mentally. I have my up and down days but I'm a lot better than what I was like before. Anyways my dad and mum got into some what of a dispute over him still paying my mum child maintenance and when it should stop. So to cut a long story short he got in contact with the organisation that's in charge of sorting all that stuff out in the UK and they told him because he has been legally giving my mum more than he should have (which wasn't very much at all) he doesn't have to give her shit till may.\n\nMy mum came up with a compromise. She asked dad if he'd be able to pay for my bus fares till the end of June to get there and back from college and then she'd obviously pay for food etc. Dad agreed. However this past week just gone mum got in contact with him about paying my fares and he said that he's got bills to pay which is bullshit because he's recently bought a house in Scotland and doesn't have a mortgage on it and he definitely isn't poor so trust me he can afford it. Baring in mind as well he's just gone and bought a new motorbike for himself as well these past few days and he's also booking a trip away with my older brother later this year.\n\nThis caused me and dad to argue a bit about it because my mum isn't a very confrontational person so she just chose to leave it and refused to ask for his help again. Now don't get me wrong I love my dad and he does care about me he just goes about it in the wrong way because he's quite a volatile person and it really doesn't take much to piss him off at all. So I decided these past few weeks to distance myself from him and not be as close because he's still in the process of moving and I think the stress of that might be getting to him as well and I really don't wanna fall out with him because he's my dad and I love him.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for doing so?",

      "description": "So I am not sure if this breaks any rule, or if this will add to the now long list of \"Obviously NTA\" that are around here lately... But I am feeling really confused with this one. \n\nSo first, context. I am from Mexico. Why does it matter? Because December 28 is the Mexican equal of the April's fool. So yeah, this happened a few minutes ago.\n\nSo I was on Instagram, randomly browsing to get sleep, when I realized a post of hers, saying something on the like \"I'm really happy to you being inside me, my princess\" or something like that. Now I sent her a PM because it caught me off guard, because she had a son a few years ago and I Knew for sure she Didn't wanted another one. So after asking her about it I realized the date and said \"Nevermind, 28\". However I got a response. \"it's not that. It's real\"  and I was like \"Ok, gonna check out the 29 to see if you still pregnant\". Now I know this sounds awfully bad without context, but I was obviously skeptical. She got really upset after that. \"thanks for your congrats and good wishes, I see you really care about it\" and then blocked me. And that got me thinking. Because it's not the first time that happens. You guessed it, her first son was also anounced on December 28. And I didn't believed her that time either. I know I kinda am the asshole: she's my friend and I should support her no matter what... But can you blame me for nor believing her about this on April's Fools? (I am well aware we ain't at april).\n\nEdit: So it turned out to be a joke. Not that it matters anyway. Just letting you guys know.",

      "description": "This is going to be a long one because I feel like I need to include a fair bit of detail to explain it so there'll be a TLDR at the end.\n\nI (f20) and my friend (M20) (call him P) have been best friends for about 5 years, dated for over a year at the start of those 5 so we're super close. Last night me, P and a couple others went to another friend's house to smoke/drink and there was a guy there that we'd never really met before (call him D). D was the only one that didn't know everyone else there so I made a genuine effort to talk to him, but for the rest of the night he just responded with \"shut the fuck up\" to everything I said even if not to him (he did it to another girl that showed up so I basically think he just hates women generally) but my friend P was sort of joining in with D and was absolutely no way on my side, I felt like shit, I felt like I couldn't say anything because it would just get shot down, so I went to sleep early and have spent all day crying about it to my boyfriend. I just felt bullied and upset. My friend knew I was upset and said he'd apologise properly later when we go out.\n\nNow right now I'm meant to be in a VIP line to see my friend P's favourite band, and then go to another club night with our shared favourite artist. He got us these tickets for my birthday, and I've not gone, and I feel really awful about it and I feel like I'm just overreacting, but he does things like this constantly, last night was not an exception. P gets far too drunk any time he has any and always needs looking after, he gets messy and too touchy and too loud all at once and is just generally difficult to deal with, he is a huge factor as to why I've stopped going clubbing so much because he's always there and always like this. Also when we're in any kind of social situation together he basically starts peacocking around trying to impress the other people we're with. Unfortunately his tactic for this is to take anything I say and make fun of me for it, I don't think he means to but he does and it upsets me. For example if I question something he  said he'll have a reaction along the lines of \"wtf that's not what I  said are you even listening? Are you stupid that's not what I said\" (generally his digs make 0 sense so it fully is just like he's saying it for the sake of it) Also anytime I mention me and my boyfriend he just instantly calls it gay or stupid, I called him out on it one time when he did it after me telling him we had reached 8 months together and we're celebrating. P apologized and then did it again in the same conversation when I next mentioned my boyfriend, he called him gay and brushed off what I'd said. I know it's only little stuff but it is genuinely every time we're with other people and again every time I mention my boyfriend. He's going through a tough time right now and I genuinely am the only person that's actively there for him, which makes me feel way worse for letting him down but also just upsets me more because I feel he doesn't even recognise that effort some times.\n\nTLDR: My friend tends to take the piss out of me whenever we're in social situations and always takes the piss out of my relationship. (He is nice when it's just me and him) He was particularly upsetting last night so today I've cancelled going to a gig with him and he might have missed out on seeing two of his favourite artists in one night. I still don't know if he's actually gone or not. \n\nBasically I'm wondering if I've over reacted or if it was fair",

      "description": "My friend Abu and I have been close for 6 years; we had a long distance friendship, so everything I'm about to tell you happened over text/call. She used to be a very kind, supportive, and overall amazing friend, but in the last four months, she's been basically the opposite. For some information on her, she has depression and suspected that she was bipolar but was never diagnosed (I included this in case it was important). \n\nIt first began with her \"bullying me\" by picking on flaws that I don't have/have gotten rid of (I'm certainly not flawless, but she was picking on things that weren't really there). She'd bring them up randomly and without rhyme or reason. Honestly, I mainly ignored it and told her I was sorry she felt that way, but that I disagreed. \n\nAfter that, she began with very sudden irritation. FYI, she almost never got irritated with me before (although we've definitely had our moments), so it was extremely odd when she started getting mad at me for small things, such as texting her too much (I wasn't spamming her) and wanting to call her (we didn't talk much on the phone; we mainly texted). \n\nContinuing on, she started prioritizing her other friends over me. Now, I'm not a jealous person, but it was VERY clear that she had a favoritism toward two of her friends, leaving both myself and her girlfriend in the dust. It didn't bother me that she was treating me as less than her friend so much so as treating her girlfriend as less than her friend. She'd buy her other two friends expensive gifts, take them out to expensive places, and literally ignore me when she was with one of those friends. It started to really bother me after awhile. \n\nAfter it had been about two months of this, I got tired of it, and I started being irritated and rude back at her; I won't lie. I very suddenly realized that things in our friendship seemed to be falling apart, so I decided we needed to talk. I tried calling her, but she told me it'd just put her \"in an even worse mood\", so I had to text this very heated conversation with her. First, I told her the problems I felt we had in our friendship (the biggest ones, anyway), then I let her respond with what she thought. Immediately, she turned it all on me (literally every problem), which made me a bit upset, but I did my best to be calm about it. After talking for awhile, we decided that taking a break from each other would be the best course of action.\n\nWe took a break for a couple days, then came back together and apologized to each other for both of our actions. I assumed everything was settled, as I'm sure anyone would, but boy, was I wrong. \n\nA couple days later, she started being really distant and cold (colder than usual, anyway), so I brought it up to her, thinking that she might have something she wanted to talk about it. She was quick to dismiss my concerns, once again blaming her distance and coldness on me (I personally can't think of anything I was doing wrong at this time, unlike the time mentioned above where I was being rude back). I decided to let it go and thought that she might stop if I gave her some space, but she didn't. \n\nFor the remaining two months, she was honestly pretty mean and was very much not acting like herself. She stopped hanging out with me altogether (the last time was saw each other was Halloween), started talking about me behind my back (to our mutual friend, mind you), and was basically avoiding speaking with me as much as possible. To this day, I can't really wrap my head around what happened in those two months, as it was an extremely sudden change from her usual supportive and compassionate self.\n\nI ended up just not talking to her for a week, mainly to see if she needed space or would text me at all. She finally sent me a message on Saturday, and in all honesty, I was being pretty distant speaking to her. She was acting like herself in this conversation, but I certainly wasn't. \n\nThe next day, I apologized to her for being rude the other night, and she forgave me pretty quickly, which I honestly didn't expect her to do, given her behavior the last four months. We talked a bit, but then I brought up how I felt like she was treating me like a back up friend at the time. She quickly blamed it on me, saying I made her uncomfortable and that I was petty and rude, although she couldn't really give me any examples of those behaviors when I had asked. I honestly was having a hard time with the conversation (she didn't really give me a chance to speak and continued on about how I was the worst person ever for awhile), so I had called my mom to my room to talk with me. My mom made me block her, so it was an unannounced end to our friendship. \n\nWhat I'd really like to know is if I sound like the asshole here. I'm honestly unsure if I did cause every problem, and I'd like to see your guys' opinion on it. AITA? ",

I enjoy Zelda and other Mario games and usually I like them because they are a chance to bond with my siblings. However, my brother always complains about how I only choose Link when we play Smash Bros and all I do is Up+B (basically just makes Link swing his sword in a circle). Honestly I do this because again I am not good at video games and it's an effective enough move. We were playing just now and I was doing my thing and he screamed at me to stop it, that it was \"annoying\" and he quit the game and got up. I didn't think the situation warranted his attitude but he knows that I play the way that I play because it's not like I take the game seriously enough to be a more versatile player. It's a GAME and he made me feel bad for \"ruining\" one of the few things we usually both enjoy. AITA here? Should I put effort into changing my game technique to appease my brother? ",

All that needs to be said is that my grandmother died yesterday, and my sister has severe depression, was going to practice a presentation for the family but backed out last minute.my parents get upset saying why did we get together if you’re not going to present (this was a planned meeting and would have happened regardless, a fact which my sister did bring up) and my sister started to break down. Again, severe depression.\n\nSo it turns into a huge fiasco,mostly my parents saying “Calm down or we’ll punish you.” And that understandably making my sister more upset. It ends with my dad going up to bed and my mom saying “I just wanted this to be about you’re father, who puts so much into this family, to have some condolences for his mom who died yesterday.” That wasn’t exactly what she said, she tried to phrase it like we (my sister and I) purposely derailed to conversation to be about my sister, when it was very clear that that was anything but what my sister wanted.\n\nCue apparently asshole me, who says “well if you wanted us to ask dad about how he was feeling, and wanted us to console him, why did you decide to make the entire conversation about my sister?”\n\nI never got a response, so instead of relying on my mom to answer me, I’ve decided to ask all you lovely and callous Redditors, AITA for point out a double standard?",

I am a hobby photographer myself but do modeling jobs on TFP basis in my free time, especially underwater as I can hold my breath very long and you get some pretty cool pictures out of it.\n\nI am a full time student and work a student job as software developer on the side, this photography thing is my creative outlet and I don't want to pursue it professionally by any means.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got into contact with a couple of photographers but one in particular wanted to work with me and is organizing a workshop for underwater shoots to which he invited me.\n\nHe also worked with me on some sports shoots this month - but I have exam period coming up and told him so.\n\nHe keeps texting me about several things now, becoming more and more pushy and I think he is an okay guy, but he gets up in my business way too much (?) - for me it is a professional/hobby contact, and I expected him to only message me when there is something regarding a project or so. That is how other photographers handled it in the past with me.\n\nHe grabs up small details when we discuss the timeframes for some projects and wants to give me advice on how to optimize them - such as my studies/work:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- more efficient study techniques (my first exam is on Feb. 4th and I know how I need to study, no way in hell I test out new techniques now)\n\n\\- invite to sauna chill out session with other participants of the workshop after the workshop, I declined in the public group, then he texted me private how the only other girl might be uncomfortable if I don't join - I declined again sternly, with my study and work plans\n\n\\- messages me several times how joining this sports group and that group he organises would vastly improve my life (I am just not interested in the 50 hobbies this guy has and I have declined them nicely several times already)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not a very outgoing person, but I keep my promises (such as appointments like the workshop I agreed to join), but I make my limits very clear and communicate them as well, this is just becoming more and more stressful for me because internally I am questioning AITA here?? \n\nI have other options for my hobby but fuck, I feel like this could give me a bad rep in the photo community if I decline any further work with him and photography was one of the things that got me out of depression - I don't want to break this",

      "description": "I (32F) have been married to my wonderful husband (28M) for two years. Since I am slightly older and more established than him, I was able to amass a good savings before meeting him. Now, I didn’t go to college, but I have always been very money focused in my early twenties. I dated a few older men that I met at my local gym when I was younger. One of them bought me several gold necklaces and diamond earrings. It’s not that they hold too much sentimental value or anything, but they are literally valued in the thousands each. So, I really would have no issue with pawning or selling them if need be, but I would want to take my time and get the full value out of them. I see nothing wrong with holding onto these.\n\nHowever, last night I was irked when my husband was holding me while I was wearing a coat that one of my exes bought me. He was kissing my shoulder, rubbing my back and kissing my neck. I have no issue with him touching me, he is my husband obviously. It was more the memories that were stored in the coat itself, which is worth a few grand. I remembered the time I was bought for me and how it was the only thing I was wearing upon receiving it as a gift if you know what I mean. This has never come up in conversation and I don’t feel right in telling him because I have no intention to make him feel jealous for literal no reason.\n\nI understand that a lie of omission is still a lie. But he has never asked about it? Do you need to tell you significant other… *everything?* I mean, if he ever asked about the details of it, I would surely tell him the backstory and stop if he asked me to stop. This isn’t something that secretly makes me feel powerful or superior to him, it’s just a nice, designer jacket. But there was something about the way my husband was touching me that triggered this memory and made me feel, uncomfortable. Deep sigh. I really am feeling confused about this and am not looking for advice because I plan on keeping the jacket. But, I feel like if my husband ever found out how much it was worth, he would question where I got it from. Am I an asshole for not telling my husband that an ex gave me this expensive jacket?",

      "description": "First off, to provide some background,  My parents are both excessive drinkers and pass out before 8:30 pm each night, I have dealt with this since their divorce 7 years ago. They claim to try to stop their habits, but show no signs about it. I know that addiction is a very hard thing to shake and deal with, but it is becoming very harmful to their health, and it is very visible that they struggle to get through a night without a drink. I have struggled to deal with both of them when they drink, and since they drink so excessively per night that they specifically can go through a bottle of wine, and half a bottle of tequila, or in other circumstances a bottle of vodka. Their alcoholism has affected my school grades in the past when they took my notebook when I was studying for a final, and have done other actions to affect my schoolwork.  I have consistently avoided my parents when they are drunk for a number of years, but with their excessive drinking, it consistently puts me into these positions to the point where I can deal with people who are drunk very well. When both are sober my parents are very nice and well mannered people, but that is only during the day, when I am away at work or school. When I get mad at them, I often lose my temper and curse a lot towards them, I say a lot of horrible things to them and I feel terrible about it, and I have often used video games as a escape mechanism to avoid them, and that hampers my grades even further. I am curious whether I am a asshole or not for dealing with my parents daily drunkenness like this. I am fully aware that I could definitely handle them better when they are drunk , I am trying my hardest to be nice to them when they are drunk, but it just infuriates me to see them like that every night.   \n TLDR; My parents get drunk consistently and I yell at them when they are drunk because It makes me sad to see them that way.

      "description": "We're both 22, and been together 7 months and ever since I started bringing her around my group of friends she started to poke fun of one of my boys for being short. He's like 5'5 on a good day but we don't ever really make fun of him ever for it because its just a shitty thing to do. She did though and would say he's a midget in most countries, can he drive without a booster seat etc. All this stuff infront of our group of friends when we're out and at first we laughed of course but it got super weird when she kept saying shit like almost every time we hung out. He would usually just laugh along or just say you bitch jokingly but I could tell it got to him of course because it was getting to be too much. I spoke with her about this and she just said she was trying to be one of the boys and it was just banter, but I told her if its just banter why don't you joke about any of the other guys then? She just said short guys are more funny to poke at and shit like that, I told her straight up to not do this shit anymore after like 2-3 months of it. My short friend went away on a semester abroad and came back about a month ago so we all went out since we haven't seen him in a while and my GF came along and she starts with the short jokes, it gets so awkward because she's insulting his height for no reason. My other friends leave with my shorter one to hit up a different bar and I told my gf we should go to my place and talk.\n\nWhen we got to my place I was pretty annoyed she'd act this way still and told her how would she feel if I made fun of one of her chubby friends for being fat and she said its not the same thing and other bs. She had a smirk on her face the whole time and that pissed me off so I just told her its done and to gtfo out of my place and to take her things. She started yelling and shit and said how could I break up with her over jokes with about a friend and I didn't want to hear it. She called me a dumbass douche and a variety of other insults.\n\nAITA For this?",

      "description": "I know the title sounds cringeworthy but here’s the situation.. (also on mobile so please excuse formatting)\n\nOn Saturday evening my friend who is in a wheelchair and I went to dinner.\n\nShe often needs help with some simple motor functions (taking off a jacket, opening a bottle of water, sometimes drops utensils/items, etc.). We’re going about our business and I’m helping her as usual.\n\nI noticed a man watching us from across the restaurant but didn’t think much of it because, unfortunately, people tend to stare when we are out together.\n\nWe pay and leave and get about a block down the street when I hear someone running behind us. I turn around and it’s the man from the restaurant. \n\n\n\nHe had to have been listening to our conversations in the restaurant because we live in a non-English speaking country, but she and I spoke English at dinner. \nSo he stopped me and began speaking English, saying how ‘he had never seen someone with so much Karissma and he can tell I have a good heart by how I helped her’ and then handed me his phone number on a small strip of paper.\n\nI shake his hand, thank him and continue walking. \n\nWhen we get far enough away she and I begin to talk about the experience..\n\nWhen he spoke to us he never made a point to say hello to her or even look at her except to gesture in her direction while complimenting my “good heart”.. my friend and I both noticed this and it was the biggest topic of our conversation. He made her feel like a charity case and like I’m “such a great person” for being friends with someone in a chair. I fully agree with her that his actions were less than thought out and he definitely could have said something with similar context without making her sound like a “sad person with a hot friend” (her words).\n\nI have a boyfriend and never intended to text the number but my friend and my mother both think I should use this as an opportunity to “enlighten” him on how he could have gone about the situation differently.\n\nMy friend (and mom) thinks I should explain how it was rude for him to highlight aspects of my personality that include being friends with someone simply because they have a disability and how he could have just told me he thought I was attractive and saved her the embarrassment of being ignored and treated like a charity case. My boyfriend agrees that it was messed up for him not to acknowledge her but doesn’t think I should try to teach him a lesson. I do not want to text him either.\n\n\n\nI don’t REALLY feel like it’s my place to tell a stranger that they’re wrong for how they decided to approach a situation, and I don’t really want him having my contact information but my friend and my mom are pressuring me to say something..\n\nOn top of that, since we don’t live in an English speaking country, I feel like he might not have fully understood that what he was saying could have been perceived as rude and aside from ignoring her I think he was just trying to give me a genuine compliment..\n\nI think I would be the asshole if I text him just to say “I have a boyfriend and you made my friend feel bad” (loosely worded) but my friend thinks I will be the asshole if I don’t say anything at all...\n\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I text him JUST to explain how he should have said something different?",

      "description": "WIBTA?  Without getting into a super long story:  My mom got pregnant when she was 18, I was born, mom and biological dad never got married, I was adopted by my stepdad when I was 18 months.  I had a great mom and dad growing up, never had anything to do with my biological dad.  As I got older (26) I wanted to understand my history a little better, found my biological dad in Colorado, and went and met him for all of about an hour. Nothing special occurred during that hour, but it was good to get the meet and greet out of the way.  As part of my research, I discovered that I have 3 half siblings via my biological dad (all are now adults). My biological dad also told me that his wife knew about me and that it was not a big deal (which I kind of agree with, this was before him and his wife got together, 26+ years ago, etc.). Several years later I reached out to him explaining that I would like to communicate with his adult kids and kind of just let them know about me and give them a \"hey I exist, if you're ever curious about me feel free to reach out\" note.  He got super weird and shut that down very quickly.   Bottom line, I have the names and addresses of at least 2 of my half-siblings. They are adults.  WIBTA for bypassing biological dad and just sending them letters? I know I wouldn't think its a big deal if I received something like that (I would be intrigued and want to know more about my half-sibling), but maybe I just can't see it from their perspective.   If this helps, it isn't like I'm a creepy guy.  I am a successful attorney, married with two kids, served in the military, love dogs, hate communism, play the guitar; you know all the good red-blooded American stuff. ",

      "description": "Been married six years. Have one son together. Wife has a childhood friend/\"brother\" who was abandoned by his family after coming out and my wife's family took him in when he was 13 or so. He lived with them until he turned 20 and lives on his own now. My wife considers him her brother. Very, very close. I met him and he's an alright guy. I have no opinion either way, they don't hang out often anymore so obviously I don't get an opportunity to hang out either.\n\nWhen my wife and him were in their late teens, he expressed interest in having a child via surrogacy. My wife volunteered that when she's 30 she'll do it for him. This was never mentioned to me during our marriage and I only found out two weeks ago. She just turned 30. When she explained it to me I thought it was an empty or idle talking shop kind of thing but she insists she's very serious.\n\nShe asked my opinion and I'm 10000% against it. We're a family now, and this would be a major family decision. She ignores me and continue talking to him about planning it, looking up clinics, doing research, etc. I've endured a week of this, and it feels like a knife in the back constantly throughout every day.\n\nI'm thinking of threatening divorce over this. I don't want to get divorced, but I'm hoping it'll do the trick and she'll rethink things. WIBTA?",

Once I realized it was the same person every day, if her food was sitting there a long time and I was waiting, I would take it out, heat up my food (about 2 minutes for reference), and then put hers back in when I was done. \n\nShe's come in a few times this week while I was using the microwave in her absence and seems annoyed that I moved her stuff. I'm not sure if her food is something that needs to be cooked in stages, which is possible, but I just want to eat before we open and tracking her down every time to ask her to move her food for me seems redundant and also somewhat rude. \n\nAITA for moving her food to cook my own?",

He is a philosophy student and LOVES debating. I think he also has a bit of a superiority complex. Alex talks constantly about the immorality of eating meat. He brings it up daily. He has posters of animated cows looking sadly at steaks hung in his bedroom. He has said, and I am directly quoting, that “Eating meat is the same thing as defending slavery because you don’t think the lives of black people have meaning.” He has said “Eating meat is the equivalent of joining and supporting ISIS.” \n\nHe is not joking. \n\nHe calls anyone who eats meat “carnist pigs”. He says this to their face while they eat. He believes it is his life’s mission to educate people out of eating meat and awaken them to veganism. If we are in line together in a restaurant and someone else is ordering, he’ll judge and mock them (out loud) for ordering anything meat or dairy related. He’ll constantly say “Hey, check this out!” and show you whatever vegan food he is eating, going into detail about the ingredients and where they come from. By constantly, I mean nearly every time he eats a meal, he does this. He’ll come into your room to show you his plate. \n\nNow, I don’t disagree with him morally. We’ve had dozens of debates on the subject philosophically and I concede on many of his points. There’s no doubt that eating meat is a morally fraut issue. Where I take issue is that he deliberately tries to make people feel guilty for their dietary choices. I have started eating out, or at other people’s houses. I’ve been packing my lunches in secret because I just don’t want to deal with him. \n\nIf anyone tells Alex to piss off, he responds with “Cool, have fun murdering!” or “Enjoy your death sandwich!” \n\nSo flash forward to today. We’re in line at a burrito restaurant. I’m ordering my usual thing, and he makes a comment about how I could fill my tortilla with veggies rather than support systemic murder. Similar to the crap he always says. \n\nI look him dead in the eye and tell him, “Man, if you don’t stop doing this shit when we eat, I’m not going to eat with you anymore. The way you behave is inappropriate and hostile and frankly, I’m not interested in being friends with someone who makes it their mission to humiliate people like this.” \n\nHe laughed and told me to chill. I said I was dead serious. He hasn’t spoken to me since. Not sure the best thing to do here since our lease doesn’t expire until May. I’d love to be able to eat a pepperoni pizza in my home without being called a terrorist.\n\nSo, AITA? How should I go about navigating this? ",

      "description": "Bad title, but hear me out. \n\nI'm a high school AP Euro teacher. I have a student, let's call him Josh. Josh is basically the 'bright but also kinda arrogant and disruptive' type, if you know what I mean. At least from what I've heard from other teachers and seen in class, he's considered the school's 'resident intellectual', so to speak: national-level debater, president of philosophy and politics club, writes a daily column in the school newspaper that's about Stoic philosophy- which is surprisingly popular, etc. You get the idea. On the arrogant and disruptive side, he's also loud, assertive, tends to get into shouting matches across the room about politics, and sometimes just mocks people for their ideas. He's also, from what I can gather, popular even though he doesn't play any sports or anything. So he uses this again to portray himself as being better than others. \n\nAnd there's another student in my class, let's call him Logan. Logan is extremely conservative. There's a trans guy in my class, let's call him Sam. Now, everybody respects Sam's pronouns except Logan. Logan constantly calls him 'her' even though I told him to cut it off multiple times. I tried punishing him- nothing major, some lunch detentions- but I was vetoed.\n\nSam's very shy, so he didn't do anything about Logan. But of course, Josh smelled a debate, so he started debating Logan today before class. I, multiple times, tried to get them to calm down, and finally they did. \n\nSince today is a block day (two hours of class back to back), I give them a 5 minute break. During the break they continued arguing. Josh finished making his points about trans rights and had just moved on to insulting Logan himself- and it was incredibly brutal. He attacked Logan's appearance, his weight, everything. I forced Josh to stop, and I was contemplating punishing him. But in the moment, I kind of felt like Logan deserved it, since he was humiliating Sam for quite a while, and I haven't been able to do anything about it. And what Josh did was kind of cruel, but I felt it was kind of justified. \n\nNow, thinking about it now, I'm starting to feel a little bit guilty for not punishing Josh. No matter how bad Logan was, Josh just went all out attacking Logan. And I feel bad for letting him get away with that.\n\nAs you can see, I'm torn. So, aita?\n\n",

      "description": "So we live in New England. It's not warm right now. Highs around 40, lows around 0. \n\nLast night my girlfriend wakes me up because she thinks she can see her breath it's so cold. I just let my bare shoulder sneak out from under the cover to feel the air and WOAH she was right. It was fucking freezing in there. \n\nWhile I am super uncomfortable, my main concern is the integrity of our plumbing. I DO NOT want our pipes to freeze and/or burst, so I tiptoe down the hallway to the thermostat to see that the heat on the second floor (where all the bedrooms are) is off completely. I assume this was slan accident and turn it up to 62. Pretty conservative if you ask me. \n\nSo anyway, I wake up to a string of text messages to the roommate group chat. The roommate who shall not be named apparently heard me get up and turn the heat on. He sends two side by side pictures, one of the thermostat set to 62, and one of another thermometer in his room reading 64. \n\nHe says - and this is text messages copy pasta - \"Well it’s at 62 and my rooms at 64 so there something wrong with my heat.\" He goes on to basically insist that until the landlord fixes the heat on the second floor, it's staying off. \n\nI tell him it's not broken. That two thermostats in two different rooms would often read a degree or two different. He says he can tell the difference and it makes him uncomfortable - he can't sleep.\n\nI tell him I think he's full of shit. That nobody can tell the difference between 62 and 64. But I also say he can have it his way and if the pipes burst it's 100% on him. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

I booked the flights to Tokyo with a stop in New Delhi.\n\nAfter we landed in New Delhi, I realized I couldn't find my passport. They would not let me board the Tokyo plane without it. She couldn't go without me because the hotel reservations were in my name. Neither of us could exit the airport because we had no Indian visas. We told the police about the situation and, long story short, they got us on a flight back to our home country.\n\nSo that is how I ruined my girlfriend's birthday. We have nothing to do for the next two weeks.\n\nNow she is angry at me. In my defence:\n\n* I did not lose the passport on purpose.\n* I have done everything I can to make the situation better. I even offered to book a last-minute trip somewhere closer where I could go with my ID card. Switzerland? Italy? Turkey? Nope, she's \"too depressed now\" to enjoy those places after what happened. (Not trying to disrespect her feelings with that. It's just what she said.)\n* I paid for the flights and the hotels. While she is going to have a disappointing birthday, I've also said goodbye to 3000 €. Yeah it sucks for both of us but don't be mad at me.\n\nStill, I feel like I fucked up. I think losing it was ultimately my fault. If I wasn't so careless, she would be having the best birthday of her life right now.\n\nAm I the asshole? And if I am, then what can I do now to not be the asshole?\n\nTL;DR I promised GF a trip for her birthday, I lost my passport on the plane, and we got sent back. She's upset. I'm trying to make the situation better but it was probably my fault.",

It’s a pretty big strip mall and we have a lot of places to eat located here, so I always go to one specific place to grab a snack in the morning. On my way to the office I work at, which is all the way across the strip mall, I see an SUV coming at full speed towards the cross walk I’m supposed to walk across. I stop and wait for this guy to speed by when he ABRUPTLY stops, almost running me over. He then makes a motion through the windshield telling me to cross, so I cross. \n\nSo, this guy apparently has a megaphone in his car like the one cops have where they can tell people things. Through his megaphone he says to me “you’re welcome” and “at least say thank you” and says something else that I couldn’t understand. Now I ALWAYSSSSS say thank you when someone lets me cross, but this dude almost ran me over and was going about 20 MPH inside of a strip mall, so I’m not going to say thank you to you.

      "description": "On mobile, throwaway account, but English is my first language.\n\nSo I woke up this morning and grabbed my phone to stall away time on my day off. After about 10 minutes I notice that my Note 5 is connected to the internet but is telling me \"internet may not be available.\" Meaning I may as well not be connected to the internet.\n\nI don't usually get this error so I look it up, hoping to see if there is a simple solution. Fortunately I'm in luck and the general consensus is to restart the router. So I get dressed and find Mom is already awake and watching TV. So I let her know what's wrong and ask if I can reset the router.\n\nShe said dad was asleep so not to be loud. (I talk loudly so i quieted down) She also tell me to turn off my phone and turn it back on and see if that would work. I let her know what I've looked up online but she wouldn't budge, so I said fine and went back to my room to reset my phone. That way if it worked I could just continue on. Lo and behold after a couple of minutes it didnt work. So I come back out and tell her so.\n\nShe asks for my phone saying she's gonna try a couple more things, (note, she's not the most tech literate person) and I comply. I mention the router solution again and ask what's she's doing. Turns out she's turning off my phone, and turning it back on. At this point we are both having attitude with each other. (we are both stubborn so it happens whenever we disagree) I again bring up resetting the router and she told me no.\n\nI ask why and she says because I said so. What a wonderful reason. At this point I realise she has no idea how to fix the problem and wont bother listening to me. So search the router for the reset button and find it's one of those hidden ones you need a paperclip for. That way at least one of us is going to get something done. It's not like she's using it. Thinking at least All the while she's threatening me not to or she will keep the router off. (A pretty empty threat because for me it already is) \n\nI find a pencil that will reach the button and she finally gives me a good reason not to. Because she is watching a show on the android box we use instead of cable. Finally I reason. I ask if she can pause it, and note the time. and she says it's live and can't be paused. I never bothered looking at the show so I just took her word for it.\n\nI stepped away from the router and sat down. She suggested I make myself breakfast on coffee while I wait for her to fix my phone (forgot she still had it, doing God knows what)\n\nAs i was making my coffee I let her know that after the show ends I would reset the router. She gave the the steriotypical say that again. We had a short back and forth before dad woke up. Both of us tried explaining what happened. Fortunately she was the first to give him attitude so he took my side.\n\nMom went to the bathroom, so I explained the situation in full to Dad. We both agreed to reset the router after Mom's show was over. After she came back Dad informed her and we all waited for the show to end. \n\nDad reset it as I was eating breakfast. As soon as it went back up my internet started working again. I let them know and finished up my meal. I took my coffee into my room to finish it, but as I got to the hall, Mom spoke up.\n\n\"Where is my thank you?\"\n\n... I was stunned...\n\nI told her \"All you did was reset my phone a couple of times and I looked up the answer. Dad and I were the only ones to do anything here, so... I'm sorry.\"\n\nShe was shocked and was about to chew me out, but Dad stopped her by saying she walked into, and deserved it. With that I went into my room and finished up my coffee. I finished it and went to the kitchen to put it into the sink. They were talking about the incident. Regretfully I rubbed it in a bit on my way back, then queue 5 to 10 minutes of standing there listening as they tell me everything wrong about asking why.\n\nLong story short they said I'm an immature baby (not an exaguration, Dad said that 5 or 6 times... I'm 20 years old) compared to them and as a result I have no say and should do what they say with no question because I'm in the shit end of a dictatorship and I couldn't possibly help them.\n\nAll I ask for is a good reason and that \"because I said so\" isn't a good reason, and if I was told from the beginning that she's using the internet I would have hapily waited (which I did do after the bullshit)\n\nThey just kept saying I don't get a reason because \"We don't give a shit\" and i dont deserve a reason. Because I'm an immature baby, Dad gave the example of taking milk away from a baby so it doesn't overeat and vomit. And how you can't explain to the baby what's going on.\n\nAm I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "When my spring break came around my dad asked me to clean up some branches from the apple trees he pruned on the Sunday before my break started. We agreed that I would have it done by the end of the week. He pruned five trees and it left maybe 4 hours work. I had been slowly working on it because I wanted to enjoy my break and had homework from classes over spring break.\nCome Tuesday and I have half the work done but didn't have time to work on it Wednesday because I had to go work on a robot all day for a robotics club I am in we worked from about 1 to 9:30. As I had not originally planned to meet with my club I had a raid in destiny 2 planned with my friend for that day which i then pushed back to Thursday. \nOn Thursday I had done some work on the branches having moved about 1/3 of the remaining pile but did not do a lot as I was exhausted from working Wednesday and wanted to help my friend. I have another robotics meeting that night (which was planned) I get a text from my dad saying \"thanks for the minimal effort on the branches.\"\nOn Friday morning I feed my dogs and see that the pile of branches has been moved already and my dad has been mad at me since Thursday night. I was not able to work on them Friday (today) because of rain. So Reddit AITA for not doing all of the work by Thursday? ",

The next 2 weeks also happens to be spring break where my girlfriend and I go to school. I recently was texting a friend from home and he told me how excited he was to be going on a trip to a legal state with my girlfriend and how much they are gonna smoke and bring back home. This obviously caught be my surprise because my girlfriend had made no mention of booking a flight or even spending time away from home for break. We’ve been together for several years and I trust her but I still think that if the tables were turned I would at least run the idea by her before I decided to make such a major decision, especially if it were with another girl other than my GF.

Halfway through my instructor talking about philosophy stuff, the guy in front of me starts playing with his hair. \n\nNow I’m not talking just scratching it and stopping, he is twirling his fingers in it over and over again. Not on the side, but on the top of his head. He twirls a strand of hair and then lets it fall, and then does the same thing again and again. If that isn’t enough, he is stretching out his arms to do this as well, so anything I wanted to see on the board is now difficult to read. \n\nI plan to switch seats so I don’t have to be distracted by that, but I just wanted to know if my initial annoyance was stupid or not. \n\nTLDR: The guy sitting in front of me in class twirls his hair constantly making it difficult to read the board and pay attention to my professor, AITA for being annoyed by this?

So yes, it is my 20th birthday but I don't find it special especially because I have an exam in 2 days and lots to study. One more thing before I get to situation is that I am totally okay with someone celebrating their birthday in any way they like.

That was something they did in past years. This year I stated clearly to everyone that I don't need gifts and presents. I have everything I need in life so them buying more of stuff is just not needed. It is enough and it means to me that they wanted to but really I am fine. We can all have a nice dinner together and that is totally okay. \n\nEveryone disagreed and pretty much call me an asshole because I didn't let them buy me anything. They say I am breaking tradition of birthdays but honestly I don't care about tradition of birthdays. Not everyone is same. I am a simple man so a minimum is enough. Some of them are maybe little mad on me so I feel little bit shitty because of it. Idk honestly I feel there is no need to spend money on something I already have.

We already had table and chairs! Perfectly coordinating table and chairs. She bought those, and wanted me to put my table and chairs in storage(mind you, don't even have a storage unit) she ended up relenting, sold the new table and chairs. She acted like it was this humongous compromise, when really I feel like she shouldn't of bought them in the first place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSituation 2: New roommate has moved in, and recently a similar situation to the one above happened. We have a perfectly good shower head. It's actually only a couple years old, as it was brand new when I moved in. Well when I was on a trip, roommate decided she didn't like that shower head, and bought and attached a water filtering shower head. I was going to let this slide, whatever, I liked the other one better, but it's not like I have to put it in storage, and she is hopefully only gonna stay for a couple more months. Well the new shower head's like range is too wide, so I can't get clean. I mention this to roommate she says she'll fix it, but didn't. So next time I take a shower, I put the original shower head and(the took it off after I was done, but got distracted so never put hers back on) she texts me about it today, seeming pretty livid about her shower head not being on, and she doesn't want \"toxins\" from the water. I basically tell her to fix the new one, and it's a favor anyways, because I liked the original detachable shower head, but could maybe deal with the new one if, she fixed it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being an asshole here? I don't mind roommates bringing their new things, and life into the apartment, but like if I already have something that is a perfectly working...whatever, I don't think it's cool to change it up on me.

      "description": "Information: I'm 17, my parents are divorced and there was a time in my life where my dad wouldn't bother talking to me at all. \nHe basically just ignored me for 4 years straight (because of his new wife back then who was just a real asshole who destroyed our whole family) , but since last year, he's trying to get in contact with me again. Like, we text each other frequently, but nothing more. \nHe always tells me that he's going to visit me some day, and whenever that day comes, he says he can't come and makes a new date. This has happened like 4-5 times now.\nNow, what I really wanted to talk about. My birthday was last month and he called me and said he was going to come and even give me a present. Of course I was happy, because I haven't seen him in a long time.\nBut then he cancelled the next date, and the one after as well. He then called my grandma (his mother, whom I have a very good relationship with, I also visit her twice a week) to tell her that he is not going to visit and he'll send that present instead. That was two weeks ago. He didn't tell ME, he told my grandma. I haven't heard of him since my birthday.\nNow it's December and I wonder if my present will ever arrive. I don't care if I get a present, but I would be really happy about a card as well, that's all I want. I don't expect him to buy me big things but just a little reminder that he thinks about me would be nice, right?\n\nAm I an asshole for thinking that? Because to me it seems like I am for expecting my dad to send me something for my birthday.\n\nSorry for the huge text. 😅",

      "description": "So I met this guy, who I will call Oliver (because it was apparently the most popular baby name in 2018 according to Google), on badoo. For those who don't know what badoo is, it's like Tinder except even more shady and sketchy and filled with weirdos. Anyway, I had connected with this dude like a full year before we started talking, and when we did I realised he lived an hour away in a town that I was visiting weekly for medical reasons. So we met up one time, I had an insane hormonal lust for him that quickly fizzled out, leaving me with the honest reality of this dude.\n\nTo say he had anger problems would be an understatement. He threw tantrums. He was in his 20's, mind you. His rage was so uncontrollable that he would break all of his housemate's stuff, scream at people and threaten them. He didn't seem above hitting women, which was unsettling to me because where I live that's a VERY common moral - even the biggest douchebags I know are heavy on \"Lay a hand on a woman and I'll break your neck.\" He did shout at me once and shattered his expensive, government-paid-for (it was for a course he was doing) laptop, causing me to have the worst panic attack of my life (that's saying something because I have panic disorder). Luckily other people were there, and the guy confronted him while the girl held me and asked me about My Oasis (app that really helps with my anxiety I recommend 10/10). He also did things like getting angry at me for not being in the mood for sex - the day after we ran into the man who molested me when I was 13 and I had explained to him the situation so he KNEW. So you get it, not an ideal companion, very scary and explosive.\n\nThing is, I'm pretty good at confrontation and wasn't about to lie and tell him his behaviour was okay. I was blatant with him and made sure he knew that it was absolutely unacceptable, he is responsible for his actions, and he needs to either get his shit together or get out. You'd expect someone like that to take it very poorly, but he actually listened to me and agreed. When he was calm, he seemed pretty grown up and able to acknowledge that he was being a little shit. I had started teaching him some of the strategies that I've learned for my mental health problems that result in intense, uncontrollable emotion, but ultimately the getting-angry-about-the-sex thing was my final straw. That crosses a boundary for me. I hadn't seen much improvement, he was still acting salty over things like the court ordering him to pay for what he'd broken in his house mate's house, so I cut ties. Not at blocking level, just stopped talking and explained why when he eventually asked, and that I didn't want to talk anymore.\n\nI should also note WHY I was hanging out with this dude at all - he wasn't all bad, I've just highlighted the bad to explain why we stopped talking in the first place. He was actually a very, very funny guy and was shockingly intelligent. I don't want to end up on iamverysmart, but a lot of my friend group in my hometown dropped out of school to pursue... Well, mostly drugs. I was the only one in that particular group to graduate high school (I did have my school friends but I didn't really see them outside of school) and progress to further study, so I was used to people around me being a little less educated - not necessarily less intelligent, just less knowledgeable about academics. But somehow this guy knew things that blew my mind. Like, I learned a few random tidbits and facts from him that were pretty cool. He was artsy and compassionate (when not violent), and I saw potential in him. Even so - if I spent a few days with him I felt utterly drained,  mentally and in turn physically. That was even if he didn't get angry over something.\n\nSo anyway, few weeks later he messages me and says he's going to get professional help. I think that's pretty lit. Then we don't talk for a few months aside from a new years greeting. I notice he got a girlfriend and then apparently lost her like immediately, so idk what that was about.\n\nMeanwhile, I graduated high school, moved 3 hours away and started university. Suddenly, there were all of these people who brought substance to my life. People like me, rather than people who tease me for refusing a bong and just talk about drugs nonstop. People who made me laugh and looked me in the eyes and listened when I talked to them, people who had interesting things to say and stuff that we could actually DO. People who I feel safe with and understood and engaged by, who make me feel energised rather than drained. Suddenly I didn't feel a need for most of my hometown friends, who didn't really seem to miss me as much as my uni friends did when I visited home, and they just kinda faded from memory.\n\nReenter Oliver. He tells me that he's almost finished his program for managing his anger. I said that it was good, and I was glad - because it's true, we talked about it for a minute. But my subpar replies shined through and then he said \"You don't want to talk to me because you're still hurt because of me being an asshole, and I'm sorry.\" I told him that it was more because I'm in uni now (he had gotten extremely angry when he found out I was going to uni a few months before, funnily enough) and I'm suddenly surrounded by dozens of people who I have to build new relationships with, who I also have a lot more in common with than anyone back home. He just said \"Ok\"\n\nI appreciate the effort that he went to, but also I just know that there's nothing I could really gain from talking to him. I immediately feel tired whenever he messages me and I know that we won't go far beyond small talk, which I honestly don't have time for at this point in my life. I feel like my relationship quota is very full; I can barely keep up with everyone already IN my life currently. I feel content with my circles, I don't feel the need for anyone else, I'd rather focus on the people right in front of me. But should I be giving him more time because he DID try SO hard to be a better person? Am I being unfair to him by not even giving him another chance?",

We had a lot in common and were in the same theater company. But, over the years, she has become more and more creepy and inappropriate with me and some of other mutual friends. \n\nParticularly with one of our mutual friends, Ariel. S once asked out Ariel, Ariel said no. But, S is really creepy with Ariel and once tried to take her shirt off in front of her, but I stopped her after Ariel said no. \n\nShe also once gave a lap dance to two guys without asking first, with one of their girlfriends standing right there, during a karaoke night. I apologized to both of them. Luckily, they didn’t seem to care. \n\n\nWhen I addressed some of this behavior with her, she proceeded to use her Autism as an excuse. She has shown no signs of improvement or self-reflection. \n\nRecently, I’ve been trying to disassociate with her, until I hear news from her and reliable sources, that she is getting a fictional TV show that is starring her as a teenage girl on the Autistic spectrum. So, now, I’m trying to get closer with her, again, so, I can have this great connection in the entertainment industry ( I want to be a writer/actor, if anyone cared). Although, I am positive, she’s going to abuse her power as a celebrity. \n",

      "description": "When we moved into our current house we were both working and able to live some what comfortably.  She became pregnant with our first.  During her pregnancy she decided that she wanted to leave her job and be a stay a home mom.  It definitely made finances tighter, but we managed.  \n\nOur daughter is two now.  Lately my wife has been talking about wanting to return to school.  She wants to take business administration.   When I asked specifically what she wanted to do with the degree she had no set idea and just said that it would open a lot more doors for her if she returns to work.  \n\nI’ve tried involving her in our finances.  She really just seems purposely blind to how tight things are on one income alone.  There have been multiple times that she’s bought things that we can’t really afford.  I just don’t see how we could make her going back to school work.  Tuition and books aren’t cheap on top of the day care we would have to get for our daughter.  \n\nThere’s another reason why I’m unsupportive of her going back to school.   Early on in our marriage she went to college for Vet tech and was adamant that this was the path for her.  Two months in and she decided that it wasn’t for her after all and just quit.  It was a state school, but still quite an expensive investment not to get any return on.  I’d be more conflicted if she had an actual plan with what she wanted to do with a business degree, but just opening doors doesn’t seem like a good enough reason to me.  Open doors don’t guarantee anything, it’s rough out there employment wise.  \n\nI want to tell her that down the line when we’re more secure would be the time to return to school, but right now it’s just not do able.  \n ",

      "description": "TL;DR gf of 3 years left me claiming I neglected her, but I think I was doing my best as a man with the presented situation, please help me realize what possibly went wrong, so I can finally set my emotions straight. I have ups and downs one day I think IATA and one day SITA. \n\nApologies for long post but I have to get this off my chest. 3 years ago I met a very nice girl. She was absolutely gorgeous, and I was a \"player\" in school. Even though I wouldn't date I'd have alot of girls orbiting around me. However when I met (let's call her A) A, I was succumbed to her looks and personality. I would date because I was so blue pilled and wanted a good girl. Seeing as everyone in school was just cheating and getting on and off relationship, that was smth I didn't want.\n\nFast forward me and her met while she was going thru a breakup with her ex. We hit it off really well, she was very shy, insecure, claimed to be depressed and have anxiety. Was not doing well in school at all. Was barely speaking to her family and lived in a shitty basement with her mom.\n\nBeing such a hopeless romantic I quickly fell for the sweet romantic gestures. Brainwashed even, I couldn't believe I found \"the one\" and started to develop feeling very rapidly. She would visit me at work, we would spend every minute of the day together. Meet up between classes. After school, before school. Everything together. She wrote me and made me art's and crafts very often. Some of the most sweetest and seemingly genuine words I've ever read. She made me feel so high, and in return all I wanted to do was \"save\" her.\n\nShe told me very early before we even made it official that she was abused as a child and abused as a teen by other guys. And told me her ex manipulated her and basically considered his manipulation to mean \"rape\"... Even though I had promised myself that my first time would be with a virgin, she somehow convinced me that since it was never her Choice in the past, that she was still a virgin. And I never countered that, always said yes she is and always considered it both our first time.\n\nWe had some ups and downs but never on and off relationship, every argument somehow we would find our way back by the end of the day. But as I now realize I mostly apologized. Even when she would say sorry, then I would feel sorry for making her feel sad so I'd end up telling her I'm sorry and that whatever happened wasn't that big of a deal.\n\nI'm school I was somewhat popular and cool with teachers so I put in good words for her with them so they would help her out. I would sit for hours helping her with homework so she wouldn't fail classes. I'd bring her food almost everyday to class. Countless sleepless nights that I would spend reading about depression and how to help someone dealing with it. I became so addicted to helping her that I totally forgot about myself and my hobbies. I just wanted her to be happy. And it seemed like we were. Our relationship seemed out of this world. We did everything together and never had any major setbacks. Never any lack of trust, always super romantic. I came from a European traditional family and they never liked my girlfriend because they said she was fake and was using me and distracting me from achieving my goals. But I would always fight with my parents and family telling them they just didn't get it.\n\nI always sided with her. Always gave her everything I could possibly give. Time, energy, money, trips, I lied to family for her, roke trust with parents, for her. Distanced myself from any social network I had, even though my guy friends always had my back, I distanced myself because I was spending every waking moment with her. And I didn't care. I never regretted it while it lasted. But it took a toll on me. I wasn't a starlight A student anymore, I was happy with less, satisfied with mediocre goals. And gave all my energy and positivity to her. But it never meant shit. Even though I would motivate her, it wouldn't last long.\n\nShe never kept her promises and I stupidly never broke it off. In school I used to tell her if she didn't graduate with good scores that as couldn't last as I wanted a woman who had high goals and wanted smth out of her life. She would always promise me that for me she'd work very hard. She'd promise me that me giving her advice and wanting the best for her was the only thing she needed. I taught this girl how to drive, how to manage the little money she'd work for. Her mom was a bum, hooking up wit a married guy, up to her throat in debts and never amiunted to anything besides drama. But still I'd tell my then girlfriend that she should fix her relationship with her mom, as at one point they were not in speaking terms.\n\nI'd put my dignity in line vouching for this girl and she'd always let me down but still is juetfy it with \"she's depressed she can't do it\", but all she ever did was wallow in self pity and whenever k wasn't happy with her actions she'd say I'm sorry I'm not good enough (total. Psychological manipulation, so I'd feel bad and tell her it was okay) it got to a point that I didn't care anymore how her life turned out and I knew is be successful and make smth out of myself and take care of the both of us, as long as she was by my side and happy that's all I wanted. We dated for almost 2 years and she got pregnant at 18 and I 18 also. It was a whole mess and I asked her to abort but after countless back and forth we kept the baby. It wzs such a life changing decision but she gave me an ultimatum either abort and we break up, or keep the baby and make it work. I obviously chose her.\n\nMy family. Didn't take it well at all and after alot of drama and as it was all said and done they accepted the fact and were nothing but supportive towards the baby, but never towards her. And I couldn't understand why. To me she was such a loving sweet girl, and all I would hope for was that her depression would go away and she'd finally see some good days in her life. That's all I wanted for her to be happy because her past was so abusive and touching that I felt as if I was obligated to make her happy. And she'd return me the goods at some point when she wasn't depressed anymore.\n\nAs the baby was approaching to being born I made a critical decision to graduate HS early and start working to save up. And so I did. Saved alot of money and then we needed a place to stay because staying with either family was too much stress and drama. She'd always wanted to move out of state and I made it happen after one day she cried hysterically and told me she wanted to escape. So I got an apartment far away like 7 hours from home in a different state and started to furnish it and work alot. She then when it was time to come over with the baby tried to commit suicide. I drove back home crying all the way because I felt so guoty that I wasn't there with her to \"save\". Anyways this past and after alot of \"idk, idk, idk\" from her she finally came. She gave me so much shit even though originally it was her idea to move out.\n\nWhen we started to live together it juet got worse. All she did was take care of the baby and watch TV all day. I was starting to feel like a plow horse. And all the money I was making (keep in mind I'm 19) was going to bills and stuff for her. I never bought anything for myself. I worked the night shift and barely slept during the day because I would spend hours on taking her out for dinners or lunch or to go shopping, just so she wouldn't feel stuck at home. I tried my hardest to give her exciting dates and stuff to do. I even left the only. Thing keeping me sane, powerlfiting, and stopped training because I didn't want her to feel like I was working on my hobbies while she was at home.\n\nI tried to motivate her to get a job and she always said she would but somehow never did. I'd come home and she'd barely ever cook, barely ever clean. I'd end up doing house chores and didn't even feel taken advantage off because I felt bad she was home all day. So. I'd come home and clean the apartment. But after a. Few months I couldn't take it anymore and arguments started. I'd come home frustrated to find it a mess and we'd fight and she'd apologize sometimes in the begging but then later she started to close off and not say anything and just stay sitting down until I'd shut up. I started to get thoughts of breaking up and I think she could feel it. It talk to a very trusted coworker that I wasn't happy. But I never thought of actually leaving her. I always thought my unhappiness was smth wrong with me and if only I did more then she'd be happy too and start helping me therfore our relationship would be back to normal. But it never worked no matter how many sacrifices I'd make.\n\nThe final days came when my grandma got sick and I went to see her back to my home country. Before going I gave my gf a few hundred dollars to spend with friends as I was taking her to her mom's place to spend time and relax there while I was gone. Meanwhile at a club a guy got her social media and hit her up. And she told me about it and I was pissed saying why would he hit her up, as in why would she even give him a contact info? She then took this as a chance to tell me that I have no right to say this because she's never cheated before, and continued to say she thinks it's best we take a break. I didn't think much of it because this low had happened before but we always found our way back. A cpule days later she told me it was best if we break up officially and just live together for the sake of our daughter. I couldn't believe it and still didn't take it 100% seriously. While I came back from vacation I went to go see her and drive back home. With her. She told me she wanted to stay at her mom's a bit longer, with which I furiously disagreed saying that we don't have time for this and we need",

      "description": "My Mom and I have been close forever.  She met my \"stepdad\" when I was very young, and he is a great father. Their 20 year anniversary is approaching, and due to my moms financial circumstances etc. They are only now marrying. I love them both very much and I'm glad to be there. \n\nMy mom is VERY sentimental. Her favorite song is \"Hallelujah\" by  Leonard Cohen. My mom has struggled with severe depression through my (and her) whole life, and on several occasions in my adult life, she has been on the brink of suicide. I drive down to visit her and bring my guitar,  and every time I play her favorite song it brings her back to reality. \n\nShe is planning her wedding as a surprise for my dad, and she asked me specifically to play this song at her wedding for them. Of course, I said yes.  This has been the plan for several months. Her brother is a minister and he is officiating their wedding, so it is a very personal and sentimental ceremony. She isn't having a large group of people. \n\nThe other night mom texts me from a bar (a little tipsy) about a woman there doing Karaoke. She sent me a fuzzy video of a woman who I presume sings for a church choir belting out none other than Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. I said it was very nice, and left it at that. \n\nThe following morning Mom calls me up to rant and rave about the woman she met and how great her singing was. She then informed me that she asked this woman to sing the same song for her wedding, and asked me instead to just play accompanying guitar. This is about 2 months before the wedding. \n\nMy feelings were hurt. I told her that, and she blew me off saying that I \"probably wouldn't even have sang it\". She then told me that I was just going to play guitar, and in a perfect world I would have sang it for her, but she knew I wouldn't. She started back peddling and saying she knew i had anxiety and wouldn't perform in front of people. \n\nNot only does that seem inappropriate to me, but I was in a band for several years and have played in front of crowds very often. It seems she realizes she made a mistake in how she worded this to me, and is trying to find a reason to justify herself.\n\nI told her that i hope this woman knows how to play the accompanyment, because there is no way i would do it now. I didn't rescind my wedding attendance, and it wasn't a huge argument. She is now pestering me every time I talk to her, saying she wants me to sing, she didnt realize i was seriously going to play etc. Etc..\n\nI know it's HER wedding, and I have no problem there. She can have this woman play the song,  but I was under the impression that there was some significant sentiment to me performing for her and dad.\n\nAITA for refusing to play accompanying guitar for this woman? \n",

      "description": "TLDR; My wife started a meal plan last week, I made brownies last night. She can't partake until Sunday although I saved her some. (It was Tuesday). AITA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my wife has been on a health kick recently after our Dr. visit, and has been working out every day and has a strict meal plan she has kept to. I am very proud of her for this, and she allows herself 1 free day of eating per week. Sunday, now I myself don't have a meal plan. I often take part in her meals, because they are a healthy alternative but are otherwise quite tasty. Now, that being said, I am not against my sweet tooth and last night I had a HUGE craving for brownies. I had a box in the pantry and just couldn't resist the idea of making some. Before I do my wife stops me and says that I should wait a couple days at least, so she could have a brownie or two on her free day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't think it's fair that just because she's on a meal plan that I also have to limit my sweet tooth cravings. She says it's not fair to make the brownies and she won't be able to eat them for a week, when she claims they will be stale and hard, suggesting I at least wait for Friday so when she can have one they'll be still 'kinda fresh'. I told her that microwaving them works, and they'll be basically just the same and I would save her a bunch. She then went on to say that it was torture to have to smell the brownies baking and not be able to have any, I think she's being dramatic. She's lasted over a week on her meal plan without cheating, there should be no reason I can't bake a batch of brownies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to give into my sweet tooth (Obviously, or else this post wouldn't exist) and went on to make the brownies, I felt it wasn't that big of a deal. When my wife saw what I was doing, you'd think I just hit her dog with a car, she immediately starts yelling at me that I am selfish and unsupportive and ran off to go to bed. Later on, when I went to join her she immediately pulled away from me, to the point of getting out of bed herself just to tell me not to touch her. So here comes my question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

I close most of the time, which means i clean everyone’s mess at the end of the night. One kid during the day decided to not clean up his mess after doing grease traps (cleaning the grease that gets collected during the day while we cook) and they decided to put up a note saying we all had to use a floor sink, thus making a 10 minute job into a 30-40 minute job. I chewed out the manager that did this, because it seems a little stupid to punish all of us for it. We’re young adults, and it seems like it would’ve been better to just write him up and teach him, since everyone else does the job correctly. \n\nTL;DR. I work at mcdonald’s, am a young adult, and someone younger made a stupid decision and the manager decided to punish everyone even though everyone else does the job right. ",

      "description": "I'm 25 and living on my own and my mom is widowed (about seven years ago).  My only sibling, my sister, has cut contact with our family out of the blue for a few months now and while we're not afraid that she'll hurt herself or start using drugs or stealing, there's a lot of unknowns in regards to that.  That's all relevant background for this post.  About a week ago my mom asked me if I might want to go on an overseas trip later in the year and I said \"maybe\" and that it depended on some factors. We talked about other things and that was it.  A few days later, she called me and we had a 30 minute argument over me having said \"maybe\" to her question instead of a definitive \"yes\" or \"sure\".  She said that it hurt her to hear me say that and that my answer communicated how I felt about our relationship.  I apologized for making her feel bad and tried to explain that it was just about the trip and that she knew that if she needed me for anything I would be right there with no grumbling.  We kind of went back and forth on this point with her not saying but implying that my hem-haw about a hypothetical trip said much larger things about our relationship and me trying to fight against that, telling her that if the situations were reversed, I wouldn't take it the way she's taking it.  Essentially that me being there in a crisis moment means more than me being there in a fun moment.  I told her that it's not fair for her to be putting all of the emotional weight of my dad/her husband's death and my sister's absence on me.  I also pointed out that earlier this year we went to Philadelphia together for a trip and that we were going to be taking a trip to Seattle in a few months and that it wasn't like I was distancing myself.  She was pretty unmoved from her point about me being \"cold\" for lack of a better word and she said I was behaving very abnormally compared to most people my age.  She also said that she had a feeling that eventually our family would shatter due to sentiments like this.  AITA in this situation?\n\nAs an aside, my mom has had in the past a little bit of a temper and I've been on the receiving end on it multiple times when it was just the two of us on a trip and she was passive-aggressive with me on the latest trip the two of us took and I'm not sure if that's affecting my willingness to go on an extended trip with her.",

      "description": "I'm (17F) a senior in high school this year, and I never really put myself out there or tried getting into a relationship. Initially, it never really mattered to me, but because I'm graduating in just a few months, I kind of feel like I've missed out. I'm a little nervous that I'll look silly going into college a virgin, let alone without having had my first kiss.\n\nSo over Christmas break, I was talking to a friend about this, and he asked me if I would help a friend lose their virginity if they had the same problem. I could tell that he was obviously talking about himself. At the time, getting into that kind of a relationship didn't seem like a bad idea. We were both inexperienced so I wouldn't really have to worry about getting judged. So I said yeah I would and we both agreed that we should become friends with benefits. Nothing really changed my opinion until the issue of lube came up. He said it wasn't necessary because a) they didn't use lube in porn and b) the condom comes pre-lubricated. My brain literally fucking shut down after these comments like I couldn't even comprehend the stupidity needed to formulate these statements. I pointed out how he was wrong, and, eventually, he agreed that using lube is a good idea. But at that point I was just fed up. \n\nI told him that I didn't really want to do this anymore because I was scared of my parents finding out, but that's obviously not the reason why I was calling it off. We still talk, but he's dropping these passive aggressive hints about how he just wants to get with a girl before college and is that too much to ask for? He's brought up more than once about how we can always follow through even though I don't really want to. Overall he's just complaining to me about this, and he seems bitter. It's making me a little uncomfortable and annoyed, but I don't know if this is my fault for encouraging it in the first place.",

She’s pretty spoiled by them (before she got married, they paid for school,cars, rent, clothes, and whatever else she wanted). That was fine because I knew what I was getting into with her. \n\nBut what irks me is that it’s like she regresses when she gets around her parents. I don’t know how to even articulate it. The lap thing though is the most obvious example. If I’m being frank, it weirds me out. I thought it was just me but one time at a birthday party for another family member, my own mom actually asked me about it. \n\nBasically my wife will sit on her dad’s lap and cuddle with him. Often put her arms around his neck and rest her head on his shoulder. I guess I just didn’t grow up in a house where people did that past like age 7, I don’t know. \n\nALSO her dad still buys her presents that in my mind, are a bit much. For example, my mother-in-law told me that he’s planning to give my wife some kind of diamond pendant for Christmas. I guess it’s nice but also...why...\n\nI spoke to my wife about the lap thing because I thought it was the most concrete things I could mention. But she got all defensive and irritated. By the end of the conversation she just goes “Fine! I won’t do it anymore!” \n\nI know she’s pissed at me now. But was I in the wrong? I mean is all this stuff normal and I’m just missing something? \n\n(Originally posted in the advice sub but someone pm’ed and said it might be appropriate here too). ",

I dislike this guy because he frequently makes passive aggressive comments at me, hits on my wife, and talks shit about me behind my back.  Multiple people have brought up to me how he is always talking behind my back and I responded with, \"Really?  I hadn't noticed, I don't really listen to what he says.\"  Anyway, I'm happy to play it like this because I don't really care, he's an asshole, and it's not like I see him that often, so, screw it.  Let him have his fun time because it's true, I just don't respect him so I don't care what he says.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, now to the issue.  I have been a teacher for quite some time and this man is currently in the process of becoming a teacher in the same subject that I teach and is beginning his student teaching in a month.  He shared this with me because, since I was face-to-face with him, and he never makes comments to my face, he acts like a completely normal and chill guy, he said, \"Yeah, man, when I go into student teaching I know you have a great curriculum so I'm definitely going to ask you to share your stuff with me!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it were anyone else, I'd say, \"Of course!\"  I'm happy to help out new teachers because I received help myself when I was new, but, for this guy?

      "title": "AITA for breaking Up after only 4 months, one week before her Bday",
      "description": "I've been with this girl since december 2018. She's a great girl with a wonderful and chill personality. She is everything I want in a girlfriend. She is pretty, supportive, chill, not the jealous type, not clingy etc. However, recently I started to get feelings of breaking up. Here are my reasons why.\n\nFirstly, we have different lifestyles and goals. I believe that since she was brought up in a, I would say, super strict way she lacks confidence in herself. To me personally, that was not a really attractive trait to me. As part of her upbringing, she is also very introverted and socially awkward sometimes. These are things I can totally understand, but for me to envision a long term relationship with them would be very difficult. When we would go out on dates it would be pretty predictable each time. I enjoy her company during the dates however I did not particularly find the dates enjoyable or fun. I asked her about her goals and she seemed uncertain and always mentioned her parents during the conversation. I did not learn these things the few weeks before we made it official. To me she seems like someone I can really trust and rely on for support but not in a girlfriend way.\n\nSecondly, I mentioned above she had strict parents. I know, I have only been dating for about 4 months and her parents have no reason to trust a 20 year old boy. However, her parents have really strict rules for her to live by. For example, she can't leave the house to go out on dates every week. One day she mentioned that I should come hang out at her house more often. I told her, sure, let me know when you're alone and we can hangout. She replies with why do we have to be alone. This kinda hit me. Her house is also fully monitored by cctvs which makes me feel very uncomfortable. She also expects me to come hangout in her house when her parents are home which also makes me feel uncomfortable. For example this semester break I was planning to bring her to the countryside to sight see and distress however when I hinted toward the subject she stated her parents would not allow that to happen which I mean I kinda understood but was really disappointed.\n\nYou might be thinking why I have not brought these issues up with her. Well, the problems I mentioned were as follows, lifestyle, goals and parents. I do not by any means want anyone to change their life, goals or relationship with their parents just to fit my needs. That to me is just horrible. To me, I feel like we do not fit well together. I feel that a clean and respectful talk is needed between us tomorrow and I hope she can respect my decision on breaking up. It's unfair to put her through this any longer. I cannot force love in my opinion it happens naturally, and well, I can't seem to find that love for her.\n\nDid I judge to quickly and aita for breaking up for these reasons and right before her bday.",

      "description": "For a little background, I have been with my first &amp; current partner for 17 years, married for 11 of those.  So until recently I had lots of experience with communication &amp; compromise in a relationship, but none whatsoever with a relationship *ending.*  Then we opened our marriage to allow for other loving relationships; no problem there.  But I had another relationship, I got dumped, and I'm concerned that I'm handling that poorly.  \nHere are the details: I was dating this woman for 3-4 months.  (I give a range because it started really slow.  I had a lengthy flu and she couldn't afford to risk getting sick - so we met once and then there was a lot of texting &amp; phone calls after we decided to try dating but before we could see each other in person again.)  All in all, I thought it was going really well.  We both highly valued honesty &amp; communication, had similar personalities, and found each other interesting.  After a while, she got busy and we didn't see each other very much.  There were a few times where she just wanted to relax on her own after a busy week; even though I knew she was stretched pretty thin, I'd ask if she wanted to do anything and figured it was a good sign that she was comfortable enough with me to say no.  She *was* still clearly making efforts to fit me in.  In hindsight, I think it was a mistake not to give her more space.  I'd been planning on asking her if I needed to adjust my expectations around how often we could see each other, but I delayed, not wanting to make her feel guilty for how busy she was - after Christmas we were expecting things to settle down, so I was going to play it by ear and talk to her about it then if it still seemed necessary.  \nWell, the Saturday before Christmas we had plans together.  I was really looking forward to seeing her again, as outside of a brief encounter it had been about 3 weeks since we'd hung out.  She hadn't even been replying much to texts, which made me nervous but aside from that she had given me no indication that anything was amiss and 3 weeks prior it really, really seemed like she was happy to see me &amp; enjoying my company.  Anyway, Saturday morning I got an email from her.  She said she had something \"internal\" that she needed to focus on.  She had some books of mine that she said she'd return after the break.  She apologized for doing it over email, but said doing it face-to-face was not within her ability at that time and she didn't want to avoid me until it was.  I know that email/text break-ups are universally despised but I forgive her that.  I think she planned to do it when she saw me that day, and really would have done it differently if she could.  She even answered her phone when I called to make sure she was okay.  Honestly I was surprised that she did, but I was worried - remember I hadn't seen her in a long time, and she had been uncharacteristically quiet over messaging.\n\n  \nThe problem is, I haven't really heard from her since.  This concerns me because 1) She still has the books she said she'd return, and I'm worried that she may try to mail them to avoid talking to me.  Those were all my favourite books from childhood so while I don't mind her having them for a time, I am quite concerned that they might not fare well going through the mail and/or sitting in a box on my porch in the snow for most of a day if the mail carrier opts to leave them.  2) I have something of hers which I would strongly prefer to pass over in-person... but she's probably forgotten I have it.  3) Last but not least, I have a million questions.  I suppose that's probably why she doesn't want to talk to me, but it would really help me to move past this if I knew the answers.  Did I do something wrong?  (If so, I'd like to learn from my mistake.)  Can we ever be friends again?  Maybe even start the relationship up again when she's in a better place?  (I can't help but suspect that the internal issues thing is only a partial reason, that maybe she just wasn't feeling it or something - I know that \"it's not you it's me\" is an extremely common lie - but maybe not.  Given how much we talked about honesty and everything I know about her values and even the things she occasionally posts to Facebook, it seems genuinely possible that this truly isn't about me at all.)\n\n  \nSo, here's where the AITA comes in.  I know that she doesn't owe me anything.  And I have seen how scary it is when you ask someone to get out of your life but they refuse to.  Stalkers are real and terrifying and I'm afraid of becoming one.  But I keep wavering between \"She's not answering me so clearly she doesn't want to talk to me and I need to leave her alone\" and \"If she wanted me to leave her alone, surely she would say so.  Maybe she's struggling with depression or anxiety and thinks she's just a burden on me, and what she really needs is for me not to give up on her yet.\"\n\n  \nHere is the contact I have made so far:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* As mentioned, called her about 5 hours after the break-up email and spoke briefly.\n* 2.5 weeks later, sent this email: \"I've been trying to curb my desire to contact you, because I thought you probably wouldn't want me to - or at least not yet.  But I just saw your recent post on Facebook and now I'm a lot less sure.  I know I'd been asking for a lot of your time.  If what you need right now is less, I understand that.  And I don't need any commitments.  I *am* afraid of being that person who won't go away when they're asked to... but if you're not wanting me out of your life completely, I would really prefer not to be.  Maybe I could give you a call on Friday and see if you're up for lunch?\"  (No response, but none expected.)\n* Called on the stated Friday.  Tried her cell once, waited a bit, tried the cell again, waited a bit, decided to try the house line just in case.  Stopped there.  Forty minutes later I saw that I had an email from her with a subject line stating that she was on an important conference call.  No message body.\n* At the time I interpreted this to mean that it was okay that I had called, so I immediately sent an email thanking her for letting me know and saying I'd try again on Tuesday.  (I know that was too soon, but it was a convenient day for a few reasons.  And I guess I was impatient.)  I have since wondered if her email was more of a \"you need to stop calling me\" response.  She had sent it a minute or so after my third attempt, not having any way to know that I wasn't going to just keep trying.  (Again, no response, but none expected.)\n* Called on the stated Tuesday.  This time tried the cell once and the house once before stopping.  No email, no return call, nothing.\n* I meant to stop there, at least for a couple of months, I really did.  But another Facebook post prompted a swing in my resolve and I sent her a poorly-considered private message on Facebook.  In it, I asked that she give me clear direction on whether I should stay away or for how long.  That was almost 2 weeks ago (3 weeks after the last phone call).  No response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, even if she does want to hear from me again she almost certainly needs more time.  So I have every intention now to leave this for another 2 or 3 months at least.  (Unless she contacts me or the books appear on my doorstep; in the latter case I'll probably leave her item in her mailbox with a note like \"I hope when you're ready, you'll look me up\".)  But I seem to have poor resolve on that, and having internet strangers chide me and give me further reasons to leave her alone would probably be good for me.  Also, I am honestly not sure if I'm in the wrong for trying so many times already and for wanting to try again at all.  The lack of response seems to make her will pretty clear... but she hasn't asked me to stop, she hasn't unfriended me, and she told me she'd return my books and she hasn't so there's an implication that she expects to talk to me again.  She also promised while we were dating that she wouldn't ghost me, which she didn't, but it feels very close to it to me.  I would really appreciate a chance for some closure.  I guess from her point of view she gave me that chance when she answered the phone, but I was too worried about her then to think to ask the questions that are bothering me now.  And if nothing else... those books meant a lot to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, **AITA for trying to contact her as many times as I already have, and/or for planning to try again**?\n\n  \n(PS. It shouldn't matter, but it probably does: I am female.  If that changes your opinion on this matter, I'd be curious to hear that, and in what way your advice differs because of it.)\n\n  \n(PPS. I imagine I'm going to get a lot of comments saying that she's terrible and I need to get over this ASAP for my own good.  At least, my friends have said that to me.  But I think whether she is terrible or not depends entirely on the one thing I don't have right now: her perspective.  Maybe she was pretending to value honesty but got bored of me and can't be bothered to think of my point of view.  Or maybe she's doing the best she can and feels guilty and paralyzed by her inability to respond in the way she knows I want her to - I have GAD, I know exactly how that can happen.  Trust me, if it's the former I will happily leave that relationship behind.  Besides, I am working on getting over it and have made significant progress, but like everyone else going through the stages of grief, I have good days and bad days.)  \n ",

      "description": "Important Background: I've gone to 3 therapists all diagnosing me with severe depression and anxiety, to my main therapist my main issue is the need to please others and my inability to say no. \nFamily; my younger sister (we'll call SB) is 1 1/2 years younger than I.\nShe is:\n•Entitled\n•Hypocritical\n•So selfish\n\nSo yeah, I hate my sister a lot and I want to disown her. I know it seems petty, but I have serious reasons and today just pushed the envelope a little to far...\n\nShe is very entitled to the point that if I don't give her what she wants she threatens me. She complains I never tell her anything but when I tell her my secrets she ridicules me and uses it as blackmail. Recently she's taken up using my issues against me by saying that my family is judging me (I'll get into that later). She tries her best to make things about her and when I told her about a traumatic experience that has fucked me up for life she immediately called me a liar and brings it up constantly yet when a minor inconvenience happens and I try not to care she has a meltdown for me not believing her.\n\nThose may all be petty to most but something happened today that urged me to want to take my own life because I just couldn't handle it anymore and honestly I still can't stop crying.\n\nI told her a secret, that I've been sexually active with my boyfriend and (he and I are in out mid-late teens) we're not stupid and use protection. It's that time during school where everyone is getting sick and I caught a slight cold, literally a cold and a small bellyache from not eating. She is now telling me that the whole family (who doesn't know I'm not a virgin) thinks I'm pregnant, and I know I'm not though.\n\nWe had this conversation:\n\nSB: Hey I'm going to let you know our grandma hates your boyfriend.\n(He is literally the sweetest boy, he always makes sure I've eaten and checks if I'm okay if I'm ever hurt or upset)\nMe: so?\nSB: She just said if you're pregnant she's going to end her own life\nMe: stop, get out of my room\nSB: Hey, it's not my fault the whole family is finding out you're a slut\nMe: seriously leave me alone\nSB: sorry! Just trying to tell the truth, so you and your boyfriend shouldn't have sex like ever... Why does he even like you?\nMe: Seriously get the f*** out!\n\nIt ended at that, but I went into a panic and wanted to move out and it took so long to calm down. I really don't know what to do, I don't even want to be in my house anymore. I feel lost and antagonized for just trying to experience life.\nAm I the asshole for hating her or am I in the right?",

      "description": "Disclaimer: Throwaway, vague story to avoid identification\n\nEx and I broke up on mutual decision, some important aspects for the relationship didn't quite work. A week later, while I was still in the \"maybe I just didn't try hard enough to work it out with him\" phase, my Ex got together with someone else, one of the new people in our friend group. I vent to her my feelings of regret, and eventually have a talk with Ex too to get it all off my chest. Result is obviously \"too little, too late\" since he is with someone new already. But I would find out about that a week later, from a jealous suitor of Girl, who wanted to poison me against those two with claims of cheating etc so I'd help him destroy the relationship. Doesn't help Ex takes forever to respond when I text him to confront him about it. Cue the most painful night of my life. Finally Ex tells me he would never cheat, and I do believe him.\n\n\nBut even so, this whole \"not telling me because it is none of my business because we broke up a week ago\" and lies of cheating left such a bad taste in my mouth, even months later I can't accept them being together, not truly. I keep that to myself, but I can't stop this feeling of... Hate (it is bit of a strong word, but it's the closest I can come up with) because they disregarded my feelings at the start of their relationship (I'm very honest person, so I would have loved if one of them could have told me, now I just feel like my trust in both of them was betrayed all at once). Am I the asshole for hating those two being together? Because of how betrayed I felt that they would tell Suitor first, and not even coming to tell me right after?",

      "description": "I was just asked by my parents to go with them to Ikea. They wanted to return a piece of furniture and buy some other things. This trip would take a couple hours, and I would’ve agreed if they had asked ahead of time. Instead, they asked me right as they were getting ready to leave.\nI was tired, as I had gotten 4 hours of sleep last night, and I didn’t want to go because they were asking for a pretty decent sized chunk of my time out of the blue. When I expressed that, they got mad and started to yell and mock that I “required an appointment” to help them. Keep in mind, it’s a Saturday and I’m not doing much, but I do have some things I want to work on tonight. I get that they wanted my help because the furniture is not light, but I feel that it’s disrespectful to just ask for this without prior notice. They had known for a few days that they were going to make this trip today. I’m not even asking for 24 hours notice. If they had asked me last night, I would’ve said yes and had no issues with it. If they had asked this morning and explained why they needed me to come, I would’ve said yes. Slightly begrudgingly (because of the lack of sleep), but at least I would’ve been able to expect the trip I’d have to make. \nWe’ve had this argument many times in the past and it greatly annoys me that it still happens. It wouldn’t be hard for them to let me know ahead of time when they want to involve me in something. Especially something that they themselves knew about. They think it’s silly that I would want advanced notice. I ended up bringing some of the furniture downstairs so it could be loaded into the car. They left without me, and they’re fuming for their reasons, and I’m unhappy with them for my own. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm a 19yo (M) I have a friend who is 19yo (F), we have known each other since 5th grade, so like 7 years, and ever since then we spend almost every day at one or the others house hanging out. For the longest time I was the only friend she spent time with outside of school, until about 11th grade then both of us started hanging out with another group of friends, but since we graduated last year neither of us spends time with that group beside the occasional text message to keep up, with what they are doing. For stuff like going out to get drinks, shopping, road trips, family events, ect, we do all that together. \n\nBut she started to tell me all the time that we are not friends and that she doesn't like me, most of the time when she says this she is mad at me for something so I don't take it to heart. But I can recall a few times her saying stuff like that when we was laughing and having a good time, and tbh it ruined the whole day each time she did it. The main 2 events in my mind atm are, 1st. we was laying on her bed watching YouTube on my phone, it was one of those dumb challenge videos and it said something like \"this one you can try with your friends!\" so I said \"we could try that\" She then says \"we are not friends tho, I don't even like you\" then said it again in a serious voice sounding kinda mad. She then got up and walked out the room, then came back a few mins later looking upset just sit on the bed watching TV not talking. The 2nd event, we was at my aunts farm feeding animals and just walking around talking, she jumps on my back for a piggy back ride and tells me to run to the house laughing and having fun. We get to the porch, she gets off my back, and all of sudden out of no where she says \"I don't like you\" in that same mad voice then refused to talk to me for like 2 hours. \n\nThe time at my aunts happened on Dec 8th, I decided to talk to her about it on the 9th and tell her it kinda hurts my feelings. She got upset and said I was being an asshole for making her out to be a bitch for speaking her mind. I then told her \"we been close friends since 5th grade and if she doesn't like me why does she spend so much time with me\" and she said because she thinks i'm \"nice and fun to be around\". \n\nNow I'm just hella confused about if she even wants me around and it is kinda awkward the few times I been around her since then. I have been pulling away and not spending every day with her, this has led to her blowing up my phone every day asking me to come do something. Some of the times I made up and excuses to stay home but the few times I went she is acting extra nice to me. I'm just really confused about the whole thing, is it normal for friends to say shit like this to each other? Am I the asshole for calling her out for this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I’ve been seeing and chatting with a guy for about 3 weeks now. From the get-go, I made it clear that I wasn’t looking for anything serious nor was I ready to jump into a relationship, especially seeing I just got out of a really awful relationship 2 months ago. I tried to explain to him as explicitly as possible that I’m still hurt from my previous relationship and trying to heal and that jumping into a relationship prematurely would just hurt us both in the end. He seemed understanding and agreed. \n\nWe went on a first date and it was amazing. Like, right-out-of-a-romantic-comedy amazing. I was smitten and I could tell he was too. However, I live 2 hours away from him and can only see him every once in a while when I visit my best friend who lives in the same town. Initially, I thought this was great because I love my own space and the distance would certainly assure me that. For the following 3 or 4 days I was head-over-heels for him. Could not stop thinking about him, smiling, and replaying our first date over and over again in my head. We texted the following days and things escalated pretty quickly. He began to mention more and more frequently how much he liked me, how he’s never found a guy like me before, and how handsome and special I am. Of course, I was flattered and said that I felt the same way. \n\nI got lucky and was able to see him again in the same week. It was my friends birthday, so I was able to sneak off and see him for a few minutes while she was finishing up at work. This time, things just felt different. It’s like all my feelings for him were slowly starting to fade. I truly couldn’t understand why; he was such a sweet guy, really passionate, and truly cared and respected me. Regardless, when I met up with him the second time there wasn’t the same spark as before. \n\nI should’ve listened to my gut, but I took my apprehensions as nervousness and anxiousness for the possibility of meeting a new guy. After our second date, he became more clingy and ever more mushy. He began telling me about “dreams” he’d have of us in which he confessed his love for me, would tell me he was thinking about surprising me by renting a zip car and showing up at my house unexpectedly, write songs about me/us, and would constantly say how afraid he was of losing me. On top of this, he’d get very upset if I didn’t text him back immediately. For someone who needs A LOT of personal space, I found this to be suffocating, especially for a relationship so new and casual. From this point on, it was clear that I had lost interest. I told him again that I wasn’t looking for anything serious and, again, he seemed to understand completely. \n\nFast-forward to today: I am going to visit my friend again and I told him that’d I’d be around. I truly wanted to see him and ran either a drink or a cup of coffee. I was visiting town primarily for my friend, so I didn’t want to blow her off the whole time for him. He then asked if I’d be willing to go out with him to a bar for a special Valentine’s Day party. I agreed thinking it’d be fun and casual. We chatted on the phone a few days later and he told me he planned on dressing up in a suit and tie, buying me flowers and introducing me to more of his friends at the bar. I was surprised and a little uncomfortable about how formal the date sounded, but I told him that it sounded nice and that I was excited to not hurt his feelings. When the phone call ended, I thought about it more and realized that I really didn’t want to go on the date. I texted him AGAIN stating that I wasn’t looking for anything serious and asked him where he saw the two of us going. \n\nI had another phone call with him after sending these texts and explained that I just wasn’t ready for something so serious. I just graduated college, am living at home with my parents and interviewing for jobs all over the place so I told him that I wasn’t in the position to dive into something so serious. He understood and I could tell in his voice he was disappointed. He told me he really wanted to be in a relationship with me and that it didn’t have to be exclusive. \n\nTomorrow is the date and I really don’t want to go. When I told him I’d like to meet up, I pictured meeting up for an hour or two for drinks or a coffee. Something casual with no flowers or fancy attire. I told him that I couldn’t go and made up a lame excuse. I then said I’d be more than happy to meet up for coffee while I’m in town. Am I the asshole for rejecting a really sweet guy’s date? ",

      "description": "This happened a while ago, but it's been weighing on my conscience ever since. Sorry it's a little long.\n\nSince September, I've shared a student apartment on campus with 3 randomly assigned roommates, all girls my age (18-20). Two of my roommates are really quiet and basically unnoticeable most of the time, but one of them, Emma, is extremely extroverted. She has 2-4 friends over to our place 3-5 nights a week, usually after 8pm. They get pretty loud sometimes and our walls are super thin. I've never brought it up, though, because Emma and I get along well enough and I don't want to add any negativity to our relationship. I don't want to be seen as the buzzkill roommate. And it's usually not too bad, anyway - the friends are usually gone by the time I go to bed. It's a little annoying but I can live with it.\n\nLate in November, Emma sent a message to our group chat asking if it would be okay for her to host a Christmas party at our apartment  in early December. The other two roommates were planning to be out of town that week, so the party was no problem for them. But I was really hesitant to agree, since December is final exam season. I ended up not responding to the message at all, partly due to indecision, partly because I just forgot about it.\n\nA few days later, I got a Facebook notification. I'd been invited to an event by Emma. It was her Christmas party, which was now set to take place on December 10th. I checked my calendar, and... yup, I had an exam on the morning of December 11th. I started freaking out a little bit and figured I needed to ask Emma to change the date.\n\nLuckily, Emma sent another notification later that same day. She had emailed our RA asking for the party contract  (since we live in student housing, we have to sign a contract before hosting any events with 10+ attendees) . The RA had rejected her request, because parties are not allowed during exam season. Emma asked if anyone living off-campus would be willing to host the party at their place, and if not then they could hit up a bar or restaurant instead of having a party. Needless to say, I was relieved, and assumed the party would NOT take place at our apartment.\n\nOn the morning of December 10th, I bumped into Emma while packing up to go to the library to study. She said, \"Hey, are you going to be home tonight? It's the party!\" I was alarmed but played it cool, laughing and saying no thanks, I have an exam first thing tomorrow morning. She told me good luck and then I left, panicking a little. I immediately regretted not telling Emma my concerns about the party, but I assumed it wouldn't be loud or run too late. I had just told her about my exam, so I figured she'd be considerate enough to adjust her plans accordingly\n\nI stayed at the library all day. I got home at 9:45pm, thinking the party was probably over by now. But as soon as I opened the door, I was hit with a blast of music and drunken laughter. I could see 20+ people in the kitchen. I quickly ducked into my room and tried to study for a little while, but the noise was too much. People were standing right outside my door and laughing. Emma's room is right next to mine, and I could hear a couple making out inside of it.\n\nI called the RA's emergency phone number. I told her that there was a loud party in my unit and that I wanted it to get shut down. The RA came over at around 10:45pm and upon being let into the apartment, yelled at everyone to leave immediately. I was still hiding in my room, but I could hear Emma protesting, getting upset, saying that everyone would leave in 15 minutes, etc. The RA wouldn't budge, and wouldn't leave our place until all the partygoers had cleared out and our apartment was dead silent.\n\nA few days later, Emma told me what had happened to her party. I tried to get out of the conversation, but when I couldn't, I feigned obliviousness and sympathy. I reacted to her story with \"oh no\" \"that sucks\" \"wow, it sounds like it was a fun party\" etc., not saying too much and also not owning up to the fact that I had made the complaint. I was too scared and didn't want to ruin our friendship.\n\nSo... I'm pretty sure Emma is an asshole for breaking the rules and throwing a party, but was I an asshole for never being upfront with her?",

      "description": "This is a hypothetical question based on an experience I recently had. If that is not allowed mods feel free to delete my post. \n\nI love watching movies, however I’m a very cheap and frugal person so I rarely go because I think they are too expensive. My fiancé loves to go to the movies and get a big popcorn and icee. Every once in a while she’ll talk me into going to see a movie and of course we end up getting a big thing of popcorn and an icee. \n\nWe always clean up after ourselves. I take my trash and throw it away because I have had plenty of shitty jobs. So I know it’s no fun to clean especially for minimum wage high school students who are working on a Friday or Saturday night. However this one time I almost intentionally left all my trash (I did not because my fiancé wouldn’t let me)\n\nWe were seeing a marvel movie so of course we had to wait and watch all of the after credits scenes. As the credits were getting closer to being over the cleaning crew came in to wait for everyone to shuffle out of the theater. One of the employees started to yell “movies over everyone leave so we can start cleaning your trash.” This was while the credits were still rolling. People started to get up and leave and she said “make sure you get all your trash we don’t want to have to clean up after you either.” As she said that I was like hell no. I had my large (empty) popcorn and cup. I started to turn around to put the trash down when my fiancé grabbed me and said “no no no let’s just go.” I feel like I had every right to be passive aggressive and leave my trash there. \n\nSo am I the asshole here? I feel like she’s not wrong but she’s way out of line to be yelling at customers and if a manager had seen that they would have been pissed. ",

      "description": "My wife and I have a pretty solid routine, and I think a really good relationship.  We've never had any fights, nobody has cheated, etc. We've known each other about 8 years, been together for 5, married for 2.  We have an 11mo old daughter.    \n\nTonight, we're doing the same thing we do every night, unwind on the couch in front of Netflix while the baby gets tired enough to put to bed.    \n\nTonight, though, my wife gets frustrated with the baby, puts her on the ground and goes off to another room.  I pick the baby up.  After about a half hour, she's asleep in my arms, and I take her upstairs and put her to bed in her crib.    \n\nI come back downstairs and go to use the toilet, walking through the dining room, where our computer is.  When I open the door, my wife, who is sitting in the dark in front of the laptop with a show playing louder than usual, quickly hides her phone against her chest and looks up at me.    \n\nAll of this is unusual.  She never hides her phone, never hangs out in the dark watching a show by herself.    \n\nI ask her if she's okay.  She says yes, and has slid the phone down below the table.    \n\nI go on to use the toilet and then go back through the room out to the living room, but I can't shake what happened.  It's bothering me and I can't shake it.    \n\nSo I go back into the computer room - I am aware that I'm trying not to be heard, though not proud of it - and I'm not heard.  I open the door.  The phone immediately goes down again, and she closes a window that's in the upper-left of the laptop screen.    \n\nI don't know what to say, and make like I needed to go back to the toilet.  I didn't stay in there long, though.  I came back out and asked her again if she was sure she's okay.  She says she is.    \n\nSo I told her - I've never seen her hide her phone like that, and asked her if she was hiding something.  I want to think Xmas shopping, but I've been burned before, so there's a part of me that thinks its not Xmas shopping.   \n\nShe says she wasn't hiding anything, and do I want to look at her phone?  I say no, I don't, and that I'm sorry, I didn't think she was doing anything wrong.  Then she says, defensively, that yes, I did think she was doing something wrong, and I said I was sorry again, that she just didn't usually act like this.    \n\nShe went upstairs to bed.  That was probably two hours ago.    \n\nI don't know if I'm going to sleep at all tonight.  She's my best friend, and has never given me any reason to think she might be cheating, so I'm sure this is just me overreacting, but fuck, she was hiding something.    \n\nAm I the asshole?  What do I do now?",

      "description": "I want to make it clear, please do not comment encouraging violence toward anyone. I just want a judgment on if I'd be TA or not... \n\nA few days ago, I was told a coworker of mine was arrested. I heard nothing more until later that night when I was told US Marshals called saying that he wouldn't be in to work for at least a few days. This coworker and I were friendly, so I was concerned, but I kept to myself about it and hoped I'd get answers soon. \n\nHis keys were returned by a friend of his yesterday, and we weren't giving any more info about his situation. Basically, now we have a coworker who was arrested, the crime was bad enough to get US Marshals involved, and he quit. I got very concerned.\n\nI decided to look up his name and saw a case titled US v. [Coworker]. Ended up paying money to get the documents off of a court document website or whatever the heck it's called. Turns out he has three charges against him and they are pretty serious to say the least. I can't post specifics because I wanna avoid violent rhetoric in the comments and I wanna avoid breaking sub rules. I read every page of every document I could get my hands on about this case. It is disgusting and made me wanna puke, to say the least. I could care less what happens to him, and I'll leave my thoughts about him at that.\n\nBasically, I wanna know if I'd be TA for telling my coworkers about the crimes he committed. Everyone but one of us knows he was arrested, and I've only told two managers what I found (I'm not a manager). I don't even know why I'm on the fence about it. Could be me just thinking about covering my ass legally? I don't know. But what he did makes me so sick and I think people that do what he did should be outed.\n\nTL;DR - A coworker of mine committed a very serious, disgusting crime and I wanna know if I'd be TA if I outed him and what he did to my coworkers.",

      "description": "I work for a grocery store. My department basically does shopping for customers who order online. We don't deliver, so customers come to pick up their orders in specials marked spots. Now, these spots suffer from a few design problems:\n1) They sit right next to the spots for our walk-up pharmacy, so people often park in them for that\n2) The row of parking spots next to them is one of the only two with handicap parking (I think 6 in each row) so people looking for a handicap spot will be right next to them when they find all the spots taken\n3) Our signs are BLUE and the spots spaced apart with diagonal white lines the way many handicap spots are\nGiven all this, you can bet that our 6 spots often get people parking there who shouldn't, and while the spots can often be empty for several minutes, they can fill quickly, and some people have stayed in our spots for over an hour, sometimes several at once.\nOn this particular day, we are a bit short staffed, so I'm the only one running orders out. I've just got done seeing a customer off, when I notice the passenger getting out of the other car, so I decide to go and see if she has an order, so I can get her name, conversation goes like this (M-me, L-the lady)\nM: Hello, are you here to pick-up an order?\nL: No, the handicap spots are full\nM: Oh, well, these spots are for picking up orders\nL: I know, you people took the handicap spots for this!\n(We didn't, someone who'd worked there for a few years before we even started the service told me later that these spots were never handicap)\nNow, under some circumstances, I may not have minded. But the next hour we were expecting to be busy, and I was gonna need all my spots, plus the the way she parked blocked a row, so I would only have 4 if she stayed\nM: Well, I'm sorry, but these are not handicap spots\nL: But I need a handicap spot! (I'm paraphrasing btw)\nShe grumbles a bit, and I feel a bit guilty, I offer her to stay for a bit if she just pulls up one spot (this way I'd at least have 5) but she just huffed and left\nI should note that she did seem to be a some-what older lady, maybe in her 50s to early 60s, so not someone who wouldn't need a close spot. I'm also pretty sure she's done this before, as the car looked familiar once I thought about it later.\nManagement in my department now takes this more seriously, but at the time I wasn't really sure how to handle the situation\nAnyway, AITA for having her move?\n",

      "description": "So a while ago, I heard a rumor that my friend (and college roommate) had cheated on his long-term SO with someone from our HS. I talked to a bunch of my friends who would know more about it, and they all confirmed that this had been going on for over a year. I even talked to the girl who he supposedly cheated with (after getting the ok from her friends), and she confirmed it as well. This all came to a head when one of my friends told me that she had walked in on him with her roommate the other night. I knew the SO from HS, and I felt like she deserved to know (if it changes anything, I knew that he had asked her for an open relationship right before college, and she had said no). I told her everything I knew, and sent screenshots of what other people had told me. AITA here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(this is basically the intro from my post last night, if you want the aftermath, go look there)",

And it lasts longer than some of our conversations. So I expressed my displeasure with the situation. \n\nSometimes while we’re in the phone one on one I might space out here and there and not hear what she says, and I compared her conversations with her friends with that saying it’s about the same.

      "description": "I am the oldest child of four and I am fed up with babying my mother. My mother is a single mother and has had truly a rough time in her life, but was impatient with us (her kids) growing up because she worked multiple jobs and was exhausted, short-tempered, and could be downright cruel when pushed (ie. corporal punishment for any spectrum of acting out). Because she worked so much, I became a pseudo-guardian to my younger siblings and a pseudo-partner to my mother. I never complained or spoke back, sometimes because she taught me not to, but also because of a looming grief she carries from my younger brother passing away years ago. \n\n\nOur relationship has gotten better now that I am a mid 20-something and have been a bit removed from the house, but I have given her so much slack all this time. She still tracks my location though I live away, I still rearrange my life when she needs me, I still send money home even though she now has a job that pays much better, I still listen to all her complaints, and give her the feeling like she can still control my life. I have always given her the benefit that she's not just scared something can happen to me, but that she has had to bury her child and fears death striking another. \n\n\nHowever, I have developed intense anxiety from her worries being pushed onto me for all these years and have grown very weary of answering to her despite being completely autonomous. She doesn't just give me her opinions, she demands I follow them. There is no discussion with her, no conversation. I am exhausted and find myself lashing out more and more because I feel so suffocated. She doesn't seem to recall the bad times, belittles the responsibility I had to take on with my siblings, doesn't remember hitting me growing up, has never recognized the impact of my brother's death on my or my other siblings, and says I'm being dramatic by claiming I have anxiety.\n\n\nThe latest incident was that she cut my off while I was telling a story to my uncle, and I snapped a bit, telling her to stop cutting me off and speaking for me. She was so insulted she cried, said I was venomous and malicious, and refused to come out for dinner despite it being my uncle's birthday. Eventually, I went up to her and apologized for upsetting her in hopes she would rejoin the family. My mother's response was to victimized herself, bringing up her hardships and she's doing her best, that she's under so much pressure from my absent father, and of course, that I can't imagine what she goes through on a daily basis.\n\n\nI'm exhausted, but I don't want to be mean. I've tried setting boundaries, but she takes them as insults. I am snapping back at her more and more. Am I being dramatic? Am I being an asshole and not respecting her? Do I just suck it up and put up with her?",

      "description": "Throwaway, because some of my friends know my main account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is currently mad at me and not picking up her phone, so I decided to make a post on here, just to check if I am morally justified in my actions.  \n\n\nHere´s what happened:  \n\n\nWe (my girlfriend and I) were just hanging out on our phones, when I opened Instagram and the first thing that popped up was a rather revealing picture of a (previously close, now not so close but still in regular contact) female friend of mine. My girlfriend also follows her, and therefore knows that she often posts pictures like these. An argument ensued, as my gf asked me to unfollow her, because it hurts her that I would follow and \"stalk\" (I never visit her profile; I only see her pics in my feed) such a \"slut\". I insisted that following this \"slut\" was not morally wrong, as she and I were friends, and told my girlfriend that she does not get to command me to unfollow friends of mine because she doesn´t like what they post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I want to clarify that the girl in question has two Instagram accounts, one \"main\" account, where she has a few thousand followers and posts these revealing pictures, and a second account, which is meant for friends only. I follow her on both accounts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe argument went back and forth for a bit, until my girlfriend had to leave my house a few minutes later. She called me later on and told me that even though the girl on Instagram is a friend of mine, I don´t need to follow her main account; it should be enough for me to follow her \"friends-only\" account. I replied that I was morally right to follow her on both accounts, as she is my friend and I want to know what´s going on in her life. We fought a little and she ended up hanging up on me. She´s not answering my calls as of right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should also mention that I don´t really care about  having access to those \"slutty\" pictures. It´s the principle of the matter (my gf can´t dictate what friends I follow on social media) that´s important to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

He on past record said he hopes I choke on my salad, hope  that I get run over crossing the street (and ex bf dies when he hits me with the car), wish that he could beat me up every time I touch my friend.

      "description": "(First off, throwaway because a lot of people here know my reddit)\n\nSo, I'm a (male) student at a university in New England, which is pretty well known for its fast pace and constant workload. Towards the beginning of the year, I learned that one of the girls on my floor was in the same Running Club as me (We'd meet and go on runs 3ish times a week for PE credit). I'd always see her at those meetings, but not a lot else because she's super busy, and has just about zero free time. \n\nFlash forward to when she decided she wanted to actually join the Varsity Cross Country program here, and needed to complete a rigorous, several week long training program to do so. When she came back to the Club meeting, she explained she wouldn't be joining them anymore because her runs didn't match up with ours. They said no problem, and she talked to me about it a little bit before she left for that day's run. It was something like 3 miles at a decent pace, but in the late afternoon in a city she wasn't familiar with, but she really didn't care. At that, I offered to go with her, so that way she wasn't running about the city alone. She agreed, and that was the first of many such times that happened. At least twice a week I'd run with her, (typically pretty intense ones) and then help her with any other things she needed to do for the plan, whether that was timing sprints, or being a finish line, etc. \n\nIt was an awesome moment when she finally did make the team, though, and now had actual real practices and even less time on her hands than the effectively zero she did before. Which, was disappointing for me, because I really did enjoy spending the time with her, as I really do think she's a wonderful girl. \n\nHowever, one thing that came out of our running relationship was that I learned she had a printer/scanner in her dorm. This mattered to me, because my math professor has us write our homework on paper, and turn in a scanned pdf of the work. Her scanner meant that I could avoid going all the way to the library to do so. \n\nNow everything comes together and is the genuine place I have to ask if I'm an asshole:\n\nThe same week that she was accepted onto the team was out first week of break, and upon returning, we would have no more runs together, but also one of my roommates brought back a scanner/printer from home. I could now just as easily scan the things in our dorm. However, with the fact that her and I no longer ran together, I kept using her scanner as an excuse to go in and talk with her, seeing how things were going, offering support or encouragement when things weren't going well, and celebrating when things were. All of this, I should note, was again because I really enjoy spending time with her, even if its just a couple minutes. But deep down, I feel bad because this little bit of time that I bug her always seems to be her time before showering and turning down for the night. Despite the fact that I always insist I can manage other ways if she's busy, she always makes a little time to help me out. \n\nGiven that she doesn't need to... but it'ts my excuse to spend time with her, do you think that makes me an asshole? Am I wasting her time, or adding unnecessary delay to her schedule do you think? Or is it okay in some way? ",

      "description": "I'm a 28 y/o male and in my immediate family I have all women, mostly this is because I was raised by my mother and have no contact with my father's side of the family due to a messy divorce when I was young. My two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. \n\n\nAbout 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. Originally this was to see one of the Magic Mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. Originally it didn't bother me, because I'm an adult and I have my own life, and my own house, and I really didn't even think about it. But an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. My aunt's birthday was in January and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. So I bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. \n\n\nWhen I asked what was going on for her birthday, I was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. This kind of irked me because when I mentioned I bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. I felt pretty left out since I am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. \n\n\nI griped about and was told that I was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. I agree with that, but once again, I'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was I was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when I asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. \n\nAt this point I was VERY annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. Nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so I decided I needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. So I removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my Facebook. Now my phone is being blown up and I'm being told that I'm immature and I need to grow up. I responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and I'm just going to follow that example. \n\n\nAm I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "For some context, I grew up in an abusive household where instead of gifts and love for birthdays and Christmas, I got religious sermons and beatings for not being simplistic and humble. I've only recently left that household after 23 years of abuse, and am now on my own.\n\nSo. My birthday was two days ago (December 15th) and a few months ago, a friend ive had for two years up and asks me what i want to do for my first birthday party. She knew what was going on in my house, because she and I got very close during that time and I felt that she was trustworthy. So I tell her that I just would like to have a nice dinner with her and my other friend, since I don't have many friends. \n\nNo presents, no flashy decorations, nothing. I just wanted their company and a night out to hang. She tells me that she is absolutely going. I confirm with her a month later, the week before and the day before, because her work tends to call her in at crazy times, but she assured me she took the day off. My other friend, however, could not make it suddenly, because she had a death in the family. Of course I understood and told her that ill be thinking of her and her family.\n\nNow the day comes and I get to the restaurant first and get to the table. I text my friend to tell her that I arrived and will wait for her. 15 minutes go by and I get a text saying that her work called her in and she is absolutely needed and she is so sorry. I tell her I understand and I hope that work goes well. Then I get up from the table, cancel it and go home. \n\nI get home and I cry. I cried bitter tears. Then I picked myself up because I told myself that I was an adult and these things happen all the time, and there's no reason to cry.\n\nQueue yesterday.\n\nI decide to go on instagram for the first time in forever and guess who I see? My friend and her boyfriend with a group of people at a nightclub downtown. Time stamped for around the time I was sitting alone at the restaurant.\n\nMy heart sank and I cried again. I never asked for anything but her company and she not only ditches me, but she lies to me in the process.\n\nI just left a comment on the photo saying \"I hope it was fun.\" And she has been trying to call me all day since then. I don't want to have anything to do with her right now...\n\nDid I do something wrong? Am I the asshole?",

I texted her today  to confirm our date details, we are going to a cool little bar/restaurant that just so happens to be dog friendly. That’s when she drops the, “I know it’s dog friendly but FYI I’m allergic to dogs.” I ask her how allergic and she says she gets asthma from them. She said she plans to visit an allergist and get an inhaler so that she can be amongst the dogs. So I obviously have a dog and live in an apartment. I train my dog really well because I don’t believe in kennels. So he is really well behaved, but they has free reign of the apartment. We also cuddle together every night in my bed. One of my favorite things to do after work during the week is go to the dog park. \n\nSo, I plan on still going on the date with her just because I don’t wanna just cancel and flake on her. But, I don’t think I am going to pursue a relationship any further. Does that make me an asshole? \n\nBonus question: Should I not even go on the first date with her if I already know that I’m probably not going to go on a second?

The conversation basically went like this:  \nMe:\"Hey, G, K, I need to tell you guys something, and this is because I'm a bitch and can't keep things to myself, not because of you.\" (Even though it is because of them)  \nG&amp;K: \"Ok, go ahead, C! What is it?\"  \nMe: \"M and I sometime's feel a little left out, and I find it kind of selfish that you guys don't make much of an effort to talk to us as we do with you guys, and again, it isn't your fault at all.\" (It was.)  \nThey were silent for a minute, and then started getting upset at me. G told me that if I didn't have anything nice to say, then don't say it at all. K stayed silent. \n\nSince then, me and K have made up a bit, but G has gone to sitting with people that me and others have told her are bad influences (An ex who has multiple times, threatened and harassed her, and a girl who talks shit about her friends behind their back), just to get away from me. \n\nAm I the asshole, or is G?",

      "description": "I have two really close friends that recently had some drama. Henceforth FA (friend A) and FB (friend B).\n\nFA had been in a relationship with this Absolute trash human being for around a year. The guy was extremely emotionally manipulative.\n\nThe ATHB had said he wanted a break.The Catch: He was a cheater. He would tell this spiel to other girls about how his current gf was cheating on him and he couldn't bring himself to leave her ectect. Bullshit.\n\nSo FA eventually found out from the girls he was texting that he was doing this (BTW most of them were her friends) She confronted him, he apologized and guilt tripped her into waiting for him to get his shit together.\n\nFA waited and waited. Eventually she started to realize how full of it this ATHB was. She dumped him officially. No more breaks. Another guy immediately started showing interest in her and ATHB throws a fit about her being unfaithful and doing this to hurt him.Just a manipulative douche. He did things like crying in front of her saying he was depressed and begging for her to forgive him.\n\nThe whole time this was going on FA had been venting to me and FB. After FA official dumps ATHB he follows her around like a kicked puppy trying to guilt trip her.FB then explains to me that ATHB has been talking to her and she's starting to catch feelings. I immediately shut her down and let her know that is a very bad idea. FA's wounds are still extremely fresh and ATHB is a douche.\n\nSo FB “takes my advice”, but I noticed her getting extremely close with ATHB. So now FB was following ATHB around like his kicked puppy.\n\nI bring this up to FB and ask what's going on. She tells me that she has been friends with ATHB for a long time. She sympathizes with him because she knows his side of FA and ATHB's break up. Also FA is starting to see another guy. FB makes the argument that FA must be over ATHB so its okay for FB to date him. This is a bad idea.\n\nEveryone knows what happened between FA and ATHB. FB is going to look extremely bad in front of her peers for some douche that will treat her like trash. And it's just a plain douche thing to do, date your best friends ex. That's a big NO.\n\nFB goes behind FA's back and starts dating ATHB. I was one of the last to find out and it really pissed me off. The fact that FB didn't tell me and that she completely ignored my warnings.\n\nFA was very distraught and it was a blow to her already fragile self worth. She was insecure that maybe SHE was the problem. If her best friend chose her ex over her, was her ex really the bad guy? \n\nIt was really painful to watch and made me more angry at FB. The relationship between FB and ATHB lasted a week before she realized that what everyone had been telling her was right.\n\nFA and FB haven't spoken in weeks and FA recently gave me an ultimatum between them. I don't feel like I can trust FB anymore. I want to just cut her off.\n\nWould I be the asshole for abandoning my friend who broke girl code?",

I find this attitude upsetting, as he's even stated he's okay accepting the risk of the dog running in the road. We live in a large city with a lot of traffic, which does have a mandatory leash law. I also don't trust that a dog with aggression issues would be safe off the leash all the time to everyone else. WIBTA if I reported him through the city's site for minor offenses? I have his name and general location because of the posts, and screenshots of the comments made about the dogs behavior and the \"risks\" he has accepted. ",

The thing is, he requested today off to do just that.\n\nHe also calls off frequently enough to be annoying and it almost always fucks me over and I have to stay, like, 2 hours over my time. Which is nice on the paycheck, but super annoying. \n\nHe's got a two year old son who he can never seen to find a babysitter for, single father, or the boy is sick. I swear this kid \"had\" the stomach flu 10 times in the month of March. \n\nI've gone in and covered for a shift he called off quite a few times and even switched shifts with him so he wouldn't be losing money. \n\nI'm scheduled to have the next two days off and I was quite looking forward to them.

      "description": "I've been talking to this guy for a few weeks and we hit it off immediately. We even had a short coffee date during lunch break, and we were on the same vibe. He was funny, charming, similar sense of humor. Everything went great. I should add that we had sex talks as well, discussing kinks and stuff. \n\nSo we decide to have a real date and then he asks if I'm on birth control. I think a few hours and cancel the date. He was confused saying it's just an innocent question, unlike all the stuff we talked about before. And we were both hinting that we will have sex on the first date, so what's wrong about birth control question?\n\nMy reasoning is this: if a guy is about to have sex with someone he just met, he MUST be jumping out of his way to use condom. It's a MUST no matter how many times we flirted dirty. And if he even thinks of not using a condom with a girl he just met, that means he was likely to do it before, which means he is at a much higher risk of having an STD and I'm not cool with that. \n\nI don't trust people who even entertain the idea of having sex with a person they don't know without a condom. I can't risk that even if he ends up using a condom. Doesn't matter that we discussed the sex positions or what we like in bed. I want to feel safe and I don't feel safe even if he thinks of not using a condom on a first date even for a second. \n\nHope I explained my reasoning well. Question is - am I the asshole for that line of reasoning? ",

      "description": "Me(15f)&amp;two friends,my bff Mia&amp;a friend Ava went to the mall 2 days ago. Ava is super pretty&amp;charismatic but lies, gossips&amp;makes mean jokes ALOT. Mia is a nice person but sometimes when shes around Ava she gets way bitchier.\nSo we go to the mall&amp;decide to pick outfits for each other. We go to the changing rooms,show off the outfits etc. Afterwards I get out of the outfit&amp;begin hanging all the clothes up on the hangers. Opposite me I hear Ava barge into Mias changing room (curtain doors)\n“Omg! What if I wasn’t changed!” Mia exclaims.\nMe, still in bra&amp;underwear, calls over to them to NOT TO COME IN because I’m not changed. But what do you know, about 1 min later as I finish hanging the clothes up Ava rips open the curtain.\nI am VERY insecure about my body&amp;all my friends know this. At this point im eating 500cals a day to try&amp;lose all this fat. Ava&amp;Mia look at me in my bra&amp;undies &amp;crack up laughing at me. Then Ava finally closes the curtain. Im humiliated. I feel exposed&amp;ugly&amp;fat. Once im out I tell them my mum texted&amp;i had to go.\nAt school the next day im cold to them both. I still felt disgusting&amp;humiliated by what they did. Mia notices but has no clue why I was mad. She texts me&amp;asked what happened. I eventually say ‘ava does shitty things&amp;you always go along w/ it&amp;it makes me feel like shit’. she apologizes for ‘whatever she did’ &amp;we agree to move on\nExcept, school today, she was cold&amp;distant. I tried talking to her but she barely acknowledges me. I’m confused not because i’m a hypocrite but because she asked for us to move on. I decide that if she didn’t want to move past it, fine,&amp;I stop trying to be friendly. Then I overhear her telling Ava what I texted her (in confidence)@ recess. @ lunch Mia asked if we can talk&amp;I said sure. We go outside&amp;she wants to know why I was mad at her, but I hate talking about insecurities&amp;still feel humiliated so I say I don’t wanna talk abt it&amp;just that we should move on. THE MOMENT we get back inside Ava whisks her off ‘to go to their lockers’. A friend,Liv, then tells me that the two had been confronting her earlier&amp;trying to make her say why I was annoyed Apparently, Ava told her she ‘simply nudged the curtain a little bit&amp;immediately closed it&amp;apologized profusely’ when Liv asked if anything happened at the mall. Ava denied laughing@me&amp;Mia said nothing. I get back to the lunchroom&amp;Ava&amp;Mia are there. Then Liv demands we resolve our problems&amp;starts clearing every1 out the room to leave us alone. I bolt because I know theyre as pissed as I am&amp;I hate talking about my insecurities. Liv follows&amp;apologizes. When we get back to the room, Ava fixes me with a glare&amp;leaves w/ Mia trotting behind her like a lost puppy. Afterschool me&amp;Mia make eyecontact at our lockers but we dont talk.\nI feel like shit&amp;I don’t know whose in the wrong. Mias generally a really good friend &amp; i wish things hadn’t gone like this. There is more but this is the main stuff that happened.\nAITA?",

      "description": "I paid for 10 sessions of personal training just to learn some basics so I could start working out on my own afterwards. \n\nMy trainer assured me multiple times that at the end of the 10 sessions I would receive a personalized exercise plan with all my baseline statistics. \n\nOn the last day, instead of going over this exercise plan as promised, he aggressively tried to sell me on one of his group classes. I’m bad at saying no so I just said I would have to think about it and I would let him know. He said to come in on Wednesday for free.\n\nOn Monday he texted me asking if I made up my mind. I politely declined, thanked him for the excellent training, and asked if I should still come in on Wednesday (assuming this would be when I would get my exercise plan). He didn’t respond, which was odd because he usually responds fairly quickly.\n\nWednesday morning I text him “is everything alright?” and he promptly replies with a long ass sales pitch text telling me how he “doesn’t give this deal to everybody” and “it’s a crazy no brainer bro.” He offered to give me the whole first month free. I again explained that I would love to but could not for financial reasons and would hate to waste his time by taking the free month. He did not respond.\n\nA week later I get an email from the gym asking for feedback on my training experience. I wrote something like “Not a great experience. Was promised a personalized exercise plan but just got an aggressive sales pitch and he stopped replying to my texts after I politely declined.”\n\nI thought this was anonymous but apparently not because a few days later I got a super defensive text message from my trainer asking why I didn’t just ask about the plan, that he wasn’t ignoring me he just “gets busy,” and that he “went above and beyond to take care of me.”\n\nHe’s right that I could’ve just asked about the exercise plan, but I felt like I was being ignored, and I figured it’s not worth the trouble cause i can easily just make one myself or find one online. \n\nI thought he was really nice during the training so I feel bad that I may have gotten him disciplined for no reason.\n\n",

      "description": "So long story short.\n\nA dude from my grade decided last year that he wanted to be a rich artist. His qoal from the start was to earn a lot of money, at least that's how he talks about it in interviews.\nDuring this year he has gotten a lot of exposure, he is working together with our parish and earning a respectable amount of money for a high schooler. I believe that recently he even got his own art show at another city and has held multiple ones here where he lives. \n\nThen I discovered something. All of his art work looks heavily inspired by an artist named Basquiat. So heavily, that when I showed pictures to my friends, they all immediately saw similarities.  (For an example the dude from my school paints the exact same faces and adds words, just like Basquiat does, only my acquaintance doesn't write them out completely. Even the colours are mostly same)\nNow the dude is kind of an ass also, he thinks he is better than everyone and pretends to be this serious artist. After he started earning money from his paintings his ego went through the roof and most people would agree. \n\nSo I've been doing silent exposing already, showing Basquiat's works to my friends and making them aware, but I could do more.\nOur school has a popular account on Instagram that over half of the students follow and it only posts memes of our school, a way to vent our frustrations. Nobody knows who runs it, but it's secretly me and my friend. \nMy friend after hearing about this had an idea to post about it on our page, but I argued against it. Yes, the dude is a douche. Yes, the things he does are wrong. But, I don't want to make him feel like shit. \nIt feels to me like it is morally wrong to expose someone like that, especially because the dude himself has a lot of problems with his family and in his personal life.\n\nSo, Reddit, would I be the asshole if I exposed him for plagiarizing a famous artist's work?",

      "description": "My mom, my brother(42) and I(30) lived together and shared expenses on an apartment. Since I went to med school that was paid by my mom and my brother, as soon as I graduated my brother sat down with me and said that it was only fair that now I should return the favor and let them breath a little financially speaking. So all the bills were shared in the following way: 50% paid by me (who earned the most), 30% by my brother and 20% by my mom. I stayed home for 5 years after graduating. But my dream has always been to marry and have my own family. I met the man of my dreams, but he lived in Norway. At that time Brazil was going through a very terrible economy and I was also not doing well with my health and I ended up being unemployed for 8 months. I sought for jobs every single day but they were simply not hiring. By then my brother was already very pissed at me, because if it was for him I'd have had a governmental job as a coroner or labor doctor. Which I never wished to work with. But they are extremely stable jobs which you can't lose unless you make a terrible mistake.\nIn my field one finds jobs online, there is no such thing as going door to door and delivering CVs. So since I was unemployed anyway, I decided to come to Norway and spend time with my then boyfriend. My brother only got more pissed at me and said I was wasting my time \"playing doll house\"(sorry, I don't know how to translate this. He insinuated that me living with my boyfriend and taking care of his 2 kids was just a kid's play). I reassured him repeatedly that I was looking for a job and just couldn't find one. Even tried out of my state without any luck.\nHe slowly started avoiding me and stopped talking to me as much. Then I got married and moved here to Norway. He never even congratulated me. I confronted him about his whole attitude as it was deeply hurting me as we had always been best friends and he is a father figure to me. He said that I abandoned the family. I tried explaining that I had finally found the right person and in a new country I'd have so many opportunities. But he insisted on his point and said that if I had found a good man he would have helped me financially so I could honor my share with the bills. But I never thought it was my husband's place to give me money for anything.\nIt has now been 2 years since he stopped talking to me and my mom tries her best to convince him to change his mind but he won't budge. I harbor no harsh feelings against him and I have forgiven him over this whole thing and I just want him back in my life. But his persistence on the point just makes me wonder if I am the asshole in this whole situation!?\nThank you for reading.",

      "description": "My 4 and 6 year old started baseball for the first time this season. Yesterday, the third day of practice my 4 year old, a “parent helper” (coach came at the end of practice) took my son by his hand and swung him 5 times as fast as he could in a circle. After the shock of what happened wore off and after witnessing my son cry and scream while laying in the dirt, team mom goes over. Practice was almost over, so at the end I told her to please speak with the coach and the parent and tell them not to do that. 1. It’s dangerous and could harm him and 2. He was visibly upset (and stated today he did not want to return). Now, I do regret not running over and telling the parent right then to never do it, but I didn’t want to make a scene in front of my son and 12 other 4 year olds. \n\nAITA if I bring this up again today before practice starts? I plan on talking to the coach and the man again and restating to not touch him or play rough with him. \n\n",

Our week goes like this, during the weekdays me and my brother have classes while my mom works, we all go home together, clean the house a little and cook dinner. Now that our aunt is at home, she literally does nothing the whole day, and just waits for us to cook, she eats and leaves the table. Me, mom and my brother would divide the tasks, I would clean the table, mom does the dishes and my brither throws the garbage out. She literally does nothing, and on weekends we work together dping our weekly  general cleaning. And still she does nothing, she just stays in her bedroom watching YouTube and goes out when there is food on the table. My aunt says that she wants to help around the house but uses the excuse \"My legs hurts dear\" all the time. Me and mom complains about how lazy she is.

      "description": "Now, this already sounds pretty bad for me, but you got to hear me out here. So about three years prior, my dad built a greenhouse, it was a big deal, cost a lot of money, and you know just took a lot of energy. This thing was expected to last a while, which is part of the irony of the situation when last year, a storm came in and pretty much destroyed our entire backyard- the greenhouse included. We were away on kind of a vacation while this happened, and some neighbors of ours' sent us pictures and we got to see the desolated greenhouse pieces all over the place. My dad was really sad, understandably, but for some unexplainable reason, I got the giggles and started laughing my ass off at this. My dad got so mad, and he still talks to me like it was my fault the greenhouse got blown over. This is the situation.\n\nI don't think I'm in the wrong here, yes it was disrespectful, but that doesn't mean I necessarily am at fault. It's not really fair to proclaim me at wrong when you can't even really help laughing, it just happens, and I tried to play it off, but he saw it immediately. Laughing is not something I can control, especially when we just keep seeing more. And even if it was, the greenhouse was not good for our family regardless, it was built to make us money, but after almost three years, it didn't even pull half back of what it cost us. The thing was hurting us more than anything, and stopping my dad from getting a more well-paying job that could actually get us more money, which I think is the whole reason we had it to begin with.\n\nFortunately, the greenhouse was covered on insurance, and we got another one built back up in its place. This one is even better than the last one, so I've been kinda off the hook, but he still reminds me every now and then of what I did. AITA here? Laughing is beyond my control, and I couldn't help myself at all, I think this is kinda an overreaction.",

      "description": "This happened last night.\n\nI live in a student hall, and I hangout with a nice group of neighbors. They're super friendly, we drink beers, smoke weed and listen to awesome vinyls.\nI'm used to hanging out with one particular dude, we like to have deep conversations about life, relationships etc. We'll call him Tim.\n\nThe other day Tim told me that he has eyes on a certain girl. Erica. Erica has a boyfriend, but he's still attracted to her. She put him in the friendzone and leads him on by going on dates. They even slept together, but did nothing. She just likes taunting guys.\n\nLast night we're having a party at Tim's place, and Erica is there. She keeps looking at me the whole night. Her friend Tiffany went to my ear and told to me :\n\n- \"Go on, she likes you. You can bring her home tonight!\".\n\n-  \"No way. Tim has eyes on her and he has kind of a crush. I can't do that to him\".\n\n- \"Who cares ? It's only your neighbor\".\n\nI still refuse and tell her that I can't do that to Tim. She asked me \"do you like her ?\" and I said yeah, she's hot.\n\nShe made obvious suggestions that there was something going on between me and Erica in front of everyone, including Tim. I was so embarassed. I didn't know how to react.\n\nOn one hand, last year I broke up with my girlfriend of 1.5 years. Her memories were kind of surfacing again these past few days, and it felt really good to have a hot girl hitting on me. On the other hand, I feel weird about it because of Tim.\n\nTiffany told me \"Okay. She told me nothing will happen. She just needs a place to stay\". I finally give up and say fine, ok. But he can't know.\n\nHer friend says \"I'm going to say to Tim that she's going to sleep at my place. Then she can just go to your place instead.\"\n\nShe does that, and then they leave, and other people as well.\n\nTim then says to me \"Damn it ! Erica was probably going to sleep here tonight, until Tiffany suggested she go with her! Fuck.\" It seemed to really affect him.\n\nI said \"yeah... Fuck. That sucks.\" and then I hung around for one last beer and left to my place.\n\nI then meet Erica. She says \"I have a boyfriend. I just didn't want to sleep with Tim.\" I replied \"Yeah sure, whatever. I got space it's no big deal.\"\n\nWhile we were together in bed, I felt a bit awkward. She's quite younger than me (she's 20 I'm 27). I didn't really know what to talk about. She made sure not to sleep close enough, so I felt weird trying to make any move towards her. Next morning, I'm feeling horny as hell. I think \"fuck it, I'm making a move\". So I start touching her around. Pretty soon I have my hand under her top. She's pretty into it and she puts her arm around me. I keep working on it, and I slowly approach the vagina. And right there she says \"no. you can play, but until there. I have a boyfriend\".\n\nI didn't feel comfortable about it so I didn't go any further. =.And got the bluest balls ever.\n\nNow I feel weird vis a vis of Tim. Am I the asshole for sleeping with her ?",

      "description": "I teach second graders. Sometimes during lunch/supper I'll catch them eating Hot Cheetos. They're not supposed to bring outside food, and are just to eat what we give them (not our rule, but a rule mandated by the State agency that supplies us food), but sometimes they'll sneak it in their backpacks or get it from the older kids. \n\nOf course, they'll run up to me, jumping up and down  with their tongues sticking out, asking if they can get water.\n\nAt first, I told them to get water and lectured them about following the rules of our program (no outside food), but after multiple times, I've grown kind of bitter. So since I'm already annoyed at them for breaking the rules, now I'll just feign ignorance and act like I didn't hear them as they jump up and down asking for permission to get water. I'll do this for a good 10 seconds then tell them to go, lecturing them along the way.\n\nPart of me feels bad, but the other part says this is the consequence of their actions. AITA?",

      "description": "I have this friend who I met at my last job.  We got along really well so we stayed friends after I left.  We try to get together once or twice a month.  There was a time when she was pretty blatant about flirting with me, but I wasn’t interested in that and basically just played dumb and oblivious and she stopped eventually.  \n\nLately she’s been having a hard time dating.  It’s been a consistent topic of conversation.  She does online dating and has been getting matched and then ghosted.  I’ve just been trying to be a good friend.  Telling her not to give up, there’s someone out there looking for you too, etc.  \n\nWe were having a few drinks yesterday afternoon and she brings up her latest bad date.   I think we were both a tiny bit buzzed and she was the mopey kind of buzzed.  She went on about how she doesn’t get what the problem is and then listed off her good qualities.  Then she asked me straight out if I would date her hypothetically.  It was instantly uncomfortable for me.  It brought back the awkward period of time she used to flirt with me. \n\nI just felt like I had to make it clear once and for all that I was not a potential partner.  Like I said I was buzzed and may have taken the hypothetical more to heart than I should have, but I really don’t know given our history.  I just pretty much blurred out an honest answer to her.  I probably wouldn’t date anyone in her age range.  That I want to have a lot of kids one day and not have to rush anything to do so.   I felt like garbage immediately, but at the time I really didn’t want to take it back.  She just made a joke about me being a pig.  I tried changing the subject, but shortly after she had to leave.  \n\nI texted her today apologizing if I was rude and blaming it on the drink, but she’s not responding.  ",

He is an energetic person, constantly on the move, cleaning, doing household upkeep, etc. The chores I do frequently are those that are personal to me, specifically I do my laundry, clean my bathroom, do my dishes, wash the counter after I'm done. I always put away my stuff and never leave it strewn around the house. I occasionally pitch in on mowing the lawn and I have shoveled the driveway multiple times so far this winter. Our trash is picked up weekly and I take it out when he's not home. I turn the lights off when I'm leaving and I generally act as respectfully as I can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, roommate has started calling me out for not doing chores in helping him maintain the house. Told me I should pitch in on vacuuming, cleaning the guest bathroom (which I've never used), washing floors, and I get the impression he just generally wants me to do more around the house. I never do any of these things. I never refused to help out but I'm wondering if I'm acting like an asshole by not doing any of it. TBH I feel like I'm a pretty damn good roommate by doing the stuff that I do, while the rest of his house is his responsibility.",

Usually when I talk to someone I get them to talk about themselves and/or topics they're interested in, their hobbies, etc. \n\nAnd on Maya's Instagram bio (we follow each other), she has a VSCO, which if you don't know if basically a place where people edit and store their photos. Basically, a lot of people post hundreds or thousands of photos on vsco but put only a few on Instagram. This is because a lot of people, Maya included, vsco pictures of daily life.\n\nAnyway, her vsco is linked in her Instagram bio. So I clicked on it, hoping to get some kind of idea what kind of person she is. And I really did. I learned what books she loves, how she's artsy, a romantic, her political affiliations, etc. I used this when talking to her, asking her about poetry, old movies, etc. \n\nI was mentioning this is another forum with some people I know online, and people called me a stalker. I don't think I'm anything close to a stalker when I'm literally using info she linked to in her bio. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, but I want to either confirm or deny this. \n\nSo, aita?",

I do the shopping every week and she’ll send half the groceries cost via PayPal (usually after me having to ask her 5 or 6 times). \n\nThis week instead of going thru all that, I sent a Paypal request to her for half the cost, now she’s literally offended about it. \n\nI honestly don’t see how that’s in any way offensive, and in fact, if anything it made it easier for her. She stomped away and says “I’ll never understand” why she found that so upsetting. \n\nThe only thing that comes to mind is that she secretly doesn’t think she should have to contribute towards our family expenses even though she works full time.

She introduced me and he went on his way and he was never spoken of again. I asked her best friend why she still talks to him if all she wanted was sex and she couldn't answer and told me that she'd have my back if it progressed but I feel like if I don't mention it to my partner directly this could become an issue down the line.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I confronted her about this, would it be fair to ask her not to talk to this guy so regularly?

      "description": "This is not me. This is truly for my cousin who's too young to have a Reddit account.\n\nTl;Dr Is my cousin Dominick (11) the asshole for getting into a fight with his mom because she doesn't want to get an appropriate sized tank for his beardie, because she says he doesn't need it (but does)?\n\nHis mom got him a bearded dragon (adult, super tame, former breeder, lemon yellow, 4 years old) for his birthday. He's 11 so obviously he doesn't have money to take care of him but it's still his pet, he just gets help from his mom for buying the things that the beardie needs.\n\nWith it she bought a 20 gallon long tank. This is way too small for a 16 inch beardie.\n\nHerbert is well taken care of. They live in AZ so the little guy gets to hang out outside while he's at school in a secured backyard habitat (chicken wire, a boxy thing in the ground so if he digs he can't escape, even has a camera that tracks movement since beardies don't move much, and has a door thing so he can get inside) The rest of the time he's either in his cage or hanging out with my cousin.\n\nHis mom buys Herbert's food and does everything else pretty well for him, including taking my cousin to the store often to buy him fresh vegetables and fruits that are safe for beardies, buying the necessary vitamins for him, buying a setup for dubia roaches to feed to him, and literally buying clothes for him. Also takes him to a vet whenever needed.\n\nShe says he won't need a bigger cage because he spends a lot of time outside. However he's obviously uncomfortable with the tank because he wall surfs and taps on the glass, there isn't much room for him, it's a basking rock cave thing,   food, hammock and a wood branch thing.\n\nThey can afford a large tank easily and have plenty of room to do so. My aunt has a really good job and makes 120k per year, big house and   central air lol. She just says it's fine apparently.\n\nMy cousin got in a fight with her because she says Herbert doesn't need a big tank, but even the vet said she should and my cousin does too. He has plenty of space in his room for it and just needs his mom to buy it.",

Their mother, my ex wife, lives abroad at the moment and I have full time custody as we don’t want to ship ‘em half way across the world every other week.\n\nI started dating a beautiful woman, let’s call her Jessica (32), two years ago now and we are getting on great. She moved in with me and the boys about a year ago and I feel like we are getting used to life together as a family. The boys like her and she is figuring out how to be a mother, which I love her madly for. I can only imagine how hard of a time I would have if I were in her shoes having to get used to a completely new way of life. \n\nAbout two months ago Jessica lost her job. She is living with me, I’m paying the bills and I fully support her. She doesn’t contribute with any money at this point and I’m okay with it - we’ve all been in tough spots and I love this woman. But then I asked her if she could look after the kids, pick them up after school and so on, and she completely freaks out. Calls me a complete asshole for using her as a babysitter and says that I am not taking the responsibility I should be taking as a father. \n\nI have struggled as a dad in the past, I wasn’t the most mature man when my kiddos were born and this leads to me taking her comment very close to heart. So I’d really appreciate some comments from a third person perspective. Am I the asshole for asking my unemployed girlfriend to look after the kids on occasion and pick ‘em up from school a couple of days a week?\n\n",

      "description": "I (24m) and my brother (21m) share a place together because he wanted somewhere to stay and it would save us money. I know it's not an ideal circumstance but sharing rent and living together was just easiest. It's been about two years. Generally, we get along fine. We don't have a super close relationship but we're still brotherly brothers. He's sometimes lazy, but after some nagging I can get him to help out around the house. Not a huge deal. \n\nAnyways, he hasn't gone to college or really isn't doing much in terms of long-term financial aspect. He dropped out of culinary school when he was 19. Since then, he's worked as a pizza slinger and delivery driver. That's fine, as long as he's working and can pay his rent I didn't have a problem with it. I'm in no position to control him or tell him what he should be doing with his life, and I try not to parent him. However, for the last two months he's been out of a job after getting fired. He became a store manager of the chain and they set him up to fail by telling him, \"You need to go manage this store and turn it around, or else you're fired.\" Well, \"this\" store was in the roughest part of the city and his coworkers were all drug dealers, wanna be gangbangers, or addicts. He was personally robbed at gunpoint twice there. That location is shit and always will be shit, so they canned him (apparently he didn't get along with the regional manager). They knew he couldn't improve the store. \n\nI get that is beyond his control and shit happens, and I want to help him out. I've been trying to help him find a job and whenever I try having a serious talk with him he doesn't talk much and kinda shuts me out.\"I don't know.\" \"I guess.\" \"I'm not sure\" are the responses I get. I try hinting at him that maybe trade school would be a good option. I know jobs don't fall off trees so I said I'd pay his share of the rent for three or four months until he can get some working shoes. That's no problem, I have the money to do that.\n\nIn mid October my boy who works in a management position for a beer and liquor distributor said the company had a job open, a warehouse job that started at $12.60/hr. The applications won't be taken until late November though. If he worked well and liked it there would be opportunities for positional transfers, delivery truck driving, sales, promotions, etc. which would all come with pay raises. I texted my brother and let him know about it and he seemed interested. I talked to him later that night with some more details. We a had a light conversation, and really the only hiccup is they want him to pass a drug tests. He smokes weed occasionally/somewhat frequently (honestly I don't really know how often, but it's not daily), and I asked him if he could try to get his piss clean or if that would be a problem. He said no he'll be okay, and it actually seemed like something he was excited about. Fast forward to last Thursday I bring him the application from my buddy and he said he decided not to apply. Irritated, I asked him why. \"Oh well... I uuh, I smoked the other day.\" You're fucking kidding me. No, I don't care that he gets high. He's an adult and can do what he wants, I was just frustrated beyond all hell that he pretty much lied to me and said he would prepare for the job. Not only did he ruin a good opportunity, he made me look like a dumbass when I told my buddy I'd have a prospective employee for him. \n\nI told him he needed to call mom and dad and see if they'd let him crash there because he's going to be leaving soon. I kind of yelled at him and told him I'm not going to parent him and provide for him if he isn't even trying and he made me look like a dipshit to my friend and all that. \n\nAm I the asshole? I really do want to help him and I don't want our relationship to be strained or awkward for the rest of our lives, but he also needs to understand he has to be able to live independently, work, go to school, or do something that benefits himself.

      "title": "AITA if I try to avoid people associating me with a certain 'friend' of mine?",
      "description": "(Sorry for the probably confusing title, I can't think of one that sums up my situation very well)\n\nThis is my first AITA post so please, don't hold back any judgement. Okay so, I'm a junior in high school and this year, a girl has sort of latched onto my friend group. None of us were really friends with her before because most interactions with her go poorly. She tends to be obnoxious and loud and gets offended very easily at thing that aren't intended to offend, despite commonly offending others and saying she is joking. Because of this, Girl does not have many (if any) close friends and is generally disliked in our class. So far this year there have been many problems in my friend group with Girl. Girl has lied about many things, made assumptions and actions that have hurt people, and gotten very upset at not being included in our friend group activities. We feel bad leaving her out but we know (based on past experiences) that inviting her would most likely result in a less enjoyable time. I know that she is probably longing to be part of a group and so her actions may reflect this but things don't seem to be getting better with time. \n\nNow onto my main dilemma with Girl. Personally I believe in trying to be a nice and civil person so I have never openly expressed my dislike of Girl to her and have always tried to include her a little bit, but I have definitely avoided becoming friends with her and avoid her in general. A few weeks ago it was Girl's birthday and I saw her in the morning because we are both part of student council and were required to clean up from the dance that had taken place the night before. I wished Girl a happy birthday and went home. A few hours later she texted me and said \"Put me on your \\[Snapchat\\] story for my birthday\"  This was the exact text, no \"please\" or \"hey would you mind\", or general politeness. Just a direct command and then some photos she wanted me to post. I was very angered this but since it was her birthday and I knew she probably just wanted to feel included I didn't want to say no. I felt that it was rude of her to demand, not even ask, that I post of a photo of her. We are not close friends by any means, we very rarely talk, she has been rude to me and good friends of mine, and I generally reserve social media posts for more important occasions in my life. So I stuck a quick \"Happy Birthday!\" on the photo and put it on my story, but went through the trouble to make it so that only Girl would see my story (the number of views would be anonymous so she would not know that no one else saw it). I didn't want people thinking that her and I were good friends, and I felt that she was using me to try and get attention on her birthday. I don't like being told what to do and I don't want to be associated with her. Eventually I felt like a jerk because she probably didn't get birthday wishes from people in our grade and no one else was going to post about her, so I allowed everyone to view the post. She didn't say thank you and eventually the story disappeared after 24 hours.\n\nWas I an asshole for going through all that trouble just so people wouldn't think we were friends? Is it worse to be honest and tell her that I can't stand her or is it worse to act like I like her when I actually despise her?\n\nLet me know if there are more details I need to include or if I was an asshole plain and simple. Thanks!",

      "description": "AITA for not wanting to hug my mom.? God I feel terrible writing this, and didn't mean for this to be that long...\n\n I am almost 30 and live with my parents (yes I'm a bit ashamed of myself but trying to get my life back together again). When I first moved it in with them I think my parents a few years ago they expected me to hug them when I got home from school or work(every single day. They are a bit traditional) I've eased off a bit and only hug my mom when she comes up to me because I feel like it is excessive and I feel I really need my space. I DO not enjoy these interactions and do it purely for her benefit. Coinciding with this is my mom's incessant questions one after another about how my day was. (My days are not that greatly eventful or interesting so I don't know why they expect to hear new things from me every day. Maybe that is my depression talking??? although its something I'm working on.) \n\nI have anxiety talking to them because they are always telling me how to evaluate my life. Since I am not given a lot of psychological space I try as much as I can to be protective of my physical personal space. At the same time I feel like I have to be respectful and make small talk with them. It also seems as if every time I'm near my mom (if we are both in the kitchen at the same time) she is always asking me questions. My mom says she is \"extroverted\" (and claims, or maybe it's possibly true- that she has undiagnosed ADD, and it is difficult for me to deal with because) I am introverted. I feel like I'm being interrogated and judged all the time. I don't know if she tries to talk to me because she feels like these \"conversations\" will strengthen our relationship. Every day when my mom comes home she comes over to hug me (but sometimes I am at my boyfriends house, or when I am home I just hide in my room to avoid this awkward interaction.) Now she has been through all sorts of stuff (undiagnosed ADD?), divorce years ago (has since remarried), has had cancer and survived. I feel guilty not wanting to hug her but I also feel like she is a bit oppressive and smothering. Although I would DREAM to move out, I am currently not prepared financially.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know she's been through a lot and just trying to enjoy the later years of her life but:\n\nDo I at least owe her hugs every time she comes home from her work? Should I solely let her initiate?\n\nLet me add that we are 2 completely different people personality-wise, and I find that I am triggered by her. I wish I had a better relationship with her but I don't know if I even can or care to anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My mom wants to hug me every day, and I want my personal space. Do I owe her my hugs?",

      "description": "Ok, So I met this girl at college and we became friends and I eventually developed feelings for her due to her humour and how often we would text and call, and work together in class. I confessed how I felt and was shot down and agreed to just be friends but now looking back I've realised how little I actually contributed and when I did I would be ignored or dismissed if she didn't think it was particularly important and previously on call she would say I only call you for the \"background noise\" and to not feel alone when she's at home but as soon as someone else texts her or her brother comes in she's quick to ignore the fact we're on a phone call so I don't feel like I'm valued as a friend and more as just someone she can call when she's bored of everyone else or no one else wants to talk to her. She's admitted before that she's a flirt and does so for attention claiming it's due to her Freudian personality and admittedly she's not the most attractive girl about average but I still liked her for her personality. Anyway, so I've been trying to get over my feelings for her so we can be friends and so I don't end up hurt when she eventually gets with someone and so I don't end up a bitter and hurt about being in the \"friend zone\". So, I've been purposefully ignoring and avoiding her whenever she sends one of her vague messages ( she keeps her messages vague and unpersonal so she can send them to more people and start more conversations with people) and told her when she texts me that I don't want to talk right now, but then she claims that I'm being a dickhead for not talking to her, I'm not sure if I'm acting like an asshole for trying to get over my feelings for her or if she's mad cause she's not getting my attention. I suppose on her side it seems like she's rejected me and I'm being salty about it but I've been cool with her after the rejection and talked to her since then but recently I realized I'm still not over her when I got stupidly jealous when she went to a mutual friends party where she admitted the mutual friend had been trying to flirt with her that night, although admittedly he was drunk. She tried calling me a few times tonight so I answered asking what she wanted to which she said she wanted the background noise and then didn't talk so I hung up saying if it wasn't important. She's called me a twat and a dickhead for not talking to her but previously we only talk about things she wants to talk about and I don't feel valued as a friend and more as a backup considering I held her in a high regard. I'm happy to talk to her once I get over my feelings for her but I don't want to explicitly tell her that cause she's already said that \"everybody already knows I rejected you\"I don't know whether it was a joke but that still hurt as well. So Am I The Asshole for not talking to/ignoring someone?",

I love to cycle at around 30-35 km/h, so for most people that's quite a fast tempo, but during heavy wind, I can only cycle about 5-10 minutes at those speeds before needing a rest.\n\nThat's why I use people sometimes as windshields. I cycle behind them, leaving a small gap and lean over my steer. This minimizes the wind from the front and allows me to rest while maintaining decent speed.\n\nAm I the asshole for this? Today I used a man on an electrical bicycle to block the insane winds coming from the front. He was obviously not having a problem with it due to his build-in battery motor, so I made good use of the opportunity, however, after about 10-15 seconds of slipstreaming behind him, he turned around. Irritated by my actions, he told me to either overtake him or stay at a far distance.\n\nI live by the rule that if there's an opportunity for improvement, I should take it, but if it annoys people or makes them uncomfortable, I don't want to do it anymore.\n\nAm I the asshole?

      "description": "When I was 16-18 I was deeply depressed. \nChaos in my family. Had serious problems with insomnia, sleep paralysis and eating. My mental health was a distaster. I was autistic\\ADD without having any clue. So I experienced all the problems that come with it, without understanding why. \n\nI am usually both cleanly and organised. But many people that have been deeply depressed, can probably relate to how difficult it can be to take care of personal hygiene. On top of this I have sensetive skin. Goosebumps hurt, so \"a little chilly\" for some is painful to me. Getting undressed, wet and cold to shower in the morning was not worth the pain. I also lived in a poorly isolated cellar, during swedish winter. So yes, in the depth of my despair, I was probably kind of gross. \n\nI had a \"friend,\" that slowly started to hate me. She ganged up with another girl, and they  were such stereotypical mean girls, it was nearly amusing. But when I tried to separate myself from them, they would follow me around. This girl often called me disqusting and was very aggressive toward me for being gross. She often punched or pinched me. She would give me nasty looks and remarks out of nowhere. She could easily discard me, my feelings or anything I said. It was like I was AIDS and had killed half her family. At first I just got stomped because it was so uncalled for. Sure, maby I was a bit gross but my grossness was not this horrible thing I put her through. Like her bullying actually was something horrible she was putting me through. But it seemed to her, that my grossness justified her behavior. But I never actually did her anything. \n\nI lived with her for a while and ironically SHE was disqusting. She was really messy, she left her underwear with menstruation blood, spread out all over our floor. In sweden we have little nicotine pillows that you put under your lip (it's called snus.) She would use these AND smoke. Then she would remove these wet, used nicotine pillows from under her lip, and place them on her night stand. They could lay in a pile for weeks, left permanent stains and they smelled like actual shit. If she ever bothered to clean and mop the floor, she would just leave the mop, bucket and water until it started to mold in there. She also had vaginal infections every other month. \n\nAt one point I had enough of her mean and unnecessary remarks, so I lashed out and pointed  all these things out. Even going as far as saying \"it's your moldy vagina that is infected every other month, so how can I be the gross one?\" She got so shocked she just froze, got red, then started laughing loudly before calling me a fucking cunt. This still grind my gears because calling someone gross is always mean, no matter how right YOU think you are. Gross is never not an insult. Grossness is also a lot of different things, and people are gross for many different reasons. But those reasons are never anyone elses business. Why was my grossness less okey then her grossness? ",

We're in a LDR and visit each other through the year. Usually whoever is the \"home team\" is the main driver for our adventures.

On highways he has weaved through traffic to speed past other cars (that I believe are under the limit, but we rarely go on highways, and this was a one-time thing).

      "description": "For context: I have a 12 year old male Akita, slightly overweight, and my father occasionally breeds and raises them. This Akita was to my knowledge the runt of the litter. His name is Titus.\n\nTitus, like the other dogs we have, is essentially affixed to my mother. He follows her around constantly, seldom taking the time to leave her out of his sight and do his own thing.\n\nThe average lifespan of an Akita is 10-12 years. He is the equivalent of a 90 year old, by this metric.\n\nNow the actual scenario: Due to his advanced age, Titus has been quite immobile and lethargic, usually laying down most of the time. He hasn’t been able to do much of anything recently, and his health has rapidly degraded. We moved to a new house a few days ago, which probably has him stressed out. He has been trying to constantly follow my mother around incessantly, however, he has been hurting trying to do so. He won’t ever lay down to rest, and I’m guessing is because he has a joint problem.\n\nHis health has been rapidly deteriorating. My parents want to put him down. I do not.\n\nThey think that, due to the misery he is in, he had a long and good life and is ready to die. They think it’s time for him to be put down so that he doesn’t have to live in misery anymore.\n\nI think that he needs to go to the vet first, and to be firmly adjusted to the new environment of the new house. The symptoms he has been experiencing is, I believe, expected for the nature of the scenario. I think he needs to be more thoroughly examined by a vet and receive proper treatment to improve the quality of his life, instead of heading to the last resort. She ended up making a full recovery. I think that Titus can make it at least several months more with a proper treatment.\n\nHowever, my parents think that this is just me being attached, and as a result, my desire for him to live means he has to live in misery. For some reason, they are totally opposed to getting him veterinary treatment. My father thinks that because he breeds Akitas, that he is familiar with their physiology and is adept in addressing health issues for them. He has been relatively successful up until this point. I think that this time he needs to relinquish his control over the issue to a vet.\n\nAm I being selfish and prolonging the suffering of my dog for not wanting him to be put down?\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

Not even stayed the night.\nI now tried to find a day where we could spend time with eachother, without putting unnecessary stress on her as i understand that helping her parents move is stressful enough.\n\nIt didn't work... Turns out that apart of Wednesday and Friday she has only time between lunch and dinner as for both she has to be home... Maybe cus her parents want it that way, i dunno.\n\nWednesday her dad has his free day and i understand that she wants to spend that time with him.\nFriday she meets a friend of hers.\nI dunno if she also has to abide by the same rules as me but...\n\nAnyway... I ask her about the next week as everything should be moved and unpacked by then (according to their plan).\n\nThe same spiel... Except Friday... No friend but the same rules as every other day.\n\nSo i decided i had enough.\nAll i wanted was a couple of days with her (2-3)to spend some time with eachother and relax.\n\nAll i got now... Tomorrow afternoon, Thursday afternoon, Saturday and Sunday afternoon, next Thursday, Friday, Saturday afternoon's.\n\nIn short...

On the first day we were walking home and AW spilt all they’re life story on how their mother was a drug addict and how their family abused them onto me and I said I would always support them.\n\nFast forward a few weeks later, AW was dating this boy and the two eventually broke up. AW said it was because the boy was dating another girl and that AW was a side chick. I believed them at first, but things started to seem sketchy. They would say all kinds of things like how they almost got arrested, their dad bought them weed, and how they got a tattoo (they’re 14 mind you).\n\nThings were starting to seem suspicious and I wanted to verify with the boy if the story AW told about their break up was true. He was baffled and had no idea, which pissed me off. At lunch I stormed up to AW and told them we needed to talk. During that, they told me that they had also spilt all that info on me in the beginning to make me stay and be their friend. I was so pissed. They said to make truce, that they wouldn’t talk to me if I would stop rolling my eyes at them. I said “I don’t make truce with c*nts” and stormed off.  Am I the asshole?",

Well one demanded a apology saying how I should’ve said that in a kinder manner and he deserves respect. He is the classic rich kid who can get his way 24/7. Well he pretty much convinced the whole friend group to block me at once banned me from the discord servers and cut me out of of their lives. I was already going to a different school so I was just screwed. Well about 3 months later they all want to be my friend again. Am I the asshole for telling a “friend” to shut up and then not wanting to be his friend again after he blocks me?",

      "description": "Long story short my ex and I had a less than amicable break up, and she continued to bother me until finally I told her to stay out of my life and that I never want to talk to her again.  About a month ago I was on bumble dating and a profile for her popped up.  She has a history of cheating, and cheated on anyone she has dated, myself included.  Would I be an asshole if I messaged this guy through an anonymous insta account to tell him?  Idk if they have some situation worked out or whatever, but I felt i would have wanted someone to tell me when she was cheating on me.  But I’m just torn if I should just stay out of it, or help a potentially oblivious guy out.  Unfortunately I forgot to take a screenshot so I don’t have the proof :/",

      "description": "Let's call this guy Caleb (although that's obviously not his real name, since we're both Indians). \n\nI'll admit up front, I'm jealous of Caleb. Hella jealous. Him and I, we're the difference between book smarts and street smarts. Let's put it this way. I can wax political philosophy and talk about different candidates positions for days. Caleb, on the other hand, doesn't give a fuck. But put us head to head in an actual election, and who'd win? Caleb. I have no charisma. He has all the charisma.\n\nAnd he's perfect, basically everything I *want to* be. He's a national-level baseball player. He's in the same level classes I am, but gets good grades cramming and cheating while I study- hell, I don't even need to study, I just do it because I have no friends or hobbies. He's friends with the group I desperately want to like me, but don't. He's dating my crush. He's dating my fucking crush. \n\nAnd I'll admit, I'm bitter. I'm hella bitter. For all my 'intelligence'- and I've grown up being told I'm a genius, that my IQ is off the charts, etc- everyone writes me off as an arrogant blowhard at best. And our entire lives, it's like we've been set against each other. We're two indian boys, whose friends are best friends, in an area with few indian people. And for all my supposed intelligence, he's winning.\n\nAnd he's always nice to me. Overly nice. I can never figure out if he's actually just friendly, or if he's mocking me. Because I know he sees me as a dork with no friends, for good reason. I've heard people talk about how nice a guy is, but I've also heard people talk about how bad a guy he is. I just don't know. Case in point, today. Me and my family is driving, and we just enter our neighborhood. I see Calen across on the sidewalk, hanging out with some friends and he waves to me. My dad turns around to go meet him. Caleb makes small talk with my dad, and then he says hi to me. I manage out a polite hi. My dad pulls away, and I hear Caleb say to his friends, 'he's really introverted'.  I lean out the window and shout 'I'm not introverted, I just really don't like you! By the way, I'm surprised you know the word introverted!' This was a really spur of the moment thing. But when I get home, my dad yells at me and says Caleb was just being nice. I'm not sure if he really was. Aita?",

      "description": "In a series of complicated events and conversations, my ex confessed to me over the phone that I wasn’t his first kiss, that he used to mess around going back and forth to his ex, and kissed other girls as well, which are things he has never told me in the 10 months that we’re together. Though he insists that he’s virgin and he just kissed other people. \n\nAnyway he told me that he’s clean, but out of shock (because he told me I was his first kiss and first everything), I asked which base has he been to with other girls in case I’m at risk for anything that can be transmitted through oral sex (that’s the furthest we have gone), and also because I wanted to know if our moments together were lies or real. I just didn’t want to live a lie thinking that he has never been there with anyone, since he was the first person I was physically intimate with. \n\nNot because that if he messed around with other people it’ll make our experience invalid or less than it was, it’s just because he lied about everything that I just had many questions and it kinda took away from how special those moments were. I also knew that there were STDs that could transmit through oral sex, so I just wanted to make sure that he’s okay so that I’m okay too. \n\nAnd immediately he got upset that I thought he’s a carrier of STDs, assured me that I was safe, and didn’t want to continue the conversation anymore. He also made it seem like it was super rare to get STDs through oral, which made me feel like he’s not really educated enough in this aspect &gt;&lt; \n\nAITA for asking him about his sexual history, or did he overreact to what I said?

      "description": "I don’t know where to start exactly because I want make this unbiased as possible to get a reasonable feedback. Here I go.. I work as a tutor in a small academy and watch over kindergarteners to 8th graders. Watching 8th grade is a bit challenging(Anyone who works with teenagers will know). Even though it’s challenging I’m able to stick through it because I know what it feels like to be their age with their problems so I try to stay that lay-back teacher. However teenagers have no social awareness and will take advantage of that. So it’s challenging to balance between chill and authoritative. With this in hand I like to think the kids and I have good(?) relationship. \nAnyways there is this kid let’s call him Eric. Eric has a tendency to do whatever he wants. I actually talked to him about it and he admitted that he has this fault. Today he was playing a typing test on the laptop even though the laptop is only strictly for Homework. Honestly I wouldn’t mind him playing secretively (what I don’t know wont hurt me). However Eric doesn’t care for this. He’s the i will play right in-front of your face type of guy. When I ask him he tells me that he finished all his homework and that I should let him play this. I told Eric to get off but he doesn’t listen. I just stare at him telling him to stop playing for 3 minutes but he continues to play and gives me all these reason why he should be able to play.\n\nThis continues and he then gets annoyed at me and leaves to a different classroom. A few minutes later I hear him arguing and trying to persuade another teacher why he should be able to play this game. This triggers me and I go over to him and I see him playing the game once again. I then shut off the computer and told him “I already told you not to play this game and you’re starting to piss me off” He then says something in the line of I should mind my own business. \nI got bit heated cause of that comment so I told him that he’s about to cross the line and he then gets quiet. \n\nAnd thats the story. There’s a lot of things going through my head but I just want an opinion on if I am being an asshole or not",

      "description": "I have a friend who I’ve known for about a year now (I’ll call her Kelly) and she’s been fine for most of it. But recently, she’s started to be a bit of a pain. \nFor example, she rarely says anything positive and judges people so easily. One time we were just walking around and saw a girl in a crop top and she said something along the lines of ‘I bet she’s just a stripper’. When these happen I usually just don’t say anything because I know if I do she’s going to make a big deal out of it.\nSecondly, she’s started calling all of our classes ‘useless’ and how she’s just ‘pissed and not going to care about them anymore’. I started saying how we’ll need them and how they were actually teaching us good stuff but she said she was going to become an ‘online spiritual counselor’ and ‘lead her own business’. And yet she still says she doesn’t need any of the classes. I asked her one day in class that if she hated them so much, why is she still doing the homework and coming to class?\nAnother small thing is that she’s recently become vegan. I’m not a vegan or vegetarian but I have nothing wrong with them at all. The only thing about this is the lectures she’s been giving me and other people. She’s saying how she ‘doesn’t want to support and industry that takes baby animals away from their mothers and kills them’. That’s not even how most farms work?? She then proceeded to say how ‘all farmers are mass murderers’. But what about the farmers that raise their animals with love then kill them humanely and use the whole body?? And she’s started shaming me and other people for eating meat.\nLastly, the biggest thing for me (although I think I might be making a big deal out of it). So, I’ve recently lost my grandfather who I was really close with and she knows. So I had to leave for a bit and when I get back, nothing. No hugs, no words of support, no acknowledgement that I was even gone, she just keeps reading her book and proceeds to ignore me. She then goes on to say that ‘she’s so sad because no one understands her and her harry potter memes’ and how ‘her brain is filled with sad thoughts’ because of this. So, no acknowledgement of how I actually am sad and depressed (and with good reason) and then proceeds to try to make me pity her and go all woe is me because no one thinks the harry potter memes she shows them is funny?\nThere’s more but I feel like I’ve already made a Ted Talk through this but I just want to know am I being unreasonable?",

We didn't have all out sex, but we did get to second base, which, to an insecure virgin teen, is pretty good. Few months later, I learn that my best friend of 10 years (who, btw, is a year younger than me but a loooot more so sexually active, and has had 3 serious relationships while I've had none : I don't think I need to spell out the inferiority complex there) as had all out sex with that same girl, multiple times. Then, and every subsequent moment that it was mentioned (a lot more often than you'd think), I feel very sad and depressed and angry. It's like I've been betrayed, or that my \"conquest\" was stolen. I hate feeling this way, because I like my best friend, and it's also pretty objectifying towards the girl. Am I the asshole here, or is it normal to feel this way?",

      "description": "My coworkers and I are planning a trip to Vegas. For reference, I’m a woman and gay, we’re all in early 20s, and there will be a total of 3 girls and 3 guys on the trip (including myself in this count). Maybe important to note that this is my first time going to Vegas.\n\nI usually don’t dress up and I usually don’t wear very girly clothes, so it was difficult for me to find a good outfit. My coworkers (the ones I’m going on the trip with) went shopping with me to help me pick out some outfits. After trying on a good number of dresses that I didn’t feel suited me, I finally found a lace romper that I thought suited me well. Basically, it was black romper, short, and lace from the midriff up. The lace covers my boob area and the rest is transparent but I’ll be wearing pasties to prevent any possible nipslips.\n\nI sent a picture of me wearing the romper to my gf (she’s not going on the Vegas trip) and she says that it’s too revealing of an outfit. I reassured her that I would be wearing pasties so no one is going to see my boobs or anything, but she is insistent that it’s still too much. We ended up getting into an argument. She said that what I was wearing wasn’t safe. She trusts me not to cheat on her, so that wasn’t the issue here, but she’s afraid guys would try to look or touch. Her reasoning is that it’s a safety issue, but I think it’s a bit overprotective. I told her I’m not going to get blackout drunk (I never have) and I was going to be responsible and I was going to stick with my coworkers and my friend (whom she has met before). To that, she said that even if I were responsible, other people in the club might not be. I ended up telling her to stop policing my body because that’s what I felt like it was. She thought it was ridiculous that I thought she was doing such a thing, so I can’t tell if I was overreacting or not. AITA?\n",

      "description": "The setting -\nThe 23:30 service from London Paddington to Didcot Parkway (a popular commuter route) on Saturday 24th November (yesterday); a big consumer shopping day in the lead up to Christmas. The train was packed, all seats taken and people standing in the aisles, and sat on the floor of the train near the doors.\n\nWe [mid 20’s couple] politely asked a middle aged couple to move from our pre-booked seats. They demanded to see the booking, before complying. The man stated “I can’t believe you’re asking an old lady to stand” whilst getting up. Other passengers audibly started tutting, and one young passenger offered his seat to the middle aged female. \nThey proceeding to moan for a good 10-15 minutes stood next to us that “our generation has no respect” and “chivalry is dead” amongst other passive entitled comments. We chose to not confront, instead putting our headphones in. I sat there afterwards, feeling like the asshole.\n\nOn reflection -\n1) I understand their frustration. I would be equally frustrated in that situation.\n2) I don’t understand the entitlement. We had pre-booked those seats - if sitting was of paramount concern, they should have pre-booked seats, knowing the service was likely to be rammed.\n3) Their behaviour was purely based on our age. If we were a similar age, I feel they would not have made such a commotion. \n4) It angers me that we were judged in that moment. Judged to be able bodied and less deserving of the seats - irregardless of the fact we had reserved them. \n\nSubsequently, because of the commotion the couple made, I was made to feel like we were in the wrong for asking them to move.\n\nFurthermore, I felt like the patrons of the train had judged us to be at fault, and “lacking respect” for asking older people to move.\n\nAt this point - I’d like to ask - AITA?\n\nIt’s now 02:40AM and I had to type this down - because all I can think at the moment is “Fuck these middle class, middle aged entitled pricks for judging us, and publicly making us feel like jerks” \n\nEDIT - Removed the details of why we booked the seats in advance. As pointed out in the comments by a user - this information shouldn’t have made any difference, however illustrates that the public make ageist assumptions. ",

      "title": "AITA For Not Sending A Reminder Text to A Friend To Meet Me For Dinner",
      "description": "So about a week back, last Saturday night, I had invited a friend of mine over to have dinner at my house on Sunday. We had already planned this twice before and either he or I was busy because of which we kept postponing. But we finally set a day and decided on a time for him to be at my place, 7pm. Fast forward to Sunday night, around 7, he wasn't there yet. He has had a habit of turning up a little late to get togethers at times but that's not something that bothers me because I'm the same way so I was pretty used to it. Anyway, I started making dinner to pass the time and before I knew it, it was 9. \n\nSent him a text asking where he was then and got a reply at 10:30 telling me that I forgot to send a reminder text and was only texting so late to cover up for the fact that I didn't feel like meeting. This naturally turned in to an argument since I didn't feel I was in the wrong. I've asked a few of my other friends about it since and they've both agreed with me but, out of curiosity, I would like to pass this question off to everyone here. I know I invited him but was I really expected to send a reminder text if we had already agreed on the date and the time? He claims it's a courtesy to make guests feel welcome but honestly, I find that laughable. It's not a date and we're pretty good friends so I don't see the point of the formality. He does come from a family though that stresses these things quite a bit so maybe it was important to him. \n\nThis is a pretty small issue. It happened a week ago and I was over it pretty much the day after it happened. But my friend keeps bringing it back up from time to time as ribbing and I honestly can't believe how he doesn't see he's in the wrong 😂. But there you have it folks, lay it on me, which one of us is the asshole here? 😂",

My husband, who I love dearly and am in no way considering leaving or loving any less for this, and who is wonderful other than this specific thing, has burned himself out on his own job and has been off work for a week with one more to go.\n\nI have spent the last week playing Florence flipping Nightingale to him, cleaning up after him, making sure he rests, eats and doesn't get all het up about stuff, and now I have ten days to finish something I NEEDED to start a week ago (which he very much knew about, but let's not unpack that) and now, after a very long fricking week, he seems to be on the mend.  I've cleaned the house, removed any shit he can trip over, there is homemade food in the fridge to heat up, and he has everything he needs.\n\nAm I an asshole for checking into a hotel a couple streets away to just try and get my head down on my deadline?  I love my job, this is the high point of my year, it's going to have a hundred thousand people tuning in and they're all fucking looking forward to it, and I want to make it awesome for them (and also make sure I don't fuck up and let my awesome boss down).  I am ready to work.  I need to work.  But whenever my husband walks into the room my brain can't focus and I'm blocked again. This job is a big break for me and much as I love, adore and care about my husband, I have to get out of here and work.\n\nI plan to come back daily to hug the cat and check they're ok (and the cat has backup food, water, toys and an undecorated christmas tree to play with) and my husband says he'll be ok and I should go do my work.\n\nBut I guess I just need another perspective here.  Am I an asshole?\n\nThrowaway because otherwise you'd figure out what I work on and then I'd have even more shit to deal with.\n\nIf you have any gifs of funny animals I could also use those.\n\nThanks all x",

      "description": "First time poster, so excuse me if my formatting is wrong.\nAlso excuse my english .\n\nSo I guess that I will have to give some backstory for you to understand this story.\n\nI am currently in highschool, and my friend who we will call F, is in my class. As we both have one lecture that is a bit away from school, both on monday and tuesday morning, I will usually pick F up, and them leave him after the lecture. He lives about a ten minute walk from the building we have our lecture in. He usually texts me in the morning to ask if I will give him a ride.\n\nThis has not been a problem for me, as it is not much of a detour for me to pick F up on the way. I do not expect anything for doing this, except maybe a little appreciation. \n\nThis was the case until last week.\n\nLast week when we had just had our last lesson, me and F were casually. For some reason we got on the track of talking about me giving him rides on mondays and tuesdays, and the rest of the conversation unfolded like this:\n\nMe: Imagine if I won't give you a ride next week (in a joking manner).\n\nF: You wouldn't dare to do that.\n\nMe: Okay, you probably shouldn't have said that.\n\nF: Don't take that as I dare.\n\nMe: I guess we'll see.\n\nAfter that we parted ways, until tuesday morning (cancelled lecture on monday).\n\nI didn't think this was too big of a deal, but I thought that it was a bit shitty of him to think that I somehow owe him a ride. I felt like he thought he could control me, so I decided that he wouldn't get a ride next week.\n\nTuesday morning comes, and so does the usual message asking if I could give him a ride. Here is how the coversation went:\n\nF: Hey could you give me a ride today?\n\nMe: Do you remeber last week?\n\nF: Yes, that was nice of you (refering to that I went by his house to pick him up, and called him to wake him up when I arrived, because he overslept).\n\nMe: No not that, remeber when you said I wouldn't dare to pick you up.\n\nF: Yes.\n\nMe: Well I am not going to.\n\nF: Yes you are (in a half-joking manner).\n\nMe: No I am not.\n\nThe conversation went on, and I thought that I made it very clear that I wasn't going to pick him up. He stops answering, so I guessed that he had accepted it.\n\nI arrive to the lecture in time, wait for a bit until everybody has arrived so we can start the lesson. Suddenly I overhear the teacher read out a message saying \"I am going to be late, I don't know where \"me\" is\". This was from F, who obviously didn't understand that I was serious. Everybody around us who had heard what the teacher said were looking really confused, so I explained what you just read to them.\n\nEverybody seemed to agree that I was right in doing what I did, and all of them seemed to find it kind of funny. F did not agree though.\n\nWe have allready started the lesson, when F comes in. F seems very mad, and said that he had to ask his dad to give him a ride, which made him and his dad late.\n\nWe talked later in the day about it, and he still seems to think that I am in the wrong. He doesn't seem to understand why I did it even though I explained my motives. \n\nI am confused now and need someone elses opinion on the matter, is he right? AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My friend expected me to give him a ride, and when I didnt do it, he got mad. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "My 96 year old grandmother was admitted into the ER yesterday with congestive heart failure. She has always been healthy, sharp as a tack and one of the strongest women I know - even after losing her only daughter (my mom). The bond that I share with her is so deep. When I walk into her home, I can feel my mother's presence (okay, not in a paranormal way)....but the way her house smells, when I hear her voice, when I see her face.....everything brings warmth and comfort into my heart.\n\nMy father told me that she had been admitted to the ER for congestive heart failure and I immediately started crying. Any time I hear of a close loved one being sick I go into somewhat of a panic mode because it triggers the memory of receiving \"that\" phone call that my mother was dead.\n\nMy father became annoyed with me. He told me, \"Why do you always react this way? I shouldn't have even told you. She's NINETY SIX! You should prepare yourself!\" My father and I NEVER argue. He is the love of my life but when he said this, my body stiffened up and I yelled, \"How can you say that? It's like if someone were to come and tell me, 'Your dad is 75, you should be prepared because he's old! She is healthy and can do things that 96 years old can't do! SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DIE so how in the hell can you expect me to \"prepare myself\" to watch my grandmother die when SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DIE????\" My father just gave me a look (I'm not sure if he felt bad for raising his voice at me or if he was surprised that I raised my voice at him, gave me kiss and then left my house.\n\nI've been feeling so conflicted. I love and respect my dad and I NEVER yell at him. But, I think his delivery was a bit insensitive.\n\nTL;DR: My father chastised me for crying when I found out that my (otherwise healthy) 96 year old grandmother is in the hospital and told me that \"I should be strong and 'prepare myself' for her impending death.\"",

      "description": "BACKGROUND\nI'm married (M28) with my wife (F26) for 3 years.\nWe have a great relationship but are both mostly homebodies and like to spend most weeknight evenings at home binging Netflix. We go out for fun activities during the weekend and rarely fight.\nWe both have jobs that need us waking up around 7am for 8am starts.\n\nTONIGHT\nSo, I have a friend who is going through a messy divorce. My wife likes said friend, but I've been recently hanging with him a lot more to give him some support and just generally be a good friend.\nI had planned to go bowling with my friend on Tuesday night at 7.30, had checked with the wife and she was all good.\nI should note now that my wife has an informal 'rule' that she doesn't like me getting back after 10pm on a weeknight. Even though we frequently watch Netflix until 11.30pm.\n\nMy friend was late and we pre-paid games of bowling with a special deal the bowling centre had, only starting at 8.30. We were having a great time just chatting so our bowling rate was slow.\nBefore I knew it it was 9.30pm. \nI texted my wife warning her we might be late.\nShe texted back 'ok'.\nGot to 10.08 and we were only beginning our last game.\nI then receive texts at 15min intervals saying that 'I'm not home yet.' - 'You're now 40min late' etc\n\nI end up rushing us to finish and it takes a good 30min to drive home.\nI arrive home at 11.18\n\nFirst thing I say is sorry for being late.\nMy wife refuses to speak with me at first and then we get into an argument for it being 'unacceptable' that I was home so late. I provide my reasons for being late and say that I couldn't just leave abruptly at 9.30pm because I have a 'curfew'. We were talking about serious stuff and I couldn't control that my friend late.\n\nWhen I go to get into bed she hands me my pillow and says 'You're not welcome'.\n\nI have been kicked out of MY own bed for what I see is a ridiculous over reaction. I am furious.\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "This is the only sub I can think of for this situation and I need a third party opinion because I am too emotionally involved. \n\n\nMy friend Sadie got together with this dude a year and a half ago. He was studying to be a lawyer at the time and has since passed the bar. When Sadie first got with this dude she kind of disappeared. Within a few months her Facebook was deactivated and she never responded to snapchats. I figured she was just busy until I got a call at 1 am with her sobbing and telling me I can never text her or call her about what she was going to tell me unless she started the conversation about it. Red flags shoot up and i agree...so she tells me how her boyfriend has spent their whole relationship accusing her of cheating constantly, getting drunk and trashing her apartment while screaming about what a whore she is, etc. and she needed to talk to calm down. I talk to her for hours and she falls asleep. This becomes a regular occurrence. Despite him controlling every aspect of Sadie's life, he believes every time she is out of his sight shes cheating. He made her deactivate Facebook because it was easier than deleting and blocking all her Male friends. He is always on her phone hence the restriction on talking about it. \n\nShe is active military and he is a lawyer from a wealthy family. He has made her cut off most friends because they \"dont mesh with his friends\" (rich kids who look down on people like her and i who are enlisted active duty) and she goes to work and comes straight home, never leaving unless he is with her because she feels like can somehow convince him to trust her. \n\nShe has broken up with him 4 times. each time she comes to stay with me because he rages and breaks her furniture and threatens her dogs (she brings the dogs to my place too) etc and she doesnt feel safe.\n\nShe kind of dropped off again a few weeks after their last breakup. Today she invited me to a St Patty's thing and as I arrive she tells me he is there and to be nice.\n\nNow here is why i did a possibly asshole thing. This guy knows I attempted prescription medication overdose a year ago. When they broke up last he spewed a ton of shit like how i would \"be dead or in a nuthouse soon\" because I am \"a psycho fucking loser like the rest of you navy fucking losers.\"\n\nI turned around and walked away today. She begged me to stay and said I had to be friends with him if I wanted to be friends with her. I finally washed my hands of the situation. With everything he said about me, she didnt even tell him he owed me an apology. She was just so happy he was being nice to her again that she forgave everything. She can't understand why I would be personally insulted by his actions and not want to just forget about what he has said and done like she does. \n\nI dont want her to feel alone because I'm her last friend that is not a friend he has allowed her to make and I just can't any more.

      "description": "Throwaway, cause his sister uses reddit.\n\nMy boyfriend has very recently started to develop symptoms that we can only describe as depression. His mood is low, he doesn’t laugh at anything, he isn’t affectionate, he looks exhausted, and he just wants to sit and play on his PS4. I’m trying my best to be supportive, encouraging him to book an appointment with the doctor (I don’t have permission to for him), and he agrees but he never does.\nHe used to get severe headaches everyday so I was used to him lying down for 3-4 hours leaving me alone with our son, but now he never helps. If I ask for something, there’s only a 20% chance he will get up from his game and do it, and he is always mildly annoyed with me that he had to.\nI am exhausted, and burnt out. He works 6-7 hours a day 5 days a week, and stays up until 3/4am playing games but I am constantly looking after our 9 month old. I snapped at him a couple of days ago after he complained I didn’t wash his shirt with “Can you give me a fucking minute?” and he has been cold since. I tried talking to him a couple times and apologizing for losing my patience but he won’t have it. He just replies with things like “Just tell me you don’t love me anymore” and “I learned my lesson, I’ll just shut the fuck up”.  \n\nToday, he told me he was going to gamble half of his paycheque because he worked hard for it. I didn’t want to pick a fight but I told him I thought it was a bad idea. We had a huge argument after he told me to go live with my parents if I didn’t like the way he lived, and I listed everything I do around the house for our son since he is not contributing, and that I don’t expect a 500$ blowout reward for it. He told me I knew how he was feeling depressed, and that what I just said was abusive. He finished by accusing me of cheating on him, brought up every mistake I’ve ever made, then blocked me and hasn’t responded in hours. \n\nI just want to know if I was the asshole. I was fuming when I sent the message but looking now, I’ve never been in a relationship with someone who is depressed before and I feel like what I did was irreversible and cruel. He doesn’t mean to do what he does.",

      "description": "I have a friend who is a 16 year old girl who goes to church with me. One day she excitingly texted me about how she bought a \"really cute sundress\" with sunflowers on it. \n\nFlash forward to this past Sunday, when she wore that dress. It was a very flattering dress on her, but it wasn't overly sexual. It covered up everything that needed to be covered up and it went down to her knees. She told me that her dad made some really rude remarks about how short the dress was before they went to church. Saying that it showed too much up top and down low.\n\nAfter church she texted me extremely upset because apparently someone complained to her parents that her dress was too short. Her father went as far to say that some of the comments he heard made him feel “embarrassed.\" She said that basically the entire way home, they scolded her for how short her dress was.\n\nI told her it was bullshit. That she could wear whatever she wanted to. That she shouldn’t be shamed for what she wore and that her parents were wrong for getting embarrassed about those \"comments\" and that whoever complained to them was a \"f\\*cking idiot\" so on and so forth. I even went as far as calling her parents inappropriate names. I used a lot of words I really should not have said, but these comments really upset me. I have a sister and know that if someone ever commented negatively on her outfit, it would really trouble her.\n\nLast night, I got a text from said friend reading \"well this is discouraging” and then a long text basically saying \"She is 16 and can not wear whatever she feels like if it is revealing. Modesty and purity are extremely important to us and and I am extremely disappointed in this whole conversation.\" Her mother took her phone, read our messages, and texted me on her phone.\n\nI was taken back, and didn't want to cause anymore drama so I just told her that I was sorry and was trying to stand up for her.\n\nShe responded with another long text saying how she wants to protect her from \"pervs and anyone else that would want to take advantage of someone so pretty and awesome\" and then said that her and I would speak more later.\n\nI've been struggling with this all day because I've had friends tell me IWTA because I overstepped my bounds by telling her that she could wear whatever she wanted and that people were idiotic to complain about it. I know I used language I shouldn't but I was just infuriated at the whole situation.",

I asked her to stop snap chatting me during the visitation because it was a depressing scene and I thought she was being disrespectful, and then she got upset with me and told me not to attend the funeral.

      "description": "We've been friend since high school and I really like him. I feel like I have never connected with anyone like this before but it is completely platonic on my end. But he likes me. We've actually stopped talking before because it got so bad. He would keep texting me how much he loves me and that he wants to be with me and I would just keep turning him down. It was hard for me and maybe that sounds selfish but I really feel uncomfortable when I know someone likes me. I'm a super self conscious person and also very awkward. I felt like I could be my whole self with him and then I find out he likes me. I just eventually told him I couldn't be friends as long as he acted this way.\n\nA few months maybe a year go by since then and he texts me. I debate whether I should respond at all and eventually text back. We really hit it off and spend a lot of time together. I was happy I had my friend back and he had a girlfriend so I felt safe. But then the weird touches happened. He would stroke my hair and try to kiss me whenever we got drunk (and we were in college so a lot), I always rebuffed him. Sometimes he would beg and I would be rude and tell him NO. He only did this drunk so I thought maybe it wasn't a big deal.\n\nIt went on like that for maybe a year, ofc his gf hated me! But I tried being super nice to her and it just never mattered. Which I completely get, I wouldn't like it either. He told me that she asked him to choose once and I said he should do what is best for him. I didn't want to lose him as a friend but he relationship was more important. And while ultimatums aren't good, I was on her side. It was weird. At one point he stopped and I felt great! That he got over it and we could be friends again. Then he started feeling more distant and I was pretty upset by this. I asked if I did something wrong and he would always say no. After that we started to sort of resent each other, I didn't like how dismissive he was of me and he was just mad I'm not sure. I never texted him a lot or anything but sometimes he'd text me first then ignore me! I got so mad and I told him I didn't like being treated this way and if this is how he's going to be we're done. He said he was sorry and being rude lately because he liked me and wanted to push away. I felt bad and apologized but we basically stopped talking which I understood, I never pushed to be friends again. A few months pass and he tells me he's over it and we try to be friends again. It was rough and awkward to say the least.\n\nNow into recent time, we are great again. We have so much fun and don't hang out too much but I felt we were starting to be on good terms once more. But nope of course not. Not too long ago he started complimenting me again and I felt really apprehensive. I just accepted them and moved on, hoping he was just being nice. Then he asks me if we can kiss and I am done. I was sort of rude saying no and that I'm not into it. I really had no idea what to say.\n\nI am at a loss, I thought it was gone and now I just feel like it never will be. It is just frustrating. He apologized saying he felt like I liked him too and I told him that he is reading me wrong. I don't want to be mean but I have NEVER liked him like that and it's hard to explain why. I just don't. I think he's good looking and I love hanging out with him but I have never felt anything romantic or physically toward him. There is nothing there. Now I just feel like we'll never be friends and he will always at some point want more. It's been years and we keep doing the same thing. Do I just power through until he finds another gf that he hopefully likes enough to kill any feelings for me? Or am I just punishing both of us by staying friends? I want him to be happy. I want neither of us to feel uncomfortable. This is just hard.\n\nSo am I an asshole for staying friends with this guy? Am I just leading him on even though I've told him dozens of times I don't like him like that? I have never really been in his shoes. Being in this position is not new for me though. Maybe I act flirty and don't know it, I honestly feel I do nothing to lead anyone on. I've tried to act more gross around him too even though I hate doing that. \n\nI'm sorry for the terrible writing, it has never been my strong suit.",

      "description": "Hey, I'm ready for some hard truths\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground - we haven't had a very interesting sex life in the past few months. In part for medical reasons, though there were still things we could and havent been doing. To be clear, no problems with what she's done before me or judgement, I've had my own 'wild past'. So me, tired and irrational, is there listening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngf came home from a night out with her work friends. When she got in I woke up, we were talking about how her night was. Apparently they were reminiscing about some old times from a few years ago when they were single.  She says about a threesome she had with two of her friends and says \n\n\"it was amazing, glad it happened. never would again\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thought of her with the guy both turned me on and made me a bit jealous, though that's neither here nor there. I never had a threesome so it was something that became an unfulfilled fantasy when we became exclusive (she wasn't up for it anymore). It's still a bit of a sore spot as is it something I would have wanted to experience in this lifetime, but being with her is more important and long term. So this memory/sentence was a bit of salt on the wounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there I am, getting upset by what I see as this insensitive sentence for three reasons:\n\n1 experience I'll never have with her (I know this is something I have to learn to let go of, I just dont know how, could appreciate advice there too)\n\n2 seeing her reminisce about wild sex when we haven't had sex in ages makes it feel like we're all downhill from here (probably the only genuine one here)\n\n3 Insecurity from this, why weren't we having drunk sex instead of her reminiscing/why would she let someone she cares less about have a threesome and not me (I know that one is petty)\n\nSo here's me two days later being crotchety and bitter, trying to let it go or figure it out and failing. not sure if there'd be any benefit to bringing this up other than making the situation worse (particularly about sex. once that's brought up as a problem I feel a line has been irreversibly crossed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR - gf talking about a past threesome, saying 'amazing but never again', me getting upset because \n\n1 we didnt and wont do that together, \n\n2 we havent had sex in ages, \n\n3 insecurity, why not me. \n\nNow i'm still feeling upset two days later and am finding myself grumpy/aloof towards her. Hit me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

For the longest time, I've loved him or I've felt as close to love as I guess a highschooler can feel. He also felt the same way but I was too scared to get into a proper relationship because of past experiences with manipulation and such. He asked out one of my friends a few months ago and they've been dating ever since. At one point in the relationship he told me they don't jive well and that he still loved me. Things are different now but being around them brings a great deal of pain. I eventually blocked him on social media and told him I wanted us to stop communicating. I didn't tell him why; I asked that he didn't but the truth is that I still feel a great deal of affection and being around them really wears me down. I thought it wouldn't be fair to him to his girlfriend that I feel this way and continued to be around him. I don't know if I'm just being a petty bitch or if it was the right thing to do.  \n\n\nside note: I like his girlfriend a lot. We've been friends for a few years and I genuinely really love being around her. Perhaps I should just get over it and let them be happy.  \n",

      "description": "I go see live music often, probably 5 shows a month. Last night my friend and I were at this cafe/bar/restaurant that had s jazz band playing. The place is new and it was my first time there. It's described on its website as a place that \"combines classy and affordable craft cocktails and pizza, in a setting welcoming to all.\". They also host live jazz, hip hop and DJs in the evening a few nights a week. It's a tiny place with maybe 12 tables and a few bar seats and tall bar tables. The whole place holds maybe 60 people.  There is no real stage, just a clearing for the band.\n\nWe got there late and sat at the bar which is to the side of where they had set up the band. Most people were focused on the music but some of the tables had people chatting through the evening. Many people eating dinner everyone drinking. So my friend and I are chatting, loud enough to hear each other because the music was loud but trying to be quiet enough so as not to disturb those around us. \n\nThe band is instrumental jazz, much of it kinda rocking. But then they get to this quiet slow piece and towards the end the guy next to us leans over and said \"nobody else is talking. can you guys stop talking just during this song?\" We did stop talking and the song ended like 10 seconds later.\n\nThe place was a cafe with a band placed at a clearing in the corner. This wasnt a theater or even a real music venue. This wasnt a ticketed concert although there was $5 cover at the door.  They serve a full dinner menu. \n\nWas I the asshole for talking while the band was playing a quiet piece? Again we were talking quietly, but the guy right next to us could probably hear us. We were not in front of the band or at any tables near the band, we were seated at the bar towards the corner.\n\nTl/dr: hushed for talking during a quiet song while a band was playing at a bar, aita?",

      "description": "I am an eighteen year old female. I live with my dad and his partner in a two bedroom home. My dad and my mom have been divorced since I was just a year old.  My dad is a hoarder. It’s not as bad as many of the people you see on TLC’s Hoarders, but to give you an idea of how bad it is, my entire life my closet (which doesn’t have a door) has been overflowing with my dads clothes. Both of the coat racks in my room are stuffed full of his clothing, underneath my bed and in my dressers he has boxes of his clothes. His own closet is also full, as well as our living room, dining room, garage, storage unit, and my grandmas house and her garage as well. Because I don’t have enough places to put my things, my room is constantly a mess. As a child I was never allowed to have friends over because of how messy our house always is. \nI have been begging my dad for years to clean out my closet so that I can use it. I am sick of seeing his things in my room. I feel like I don’t have my own space, not even inside my own room. \n\nRecently, I had a realization. I am a fucking adult! I deserve to be respected by my dads. I took an entire day emptying my closet of his things and placing them in nice stacks in the living room for him to deal with. I removed literally 50 pairs of shoes from my closet as well as 10 leather jackets, about 30 belts, and I swept and cleaned my room as well as I could. I was so proud of myself. I put my clothes in my closet and tidied up my room. It was the cleanest I’ve ever been able to have it.\n\nMy dad came home just as I was finishing up and noticed his clothes in the living room. He proceeded to have a meltdown and yelled and me and I ended up leaving in tears and staying the night at a friends house. The next time I came home all of my clothes were piled on my bed and his stuff was pushed back into my closet. I was devastated. \n\nMy room is now the messiest it has ever been. I have no motivation to clean and I feel absolutely disheartened. I just kick things around my room instead of putting them away because what’s the point? The rest of our house looks like a pigsty anyways. \n\nWhen I complain to him about my dirty room, he shifts the blame. “Well it’s your fault for not cleaning.” He acts like my effort to take back my closet was at no cost to me. I spent a whole day getting my room in shape for it all to go to shit. \n\nAm I the asshole? How do I deal with my dads hoard? I still have to live with him, but I have no space of my own and never have. Ugh!!! ",

      "description": "My extended family is small.\n\nI was close to uncle Dave and aunt Marie when I was a kid and they were \"cool aunt and uncle\". They have two boys, Mike and Tony. Mike is few years younger than me and Tony just turned 18. His birthday party is this Saturday and also a reason why I'm writing here.\n\nAs years went on my mental health deteriorated but I don't know how much they know since no one ever bothered to ask me anything. What I do know is they treat me as... As if I'm stupid. Like I don't understand concepts of politics, relationships and \"adulting\" altogether. \n\nMy dad and Dave were raised by narcissistic grandpa Tom that died in late October of 2018. Their mom died back in 2001. Grandpa Tom was abusive asshole. He had a sister that was always treat as \"damaged goods\" by their parents and grandpa was sunniest sun there is. They enabled shithead to achieve his full shitty potential, but I digress.\n\nMy parents never treated me and my brother any different. Even if they did it wasn't because of our genders. What I do feel when I'm around my extended family is that same dismissive attitude people have when they view someone as \"less worthy\". \n\nFor example, if I were to come to Tonys birthday party it would be expected from me to help with serving people, doing the dishes, etc. I wouldn't be asked and I would end up being the rude one if I didn't help.\n\nWhen they ask me something I often get corrected about *my opinions* as if whatever opinion I have is wrong. Sorry that I don't hate LGBTQ+ community, my bad. Sorry that my own divorce isn't good enough proof that I know what steps needs to be taken in order to get divorced.\n\nMike and Tony picked up same behaviour and I don't feel like part of family at all. Just annoyance that comes with my parents.\n\nIn early December I had my birthday. Birthdays are important to me.\n\nWhat ended up being dot on the \"i\" was when uncle Dave called 17 days later to wish me happy birthday with some bullshit excuse. Few days prior he sent me pics of grandpa's dog that he adopted so it's not like we weren't in contact. You may ask \"who does that\"? Well, someone who will remember my brothers birthday is coming up (late December) and that they skipped mine. Upsie.\n\nI'm just done. They have a lot on their plate but so do my parents who ask about Mike and Tony, then remember what they were told and follow up with situations. Not because they have to but because they are honestly interested in their well being.\n\nI will not attend Tonys party, I haven't sent him a birthday wish.\n\n\nMy parents and my brother know who I truly am and they know I have more to bring to the table then just \"help in the kitchen\" and be quite around other guests.\n\nSo AITA for cutting them off after no one reached out on my birthday?",

She still wanted to hang out with me, but I told her I couldn't for my own sake. She understood.  \n  \nA few weeks ago she got in contact with me again wanting to reconnect. I was hesitant, but started speaking with her again. We tried scheduling things, but something always got in the way for her. I tried to be understanding with her supposed \"constantly changing\" work schedule, and her child.  \n  \nBut whenever I tried to ask about meeting up, she'd never text back. But she'd be all over social media. I'd give it some good time, like a day or two and check back again, but still would avoid my questions and give some excuse. She's done this kind of thing in the past, and I just thought I'm not dealing with it again. I told her I understand if she's busy, but her \"constantly changing\" work schedule didn't add up to her days off and days she said she had her child.  \n  \nI told her I'm not going to play any weird games, and have been completely transparent.

      "description": "Theres more to this than just the title but i couldnt fit everything in. All of this is extremely NSFW just as a warning.\n\nI am involved in the cuckold fetish community as a \"bull\". A cuckold is a guy who enjoys other men fucking his wife or gf, a bull does the fucking. I have been doing this for four years and im now addicted to it. I have a very dominant personality and i like humiliating and shaming people, husbands and wives.\n\nI have \"owned\" a married couple for seven months. We all pretty much got very close. The husband was an elderly man in his 70s with a wife in her 30s. I frequently used humiliating language during the sex which was consensual for all parties.\n\nThe husband died before Christmas from a stroke. I have still been seeing the wife sexually, however when i started to verbally insult him she got offended despite me doing it many times before. I understand maybe telling me to not to do that out of respect but she reacted very negatively and called me an asshole, which came as a shock. \n\nWhen youre in that fetish zone some things are going to be said, right or wrong, and i feel like that should matter in the context of the situation. Outside of sex i got along with the guy, but during sex with his wife i humiliated him, which is what i was doing again.",

He had 4 children (all over 20+ years old) and a wife. Family that went to his home included my parents, some of my aunts and cousins. I was told they sat together and cried and reminisced and this was to show support. I didn't feel the environment would be beneficial to anyone, so I didn't go. Instead I had a pretty typical day and even went to the gym.\n\nLater on that day, my dad was furious with me for not \"supporting my mother\" during this grievance. I told him it was stupid to sit there for hours, because my presence wasn't going to help anyone. He was heartbroken and sad and cried over this, though I remained angry that I was confronted. I did attend the funeral and burial service at my mother's side the entire time. Even years later, I'm told that I was wrong to not be in attendance. I told my mother that I felt like I was being told that my way to grieve was wrong, but maybe I'm being selfish. AITA?",

      "description": "     Last Saturday, I attended a “going away” party for a friend who’s headed into the Air Force. Including myself and my girl friend, all the people in the party are a close knit friends of about 15 people. Prior to the party, a girl, who I’ll call “K”, and I have been talking about her emotional struggles with her relationship and her inability to see a future within herself. I aided her to the best of my ability and throughout the night of the party, I continued to do so. Right after I’ve almost sobered up and I was about to leave, K suggests  she and I go swim in a nearby lake. I say yes, but with no actual intention to do so because it was around 20F that night. She and I walk to the lake, continuing to talk about her mental state and once we reached our destination, I prevent her from swimming. We talk for around 20 minutes and before we decided to head back, I ask to platonically kiss her. I ensure her that my girl friend would not mind so she says yes and we do so.\n\n     We head back and I get in my car to leave and as I was about to put the car on drive, K leans in through my car door and kisses me again. This time longer and slightly more involved. K asks to text her once I get home and I head on my way.\n\n     Later in the morning, I hear from my girl friend that immediately after I left, K cried into one of my friends arms. I’m not sure what was discussed, but I hurt K and confused her when I was genuinely attempting to help her. I’ve had to leave the group chat we’re all in and I’m not talking to anyone there for at least a week in order to give them space. \n\n   AITA for doing what I did?",

      "description": "I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years.  Just a little backstory: Right before we made it official that we were boyfriend/girlfriend and that we were exclusive, he went down to Florida to visit some friends and ended up having a one night stand with this one girl that was friends with his friends down there.  I didn’t count it as cheating because we hadn’t discussed being exclusive and putting a label on our relationship, but it still hurt me a little bit.  \n\nFast forward to present day, his brother wants to go to this convention this summer down in Florida over my boyfriends birthday.  My boyfriend said I could come with them when he was talking about it a few weeks ago because then we could celebrate his birthday and I happen to be off school that week, too.  Today we are at his parents house, and his mom is asking him questions about the trip and if him and his brother are going to drive or fly, where they’re staying and what not. I got a little bit suspicious because she hadn’t mentioned anything about me, so when his mom left, I mentioned it to him.  He tried to tell me that he never actually said I could go (he definitely did) and kept saying “you don’t want me to have a nice vacation? I haven’t been on a vacation in so long.”  I explained to him that it just hurt my feelings because he told me I could go and I got excited (I haven’t been on vacation in years either) and it was disappointing to hear that he was now planning to go without me.  I also was excited to spend his birthday with him because he has an oilfield job and is only home every two weeks for 6 days, so I already get limited time with him.  Here’s where the backstory from the beginning of this post comes in, too.  He hasn’t given me any reason to believe he would ever cheat or anything, but I have severe anxiety and can’t stop thinking about what happened all those years ago. \n\nSo, Reddit, am I being an insecure asshole about this or do I have a little bit of a reason to be pissed?

We work similar hours, but live by different schedules. He wakes and stays up later than me by 1-3 hours, depending. Because of this, while we would watch Hulu/Netflix after work, I would eventually begin to doze off. He would make attempts to rouse me before getting annoyed with me for it. When he was annoyed he would snap at me. Going to sleep by myself wasn't an option because he would be upset that I didn't want to cuddle with him. If we did go to bed when I wanted to, he would either watch shows on his phone with headphones in or play games on his phone or switch. If I could, I would take mid-day naps so I could stay up a little later. The problem was, he would also be upset about that if it meant missing our shows. \n\nI was always under the mindset that, because it was on streaming services, if I felt I missed too much of an episode due to my dozing off I could just watch it again. He was not a fan of watching an episode more than once. He found it annoying and boring. I believed that TV shows had no real bearing on my real life so they were not super important, but he wanted me to pay full attention to the shows. If I checked my phone at all, to reply to a message or look something up, he would pause the show and watch me while waiting for me to put my phone back down. While I understand that your partner getting on their phone can be quite annoying in certain circumstances, I didn't see a problem with doing it occasionally for a short time, where he did. \n\nAll this being said, am I the asshole for dozing off while watching shows with my boyfriend at the time?",

I'm also on mobile so I'm sorry for the layout. \n\nMy boyfriend lives directly off a highway, that \"T's\" with a residential neighborhood. The entire town is in the mountains and based off this highway.\nA few weeks ago (it feels), bf and i were outside and spotted a dog sprinting to the back of his yard. The dog was hesitant to approach bf but had no issue coming up to me and licking my face. On his collar, there were two phone numbers and an address that was located around the corner from bfs house. We called both numbers, multiple times. One number was a non-area code number so we chose to go with the second number. The other number had a woman answer. Bf said, \"Hi! We've got your dog around the corner, etc.\" Lady says she doesn't have a dog. So we try the other number, same lady answers and asks who we are this time. Bf says, \"My name is _____, I live off of ______. We have your dog\"\n\nLady, once again, says she doesn't have a dog. We decided to take him to the address on his collar. We stood on the porch for a good 10 minutes for a very spacey, black toothed woman to openthe door slightly. Just open enough to let the dog in and make eye contact. No response or thank you, just a shut door. Now, I only mention her looks because, in this town, drug users come here for cheap rent and solidarity. I'm not a complete asshole who thinks of people as incapable of something based on their looks. It's a very comfortable town, people go to the store and find their entire neighborhood in there as well.\n\nWhen someone knocks on the door or rings the bell, people tend to automatically answer. This woman did not. We were actually contemplating on how to write her a note, saying we had her dog, if she didn't answer.\n\nAbout 10 minutes ago, bf and I are walking up to his house after picking up baby brother from school and, in a straight line, the same dog sprinted to us. Immediately called the dog by his name and he was so happy. He was excited to get into the car with us once again. He knows where his home is too. The moment we get to the property, he wants to sprint to the door and inside the house. But then the same woman answers (at a normal pace this time) , recognizes us and begins to shut the door. Bf even says, \"We found your dog again!\" as some small talk, and she just chuckled and shut the door again. We don't expect a reward or even much of a discussion. But most people express their anger or concern when a pet is returned to them.\n\nI also had a chance to really pet the dog. He feels skinny, but his fur makes it hard to really tell. I'm not familiar with his breed either, so i don't want to make assumptions about a good or bad home. The main factor that's making me want to take him home with me is that it's such a dangerous area to have an animal loose. Cat owners bring in their cats as the sun is going down because mountain lions or coyotes will get them. There's a major highway just a block over that takes human lives like no tomorrow, imagine the number of animals it's stolen. If the dog is a fence jumper, the owner should keep him inside for most of the day, or attempt to make the fence more capturing. He's not a Husky either, I know those little guys are escape artists. In my mind, I think this owner is neglectful.\n\nOf course, I won't go to the lady's home and take her dog. But if I have to save him again, for the third time, why shouldn't I save him and take him to a loving and caring home? I will admit, I recently lost my childhood dog and am looking for another furry friend, but this isn't desperation or needy-ness. This is pure concern, with good intention. So, Reddit. Would I be the asshole for trying to save this dog? ",

      "description": "I don't believe in exclusive relationships. I don't think love should restrict people in any way, and I think people should be free to express love to anyone and not reserve it for one person. I've been in a wonderful open relationship for quite some time now. (Let's call her Ava) Neither of us have ever even pursued other people outside our relationship, and neither of us plan to, but we like the idea of having the freedom to do so if we chose.\n\nAdmittedly, I don't think Ava shared my belief originally, but after I told her what I felt she came around to agreeing with me. Ever since, we've been in a great relationship with practically no problems. Once she told me she was anxious that a female friend I was hanging out with would \"steal\" me, so I cut ties with the friend pretty quick because I don't want to worry her.\n\nAva has two friends she sees every day. We're cool with each other. We often hang out just the four of us, but I'm newest to the group. Every day when I'm not there, those two friends roast Ava for being in a relationship with me. They tell her that I'm using her, I don't really love her, etc. They literally call me a crackhead when I'm not around. It got to the point where Ava said that I'm almost all they talk about anymore. I was cool with it because I knew Ava knew those things weren't true. We figure they're either uncomfortable with our open relationship or jealous, because they've been single their whole lives. The thing is though, they're both cool people. I get that they're doing this because they think they're protecting her.\n\nA couple hours ago, I went to see Ava and she was visibly troubled and sad. She told me that they really roasted her more than normal today, and one of them said \"This isn't really a roast, you just think it is because you know we're right.\" Apparently that got to her, and she told me that she's anxious about our relationship now. The whole night we kept saying that we were content with our situation, we loved each other, and we didn't want to end things, but she was still troubled after what her friends said. Against my beliefs, I agreed to be in an exclusive relationship with her because I knew it'd make her feel better.\n\nLater I realized that the whole thing was spurred by these two friends. Basically, I had to surrender a belief I held highly because they got in her head. I wanted to go to their houses and ask them to stop harassing Ava about us, direct and honest, but I figured I'd wait a day to clear my head. I don't want to tell Ava about it because I know she'll tell me not to, then I'd have to go against her wishes. Tomorrow I'm probably going to talk to them, WIBTA?\n\nTL;DR: My significant other's friends harass her about our happy open relationship. This made her anxious, so I had to change to an exclusive relationship, which I don't believe in. I want to confront them and tell them to stay in their lane.",

We didn’t care and didn’t give any attention to him...   until he started hitting on us. At first he said stuff like “I want to swallow your kids”  and  “I want to see you in bed”, however these comments were mainly directed at me.\n\nSo recently he started getting more up close and personal like screaming in my ear and getting face to face, in me and my friends opinion to close. So on Valentine’s Day he said I want you to be mine and touched my upper thigh. I was shocked. I shouted “Get the fuck away from me!” He moved seats and started crying.

      "description": "Background: My company (company 1)works very closely with our sister company (company 2). Both companies are owned by the same people and we do a lot of work that is shared between us.\n\n'Joe' has my job, at company 2. We've worked together in the past on cooperative projects and while I've seen that he's definitely skilled, he as very a crappy attitude about everything. I've also found I can't rely or depend on him holding up his end, and the work he does on round one is usually half-assed and reeks of laziness.  It's not a big problem as I tend to adjust for this assumed delay and it's more of a mild frustration to work around for me.\n\nLast month the higher-ups at both companies decided that I needed to take responsibility in directing Joe by monitoring his output, holding him accountable to goals, and having him report to me. Basically, I'd basically be his supervisor. I've told them this is going to cause problems since:\n\n1. He doesn't work for company 1\n2. I wouldn't 'technically' be his boss\n3. I'm having added duties to my job but not seeing compensation for it.\n\nI've told them this and mentioned that if hey really wanted a handle on his effectiveness it would need to be monitored with his manager at company 2. Office politics wise: I feel that company 2 is trying to pawn off their problem employee they don't want to deal with. \n\nI refused and now my boss (who I consider a very reasonable and like-able guy) told me in the nicest way that I'm being a bit of an asshole by not getting on-board with their plans.\n\nAfter this it was made clear that, regardless of wither Joe stayed at company 2 or not, I'd be in line for a pay increase and an additional hire for my team in about three months.  Company 1 has been good in the past with following through on these kinds of promises.\n\nHere is my question: Should I feel like the asshole for refusing an odd managerial request OR Am I in the clear for seeing a train wreck before it happens?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: My company wants me to take on a role I'm uncomfortable with.",

Due to reasons, I've been separated from my wife for the better part of 2018, since august and my wife has had the truck this entire time. Since she's had it, I've had her pay for the truck and its expenses, i.e. insurance and any repairs.\n\nFast forward to 3 weeks ago, January 5th, my wife thought it would be a brilliant idea to let her sister, drive the truck. Now i don't know exactly what happened, but she crashed it. My wife \"forgot\" to put full cover insurance on it, so they won't fix it. So I tell my sister in law, \"you've been working since you got here, you must have some money saved up, You're going to help me fix this.\" She blatantly refused saying she didn't have to pay for anything because it wasn't her fault and is accusing me of being unfair for expecting her to do so, however according to my wife and the police report and the insurance company, she was the at fault driver. But this girl has even convinced my wife that she doesn't have to pay for anything. \nAnyways this has left me extremely frustrated and now loathing my sister in law. \n\nSo am i the asshole? ",

      "description": "I love my mom to death. She’s a very religious Christian. I was raised going to church every Sunday and I’ve also been baptized, however since I’ve moved out and lived alone, I’ve adjusted my views and see myself as atheist. My mom doesn’t know this because she’d be very upset. She had a heart attack ~5 years ago due to stress which she attributes to my siblings being drug addicts and taking the wrong path in life. I’ve been quite successful in my life by going to college and getting a great job. So hopefully you can see my hesitation on telling her my religious stance when I know it’d stress her out greatly and that isn’t good for her health. \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years now. One of the first questions my mom asked is when we started dating was if she is is a Christian. My reply was no and I told her she was atheist. I could’ve lied, however I’m generally truthful with my mom, minus the part about not telling her I don’t see myself as a Christian anymore. What she doesn’t know doesn’t hurt her.\n\nMy mom has family over for Christmas every year and this is the second time my girlfriend came with me. During the festivities, about two hours or so in, my mom pulls my girlfriend aside in another room and tells her she isn’t giving her blessing to her unless she accepts Jesus and becomes a Christian. I had no clue this happened until after we left and my girlfriend unleashed her anger in the car. Keep in mind that my girlfriend kept her cool for the remainder of the evening until we left. We stayed for another two hours; I have no clue how my girlfriend kept her composure during that time. Props to her.\n\nWhen we get back to her house, I text my mom asking if she said that, which she confirmed. I told her she was out of line and I was angry because it was completely unprovoked and hurtful. I explained how upset I was with her and that even if I had plans to marry her anytime soon that I would disregard her non-blessing because it’s our lives and not hers. She decided to call me and proceeds to lecture me on why being equally yolked is important to god and that it would never work if we believed in different things. She wasn’t understanding what did wrong and doesn’t believe she said anything out of line. At that moment I considered telling her I was atheist out of anger, however I didn’t because obviously I don’t want to stress out her heart and again, what she doesn’t know doesn’t hurt her. My girlfriend and I eventually let it go; we left it in the past and moved on.\n\nQueue to today. My girlfriend shares a pro-abortion post on Facebook. Her and my mom are friends and my mom decides to write out a lengthy comment on the shared post about why abortion is wrong according to Jesus’ will. My girlfriend and her end up having a keyboard battle over the subject which results in my mom blocking my girlfriend on Facebook. Again, I didn’t know about this until after it happened. I called my mom and railed into her about this. She goes on to say that she’s seen many posts she didn’t agree with and decided to speak up finally, which I told her she shouldn’t have and should’ve just unfollowed her on Facebook so that she didn’t see her posts in her timeline if she had a problem with them. My mom insists she doesn’t think she did anything wrong, but I beg to differ considering the event that happened during Christmas.\n\nAnyways, I’m pretty heated with my mom considering everything. I don’t really know what to do about the situation. I almost want to cut contact with my mom for a bit because of this. Obviously that’s not something I want to do because I love her, I just don’t know what else to do though to make her understand.\n\nSorry for this wall of text.",

      "description": "Hey. So I was having a party of just friends that I know pretty well. One one the friends that is more on the side of an acquaintance, let’s call him joe, brought a +1 that I did not know, who we’ll call dough.\n\nI was alright with dough because he was joes friend, but then he started doing very rude stuff at my house. We had the Nintendo switch out playing smash, and every time he lost he would throw the controller down to the carpet.\n\nNo one else was doing that, and he kept just throwing it to the ground like if it was his stuff. We didn’t get too and because the ground was carpet, but we were annoyed nonetheless. \n\nThen later in the night, he kept opening his beers on my WOODEN furniture. He def dented my table and some other things. I was not ok with this. I mean, the table wasn’t really mine, it was a house mates, and the same for the other furniture, so I called him out. \n\nDespite that, he kept doing it, so inicie decided to take the beers away from the party and just leave the canned ones to avoid confrontation. \n\nLater, he was talking about how some beers he brought sucked, and then I jokingly replied, “yeah they suck” and he got extremely defensive about it. He kept saying “fuck you” and “what did you say bro,” and then he squared up to my face.  I told him to gtfo of my house and he said he wouldn’t. \n\nThat’s when I got mad and I decided to hold his fists because I did not want to fight.  I then told him to gtfo, and I then pushed  him all the way through the hall way through out the door because he kept pushing me and trying to free his hands like he was going to punch me. \n\nWhen I got to the door, he pushed against the wall and tried pushing me down, but I remember all the wrestling from hs loll and just flipped him to the floor. \n\nNow I know there are no rules in fight, but while I had him in the floor, he kept trying to bite me. I just grabbed his head and pushed it to the floor to keep him from actually biting me. \n\n\nI then lifted him and literally threw him out the door. His friend left shortly after. He was  “sorry”. \n\n\nI live with a bunch of other people, so I didn’t want to fight in our house. The thing is though, some of the housemates were there but while I was holding him, they did nothing   They heard me tell him to gtfo, but they just watched.  Like wtf? Should I feel guilty? Did I do wrong? AITA? Are the Roomate’s the assholes? The guy?\n\nJust venting. Sorry. Don’t know who is the asshole. ",

      "description": "Basically I know several people who say the are \"bisexual\" but never dated the same sex and it annoys me to no end, because why not just say you are straight or lesbian. It just feels like you want to feel \"special\" or not considered \"ordinary\" or some bullshit like that.\n\nA girl I know just got out of a 4 year relationship and a few months after their breakup, I jokingly asked \"Now that you're single, are you going to hop on tinder and just bounce from pussy to dick,pussy to dick? because that's what I would do, minus the dick part\" and she laughed and said \"I like the part with the bouncing from dick to dick, but not the pussy part. I don't really find girls attractive and have no interest in having sex with them.\"\n\nI've known this girl for years and all those years, she has gone on and on about she is apart of the LGBTQ+ because she is bisexual. And I learn she doesn't even find girls attractive? I brought this up with her and she explained, \"I find girls attractive, but I'm just not sexually attracted to them\" Okay, what the fuck!?!?!\n\nI'm straight and I think people like Ryan Gosling, Ryan Reynolds etc. are attractive, does that make me bisexual? NO! of course not, because that would absurd. And I don't want you thinking I hate bisexuals or something because my brother is bi and has dated both men and women.\n\nI've known a few other people like her, and I'm convinced these people just want to feel \"special\" and put this label on themselves that isn't really there.\n\nAm I The Asshole for being annoyed by theses types of people?",

      "description": "A bit of background info, I've been a long term fan of anime and manga and recently got into the cosplay community. I've been kind of a closet photographer in the past, and decided to start a hobby as a cosplay photographer (shooting cosplayers). Cosplay photographers in my local community typically charge $60-80/h shoot and return 10-15 edited photos.\n\nNow, as I'm new, I'm looking to build my portfolio by collaborating in TFW (time-for-work) shoots, which means neither side pays the other. The problem is, when I post in communities that I'm willing to shoot TFW, the models who volunteer are either: (1) not very attractive (2) have low quality costumes or (3) late or don't show up. Whenever I reach out to someone I want to work with, they decline TFW and say they charge $50-100/h, saying it's only fair since I'm new and they've got more experience (and less to gain from a single set of free photos).\n\nNow I'll post that I'm doing TFW, but I have the right to select which models to work with and not everyone who volunteers will get chosen. Recently this cosplayer I rejected has been spreading gossip that I'm only out to shoot \"booth babes\" and telling everyone to stay away from me.",

      "description": "I (26f) had a car crash 4 years ago and it was pretty bad. Not my fault. Some people drove on the wrong side of the highway and slammed into me, head on. I've always been a bit of a depressive, so the near death experience had a big impact on me beyond all the injuries (superficial, I healed like wolverine thankfully). I remember thinking, huh, maybe I don't actually want to die. \n\nBut the more time that passed since then my life has really changes. I just felt less and less like 'myself', started doing stuff out of character (quit my long term job, stopped caring about income, etc) but I didn't put two and two together and link it to my accident. Because my life has been so privileged it never really occurred to me that this trauma may have actually negatively impacted me.  \n\nAnyway, along with those changes in my life I also noticed I was getting more irrational and lashing out in anger over things that wouldn't have bothered me before. \n\nSo things like, blaming close friends of mine for dumb stuff, isolating myself, becoming unreliable and constantly angry and sad. \n\nI ended up going to my doctor late last year, who recommended I get another brain scan (they did one in the er after my accident but I never had a second one) because she noticed my behaviour and condition seemed worse than usual. \n\nI was diagnosed with a (not life threatening) small aneurysm that I had surgery to fix (modern medicine blows my mind). So now my headaches have gone (I'd thought they were just hormonal) and I'm feeling way better to know that my particularly low rut may have been a product of injury. \n\nI had really gotten bad. Telling friends I wanted to die, blaming them for not being on my side when a guy wouldnt leave me alone,reminded one of them that her husband abused me and i still stuck by her etc. SO i genuinely do not blame them for blocking me and deciding amongst themselves to boot me from the group. Noone has to tolerate such treatment and i know that i am noones responsibility but my own.\n\nIve apologised via email as I'm blocked by 3 close friends, explaining that I'm pretty sure I was slowly getting worse and worse and am so sorry for my words ans actions. But I got zero response. It's now been 3 months. I can't keep trying Ti apologise. But I also feel so god damn worthless that such close friends can write me off after a mistake. \n\n**TLDR** got in a car crash 4 years ago. Had a mild brain injury diagnosed only a few months ago. Think this is why Mt depression worsened and I became a dick to my friends. Am I a bad person? My heart is broken.",

      "description": "A little bit of information about me: I'm a lesbian 15y/o living in a Nordic country, attending a public school in 9th grade. I'm diagnosed with depression, autism and anxiety. I find it extremely hard to talk verbally, make eye contact, and so the list goes on. (in short: I'm really socially anxious).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, the incident that ignited (not started) this all was around a month ago: I was walking out from the school building at lunch to go buy an energy drink from the grocery store in the same town. While going around the corner of the building, a group of 4-5 smoking. I recognized only two of them, those being two guys in my class. I didn't even look at their direction, I just kept on walking like usually. When passing by, one of the girls standing there decides to shout out loud \"Felicia!\"; I ignore them per usual. A second after, I hear a second girl (at least I think it was the 2nd one) shout \"Feliciaaaa! Do you wanna fuck me?\". Right after that, someone shouts \"Pfft, don't answer me then.\". Considering those 3 \"sentences\" was shouted within the span of a couple of seconds, I decide that enough is enough; I turn around and shout \"Don't fucking say my name, whore!\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got my drink and took another route to avoid them. I get inside I grab my history book and walk to the hallway where my next class is about to start, which was in about 5 minutes or so. I stand outside the classroom, on my phone. The hallway was a dead-end, classrooms on both ends. Soon enough, I see a group of about 6 walks up to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey start talking shit to me, insulting me and so on, despite being cornered in and insulted; I keep my calm and my expression remains the same blank one as always and I just desperately keep looking down at my phone for the time, knowing that the door for the classroom we're standing outside is gonna open at precisely 1240. One of the younger guys in the group starts swearing at me in Bosnian (used to know a Bosnian friend), the same guy then tries to kick my feet around to make me trip. I just stand there in the corner and wait for the 2 minutes to pass. Right before the teacher opens the door, one of the guys from my class goes \"This fuck isn't gonna say anything huh, man you gotta hit her before she says anything.\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe classroom door opens and I find my way out of the corner and just speed walk really quickly into the open area, knowing that there are newly installed cameras supervising those areas. They keep on following me, insulting me in my native language and Bosnian (that one guy kept on doing it for some reason). They continue kicking my feet, legs, trying to shove me around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the bus stop, my classmate comes up and starts threatening me, insulting me, claiming he's gonna beat me up on Monday unless I do X and Y. I just keep on ignoring him and he finally goes away when the bus arrives, I take the bus and I get home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for shouting back \"whore\"?",

      "description": "Hey there, long time lurker, first time poster. :) This is a long read for a relatively minor incident so be warned. :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a story from yesterday about a minor road rage in Regina, Saskatchewan that spilled into a Toys’r’us. It isn’t so much the incident itself but an experience I had with an “off-duty police officer” after the encounter that has me writing.\n\n \n\n  I was involved in a minor road rage incident outside the intersection at the Toy’r’Us on Albert north. Keep in mind the power was out in most of the city yesterday, this intersection included. I was a passenger in a vehicle with my sister and eight year old niece as we were heading through the 3-way intersection where  an SUV was turning from the left into our lane at the same we were proceeding through the intersection. We were in the far-right lane, the vehicle turning onto our street tried to merge into the far right lane from his left turn, which would have collided with us but fortunately both vehicles slowed down and we continued through the intersection. The man apparently shrugged his shoulders and put his hands up in the air at my sister in an annoyed manner, but other than that this was by all accounts  nothing to write home about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  However, my sister quickly realizes the man is now trailing us and following us into the parking lot of the Toys’r’Us. We park and the man drives to the entrance of the store and waits there. We wait inside our vehicle for a minute or so before he decides to park his vehicle. We decide that was our moment to go into the store with my eight year-old niece. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  We aren’t thirty feet into the store, barely past the turnstiles at the entrance where an angry, raised voice calls out to us “You guys really need to learn how to drive through an intersection”. We turned around, I give the guy an incredulous look and my sister tells him he was in the wrong as he was making a left turn into the far right lane. He's contesting my sister never stopped at the intersection. I  walk in-between both of them and told the man it didn’t matter - this wasn’t the place or time for this. I told him to leave. He drops an f-bomb and became increasingly irate. Everyone in the store is looking at us. I told the man he was in a kids store making a scene over some ridiculous road rage. I extended my arm as Im standing about six feet away as if to motion not to come closer to us - That was his cue to extend his arm like a football player and walk towards me as if he motioning he was coming through. I acquiesced and moved aside as he started to move inside the store, continuing to curse and tell us what morons we are. He barely missed making contact with me as he walked past, he would have with his extended arm had I not backed off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   As this point I pull out my smart phone and tell the man he’s going to be famous - he’s going to be on youtube. I point my camera at him as if I’m recording and start to ask him questions like his name, if he has something to say to do so, etc. I wasn’t actually recording at this point, I was fumbling with my phone trying to get it to record so I only caught the last 15 seconds of our encounter. Soon as I turned my phone on the man went from the hulk to someone who had just been caught on one of Chris Hansen’s “To catch a predator”. This jerk knew he was about to become a viral hit if he didn’t stop being a cantankerous lout. He instantly shut his mouth and made started walking towards the exit. I kept pace with the man so I could get his face on camera as I was now filming. As he gets to the exit he points at me and shouts to no one in particular “Someone get this guy out of here!” Before giving me the finger and walking out the exit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought this was the end of my little ordeal, but this is the part that really stuck in my craw…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Not 5 seconds after the road-rage has left the store a woman in her early 40’s walks up to me and says “I saw the whole encounter, I am an off duty police officer and you did not help the situation.” I give her my patented incredulous look and kind of mutter to myself and walk off. I was already pissed off at the Mr. Keeping it real, but this took the cake. This woman with her supercilious, back-seat conflict management has the gall to tell me she would have handled things better… as she sat there as a wallflower and did NOTHING the whole time the guy is cursing at us in front of children over nothing at all. The next 15 to 20 minutes I see her throughout the store with a huge shit-eating grin on her face as she tries her best to avoid an further eye-contact with me…. staring up at toys in the pallets…etc… It was infuriating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  What was she waiting for? To see if I passed the conflict-resolution test? To see if Mr.Psycho was going to pull a gun? What was the point of her waiting to tell me this? Why did she not try and stop the psycho as he followed my sister and my 8-year old niece (shopping for her birthday, by the way?  If she did in fact see the whole thing, as she claimed, why did she not immediately step in to get this guy away from us? She had at least a minute to step in to demonstrate her superior training. He followed us into the store to yell and curse, not shop.  I almost walked up to her to ask her for her name # badge number, and to sarcastically thank her for her help. I stopped myself because you know… police. I don’t want the hassle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, my actions weren’t as passive as they could have been, but I feel like my actions led to him immediately leaving the store like a scared coward, which was intended. I avoid confrontations at basically any cost, especially in public… but once you have my attention… you have my (&amp; my camera’s) attention. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat ameliorated my anger towards this officer was that FOUR separate Toys’R’Us employees approached me and asked if I was okay.  To be honest when the first gentleman was walking up to us I 100% expected him to ask us to leave the store after the hero cop told me in a loud &amp; curt tone how I screwed things up. This wasn’t the case, they all took their turns apologizing and asking if we were okay. The last one to ask us also told us if the man was still outside waiting somewhere to come to them and they would deal with him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you Toys’R’Us! Thank you for having my back when the backseat “off duty” officer stood by only to reprimand me only once the psycho road rage was gone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.

It's a really chill group, except for this one guy.\n\nSince day one, this weeb has had a thing for me. Not that I mind that much, it's a confidence booster.\n\nEveryday when I walk into the auditorium I see his head look for me. The guy barely showers and drinks at least 1 litre of pepsi (not even coca cola, PEASANT) every day.\n\nRecently my friends and I have been actively trying to avoid him. The reason is that he only speaks about anime and manga plus the facts stated above.\n\nIn class in he is really loud and annoying and he barely has any social skills.\n\nAt this very moment we are lying to him so he doesn't sit with us. Yesterday I lied about eating with friends from high school so I could avoid being alone with him.\n\nI kind of feel bad, but he doesn't seem to understand that nobody really likes him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre we the assholes here?",

      "description": "There’s a lot I could say about this, but I know this isn’t an advice sub, so I’m going to keep it short. A friend that I used to be close to but haven’t hung out with in two years reconnected with me recently. We’ll call him Alex. I originally distanced myself from Alex because he has some mental health issues that he refuses to get help with. I felt like a therapist, as did two of our other mutual friends at the time. He was completely reliant on other people for his happiness. Personally, I just couldn’t do it anymore, and he would not listen to anybody’s advice. \n\nI was going to give him a second chance after we reconnected (I ran into him at a bar), but later that night, he sent me a long-ass text in which he essentially explained to me how difficult the past two years have been. The things he told me he’s been through since we last spoke, I am honestly astounded that he still refuses therapy. To each their own I guess, but not when it means thrusting your emotional problems onto others. Anyways, somewhere in the middle of this long-ass text, he told me that if we don’t hangout while he’s home from school, he will never speak to me again. \n\nNow, the problem here is that I went to a very small high school, and many of us still see each other. There is no way I’ll be able to get around not seeing him again, unless I plan on turning down invites to future social events that he may be at. His younger brother and my younger brother are friends, too, and often times they all hangout together in a small group.  This is where I’m questioning if I’m the asshole. My brother seems to think that if I don’t hangout with Alex, it makes things weird for him as well. While this may be true, there are a lot of other reasons not listed here to help explain why I don’t want to see him, and I don’t feel as though I should have to associate with someone just so that things won’t be ‘weird’ in the future — especially when that person only brings negativity and drama into my life. Him threatening not to speak to me ever again is what really sealed the deal for me. To me, that’s just not something a grown adult should be saying. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I being an asshole by not reaching out to him?\n\n",

In December I met some of them and immediately there was one (we’ll call him Derek) who I couldn’t stand. He was all around pushy and always made vaguely sexual comments to GF\n\nAfter a couple weeks he started getting physical and I shut that down real quick. I told him to stop and asked my girlfriend to tell him the same if he didn’t listen. I thought all was well until fast forward to now and I find he never stopped nor did she stop him. It was never much just grouping here or there. She’s always swat him away but never really told him to stop.\n\nToday I told her that I’m done trying diplomacy and told her to choose either me or Derek. She got mad, called me an asshole, and defended him by saying he’s just joking.\n\nIt’s been a few hours and I’m starting to feel off about whether I’m in the wrong or not.

      "description": "For some background, this girl and I had been best friends for around two years. We had been through everything together, and were always with each other. I even went to her al-anon and eventually NA meetings with her. We went down the addiction path together, eventually, but I did not try to get clean unlike her. I did everything I could to help her, but she just wouldn't try. Not for herself, not for me, nothing. I understood she had a disadvantage, being her mom, dad, and brother were all also addicts, but I still knew if she did not want to get better she couldn't. At this point, she was addicted to pills, and I drank cough syrup daily (codeine). Both are opioids. I was not trying to get clean, but thought I could get her to.\n\nP.S. I know my post history illustrates that I am young and post pretty frequently. Just got Reddit and going through the few things I have been feeling guilty about. But I am a young addict, just lucky to try and turn myself around early.\n\nAnyway, fast forward about a month. She was still having a very difficult time, but I had turned much around. I really still don't know if I was ever addicted being I did not have a very hard time mentally. Physically, however, it was hell. I changed my living situation and could not get drugs anymore anyway, so it was really a forced withdrawal. My best friend also moved. She was living in Michigan, where we were best friends, then she moved to West Virginia. I was just in a different part of Michigan. While in Virginia, she went from pills to crack. I still tried to help her, but she started to get angry with me and would say very hurtful, personally cutting things to me. Making comments about my weight or sexuality. Even my living situation and past abusive problems. She knew how to hurt me and she did. At that point, I was done and stopped helping her. I no longer encouraged her to get clean, and sometimes even partied with her whenever she came to Michigan. I have since forgiven her for the comments, but I feel bad about supplying for her.\n\nFast forward another couple months. She moved back to Michigan with her mom, and began actually trying to recover to little success. She also still puts herself in bad situations, like dating a girl who was known to cheat on her partners, and made multiple suicide attempts with her and before their relationship. She asked me for help. She asked for my support and forgiveness, but I know whenever I am with her I feel shitty about myself. I wanted to help her, but I cut my ties with her. She has since had hospital visits, psyche ward stays, etc. AITA for not helping her?",

      "description": "Okay, mobile, first time poster, etc.\n\nSo I live in a VERY funny situation. I live with a \"foster\" family after escaping my mother, who I will be telling stories about on r/raisedbynarcissists . I've lived here for about six months.\n\nI have asked my foster dad to not make jokes about killing dogs. To make a long story short, I have unresolved PTSD about the murder of my dogs, and those jokes were incredibly triggering. \n\nFor months, every time he would make a joke about killing the family dogs, I would ask him not to. Every single time, I would get incredibly triggered. Most of the time I would go to my room and cry.\n\nEarlier this week he, once again, made killing dogs jokes, specifically a 'putting dogs to sleep' joke. When I asked him not to make those jokes, again, he continued his joke with 'the old night-night time'. I had to stop what I was doing [playing mario kart] and go cry for like, an hour. \n\nLater on, he was making jokes about how I have sad eyes. Me, being the angry sad teenager I am, immediately snapped back with, \"I wouldn't be so sad if you didn't joke about killing dogs all the time.\" \n\nHe told me to stop being so sensitive, to which, I yelled at him and swore, saying something along the lines of \"Do you want to know what I'm so fucking sensistive?\" I honestly don't quite remember, being angry makes my memory shoddy. Anyway, I divulged my trauma, and only then did he agree to not make the jokes that trigger me so much. We shook on it\n\nHis main line of defence was \"I didn't know that.\" I came very close to continuing to yell at him about how I shouldn't have to divulge my trauma to get people to stop doing things that obviously bother me. I held my tongue, but I'm still pretty fucking pissed I had to go that far. \n\nI feel like an asshole for yelling at him, but on the other hand, I repetedly asked him to stop. Over several months. I don't know. ",

The separate accounts would essentially be used at our discretion. My idea would be to have 1 shared credit card for our mutual expense in addition to the bank accounts. If we would like to have an additional credit card, they would be individual accounts. We currently have joint bank accounts/credit cards that I currently maintain.

      "description": "So basically my friend who I've known for a few months invited me to a game of PUBG Mobile on the weekends. We started the game and there were a few issues with voice chat so I had to wait for him until the plane automatically kicked us out. While playing there were a few moments which just made my blood boil like when I asked him for some ammo that he had but didn't need because his gun didn't require that ammo type, yet he insisted that he would need it in the future (The whole game he never used that type) he had one hundred or so bullets and only gave me 10 even though my guns all required it. Near the end of the game, he asked for all of my bandages and said: \"its the least you owe me for giving you that ammo\". I got really quiet and didn't talk for a bit because I knew if I did I'de get really angry and say something I shouldn't. He also constantly kept bugging me to stop in the middle of a big field where we are easy targets (Nearing the end of the game so the life circle wasn't particularly large) eventually I got so fed up and just let him heal. Only then did I realise he had the maximum amount of health he could have before he couldn't heal anymore and I got really upset with him because we were already being shot by someone, we ended up dying because he kept accidently double tapping the \"enter car\" button and getting out. He got shot and died and I went out to help him up because I didn't want to seem like a dick and just driving off but I got shot and died.

      "description": "So, some context, I [26M] met my now ex-girlfriend [25F] about a year ago. I met most of her friends and even her family before we got together. We became close and started dating a couple of months ago. We of course have been intimate in this time. \n\nNow, over the course of this past year, the topic of transgenders has come up numerous times in private conversations between just us and conversations with other people. I’m very tolerant of people’s choices so it’s never been an issue. Fast forward to ~2 weeks ago and we are just hanging out at her place when we start talking about our future (nothing new, and mostly a casual conversation until, well). \n\nWe had previously discussed marriage and how many kids we want etc., so when I made a comment about her having my children I was kinda surprised with her response of “well, they’d have to be adopted”. I paused for a second and asked if she is unable to have kids. She got visibly nervous and started choking up a little bit. I started to realize it was a sensitive subject and was ready to comfort her and talk about our options. \n\nIt was difficult for her to get out but the gist was: “No, I can’t have kids. I used to be a man.”\n\nI was speechless. I had so many questions but wasn’t able to get a single one out of my mouth. She could tell by my face that I was in utter disbelief. I just told her I need some time to think about this and went home. \n\nSo I went home and slept on it. I never considered myself transphobic but now I am going back and forth with myself because I didn’t know if it was transphobic for me not to not want to be with her anymore. I came to the conclusion that I was going to break up with her, and that it is my sexual preference. I know she is effectively a female but I can’t see myself getting past the fact that she is not biologically a female. I always wanted my kids to be *my and my wife’s kids*. Not adopted, and not a surrogate. I’m torn because while I wanted this, I was ready to pursue alternative options because I really love her, but now that I found this out I feel totally different about it. \n\nTwo days later she came over for dinner and I was sort of on the fence about breaking up with her (I figured I would do it, but wasn’t sure if that was the time). This being the first time seeing her since I found out, it just felt, different. I knew I had to do it. She got really upset and said she can’t help the way she is. I told her it’s not about her and more about me being unable to move past it. She cried a lot but eventually left, leaving me feeling just absolutely awful. I love her but now I can’t see a future together. I honestly felt a little betrayed to have that secret kept for so long, but also understand why she wouldn’t want to tell me. I’ve been in communication with her and she’s still upset but says she’s not angry because she knows how it can be tough to accept. She insists that over time I will come around, but I just don’t see that happening. Her friends are calling me transphobic, an asshole, inconsiderate, the works. I basically just tune them out because she doesn’t seem to be on the same wavelength as them so it doesn’t matter to me what they think. \n\nSo, am I transphobic? Am I the asshole?",

Therefore, this is a commmitted relationship.\n\nOn to the issue, I'm the tidy type in that I clean-up after myself, I put my things away, I do my best to keep a clean house and do more than my fair share of the house work. Both in the garden and inside the house.\n\nMy girlfriend is the messy type, I don't think she does it intentionally, she's just a bit of a scatterbrains but it winds me up none the less. She defintely does less of the chores and in her own way of being untidy creates more work for me to do.\n\nI ask my girlfriend to try and clean-up after herself in various ways, put her clothes in the laundy instead of on the floor, throw away rubbish when she's opened/unpacked something, clean-up her mess in the kitchen, the front room, where ever; I get peeved about her untidyness but it never really turns into a fight. I just try to push in the direction or doing the considerate thing.\n\nOn the other hand, If i ever do anything that she doesn't agree with, something as minor as putting the wrong clothing items in the wrong hamper (she likes to keep towels/sheets seperate from clothes) she gets really wound up at me about it, if I highlight how many of her quirks I need to tolerate and how surely she can tolerate some of mine it'll usually turn into a fight where we refuse to apologise or talk to each other for hours, on rare occasions due to work scheduldes even days at a mine.\n",

      "description": " Hey All,\n\nSo back story time. I've been with my boyfriend for about 6 years. I broke off the relationship half way through for a few reasons, main one being that he had no job, no hobbies other than gaming and no intention of doing anything with his life. While we were apart, he seemed to get his act together. He got a job, lost some weight and tried to get me back. He succeeded. He was/is my best friend, I love him and so we got back together. When we got back together, I told myself that I wasn't going to nag anymore, and I would let him live his life, I would live mine and that would be fine.\n\nSo 3 years later, we seems to be in a similar situation. He has a job which is great, but we're 25 and I feel it's time for him to get a car and learn to drive. I've been driving him and me everywhere we go the last few years and it's time for us to think about moving out of our parents' homes.\n\nIt started more than a year ago when I encouraged him to start driving because he was looking for a job, and since he had very little experience and no college degree, driving might help him out a bit (it helped me get 2 jobs). When he got a job I continued encouraging him, driving would be nice for getting him there on time, and maybe we could meet for lunch sometimes, where it's impossible with me just driving. Now, I want him to drive because i'm sick of driving us everywhere we go. It took him 8 months to get his learners permit, 5 months to do the legal 12 driving lessons and more than 4 months to buy a car (ongoing). He makes excuses whenever I ask if he has made any progress, and other times just straight up ignores me.\n\nI confronted him last night, telling him how I feel, telling him he's wasting time and although I know I can be impatient, I feel like he either doesn't want to do these things, or isn't bothered. He says i am too impatient, I want things done on my own time without considering anyone elses time and I make him out to be a failure at everything and he's sick of it. I tell him I don't think of him as a failure, but I think of him as a non-trier. He responds by telling me I want him to do these things for selfish reasons, I want him to drive so he can drive me places and I want to move out to get away from my family.\n\nThe truth is I do want him to drive so he can drive us sometimes, but I also want him to take responsibility for something. I do want to move out to get away from my family, but also so I can see him every day.\n\nMy question is, am I too naggy? Am I being a spoiled entitled bitch? I genuinely do want him to do these things for his benefit, but I would be lying if I didn't say I didn't want them for me a little bit too.",

      "description": "So I want to give this some context, I [M21] have a girlfriend [F20] and her best friend [F20] who are all really pretty close. Now this friend of my girlfriend's is very open to lots of experiences. For example, her and my girlfriend had a threesome and she also is very hypersexual. Anyways, she decided one day to get her nipples pierced, and she sent me photos of them to show them off, which isnt super weird considering the threesome background.\n\nAnyways, over the weekend my girlfriend and her friend were at their place and my girlfriends brother [M15] was hanging out with them. The girls drank a little bit and the next day I was told by my girlfriend that the brother saw her piercings poking through her shirt and asked about it, to which she responded by flashing her tits to her. My girlfriend didnt seem to think it was a big deal that her own brother saw that, but when I heard about it, I voiced a different opinion.\n\nI told her that it was not ok to flash a 15 year old boy, especially because in my state, the age of consent is 16. Even if he was 16, it would still be weird and not ok to me considering it's her friends little brother. I was not expecting her response, to where she said I was being sexist because guys can show their tits so girls should be allowed to as well. She says equality of rights. I fully support womens rights, but tits on a female are secondary sex organs, but not on a male.\n\nDoes this make me sexist?

      "description": "You ever meet someone who's so nice, so charming, so lovable, just gets a long with everyone, that you yourself are scared to point out a flaw with how they're acting, as it may hurt your status, and make people turn against you? Well as you may have guessed, that's the situation I am in right now.\n\nI was elected president of my class because they knew I'd prepare and execute to the absolute best of my ability. I'd work on any project we had, and try and lead my class to success. I'm not a very loud individual, I definitely lean more towards introverted, while my representative-elect, would be on the exact opposite end of the spectrum, and gain notoriety for their voice. While I, would try and gain it for my actions.\n\nWe were clearly explained our job duties by our superiors, they told us exactly what they were supposed to, and what I was supposed to do. As president, it's my job to conduct the meetings, I run it, I'm the one asking the questions, and trying to get the input- and NOT the representative's job. \n\nI worked hard to prep for that meeting, I typed a paper of what I was getting out of it, what we were going to do, the signups, the speech, the times, the roles, everything, it was all tucked into a neat folder. I had convinced people to be our sponsors, and had everything setup for this meeting. \n\nAnd when the meeting happens, my heart drops. My representative takes my paper and just starts running it as if it were her meeting that she organized, and planned. She looks great, I'll admit, she's a natural leader- on the surface. I did all the work, including the meeting work, I got our input and am now organizing it for the day the event is supposed to happen. Everyone commends her for her work on it, while I'm treated as inferior, despite the fact that I'm president! \n\nI was furious, naturally, that my work didn't get recognition and was instead rewarded to someone else who didn't put it in. I couldn't get on them about it, that'd make the whole situation look a mess (which I worked hard to avoid) if I started arguing at a meeting, plus like I said, that's a risk as I may get people turning on me. I want people to like me, it's important when you have a job like this.\n\nAITA for being mad at them? I really like them a lot, they have an amazing personality and is easy to get a long with, but sometimes when  you cross into my territory, I get defensive, and I don't know if I'm overeating in this. I love their input, but it almost feels like they stole from my work from me, I don't know if I am the jerk from this.\n\n  \nTL;DR: Someone who's more extroverted took my work at a meeting, despite the fact that it's my job to conduct them, and I got mad at them for it, but I HAVEN'T TOLD THEM ANYTHING.

      "description": "A few days ago, I was hanging out at a table of fellow students (wouldn't exactly call them friends) in our campus atrium. A girl asked me if I'd do her a favor and go grab her some paper towels from the bathroom, because the mens bathroom was about 20ft closer to us than the girl's bathroom. I would have done her the favor, but I saw that she wasn't actually busy with anything, she was just chatting with the other students. I figured that she could just do it herself, and I wasn't gonna go and do her bidding just because she didn't feel like walking the extra 20 feet to the girl's bathroom. I told her to grab the towels herself, and she gave me a dissapointed glare, making me wonder if I was in the wrong.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This is something I’ve been thinking about for awhile, and plus I just saw the post that says “AITA for returning my VDay gift to my boyfriend” so I’m inspired I guess.  \n\nMy bf and I are in an LDR. THIS IS RELEVANT. We are 22M and 21F. I’m still in college, he graduated in December. This was our second Valentine’s Day together, but the first we got to spend in the same city. About a week or two before Valentine’s Day, he was in my town and we were in Walmart buying groceries for weekend meal planning and I saw a dress for like $10 that I thought was super cute. I decided against getting it bc trying it on would’ve took up too much time and money’s tight too so it’s Saul Goodman.  \n\nValentine’s Day comes and bf is here in my apartment and is waiting so patiently for me until I finish classes. I come home and he presents me with a dress from Walmart. Not the same one I saw before. It’s short-sleeved, turquoise, and quite, uh, small. Now I’ve lost some weight and fit into small clothing but this dress easily made me look like I was in a sausage casing. Plus, there was an elastic band in the middle that basically cinched my waist and cut it in half in a very unflattering way (I’m a pear shape). I later learned the dress was 92% polyester, 8% spandex.  \n\nI thanked him (duh), tried it on and hung it up. He asked “This is the one you wanted right?” Well like I said, it was not, but I didn’t want to hurt his feelings so I said, “I’m not positive , but I’m pretty sure!” A few days later, he had left and I went back to Walmart to choose a new dress or at least get a size up. I ended up choosing a whole new one that was white, long sleeved, a size up and it was so. much. better.  \n\nI did tell him I got a new dress bc he called me as I was leaving the Walmart. When I explained that I exchanged the dress, I could kind of hear in his voice that he seemed a bit hurt. I can understand why bc it’s his first time giving a Valentine’s gift and I exchanged it. When I modeled the new one for him later, he loved it on me.  \n\nMy mom says that as the giftee I can do whatever I please with the gift but she liked the turquoise one better.  \n\nPlz help me y’all, AITA?",

      "description": "It’s kind of a long story but I had this friend I knew for years. He was my best friend for a while and we went from high school to college together. One day, my friend suddenly kept talking about this hot girl he saw in one of his clubs. Wouldn’t shut up about her. He seemed into her but wouldn’t ask her out because he was too scared of getting a no. Asked me to go with him and talk to her.\n\nWe went to his club together and I ended up talking to her. She was friendly and nice. My friend didn’t say much of anything but when we left, he said that he thought he made some progress. Didn’t seem that way, but whatever. After that, while I was walking to class, that same girl walked up to me and said that we should hang out together. I didn’t mind, but wondered what my friend would think, so I asked her if he could join us. She said yes, things seemed fine, but when I told my friend about what happened, he was pissed that she talked to me and not him. I said that he should actually talk to her so she’ll notice him and he was even more pissed off, felt really guilty about that. \n\nAfter that, we kept hanging out but my friend was still too shy. I tried leaving them alone once, but I guess my friend didn’t say anything to her and she felt awkward. Eventually, she asked me out and I wasn’t sure if I should say yes. But I was starting to like this girl so I went out with her. It went great and we kept dating. I was nervous what my friend would think but thought that he should have spoken up and actually talked to her all those times we were hanging out. Eventually, he found out and he really yelled at me, started to attack me. Told me to get out of the apartment (we were sharing a place at the time). My girlfriend asked me to move in with her when I told her what happened. I really like this girl and things are going great but my best friend isn’t speaking to me and I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for what happened.",

Called out on Facebook for being hostile &amp; “not understanding” after getting upset, apologizing &amp; then requesting a refund.\n\nOur care provider for our youngest son abruptly cancelled care for the entire month of April (and going forward) on the 3rd day of the month. She’s having a mental health crisis &amp; has some other things going on in her personal life. I was upset with her when she told me, but I immediately apologized when she informed me on what was happening with her &amp; have been nothing but cordial &amp; polite since. She found us spotty care for the next 2 weeks, but after that nothing, leaving us with at least a week with no care, and scrambling to find a new daycare after that. (Which is incredibly difficult where we live)\n\nThursday we asked if she would pay us back for what we paid her for April, less the care she did provide. This is upward of $750 that we can’t afford to throw away.  Yesterday she posted a rant on Facebook about how we were hostile &amp; aggressive and don’t support people with mental health issues. I’ve barely spoken to her since the first time &amp; it was definitely not aggressive. She also told my devastated 3 year old that it was my fault she couldn’t take care of him because I was mean. My older son confirmed this.\n\nSo AITA for asking to be paid back so I don’t have to sacrifice our savings because I won’t be able to work for a good portion of the month? \n",

But I'm really not comfortable with meeting her folks yet. Especially since she told me he ran my background and I really don't know how I feel about that.\n\nSo we're texting and I ask her \"Uh will I be meeting anybody when I pick you up tonight? lol\" I'm being strategic as possible with my lol's and smiley emojis to really keep it light.\nBut she apparently thinks I'm referring to her friends, to which I reply \"haha, that's not what I meant.\"\n\nBetween the response time I just suck it up and figure \"Well, if I meet the folks, I meet the folks - worse thing it can be is awkward.\" and I decide I don't want to divulge I was nervous, because I don't want her to feel uncomfortable about anything.\n\nBut she keeps pressing \"what did you mean?\" and I'm responding, playfully \"Nuffin\" \"no, what did you mean\" \"Nufffiiinnnnn\" with smiley emojis and the tongue out smiley and all that shit. I'm really trying to play it off as nothing here, guys.\n\nWell about an hour before we're going to meet up with her friends (and about a half hour before I need to leave to pick her up) she sends \"Just forget it. It doesn't seem like you want to go\" \n\nAt first I ask what gave her that idea -- but then just follow it with a fess up text that I was nervous and didn't want to admit it, but got over my nerves and just didn't want to bring it up.\n\n\"Well you should have just said that. Beating around the bush and being coy is no way to communicate. I would have understood if you just told me but you decided to play games.\"\n\nfrom there I'm in a state of wtfffuuuhhh?

      "description": "A little preface: I followed this individual on Twitter, and she followed me back. We share several mutual followers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe fandom on Twitter. We don't know each other in real life. Yeah, I know, it's kinda ridiculous, no need to tell me that. \n\nAnyways, I decided to try and socialize/reach out to someone who follows me on Twitter for once, so I did so, and everything went swimmingly for about 5 minutes until I brought up how I don't like talking to new people because I'm afraid of coming off as weird, awkward, annoying, etc. \n\nI wasn't being creepy or anything like that. In hindsight, I realize this was a really stupid thing to say, and I should've just let the conversation flow like normally. Anyways, I was basically left on \"Seen\" about 10 minutes into our actual meeting, and I felt extremely terrible for saying what I said, so then I sent something along the lines of, \"Anyways I'd rather talk about something positive. What's your favorite movie?\" A (much closer) friend told me after the the fact that the opening line was a bad idea. I agree with that too. \n\nSo, after waiting for about 10 more minutes for a response that hopefully would allow me to salvage this conversation and continue on like normal. But all I get is some text at the bottom of the DMs that says, \n\n\"You can no longer send Direct Messages to this person.\" \n\nI check her profile and it says that her tweets aren't available to view for me. So, as luck would have it, I have been blocked after that short, awkward, weird interaction which I blame entirely on myself. \n\nSo, am I the asshole in this situation? Thanks in advance. ",

      "description": "So, we are not made out of money. I do have an awesome job and my girlfriends job pays her bills pretty much (not much opportunity to save). We live in NY, Long Island to be more exact. The cost of living here is crazy, but we somehow make things work. We discussed marriage and actually looked at a possible venue yesterday bc we were always talking about how amazing itd be to have the reception there.\n\nSo I told her, I want to get her a diamond, it may not be the biggest carat but silly me had it in my mind that you can ONLY propose with a diamond.  Diamonds are a girls best friend, right? I could buy her one but it would basically wipe out my savings (I am saving for a down payment on a house, well we are).\n\nMy girlfriend explained to me that a ring symbolizes the love we have for each other but in no way does it have to be a diamond. She would much rather that money be put towards a house, which I agree with. So we went browsing in NYC and she found a BEAUTIFUL ring, not diamond, but moissanite. Personally ive never heard of it but damn it was really nice and she lit up ear to ear! Not only was moissanite affordable, you can hardly tell the difference. Say no more! \n\nI guess why I am here is, my older brother JUST got engaged yesterday. He blew HALF his savings on a $21k (2ct) diamond ring that is beautiful! But I think to myself is holy shit, am I an asshole for not getting my gf a diamond? She made herself clear bc I confided in her about this, she loves me so much and I could propose with a pandora ring and she would still say yes 1000x. It made me happy because this is one of the many things I adore of my girlfriend.\n\nAITA? Why does diamond have to be the industry standard? \nThanks!",

      "description": "My girlfriend got a bunch of yeast infections last year, like one every other month. Every time, she went to the doctor because she \"doesn't like monistat.\" The doctor wasn't even testing her, just giving her a prescription every time, so I wasn't convinced every single time was an actual yeast infection and not just her being paranoid.\n\nFinally she decides to go get a bunch of testing done to find out what is causing these infections (even though only one was a confirmed yeast infection) and they found nothing. She basically spent a bunch of money on useless tests. \n\nShe changed up her diet and clothes and doesn't get them much, but still runs to the doctor every time she thinks she has one, literally the day she feels it at all, she'll go to the clinic. I gently pointed out that perhaps she is having an allergic reaction or maybe is just being a little dramatic whenever anything feels a little \"off\" down there and she got very angry with me and told me never to comment on her health again. All I did was suggest that perhaps she is overreacting or misdiagnosing herself. AITA?",

Honestly it's a good deal that in theory, should benefit everyone. \n\nIn short, he is three months behind. He lost his main job, but still had a part time job that pays his Insurance, phone &amp; car payments. He finally found a second job as a waiter and has promised to pay me every day from his tips. The ultimatum I gave was if he falls another month behind, he's out. I've put up my own money thus far and my parents know nothing about this situation. \n\nSince this is an informal agreement, he did not pay a deposit nor do I plan to charge him late fees. However, I've completly ran out of patience. He spends all his time smoking, playing video games, and lounging around. I've also noticed 2 new games, a controller and some other nonessentials. \n\nSeeing that, among other typical lazy roomate complaints. I dont want to kick him out, but I'm done enabling his behavior. So I took his devices off the internet. He is pretty upset about it, and claims to not understand why I would do that, since we have a \"plan\". \n\nMy plan is to give him access back once he gets back to owning me two months and he provides me with a payment plan to pay me back in a timely matter based on his new income. I do plan to have set repercussions if he makes more late payments, just haven't figured that part out yet. \n\n",

      "description": "Okay so I’m still a High School student, and today at lunch me (and many others, keep this in mind) ran to the start of the line. Of course, me being the “teachers pet” wouldn’t do it without a reason, which was that I didn’t eat dinner or breakfast yesterday which basically made me feel like I was starving to death. Anyways, as I run up to the person behind me is ranting that me and the person in front of me “cut the line and have to go all the way to the back.” I ignored it and so did he, and after a while he singled me out and started calling me an idiot and an asshole. Of course I was weirded out and felt a bit bad and that maybe I should’ve just went to the back of the line, even though every single person before me and the dude in front of me ran as well. Next, when I sat down next to my friends (which we “claimed” when we walked in) and the same guy behind me in the line starts screaming at me and my friends on how we stole his spot. We did come in a bit late, but we didn’t come in so late that he was there. My friends said they we got here first and that he should mind his own business. He looked like he was about to cry (keep in mind this is a HIGH SCHOOL student close to graduating) and I felt really bad about it. So reddit, I want to ask you, am I the asshole here or no?\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Hello! Just wanted to say I apologized to the guy and we’re not enemies anymore :P So thank you for letting me know how I was in the wrong here because otherwise I don’t think I would’ve been able to make a friend :)",

      "description": "For privacy, I am using a throwaway account and obscuring some identifying details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father died a few years ago, in his fifties. He is survived by me (his only child), his ex-wife (my mother), his sister (my aunt), his estranged brother (my uncle), and his parents (my grandparents). This is the story of how my grandparents and I stopped speaking to each other after he died.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad moved away from the deep south to the west coast to become an engineer. My grandparents still live in his childhood home. Grandpa is a retired railroad worker with a pension. (He used to tell me that he got that job when he was young by just showing up and refusing to leave.) Grandma is a homemaker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my dad died, I flew out to take care of his body, his house, his work, and basically everything else, with my mom and step-siblings. My dad had always told me he wanted a Tibetan Sky Burial. But since that was illegal, cremation would do. He was into the \"deathling\" community and cheap, environmentally friendly treatment of corpses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut when I called my grandparents, they told me they wanted me to fly his embalmed corpse to them so that they could bury him in the family plot. I told them that it would be extremely expensive (I had to pay for everything out of pocket), difficult to arrange logistically, and an especially bad idea for my dad's body, which was found about two days after he actually died. Besides, my dad hated the idea of embalming and burying corpses. They begrudgingly agreed, but insisted that I \"bring him home\". I knew my dad hated that area, but I thought I could give them some of the ashes, then spread the rest someplace he liked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward about a week. I'm at my grandparents' house. They have arranged a Nazarene burial and published an obituary soliciting donations to their church. (My dad was not Nazarene.) I am getting ready to divide the ashes for them, when they start berating me for having him cremated against their wishes and not letting them keep all the ashes. I won't recount everything they said, but they kept asking, \"What about us?\" and telling me, \"We could die soon\" and \"The heartbreak you're causing will kill us.\" Eventually, I offered them all the ashes. They refused, saying I had taken him away from them. I just didn't know what to do at that point, so I drove off before sunrise and didn't contact them again. I still have the box of ashes because I just don't know what to do with them at this point. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So a few weeks ago open enrollment started and my ex and I sat down to talk about coverage for my son.  At the time we were going to get him health insurance and no dental. But as i thought about it I was like “it would be stupid to not get him dental insurance.” It’s pretty cheep and with all his mouth issues (he’s 9 and went through a round of braces and now wears a retainer.) the cost of his future bills are going to add up.  And god forbid he actually needs work. A filling out of pocket can cost upwards of $400 around here.  Plus you need to be on most plans for a year before you get any orthodontist coverage. It just seems like the medically responsible thing to do.  \n\nI let her know I was going to in fact  get him dental coverage and that she was expected to pay her share 39%  or $18 a month. She is railing against it.  Trying to say I’m trying to get her to pay for my personal coverage (I’m not) and that he can get insurance next year like we previously discussed.  \n\nSo I informed her that she was required to either pay her portion or provide her own health insurance as it stated in our child support order and if she doesn’t, I will file for contempt.  Now she’s attacking me personally like I’m doing something TO her when I only want her to do her job as a mom.  Am I the asshole? ",

      "title": "AITA for kicking out an autistic kid from my movie theater?",
      "description": "This one is a little interesting\n\nA little backstory first.\n\nI am a manager (m 19) at a movie theater, in a rougher part of a major Canadian city.\n\nWhile cleaning a theater to prepare it for the next showing, a 16 year old looking kid came into the theater trying to find his hat. No problem, stuff gets lost all the time, and I know exactly where to look; (stuff almost always finds its way under the seats). The whole time we were looking, he was cussing under his breath, \"son of a bitch\" \"fuck me,\" to me it seemed a little excessive but i understand people get frustrated when they lose things. I would expect this reaction if someone had lost their phone, but he had only lost his hat. Anyways I find his hat (under the seat), he takes it, says thanks, and goes on his way. The hat was a black hat with a Dos Equis logo on it. After he leaves, I think to myself \"wow that interaction was weird,\" and go on with my day without thinking anything of it. \n\nfast forward about an hour\n\ni was at box office when a guest informed me there was a disturbance by the vending machines. I thank her for informing me and start heading over there. Immediately I see a man throwing punches at another individual. I intervene and tell the man to leave now. He turns around (he appears to be a teenager) and very smugly chuckles and says \"oh thats my mom.\" I say \"doesnt matter, you need to leave now.\" To me it seemed like he thought he could get away with doing whatever he wanted to his mom, judging on his response. regardless, I was going to kick him out no matter what his response was. He requested to leave out of the front doors, which I thought was an odd request considering what had just happened. I said no and escorted him out of the side doors. He kicks the door on the way out.\n\nI go to check up on the mom, she is okay but has tears in her eyes. Behind her is her younger son who was holding onto his eye and crying (he had gotten a black eye from his older brother). I ask if she is okay, she says yes, she says that her son is autistic and is 16 but has the mental capacity of an 8 year old. That explains it. She was completely silent from when i approached the situation, until I asked if she was okay, she had not said anything while I was kicking the kid out. Regardless, we give her a refund, a few passes and send her on her way (this took about 10 minutes from the time i asked her if she was okay). I apologized for kicking him out, saying that when I saw violence i had to act. She says not to worry.\n\nAfter a few minutes I realized the kid was the same kid who lost his hat (i had recognized the hat). this explained his behavior to me. \n\nFast forward about an hour, I was coming back from break.\n\nAs I walk in the doors, a fellow manager says to me that the cops are here, looking for someone. (he shows me a picture of the individual). its the kid. fuck. \n\nI go up to the cops, they asked for my story, I told them i saw someone throwing punches and kicked him out. They said he was autistic. I told them the mom told me until thereafter. They said not to worry, but that he had gone missing. \n\nTurns out that when i kicked him out he kinda just kept walking instead of waiting for his mom or whatever, and again, this is in a rough neighborhood. \n\nSo am I an asshole for kicking out an autistic kid, leading to him going missing? I feel like perhaps I should have waited and asked the mom before kicking him out, but she never said anything while i was doing it. I have no idea what happened to this kid, and I feel really bad that my actions led him to going missing. Then again, I also feel justified in this situation because the dude was beating the shit out of his family, what else could I have done. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone needs any extra details or clarification just let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I thought I would finally get a chance tonight because he said we were all going to go out and rent a limo and slam beers in it driving around to different bars. I go to work with the plan that I’m going to meet them all when I’m done. Halfway through my shift my boyfriend texts a screenshot of one of the coworkers saying it’s “shop only” and I can’t come along. We’ve been trying to save money and I don’t really have any friends up here, so I am now stuck home alone with nothing to do. My boyfriend apologized but still went and is still out. I told him how I feel but that seems irrelevant to him. He’s definitely mad at me at this point, as well- I did text a snarky “at least one of us is having fun”. While I know that’s wrong, he had zero hesitation about still going and only texted “wow” back to me. He knows I’ve been lonely and depressed because we’ve talked about it. He invited me out with two of the crew ONE time and kicked me under the table throughout and told me I was being embarrassing. I was being very reserved because  know I can be loud. It seems he’s concerned with impressing these people and not much else. AITA?",

      "description": "This is rather light compared to some of the super drama filled posts on this sub. If that’s what you’re here for, about face. \n\nFew days ago I had to get some routine maintenance done on my vehicle. It’s a higher end dealership, so there’s a nice waiting room/lounge area with TVs, charging stations, beverages and snacks. There were a couple unforeseen issues on my vehicle so I ended up being there for about 3 hours for what was supposed to be an oil change and tire rotation. \n\nAbout two hours into waiting there (I was alone in there for quite a while at this point) a salesman walked in a little girl and her younger brother, they both had tablets, they sat down and the salesman left. The girl was somewhere between 8-10, and the boy was probably 5 or 6. We were in there alone and I wanted to make them feel comfortable, so I started talking to them about the snow storm that was all over the TV. We’re in the southwest and they had never really seen snow so it started a good fun little conversation. Then the little boy started showing me his games on his tablet, and I was just entertaining them. \n\nWe were really having a good time and about a half hour into it the little girl was telling me all about her family and her life. All totally normal stuff, but then she started to tell me about their house and how close it is to the school (she specifically told me about walking through the path behind the school taking a left and walking X houses down, etc.) and what time they do this, and I cut her off. I didn’t know her name I just said, “Sweetie, I’m sorry, but you really shouldn’t be telling me this stuff. I’m a nice man, and would never hurt you, but you don’t *know* that. You can’t tell these types of things to strangers.” \n\nIt seemed like she understood, and shook her head yes, but then she totally shut down. It seemed like I almost scared her. Any attempts to talk to her from that point on were futile. It was sad because I was really having fun with them, could tell they were, and I wanted them to feel comfortable in this place alone with me. \n\nSide note: no one came to check on them, like once. In the entire hour I was there with them. Their grandparents were looking at getting a car, but no salesman came around to look for them or anything. That didn’t really seem right to me, but whatever. \n\nAITA for stopping this girl in the middle of her story and pointing out what she shouldn’t be telling me and why? Should I have let it go, knowing I’m obviously not going to do anything, and they’re not my kids so it’s not my responsibility to educate them on these things?",

      "description": "Hi guys,\n\nI'll try to keep backstory minimal and factual\n\n  \nMy brother got married this past Saturday. I was a groomsman. I had a great time. I don't think my dad did. My dad and I had a fight the day after the wedding where he believed I got too drunk (I did) but I believed I was still having a great time and he was either responding to a specific disagreement we had or he wanted to take out his bad mood on me.  \nMum took my side and I believe she harshly reprimanded him in private. Dad apologized to me, but I believe he likely felt coerced into it and ganged up on.  \n\n\nThe next morning dad woke up in an even worse mood. I would later find out that he had been rude to all of the family members present that morning. I also woke up in a bad mood after ruminating on events most of the night. I tried to keep this to myself and just get through the day and eventually get home, but my fuse was very short.  \n\n\nI walk outside to unload my things with a neutral expression on my face, eager to avoid initiating conflict. Dad meets me with a scowl. I respond with my own scowl. Dad aggressively asks if my tie and belt which are in his car are mine and shoves them into my hands. I respond aggressively that they are. Dad then goes back into his car and grabs the suit that I purchased for my brothers wedding onto the gravel. At this point, I lose it, I get up close to his face and scold him like I never have before. I tell him I will kick his ass and that I am this close to doing it and I make it very physically clear that I will follow through on this. He stays silent.  \n\n\nI have tried to keep this retelling factual and balanced and also include his perspective but do not let my understanding of his perspective fool you into thinking that I believe he has behaved in any way acceptably.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrior to this, this individual has cheated on my mother and has hit her once before on a trip to Europe a year prior. The hitting was a smack that I have been informed has not happened before or since. It was a shock.  \n\n\nAm I finally sticking up for myself or did I lose the moral high ground by threatening violence\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

      "description": "Hey guys. I’ve been pretty conflicted about lately and feel like a bad friend.\n\nMy friend and I are both in our 30s and have been teamed up since middle school. We’ve been through college, bad relationships, divorce and all that together and she’s my closest confidant. We mainly communicate by text (we’re not phone call people) and getting together when possible as we live a few hours away from each other. We pride our friendship on not being super needy with each other and there’s no hurt feelings when we don’t respond right away or over a few days. \n\nLately she’s been visiting the town I live in a lot and inviting me like normal, but I’ve been flaky. The reason I’ve been hesitant is because her kids are rude. They’re 9 and 11 and always make rude comments to each other and people around them. I’ve been called fat, lazy and stupid by them with their mom, my friend, not really saying anything or doing anything to stop it. I don’t feel like I can say anything else except “hey that was rude”. The behavior and comments continue even though my friend tries. I’m childless and therefore don’t want to tell anyone how to parent. \n\nI much prefer hanging with her without her kids and have been skipping out on hanging out lately. She wanted to meet for lunch this past weekend and I said I was busy because I didn’t want to hear comments about how gross my food looks or why I’m eating so much (I don’t, just a chunk). \n\nAm I the asshole for avoiding my friend because of her kids?

      "description": "Ok this is a long one, with many people involved, so thanks in advance to those who read through the whole thing. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (24f) and one of my closest friends, we'll call him Alex (24m), have been at something of an impasse about whether I should let a mutual of ours - we'll call them Erin (23f) - back into my life as a friend. \n\nThis all began years ago in high school. We all belonged to a friend group that was pretty close-knit. There were like a dozen of us, and we were the weird artsy kids who spent time drawing together, talking about anime and Doctor Who, and had a name for our little club. We had a lot of fun, and I have many fond memories of the times we shared. I wasn't close with everyone in the group  since there were so many of us, and one of them was our *de facto* leader, Erin. They're the one who organized a lot of our weekend get-togethers (we called club meetings) and hosted all events with our group. They were close with others, including a girl named Maria. I'll get to her later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the year or two that our group was together, people like my best friends Betty and Liana stopped coming to meetings, citing differences with Erin as main reasons for not returning. Around this time is when I noticed certain behaviors of theirs: the condescending tone with which they would often correct people, the petty gossiping, and the unending drama that seemed to follow them wherever they went. They were never this way with me so I continued to go to group meetings in the interest of maintaining my friendships with everyone else.\n\nThen Erin took up smoking, which at first was just an inconvenience that everyone put up with for the sake of the group, but then they started to encourage others to take it up. Before long, half the group would have to leave like three times a meetings for long periods to take smoke breaks. Then they'd come back stinking to high hell, and those of us with asthma and allergies just had to deal with the smell and coughing. To say the least, the rest of us were not happy. We brought it up to Erin and the smokers that their habit was getting in the way and constantly splitting the group in the middle of our fun. Some started the process of quitting or minding their intake during meetings, but Erin continued unabashed.\n\nAlso around this time, Maria was in a lovey-dovey relationship with Carlos (who was Betty and Alex's best friend growing up). He started coming to meetings and all was well. Everyone liked him well enough, and Maria was heads over heels. A few months pass, and Carlos breaks up with Maria seemingly out of nowhere. It comes out that Erin was actively trying to get with Carlos under Maria's nose, and that they were in an emotional affair. Maria was devastated, our group was shocked, there was some side-taking and in-fighting. All of these compounding tensions spilled over and destroyed our friend group. That was the end of our club. \n\nAnd even after all these years I still feel it was entirely Erin's fault. I mean, Erin struggled with BPD and had a shitty upbringing with a drug addict mom and an absent dad, so I tried to be understanding. However, while it explained some of her actions it doesn't excuse them. To this day they have never once apologized for causing Maria such grief.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile this was all going on, Alex was slowly losing his friendships with everyone in the group for other reasons. It left him with few options friend-wise, and he doesn't make new friends easily. That's a whole other story on its own, but suffice it to say that I wasn't totally surprised that after all this he stayed friends with Erin and Carlos. \n\nThat was a long time ago and neither I nor Maria mind that he stayed friends with Erin after all this, but we choose not to hang out with them ourselves. For me it started out purely out of solidarity, but it became more personal when I made the mistake of agreeing to hang out briefly for a group outing that had Erin involved.\n\nErin wasn't considerate of my aversion/allergy to secondhand smoke and even sat upwind of me at the beach while puffing on a cigarette (I couldn't really move spots because I was trying to protect my new tattoos from the sun), then when I asked that they not smoke in the car on the drive back they said okay... and we didn't even make it out of the parking lot before they simple rolled down the window to hit their vape (which didn't work because it kept blowing into the backseat and in our faces). This continued in Alex's house when they basically huffed like a chimney all afternoon. The air even took on a hazy quality, and had a sickly sweet stench that permeated everything. I didn't hide my discomfort, even put a blanket in front of my face to filter the air, but they didn't seem to take notice. Or if they did they didn't care. Even if they didn't see, I'd made it clear in several occasions now that I wasn't comfortable with breathing in their smoke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfterwards I put my foot down and privately told Alex I wasn't going to hang out with him if Erin was there. And it made him sad because he has so few close friends left and can't hang out with any of them in a group anymore.\n\nI thought the matter was settled, but recently Alex has been talking about trying to get Maria and Erin to make up (they'd done it before in the past but Erin kept doing inconsiderate things that hurt Maria) in the hopes of getting some of the old gang together. He's been talking to me about how much Erin has changed, how nice and funny they are, and how they've really grown out of this person I still have in my head...\n\nAnd he keeps bringing up possible future plans where Maria, Erin, and I are all hanging out together. He says it with this slow pleading look like 'I know you have problems with them but wouldn't it be better if we laid those to rest and were all buddies again?'\n\nIt makes me feel a little bad for not giving them another chance if what he says about them being changed is true. But Maria made a great point stating that \"I am doing fine without them. I don't hold animosity anymore, but I'm happy with the friends I have now and don't need to gamble on the possibility that Erin will bring more drama into my life again.\" I agree with her, but it seems Alex is keen to mend those broken bridges. The things he says about his friendship with Erin sound nice, but I think he has it easy because he doesn't have a problem with Erin's smoking and wasn't directly impacted by their inconsiderate behavior in the past. He keeps bringing it up in hopes that I'll relent.\n\nAITA for not giving them another chance?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - This person, Erin, who broke up my high school friend group with a pattern of inconsiderate behavior (including having an emotional affair with a mutual friend's partner and smoking while I'm around despite my repeated assertions of being uncomfortable) has supposedly changed in the years since these incidents, but I'm wary of taking the gamble and letting them back into my life. My buddy Alex wants to see his friends all be cool with each other again and keeps trying to get me to give Erin another chance, but I don't want to. AITA for standing my ground and refusing to interact with them again?",

      "description": "A group of my friends and I went out for brunch yesterday after a St Patrick’s day event. There were 7 of us and we had a server who was not shy about sharing his ultra right wing views about immigrants. \n\nWe told the server we were just trying to have a nice brunch and would rather not hear about his political beliefs. Unfortunately he wouldn’t shut up about undocumented immigrants and the Chinese/Mexicans/etc every time he came to our table. \n\nSome of us found it funny, funny in the sense that every time he came over we were waiting for the next outrageous thing to come out of his mouth. But I thought he was kind of rude to keep mumbling these political rants despite us telling him it’s not appreciated. \n\nInstead of leaving him a real tip, I left a penny and a note suggesting he shouldn’t impose his politics on his customers. One of my friends thought that was kind of shitty especially since we were a large party and the server had to work on Sunday. But I didn’t think so. Was it shitty for me to do that?",

Your not innocent in all this” she basically said she is single so not in the wrong. \n\nI said to her I just don’t want to listen any more. She later said to me I hope you don’t think I would do that to “husbands name” I said no… but felt really affronted. Just she needs to grow up.

      "description": "Went to a concert yesterday at a small, but definitely not sold out venue with a friend of mine. We're in our early 20s. As we're both quite tall, my friend and I did not want to stand right in front, so others who aren't as tall could still see something, so we're in the middle of the crowd. As the show wasn't sold out or anything, there was still a lot of empty space to stand or dance right in front of the stage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, the show began and everybody started to dance: great show overall. However, a woman who was approximately 20 centimeters shorter than me and probably was in her early 50s, thought it would be a good idea to start recording a video of an entire (!) song on her phone. She was holding her arms above her head right in front of my head, completely blocking my view. As I didn't want to obstruct other peoples' views, I let this woman do her thing and just cringed how she recorded one of those terrible self-filmed concert videos. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the song was over, I tapped her on her shoulder and said \"Can I give you a tip? If you just do a couple of steps forward, so you're in front row (the empty space directly in front of the stage, with no people to obstruct your view) then your arms wouldn't get so tired while filming!\" \n\nShe was like; \"Oh I thought this was a nice exercise, haha...\"\n\nTo which I replied; \"Well, that's great, but there are other people behind you that also want to see the show without a view obstructed by the screen of your phone\".\n\nHer husband heard this and told me brusquely \"Well then why don't you just take a step aside?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah, whatever, I thought. I didn't reply to him as I didn't want to escalate the \"conflict\".  The couple slowly moved away from us to the front after that and she didn't record another video on her phone during the show.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for introducing a woman to the idea to move to the front of the audience so she can make better quality videos and other people don't have to watch the concert via her phone screen?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Been friends with roommate for 8+ years. \n\nThis has been going on for a while now, but it's only recently become an issue to me.\n\nWhen he moved in this time last year, him and his gf had just broken up, and my bf moved in with us at the same time.\n\nHe's been meeting girls on tinder and having them over since then, and it's never really been a problem.\n\nBf and I just let him do his thing.\n\nHowever, the number is now up to 3-4 different women coming over every week. Some are repeats, but honestly he brings in new girls more often than going back for seconds.\n\nHe claims these girls know the deal, but I cant imagine that they truly know the extent of women he's fucked...of course everyone has different opinions but I could never fuck a guy I knew was literally inside another girl the night before. Also I've mentioned STD testing to roomie who said hes \"already been tested this year, I'm good\". OK bud, not how that works. \n\nAnd on the other hand, I'm simply no longer comfortable with the flow of different and unknown people in my house. It gets ridiculous, to come inside nearly every day and be introduced to a new girl. Yes I have tried purposely mixing up names, or making remarks like 'which one is this?' its like a joke to him. \n\nI try and never use it as leverage, however the fact is that I own this house and will be here for much longer than he will. And I'm not comfortable with this many randos having our address. What happens when one of them wasnt expecting to go home at the end of the night and causes a scene? Or worse? \n\nI also don't understand why he always has women over here. However I have heard him take credit for ownership and cleanliness of the house, when he barely pays rent on time and doesn't clean a fucking thing.  \n\nNot to mention, apparently nearly every girl he has over has made a comment about how attractive MY SO is. Being the sort of insecure person that I am, this just makes me feel even more uncomfortable in my own home.\n\nI'm not one to judge. I know he has rights to have people over.  However, me and BF specifically asked him to not have someone over last night and he did. He waited until we were asleep, which makes it slightly better, but we were going through a difficult time and wanted privacy, not just that night but the next morning as well. and he refused to respect our wishes even though it states in our lease agreement that all residents must be okay with a visitor. \n\nTLDR; roommate has 3-4 different women over every week to fuck, he doesn't clean up after himself in general and is not a great rooommate, now after he disrespected our request for a night of privacy and mentioned that nearly every girl he fucks makes a comment about how attractive my SO is, I'm just fed up with my roommates promiscuity. At least, done with it happening at my house. \n\n\n\nWould you be okay with this situation?  Am I even rational??",

      "description": "Here is my situation. We have an AMC theater that my son (22) and I (51) go to. For those not familiar with AMC they have a rewards program that if you pay for the premium (which I do) enables you to enter express lines for buying tickets and refreshments. Well, one day the two of us go to the theater and they only have one box office open. There is a sign that says for premium members to enter on the left and for everyone to enter on the right. We of course, enter on the left and are third in line. The right line has approximately ten patrons in it.\n\nThe first person in our line goes first. Then the first person in the other line. Then the cashier beckons the person in front of me to come up and be next. When this happens there is an older gentlemen probably around 65 (who is in the longer line ) who starts screaming. He starts waving his card around and wants to know why he isn’t being treated the same as the people in my line. The Cashier asks him if he is a premium member and he replies yes. Now, I’m not sure if you can actually tell from the card if you are or not as the card still has perks if you aren’t a premium member. The Cashier tells him that he is in the wrong line and waves him over to my line.\n\nThe gentleman then steps in front of me and is now next in line for the cashier. Then this happens\n\nSon- “Hey, get in the back in the line!!”\n\nSenior Citizen- What!!!!!\n\nSon- “I said, get in the back in the line”\n\nSC- “I’ve been here longer than you have”\n\nSon- “Not my fault, you can’t read a sign or follow simple instructions”\n\nSC- “You want a piece of me, punk” (That may not be the exact quote, but it is close)\n\nI’m actually not sure what my son said at the point as now I was between the two of them with a hand in my son’s chest pushing him backwards and telling the SC that he can go next.\n\nSon- “Dad, are you seriously going to let this asshole in front of you”\n\nSC- Some curse words\n\nSon- Some more curse words\n\nMe- “Yes, and calm the F down before the cops get called”\n\nWhile this is going on the cashier finishes processing the person at the box office and beckons the SC to be next while I calm my son down.\n\nAfter the SC finishes the cashier doesn’t know what to do. There is another gentlemen who is first in the other line who is in his 70s at least and maybe 80s. I tell him to go next and then we go after him.\n\nNow, I’m pretty sure I’m not the asshole in this situation. I think this boils down to my son and the SC. However for purposes of voting I will claim the position of my son as I am 50% responsible for his DNA. ",

      "description": "I’ve always cried at things I find sad. Sad movies, books, TV shows, social media posts, etc.\n\nMy boyfriend knows and hates it. He always gets mad at me for crying and tells me that I’m being ridiculous. He doesn’t like seeing me upset when he can’t fix it. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t tell him what’s wrong because I know he’ll think it’s stupid which makes me feel worse. \n\nFor example, tonight we were on the phone having a conversation with my dad. I was simultaneously browsing Facebook and someone posted someone else Facebook post of him bragging about beating his dog for pooping in the house. In the background you see his poor dog and blood everywhere. I wasn’t expecting it and started crying but didn’t want to interrupt the phone call and waved my SO off and told him it was fine. \n\nAfter we got off the phone my SO told me that I was being selfish for crying all the time. \n\nAITA?

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nMy coworker is currently pregnant and everyone is gushing over her constantly. All I hear all day long is pregnancy jokes, comments, or baby talk. Especially now as her due date is around the corner.\n\nI am happy for her, but I have had 3 miscarriages within the past 13 months. The last one I had major complications with and there is a chance I won't be able to get pregnant again as a result. My coworkers are aware of the last one because it happened later in the pregnancy (22 weeks) and we had announced. \n\nI'm genuinely happy for her, I really am. And I try to be supportive. But, I cannot make myself be enthusiastic. \n\nThe office manager confronted me about it this morning because I'm the only person not constantly asking the pregnant coworker how she's feeling, etc and the manager noticed. She feels I should be over what happened or at least be able to pretend enthusiasm. Again I have always been supportive and kind to the pregnant coworker, I just don't gush over her or start conversations with her that involve her pregnancy or child. \n\nI thought I was doing fine, but this confrontation by the office manager makes me wonder if I'm really being an asshole? I don't talk about my miscarriages with any of them anymore, not since I was finally over the medical complications and even that was just because I couldn't do things at work that I normally do without risking a trip to the ER. I'm a very private person and I while I was open with saying \"I'm not ok, but I'm doing better than yesterday.\" I never opened up to anyone in the office about what I was going through beyond just \"this happened and as a result I can't do X until my doctor clears me for that type of work\". \n\nI honestly don't know if I can fawn over my pregnant coworker at this point. I feel horrible about it after what my manager said, but its all I can do sometimes to just smile and nod to the conversation regarding her pregnancy/baby instead of crying. I don't expect everyone to treat me special by any means, but am I really the asshole for not pretending to be ecstatic about this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Alright, so this just happened. I share a house with my current boyfriend, A, who I’ve been dating for about three months. We have a pretty solid relationship. We’re both very forthcoming with feelings or gripes we might have with each other. I’d even go as far as saying that we have 10/10 communication skills. \n\nMy ex boyfriend, B, broke up with me more than a year ago. We had dated for three years and it was pretty serious, but it eventually went to shit, hence the “ex” part. We share a dog who we both love very much. It took a year of petty arguments, screaming matches, and not talking to each other at all to get to a point where we’ve both moved on and have a dope friendship. As it happens, we’re great friends, as we had been friends for years before we hated, but we just made an awful couple. \n\nA is very aware of the existence of B in my life and understands and respects the dynamics of our relationship as friends and dog parents. He’s been nothing short of wonderful and supportive throughout, which makes this situation even more confusing. \n\n So, around 1:30 AM, B’s sister texts me saying that she got a message from B saying that he called 911. I guess iPhones have this feature that if you call 911, they notify your emergency contact and send them your location. Anyway, I live about twenty minutes away from B and she lives about a two hour drive away. Needless to say, I told her I’d check up on him and let her know what was up. \n\nBefore leaving, I gave A a heads up and I was met with a shitty face. He informed me that it wasn’t my responsibility to check up on B. I argued by saying that B tends to sleep walk so he might’ve unintentionally called 911 or something like that. A was absolutely adamant that it was inappropriate for me to go. \n\nI got to B’s and turns out he was okay, just dead asleep. I had him call his sister, I joked about him calling 911 for company, and I left. Upon returning home, A was waiting for me with an angry look. He argued that I shouldn’t have gone in case it was a dangerous situation and because it’s straight up inappropriate to go to my ex boyfriend’s house at late hours in the night. \n\nI just can’t understand how A might think that I’d even want to drive to anyone’s house in the wee hours in the morning just to come right back home. I feel confident in my decision to check on B because he’s my friend and I’d do that for any of my friends, especially if it meant bringing their family members peace of mind. I understand the part where I could have put myself in danger, but I approached B’s house very alert and searched for anything that was out of the ordinary before entering. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hello reddit, I'm writing this because a situation just happened with my little brother that I think is absolutely ridiculous. Back in July, my family and I were vacationing in France, I asked for an XBoX controller for my games. My little brothers both had controllers, I initially asked for an Elite controller which is 160-ish USD, but my parents declined, so I went for a run of the mill white controller. I got it, and this was unacceptable for my brothers, they had black ones and apparently their black controllers now sucked. They tried to take if from me and swap it for their own controller, they claimed that there was a difference other than the color which justified them taking it. At least that didn't work. \n\nIn December, my little brothers and I asked for rechargeable batteries for our controllers, my dad agreed to buy us the chargers, I also asked him if I could buy a condenser microphone, an AT2020, I would be paying for it from the money I earned obviously.\n\nMy parents and my siblings come back from their vacation in Dubai, and there are only two batteries in their luggage, my dad tells me that he forgot I wanted them, though my little brothers told me that they had convinced him that I don't need it. I don't know who to believe but that's irrelevant, I find the microphone, but it's not an AT2020, I won't complaint since it's still a condenser and better than my blue snowball ice, I take it into my room, but then my sister gets angry that her microphone is missing, I thought my dad must've gotten her a mic too, my dad the finds me using the mic, grounds me and gives it to her, turns out he bought the mic for her in the first place. At this point I'm clearly pissed off, so I retreat to my room and go to sleep.\n\nLater that week I ask my dad for the battery, my little brothers had gotten a knock-off battery, I asked my dad for an original Microsoft one, which was somehow cheaper than the knock-off, he agreed. My little brother whined about it but I didn't think much of it. Come delivery day, there are two batteries in the box, I excitedly thank my dad and unbox them in my room. I thought he had also gotten me a spare charger. Nope. My little brother comes into my room screaming and starts kicking my stuff, turns out he also got an original charger too, even though he already had one. I thought this was unfair because he had two batteries while I had one. \n\nWhen I asked my dad how come he gets whatever he wants and I have  to consistently ask him about it he tells me when I was his age I had everything I wanted, which consisted of a PSP and a Pentium powered PC that couldn't do jack shit. I was grateful that I did have them as a child though so I decided to drop it. For reference my brother's PC is has an i7 and a respectable graphics card. My current PC is way better than his, but that's irrelevant to the argument.\n\nA few weeks later my brother buys his second and third copy of Minecraft, the third copy is an XBox one edition which he can't even fucking play, my dad gets it for him anyways because it's cheap. He then goes on a buying spree where he buys Just Cause 3 and FIFA 19, which I asked for as well. My dad did give me the origin login details for FIFA 19 which was nice of him, and I did already have Just Cause 3 on my steam account, I still don't understand why my dad didn't just force me to share my account with him instead of buying the game twice.\n\nLast night shit really begins to hit the fan, as my brother buys his third copy of the same star wars game, and my dad agrees to get him GTA V (he hasn't bought it yet), which he rejected when I asked him a few months prior. This pisses me off.\n\nThis morning all hell breaks loose when my other little brother and I learn that my first little brother is not only buying the 200USD controller that I asked for in July, but he's also buying a PS4. Even though he has a computer than can run all the games he plays and he doesn't own any PS4 games. I get angry, and my dad tells me that there are certain things which are appropriate for my 8yo brother that aren't appropriate for me (15yo). Like 3 copies of minecraft, 3 copies of starwars, a PS4, fucking GTAV, and a 200USD Xbox elite controller. \n\nHe also told me that I have many things to be grateful for that he doesn't have, like a very powerful PC, and an XPS laptop, a massive collection of Rubik's cubes, which I had to restart a year ago when he destroyed all 37 cubes I owned and had been collecting for 7 years and were worth over 500USD. (I never got compensated and my little brother never got punished).\n\nThat's not my point, I recognize that I am privileged and that I do have many things to be grateful for, my point is that it's unfair that my brother gets to spend my father's money in whatever ways he wants, to buy whatever he wants whenever he wants, even though he doesn't use most of the shit he gets, and on top of that, if we both ask for something he gets it and I don't.\n\nThanks for reading through this if you did, please give me your feedback, what do you think, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "A couple of days ago I went to this dine in place and got served by this lovely young waitress. She was very nice to me and quite attentive to me when I whistled for her attention. Anyway I noticed that she was a bit fat around the stomach. I didn't really want to say anything, but she caught me staring and said that she was pregnant. Apparently the father had skipped out on her a couple of months ago and now she was working three jobs whilst trying to support two kids and a pregnancy. \n\nI sympathized with her and went on eating my meal. Afterwards, I paid for it but I didn't leave a tip. It wasn't personal, I just don't believe in tipping. The waitress looked at me but didn't say anything. I said goodbye to her but she just walked away which I thought was a bit rude. \n\nBut thinking back on it I kind of felt bad about not giving her an extra dollar or two. So I'm wondering: AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Ok so for context I’m a high school student and am in honors physics. My physics partner, let’s call her Rose, is probably the laziest person in the world. Every time we have any assignment I do all of the work, and she either talks about her personal drama or naps. Then expects me to give her all the answers, even when it’s independent work or assessments and we have different papers. At first I didn’t really mind so much ,because I thought she was cool and maybe her parents made her take this class. But it’s the end of the year, she’s failing this class (she has a 32), and she won’t do anything for herself. I have a lot of other things I needed to do and don’t have time for this bullshit.\n\nNow here’s the real reason  I’m here, so today was book work review day. We each individually got assigned 16 problems that are due at the end of class. It’s a show what you know kinda thing. I finished mine within about 20 minutes. Meanwhile Rose looked at her problems, decided she either didn’t know how to do them or just didn’t want to, and went to sleep.\n\nShe woke up about 10-15 minutes before the end of the period. My teacher has basically given up on trying to make her stay awake in class. She looked at me and asked if I’d do it for her. I forgot to mention that we also had the data lists we’d need and formulas in front of us. I shortly explained how to do it and went back to finishing my work for other classes. That’s when she started saying passive aggressive comments about how I was a bad partner, such as, “Maybe if I had a better partner, I’d be doing better in this class.” This made me really mad, “It’s not my fault all you do in here is nap and now you’re failing.” This ensued an argument of whispers and texts. She keeps blaming me for not helping enough and for her grade. While I think if she really wanted to better she’d talk to the teacher and try harder, am I being an ass?",

Her social status is weird- she's hot, I guess, and pretty social, but was only ever really popular because her boyfriends were. She cheated on all of them, and all of them turned against her after that, and having 4 popular people against you for cheating on them (which everyone can agree is wrong) is bound to make your life suck. \n\nSo she started getting bullied pretty bad over it. Everyone at my school is either bullying her, or coming to her defense saying she did nothing wrong. I have friends on both sides. I'm pretty close with her 3rd bf, but I also have friends who say she isn't bullied. I don't really bully her myself, but st the same time I have no sympathy towards her. Like, she made her bed, so she can sleep in it. It's not like she made enemies innocently either, she dated r guys and cheated on them. That's pretty wack. People bullying her are jerks, but she also definitely brought it on herself as well.\n\nAnyway, I expressed my opinion to a group of girls in one of my classes (they asked), and I was called super insensitive and an asshole. I don't see myself as either, but am I? ",

      "description": "Little backstory here, I'm 19 y/o and I've been working to save a little cash up before I head off to uni later this year. About 2 months ago I was hired at a new job, and the other day I resigned on the spot and walked out, to not set foot in there again. I gave no notice.\n\nContext as to why I walked - my immediate manager was pretty horrible to me and treated me like shit. I was constantly sworn at, called some pretty offensive names, screamed at for making mistakes. I was entirely new to the job and had not worked in a similar environment before, so I had to pretty much learn everything on the fly.  Even when I wasn't making mistakes I'd get yelled at for some reason or another. On two occasions I was threatened with violence. I also overheard them saying how useless I was to another manager, and that I \"should just fuck off already\". This is in a customer-facing role too. \n\nAnother big problem was that my immediate manager was in a crucial position. The business couldn't afford to lose them, as they were such an integral part of the business itself that it would collapse without them. So I knew that even if I reported them, nothing would be done about it - not for months at least. They were essentially unfireable.\n\nOne night I couldn't put up with it anymore, and vowed to resign the next day, when I was due to work. I wrote my resignation letter that evening and handed it in to the boss (not my immediate manager, different person) the next day. He was very pissed at me even after explaining the whole situation to him, and accused me of \"throwing them in the shit\" by resigning on the spot. After the conversation ended, he didn't shake my hand or say goodbye - he just left me in the office. I let myself out.\n\nProblem is, after I walked out of the building, I had a massive mixture of emotions. On one hand I felt great for not having to go there anymore, but I had this horrible feeling that I'd let down my coworkers. Aside from my boss and my manager they were really nice people. We were quite short staffed at the time, and I felt like ass knowing that they'd have to make up for me walking out on them.\n\nAm I the asshole for walking out on them like that? I don't know what else I could've done in the circumstances.",

      "description": "I am 32F, my bf is 32. He has a 10 year old boy from a previous marriage. His ex is extremely manipulative and was abusive to my boyfriend while they were together. She manipulated him into having a child and getting married within a few months of being together. He left her when their son was 3 years old. He had no reason to suspect she would be abusive to the son, but I know that’s not how abusers work, and have strong reason to suspect she his abusive to the son now as well.\n\nI love my bf and his son, but I’m at my wits end. His ex tells their son lies about me constantly, saying I’m trying to replace her as his mother, that I’m trying to stop his dad from seeing him, that it’s my fault if his dad doesn’t answer the phone because I don’t like him. I used to have a really positive relationship with the son but he’s started to believe her lies and now he doesn’t speak to me. He’s polite to me but he doesn’t want to actively spend time with me and often retreats to his bedroom if I’m in the same room.\n\nHe’s also extremely depressed. This has gotten significantly worse in recent months. He has horrible panic attacks because he doesn’t want to go back to his mums. A few years ago I contacted child services about concerns I had about his mums treatment of him and it honestly made the entire situation worse, I did it anonymously but she found out it was me and threatened legal action against me saying she could stop me seeing their son. It caused a lot of trouble and I think made it worse for the son at home, too especially as I noticed a huge difference in his behaviour towards me after that.\n\nThere are other things as well, such as my boyfriends parents also listen to his exes lies about me and they hate me too. I feel like everyone in my bfs life think I’m the worst. I suffer from anxiety and depression anyway but this is seriously exasperating it. My boyfriend is lovely but a bit useless at actually dealing with his sons trauma, I keep pushing for him to take the son to therapy and he agrees he needs to take him but keeps putting it off.\n\nI feel like I want to leave. I’m constantly stressed and depressed and feel completely helpless. I feel like I’m only staying in the relationship because I don’t want to further damage the son during an extremely difficult period in his life. I don’t know how to deal with his mum, I don’t know what the right thing to do is, and I feel like an asshole for even considering it because it’s not like my boyfriend or his son have a choice in this - they’ve got to stick it out regardless of whether I’m around and I’d just be making the situation worse if I left. But I don’t know if I can cope with the situation anymore.",

      "description": "We started talking on this account just over a year ago now, and up until this point it was the one I had used for all my previous shenanigans. I thought I deleted most of my old contacts after the relationship got serious, but I can be quite negligent and so I wouldn't be surprised if that wasn't the case.\n\nBut within days of getting to know him I was very serious, and have been to the point where we're having marriage talks with our families. It is long distance at the moment and we Skype regularly. Unfortunately, the stupid mutual friends thing popped up a couple of days ago and it upset him a lot to see random guys and my ex just pop up like that - understandable - so I quickly deleted all miscellaneous contacts and I thought that would be that.\n\nThis morning, however, the thing popped up again seemingly with the same contact suggestions and he just asked for me to delete my account. I don't want to. For the record, I should add I have several accounts just because of how forgetful I can be with passwords on different devices and regarding this account, we haven't used it in months. I don't want to just delete the account because it was where we first started talking and with the Skype update a year back, as far as I know, saving messages is not easy and so I really wouldn't want to do that unnecessarily.\n\nI know how upset it gets home and I don't want to do that to him, but at the same time there's a part of me that feels as though he's overreacting. I know it's not great just having it pop-up like that, and I know it's not a trust issue, but I just I'm not sure if I'm the asshole for getting upset too. I mean the situation isn't my fault either, is it fair to expect him to just ignore the issue or not get this upset over it?",

      "description": "When I say “wrongfully fired,” I mean it only in the company guidelines. I accept I was definitely the asshole in the beginning. Basically what happened was that I requested time off to visit family when I first got this job. I didn’t get the seven days I requested but I did get five days off. I ended up having to pay $125 to change my flights that I had scheduled before I got the job. Here’s where it gets tricky: I was scheduled to work the day my new flight left, but I had thought I had the morning shift (the flight left around 9pm.) Turns out I actually had the night shift which is 3pm to 11pm. I found this out two days before my flight.\n\nThis was, of course, my fault. I should’ve scheduled my flight the next day but just assumed I would be given the morning shift. In my defense, I had only had morning shifts before then and that day was the first time my manager ever put me on an evening shift. Anyway, mistakes happen. What I should’ve done is immediately called my manager and explained my situation to her. We could’ve gotten something worked out or at the very least, she would’ve known I wasn’t going to come it. However, my anxiety got the best of me and I ended up worrying and worrying and worrying until the day came, I didn’t call, didn’t show up for work, and just got on the plane.\n\nWhen I got back five days later and showed up to work, I was informed that I was fired. Having NEVER been in any kind of trouble at all at a job before, I went home, cried, wallowed in self pity for a while, then remembered the whole thing was my fault and got a new job two days later (at their rival company.)\n\nEverything above was all my fault, and that’s not what I’m asking about. \n\nAnyway, it’s been about a week and I was just looking over my old employee handbook and it says, word for word, “if an employee “no calls-no shows” two consecutive days the employee will be subject to termination.” TWO days. TWO. I no called no showed ONE day. I have half a mind to just highlight that portion of the handbook and send a picture of it to my old manager. WIBTA if I did that? The job is over and terminated and I don’t want it back. It’s just me being petty.",

She’s 25 and works as a doctor so her schedule is pretty hectic and she finds it hard to make time for me. Any free time she has she usually spends it with her family or her flatmate. Sometimes she can have 3 or 4 days off per week and can’t see me because she’s spending time with her family. \n\nWe don’t live far apart (5 miles) and her parents live round the corner from me (which I find even stranger that she hasn’t told them about me as I sometimes pass them a few times a week). \n\nWe still haven’t had sex yet either (she says there’s a reason for this but won’t tell me what it is - I assume it’s something bad based on a couple of things she’s said but I’m not sure). She’s definitely not a virgin though and has had more than one partner before. \n\nIt was my birthday a few months ago and I said that I didn’t want a present but she insisted on getting me one and suggested us going on a holiday and even though she’s had time off, she doesn’t want to talk about planning it but she keeps saying that she’s interested in going with me. \n\nWhenever I bring this up to her, she says that she’s busy with work and feels that we see each other a decent amount and that her family are very important to her (which I completely get and admire) but I just don’t see why she can’t tell them about me and see them during the day (when she’s off) and then see me in the evening. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here or are some of my feelings justified? \n\nThanks for any answers (even if they are blunt and honest).

And that she made it sound like she was entitled. I also told her “ i thought u knew how to write a good email” which right now sounds like an asshole thing to say, which I’ll admit. \n\nShe told me she wasn’t gonna hear it from me too. And that her teachers already confronted her about it and explained it to her why it was a bad email and she doesnt want me bashing her. After that she said things like not deserving to work, and just accepting it. I apologized and told her im not bashing her. I also told her that I thought she didn’t understand what was wrong with the email so i was pointing out the things that sounded bad. I told her she deserved the internship and apologized for criticizing her. \n\nLastly she said “ I can’t take little criticism” to which i responded “ye ik lol you gotta learn”.

      "description": "My sister has been dating this guy for a year. He’s a really good friend of mine since school and I’m currently in a relationship with his cousin so we’re all pretty close. \n\nMy sister lives in a different town and they’ve been in a long distance relationship from the start. I had noticed an imbalance in the relationship from the start but didn’t say anything because they looked happy. But he basically gave everything to her, he was the most thoughtful, affectionate, loving and supportive boyfriend I’ve ever seen. \n\nHe helped her with everything from work projects to uni applications, he tried to get a job in her town, but she moved to another one. She claims she loves him but she’s not grateful for any of this, she never did anything for him, never made an effort to come and see him. \n\nLately she’d been barely answering his texts, she told me once she was annoyed with him calling her when she was busy. I told her not to get pissed, he had so many qualities etc etc. \n\nA few weeks ago he came to me crying and told me he had had enough, that he feels unloved and rejected but she still says she loves him and wants to keep him around. \n\nI tried not to take a side but it was hard not to see how much she was hurting him. I told him to talk to her and give her a chance to make an effort, but if she won’t then he has to let go. \n\nHe talked to her, but nothing changed over the next few days. I tried to call her and talk to her but she kept telling me she was busy and would call back but never did. So I told him that honestly she’s my sister and I love her but she’s not treating him right and if he’s unhappy then he shoud leave. I stayed with him for hours, telling him he deserved someone who would appreciate his efforts, and that her priorities don’t seem to include him. \n\nHe ended up breaking it off with her and she called me the next day telling me she was sad but it was the right decision. I feel terrible for having triggered the break up and having caused her pain. I feel terrible for having taken his side and not hers. She doesn’t know that I was a part of him taking this decision and I don’t know if I should tell her. \n\nWhat do you think? ",

      "description": "AITA for not stopping a game for my girlfriend (F17)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically what happened is yesterday was obviously valentines day, and as I do not live close to my girlfriend I decided to get some flowers and chocolate delivered to her house.\n\nI noticed that she was a bit bummed out throughout the day which was understandable as she hadn't received the gift yet. (Bearing in mind we had decided to celebrate it next week, but I decided to surprise her with the gifts on the day)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we were snapchatting through the day and I was trying to cheer her up while not revealing that I had got her the gifts. I said to her that this evening we could use Netflix Party to watch a movie together as a \"date\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe evening comes around and the presents had not arrived. I told the delivery people to leave the flowers in the porch as I planned to facetime her and tell her to go outside. So when I got home I was playing a game with my friends which I don't get to talk to very often due to our schedules. I had the tracking website open and was refreshing it.\n\nIn the game we were playing I died and had 10 minutes to wait, I saw then that the flowers had arrived.\n\nAs I assumed they were on the porch and my girlfriend didnt know and was feeling bad about the day I decided to mute myself on discord and facetime her to tell her to go outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI facetimed her and then she said that she had them already as the delivery guy knocked on the door. She thanked me and we talked for 5-10 mins before I asked if its alright if I finish up what I was doing and then call her back in a bit. She said yes although sounded a bit down. I said goodbye and hanged up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\naround 20-30 mins later I try to call her again and she didn't pick up, I sent her a message on snapchat to let her know that I tried to call, she said she saw the call but she didn't call back, and that she needed to cook dinner in a bit. I was understanding and didnt kick up any fuss about it as at that point I didnt realise there was something wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI waited for around 2 hours before she messaged me again saying she was upset that I didnt talk to her and that we didnt get to do our planned \"date\", I called her and she was upset and angry and we argued about it for a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologized but also said that I dont think the reason we didn't get to watch something together was because I was gone for 20mins but because she was away for nearly two hours and then got angry at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning she is still upset and I feel very bad but am unsure if I am in the wrong or not\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo reddit aita?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Throwaway account because peeps know the real me. Anyway yeah for a long time I’ve been fascinated with those who have a mental disability and make the constant murmurs and facial expressions, most notably the tongue in the bottom of the lip.\n\nAt this point let me make it clear that I have absolutely nothing against them nor do I feel any kind of... well, anything for them to be honest. I don’t feel like, sorry for them, nor do I feel like they should be treated differently in a derogatory way or anything like that. Put shortly, I couldn’t care less, wish them the best and would leave them to live their lives as I live mine.\n\nHowever.\n\nWhenever I see one on say, the bus or at the cinema or something, I tend to stare at them, without realising that I am. I’ve caught myself doing this several times and thus brings me to my asking of /r AmItheAsshole’s judgment of me. \n\nI was standing at a bus stop with my girlfriend, and there were some mentally disabled people in a group with their carers on the other side of the road at the opposite bus stop. One in particular caught my eye, because he was wearing a bright yellow rain coat with a cat umbrella and I stood there, staring at him. He began smiling at me and making the same face I described at the beginning, the one where you push your tongue into your bottom lip and make a nurrr nurrr noise. He began drooling as well.\n\nThe carer caught him, then wondered what he was getting so excited at and then looked across the road at me. The carer then threw a face of horror and I wondered why.\n\nMy girlfriend nudged me very hard on the arm and asked me what I was doing. “NOTHING!” I said, suddenly feeling like I had done something wrong.\n\nWhat she then told me was horrifying.\n\nI had apparently began to imitate the disabled guy, pushing my tongue into my bottom lip and making the nurr nurr noise. She was absolutely livid and told me to stop being such a dick.\n\nHere’s the thing. I literally had NO clue I started doing it or for how long. So now I’m a bit conflicted. I didn’t even -know- I was doing that and so does that make me some kind of low-key asshole?\n\nTLDR: Was **unknowingly** making faces back at a kid with a mental disability while thinking about other things, girlfriend thinks I’m a dick. \n\nNb: if at any point during reading this you’ve made the same tongue-in-bottom-lip face or made a nurr nurr noise then you know where I’m coming from ",

My friends and I sit at a table at school in the morning to talk.\n\n So I have a fascination for World War 2 and people at my school know that. John found out and looked up basic facts and one fact that is very unimportant. So the next day he comes and sits down at the table uninvited and I think oh god and he says to me \"Did you know that the Wehrmacht and the US fought on the same side?\" And I said \"No\" since I didn't know that and the day went on. The next day he sits down here again and says \"What happened on December 7th 1941?\" I said \"Pearl Harbour, you know I know this stuff\" and he was shocked, I also told him that I collect this stuff and he had the nerve to say \"Knowledge is better than collection.\" I was in shock that he said this, my other friends were around and in shock too my friend tells him \"Just because you looked up a few facts doesnt make you a master at this.\" John replied back saying \"I have mastered the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War 1, World War 2, and the Cold War\"  I was pissed that he said this, but brushed it off because he was most likely lying. He was know for this kind of stuff. Today he says to me \"Did you know that Operation Barbarossa happened on September 1st 1941?\" I gave him a confused look and said \" Do you mean the invasion of Poland in 1939?\" He says \"NO, I mean Operation Barbarossa\" I said \"Sure\" and I knew he was wrong, but for some reason my brain just said yeah, so tomorrow I have a million questions for him to test his \"superior knowledge\" in the subject I just so happen to like and that I excell in.\n\nAITA\n\n",

      "description": "Yesterday my cousin, who is barely over 19 and a freshman in college got engaged. \n\nOf course the family is thrilled, she’s the first to get engaged in about 10 years. \n\nI’m not thrilled, in fact I voiced my disappointment to my grandmother who feigned shock I would be upset. \n\nI’m 23, therefore I’m not aching to get married but I have been in my relationship for about 3 years so I know my time is coming so I was a tad thrown off. Now I will admit I am a little annoyed that she was proposed to at Disney as she openly hates Disney and well I’m a huge Disney fan who has been vocal about my desire to get engaged there.\n\nMy issue is with the fact that everyone seemed ok with it. She has never worked a day in her life, last year was dramatic as her now fiancé went off to college and cheated on her, he doesn’t work either and she can barely survive a week in her dorm alone. I just don’t think they’re mature enough for marriage. \n\nIt would be one thing if they’re going to have a long engagement but they’ve set a date for this December because our family will be visiting for a reunion. \n\nShe’s already discussing deferring from college to plan her wedding and the first thing they asked was “Hey frankinthecoil when can you head down to Florida and help her design the dress?” I used to run a bridal shop which people thought made me sad because I wasn’t engaged (really it made annoyed people acted that way shopping) \n\nI just can’t sit there and support her in what will end in a messy ending. \n\nI’m not going to scream in her face “YOU ARE SO DUMB” because she’s 19 and she is free to make her own decisions but I refuse to participate.\n\nI was asked to be a bridesmaid and I declined. \n\nI have declined to help her shop for a dress. \n\nI don’t want to go to the wedding because I just can’t support a 19 year old who is scared to walk near a busy road, won’t drive on the turnpike, can’t cook for herself and plans to just move her and her husband into her parents home after the marriage. I think it’s stupid. \n\nAm it the asshole for not wanting to take part in this?",

      "description": "I (M17) am only able to visit my grandma once a year on Christmas with my mother and brother, she lives 4 hours away and we usually dont have time to go visit her, because of school, work etc. So it became a tradition to at least visit her every year for Christmas, All my other grandparents are already dead and she was always the most caring and nice and I really really love her. I told my girlfriend that I would be gone over Christmas to visit my Grandma and thought that this wouldn't be a big deal and compleatly understandable, especially because we have to live in the constant fear that there wont be a next time to visit her because she is already pretty old. Today she became a bit angry over something really trivial and in the process of sorting that problem out the topic with Christmas came up again and she asked me if I really HAVE to go. I said of course I have to go for obvious reasons. She pressured me by saying stuff like, \"would you forgive yourself if I hurt myself while you are gone?\" or after I said that im always there for her no matter the situation \"no you are not always there for me\" even though I would answer her messages and calls as fast as possible. In our relationship im always the one who yields in the end so I did now as well and said that I would talk to my mother about Christmas even though im extremely unhappy with that solution. She is really depended on me and nearly doesnt have anyone else that could help her if she is depressed. So Am I the asshole for wanting to go, even though my girlfriend would need me?",

      "description": "My 6&amp;7yo daughter's are starstruck with YouTube personalities and want to imitate their idols (JoJo Siwa, Tiana etc). The last year or so have been a battle of wits, the kids begging for their own YouTube channel so they can imitate their idols, myself and partners constantly trying to find creative ways to tell them \"no\". \n\nA few days ago they return from visiting the In-laws with the news \"Dad! Guess what! We have our own YouTube channel!\".\nBrother-in-law and his wife went over our (myself and partners) heads and not only helped them create their own channel, but filmed them and uploaded videos to their newly created non-private channel, which neither myself nor partner have any control over. There's nothing dodgy with the content, just the kids talking gibberish in the grotty, poorly lit spare bedroom at their grandparents place.\n\nI'm still fucking livid and haven't yet had a chance to confront Uncle, since he fucked off on holiday the following morning. My partner initially shared my anger at him but has since calmed down and thinks I should just let it all slide since nothing bad has come of it so far.\n\nAm I the Asshole for wanting to confront him as soon as he get back from his holiday and demand to know what the fuck he thought he was doing with filming our children and managing \"their\" YouTube channel?  Pardon the overly dramatic \"kick seven shades of shit out of him\" flex in the title, I'm absolutely not planning on threating him with violence, just letting him know how much I think he's overstepped his mark as \"fun-uncle\" and putting it in no uncertain terms that if he ever pulls this shit again he's getting cut off completely. \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "This is something I've thought about a lot over the last few years, and I'd like to get some outside perspective. I'll fully grant that I'm not objective here, but I'm not embellishing anything that I mention here.\n\nMy wife's parents aren't good people. They do a lot of things which I very much agree with, including espousing their Argentine racism toward other Latinos . . . and black people . . . and Asian people (MIL was okay with wife marying me because I didn't \"look Asian,\" even though I'm half). Beyond that, there are a few big things which bother me.\n\n* MIL was both physically and emotionally abusive throughout my wife's entire childhood, adolescence, and even into her young adult years. The physical abuse was never \"bad,\" but the emotional abuse absolutely was. FIL wasn't abusive, but enabled MIL and never made her stop. \n* My wife had severe endometriosis growing up, to the point where we had to get her a hysterectomy in her mid-twenties. In-laws severely disapproved of this because wife's job was, of course, to make babies, so they removed wife from their insurance plan (she was still young enough to be covered at that point) and refused to acknowledge that the surgery was happening. \n* In-laws, particularly FIL, \"doesn't believe in\" mental illnesses and didn't any of their children, including wife, treated growing up. Including after future wife had a suicide attempt--MIL told her that she needed to cover up the cuts and come to church the day afterward because she was being an embarrassment.\n* MIL kicked future wife out the of the house when she was 14 or so during winter. Future wife went to a neighbor's house, crying, and explained what happened. MIL came to pick her up, then punished her because she was embarrassed that the neighbors found out what happened.\n* In-laws are wealthy. Easily in the 1% here in the US. They are very generous to all of their children *except* for my wife. Her two brothers got a free condo for college, a car each, tuition paid for, and grocery money. Future wife got a $3,000 loan cover part of tuition. I honestly don't care about not receiving money, but I *do* care about my wife being a black sheep. \n* Wife says that her relationship with her parents has gotten much better, which is true, but better looks like only crying after getting off the phone about 20% of the time rather than almost all the time. \n\nMy wife wants to preserve her relationship with her parents and try to mend it since it *has* gotten better. After they dropped her from their insurance prior to her hysterectomy, however, I went full no contact with them. I explained in no uncertain terms that I never want to see them, talk to them, and that they will never be welcome in my house. The thing is, that was almost four years ago. My wife doesn't understand why I'm so upset at them, nor why I'm so adamant that I want them out of my life forever. I also feel like I might be the asshole here for not being willing to be with her when she does interact with her parents. \n\nAnd all of this isn't to say that my in-laws don't have any good qualities . . . I just think they're pretty far outweighed by their negative and abusive ones. ",

      "description": "Sorry for formating issues on mobile.  So here is the set up. We work for a company that let's us request days off and if those days are requested off by more than one employee the employee with seniority gets the days. But all days must be requested before March 1st for seniority to count anything after that is first come first served. So here is the asshole part. The senior man in our department has been out on workmans comp since November due to a self inflicted injury(he tripped over his own 2 feet and fell on his shoulder resulting in a torn muscle and needing surgery). He is the senior member in our department that has 5 weeks of vacation every year. He has not been cleared for duty as of yet and probably will not be cleared until well into next month thus missing the deadline to use his seniority for his pick of vacation days. Every year he takes the week of Thanksgiving until the end of the year. Since our department only allows one person off at a time he screws the rest of us. As a department we have talked with him about maybe letting some of the rest of us take some of those days like you take Christmas  and I'll take Thanksgiving that sort of thing. We are repeatedly met with \"I've been here 30 years I'll take what I want\". The thing is the rest of us have little kids and would like to spend time with them during the holidays and his kids are grown and gone. He takes the time to maximize his time off and money earned and out of spite. So this year he is out and will miss the deadline for putting in his vacation so the department divvied up the days and put in our time for the holidays. The guy that is out has been calling management trying to put in his time before the deadline and they are on the fence about letting him. So I guess I'm asking am I the asshole for pushing back with management, getting our union involved, filling greavences, and generally taking a stand that since he isn't working they shouldn't let him block out days for vacation, since he may or may not return to work?",

My friend stated that she didn’t think her dad was abusing her younger sister, (despite what I consider to be very telling signs of abuse, and a near admission to it.)\nSo last night I finally called CPS on the family. I knew the mom wasn’t going to do anything about the father so I intervened. I’m just worried about my friend finding out it was me who called CPS. She doesn’t want her dad to go to jail, and she’s afraid that if she says anything about her traumatic childhood and they call the police, her family will hate her. I don’t want to ruin her relationship with her mom and siblings, but there is still a minor in that house and I’m not sure if she is being abused right now. I’m pretty young, my friend is 17 and I’m 19. I am afraid that my impulsively may have effected the outcome of my friend’s life negatively after she’s already had to deal with so much. But I couldn’t sleep at night thinking that her father may be doing something to her sister. I feel like I may have meddled in a situation far bigger than me and acted immaturely without thinking over consequences. AITA?",

      "description": "So for some context, this disagreement started probably about 6 months ago. We were talking about fist fights because we had just seen a video on Facebook of a pretty brutal fight. I tell her about how I am pretty decent at fighting since my older brother and I used to have a lot of them when we were younger for various reasons (practice and actual fights). She then asks me if I think that a girl could beat me up for some reason. I was initially a bit confused as to why she excluded men, and I ask her why she asked me that before answering. She then goes on to say she thinks her mom could beat me up! At the time I laugh uncontrollably because I think this is hilarious and that she is making a joke. I react this way because I'm a pretty big guy and I keep myself in good shape (22M 5'10'' 190lbs \\~10%bf) and her mom is in her 50s and probably sitting round 200, as far as I can tell not in the greatest physical health. I finish my little episode and I could tell she was not amused. I mean I'm not saying I would ever even fight a 50 year old man or woman anyway but it is a little funny to me. After this awkward bit of silence we just move on with the night and I think everything is just fine. \n\nFast Forward to this weekend and the topic of male vs female athletics is brought up again. We have this  2 hour \"debate\" on whether males and females are on an even playing field in terms of athletics. I put debate in quotations because it is not a debate, and the facts are clearly visible to everyone or so I thought. She then claims that I look down on all women because I say they aren't as physically capable as men in general, which is just blatantly untrue. I ask her to back up this audacious claim and she brings up the incident from 6 months ago, which I think is pretty ridiculous. Last I spoke with her she called me a woman hating asshole. I do admit I may not have delivered my points with supreme grace, however I don't think I am unjustified in my viewpoint. So AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for “Exposing” my Manipulative Ex GF After a Huge Falling Out",
      "description": "Hey guys, this is my first post on this subreddit and my first post in this style so please excuse any format errors. I’ll put a TL;DR but it!s better to read the whole thing as it gives you every bit of Information. Sorry it’s really long but it’s all relevant. \n\nTL;DR: On and off GF leads me on and uses me for two years and when I realize it I post our text conversations on Instagram to show our friends how shitty she is.\n\n          For some context, at the beginning of my Sophomore year of HS I became close friends with a girl (We’ll call her Sabrina for convenience) that I had on and off feelings for a while after getting into a relationship with one of her friends. Sabrina and I immediately hit it off and were “best friends” all through Sophomore year, she even talked me out of suicide on one occasion. Then eventually we both admit her had feelings for each other right before summer began and started dating.\n          \n         Unfortunately for me, however, Sabrina informed me that she had huge commitment issues and anxiety, which wasn’t a big deal for me considering that I am usually a very understanding person. The relationship didn’t last long because over the summer she visits her father in a far away city, she starts ignoring me and says it’s because of her commitment issues and says that it should only be temporary (spoiler: It wasn’t). We broke up early in September and the reason she gave for it was that we weren’t talking and that she didn’t want a boyfriend because it would distract her from doing well in school. I didn’t take the breakup well but I was understanding of the situation because we were getting closer to going to college.\n\n          We stayed “friends” for a little while after that until late October of Junior year, when I found out that Sabrina had gotten back into a relationship with the ex-boyfriend she had before me, who also happened to be one of my good friends (Don’t worry there was no harsh feelings between the two of us for dating the same girl). So, I confront her about it, however I will admit I was a bit standoffish but only because I felt like I was lied to, especially because the breakup happened less than 2 months prior to this event and she told me she didn’t want to be in a relationship so she could put 100% of her attention into school. We fight and don’t talk for a couple months.\n\n           Then New Year’s comes around and I decide to make amends with Sabrina as I wanted to have a fresh start with everyone I had wronged the past year. We both talk that night and it was like nothing had ever happened between the two of us, we went back being “best friends” again. We hang out a few times and I start to feel myself catch strong feelings for her again but I just ignore them and continue on just being friends with her, even though she was also single again. We progress through the year just fine, talking as we normally would. We even hung out with each other a few times and on one of those occasions she kissed me but it ultimately led to nothing.\n\n          Now we’re approaching the end of Junior year, and prom was just around the corner, so naturally I ask Sabrina to come with me (as I did not have a GF to take with me at the time) but a few weeks later I meet another girl and we start dating, I did tell this girl about Sabrina and of course she had her suspicions, with her being my ex and all.  I also tell Sabrina about my new girlfriend and she’s completely cool with still going to prom with me. Then about a week before my prom I was planning on spending a Friday night with my girlfriend, but then in comes Sabrina asking a huge favor of me. She asks me to go with her friend to her school’s prom, but it’s on the night my girlfriend and I had planned. I go to my girlfriend and explain the situation and ask if I can go and she gives me the “yeah you can do it, it’s totally fine” response women give when they’re upset but don’t want to outright tell you, some being the oblivious dumbass I am commit to going to prom with her and her friend. As a result of this, my new girlfriend and I break up temporarily as her and my friends both attempted to crash Sabrina’s prom.\n\n          Now that I was once again single, Sabrina and I started getting a little more friendly at my prom, nothing too serious, just things like holding hands. After prom that was as far as we had progressed, we just remained friends. School gets out, I get back together with the other girl, and Sabrina and I continue to talk all throughout the summer, except this time she doesn’t go off the grid for weeks at a time, which I found very strange, despite her being in her dad’s town again for the summer, but I paid no mind. \n\n          One day in the summer, I post a picture of myself at a concert I went to on my Instagram page and Sabrina post’s something some might consider “thirsty” and my girlfriend took serious exception to that, and it ultimately led to our second and final split. That’s when Sabrina and I really started talking again, we would both hype each other’s pictures up, we would talk for ours at a time, play games together over Skype until 4 am, and a bunch of other things. \n\n          In mid August, when she returns home,  we decide we want to hangout for the first time in a long time. We have a great time at the mall and movies and the night went by way too fast. Then a few weeks go by and she invites me out to a party for one of her friends’ birthday at the beach, and since at this point I’m crushing hard, I agree without a second thought. That entire day consisted of us either talking in my car, laying on the beach, or with her  nuzzled up next to me on the couch while all of us are watching movies. This is the night I realized I was falling in love with her yet again (big mistake). We ended the night with a long conversation outside her house (In which she hinted at the fact that she wanted me to make the first move) and a long embrace and left it at that. \n\n          The very next weekend I invite her over to my house to hangout and watch movies and that went as well as that can go. I drive her home, walk her to the door and, with much convincing from her friend earlier that day, I kiss her, and she kisses me back. We both confess our feelings and both of us left with giant smiles on our faces. School begins once again, her and I were seemingly as happy as could be, spending as much free time as we had with each other. We even got a chance to celebrate my birthday together, which made me exceptionally happy as this was the first time I’d had someone who wasn’t family celebrate my birthday. We then began planning a Halloween/ Birthday party for her, and we invited a lot of our mutual friends and we were very excited for that.  We also were getting ready to go to a huge music festival in a city not too far from us and we had been planning it since the previous spring.  I thought that life couldn’t get any better, until only two weeks later she comes to me telling me that her anxiety and commitment issues were once again getting to her, and she tells me, in a very respectful and optimistic way, that she wants to take a break and reconnect as friends so that she can calm down her anxiety so we can have a healthy relationship. I completely understood but I was still afraid that the same thing that happened last time would happen again and I let her know that I was worried that my tendency to overthink things would eat away at me. She offered to be there for any questions I had and for reassurance that she wasn’t going to disappear again. So for the time being my emotions were under control\n\n          At first, everything was just fine, we were still talking, although it was substantially less than we would before and we stopped seeing each other, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Slowly but surely our interactions get shorter and shorter and fewer and farther between. This is where my big mistakes begin, I let all these worries build up because I continued to give her the benefit of the doubt because I thought she could potentially be busy, with school and planning the party. Now, the weekend of the festival is upon us. I ask her if she’s excited for it the day before we were supposed to leave and she tells me, “Oh, I’m not going I sold my ticket” so it ended up being just her friend and I at the festival. While I had a ton of fun going you can only imagine the disappointment after we had planned this trip for months and having her back out at the literal last second. When I get back from the festival I unloaded weeks worth of worries onto her. To her credit, she answered all of my questions and calmed me down temporarily and ensured me that things were going to get better once the day of the party passes. I let that sink in and I have a positive outlook for a while, then the day of the party comes around. Up to that point, our conversations had numbered almost none. Despite this, I’m excited for the party because I really wanted to spend time with her so I went into the party optimistically, even though I am not at all a party person. I get there and I greet her friends that were waiting in front that got there before me. When I got inside I was looking around for her but I was I formed by her friend that she was still getting dressed, so I wait patiently. She gets down and greets everyone generally, and I was hoping she would come and say hi to me personally, but she didn’t and that’s kinda when my night went downhill. The party starts not too long after that, and my anxiety immediately flares up and I’m confined to the wall in the kitchen with all the other people that didn’t like dancing and being in a crowd. Now I stayed like that for a majority of the night, I actually had a bit of fun with the other wallflowers that were with me, but S",

      "description": "In short, I am a cisgendered woman and although my childhood was nothing short of traditional, I had the opportunity to have a non-traditional education and met tons of non-traditional people. I've  been able to venture out past the redundancy of my ethnic enclave and it's been monumental in shaping my own personal views.\n\nRecently, I've been talking to this guy and everything has been going smooth for the few months that we've been talking... until early this morning when he jokingly commented 'he's attractive' under a transgendered woman's post. I like to think I'm very tolerant, but I'm very no-nonsense about personal attacks or 'jokes' like that and this person knows this. It has never come up before but I was just so surprised by this. When I confronted them, they just casually mentioned that they have a transgendered friend who is some type of sex worker. He told me I obviously care about this more than he does but we have left it at that. I've literally have had friends who have been attacked and have lost their lives for their identity, and I would be extremely uncomfortable bringing a romantic partner with those views around my friends. I want to just unfriend and unfollow but honestly, am I overreacting? Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Grammar\n\nUpdate: a few days after I had stopped talking to him, he did apologise but honestly that didn't satisfy me. Fast forward to today, he has willingly signed up for an all-day mental health first aid course with me. The best apology is changed behaviour so I'm glad things worked out.",

My friends friend (let’s call her “Jane”) jumped down my throat about how I could “eat more” and “if you’re fat what am I.” Jane then went on a long rant about how some people can’t help being fat, and how she’s only overweight because of her health issues.\n\nSo I said many people have health issues but still figure out ways to take care of themselves. She said she has hypothyroidism, so unlike me she doesn’t have energy to workout.I explained that I too also have hypothyroidism, and that in fact, I don’t even have a thyroid. But that I still manage what I ate even when I can’t go to the gym. \n\n I also said that I understand you gain some weight dealing with thyroid issues but not enough to become morbidly obese. That it’s very rare to have a health problem that makes you gain enough weight to be THAT overweight, and hypothyroidism definitely isn’t one of them. At some point people have to acknowledge that some weight gained is their fault and not their disease. She started crying and told me I was fat shaming her, and my friend agreed. \n\nShe’s made a lot of comments in the past about my body, and has implied I have an eating disorder (I don’t, like at all).

      "description": "This might be a long one, guys...\n\nSo, September 2018, my mother was involved in a fatal car accident. My father (Who never married my mother and had custody of me) and I were the first people called, as my aunt and older brother were unavailable. My aunt and I never were really close, I would only see her when she, her boyfriend, and my cousins came to my mom's house when I was there. We rarely, if at all talked over social media.\n\nThat night/morning at like 1AM, she messaged me 'Don't post it on facebook', I agreed because it was...a sensitive time for me. Plus, I don't really use social media, especially facebook. The next day, I'm online checking on how everyone is doing, and I see my aunt has posted about my mother. This definitely rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nMy mother left behind four younger siblings- the oldest 13, and the youngest 6. They couldn't live with their biological father for reasons I will not mention here (This is not my dad, my dad and their dad are different,) and seeing is my Aunt was the only next of kin, she decided to take my siblings in.\n\nThings are hectic, but quiet for the next few months. We have a private memorial service where I see my aunt and siblings, everything seems okay.\n\nThen, December rolls around. I plan a trip up to their house, which is two hours away from mine. We're driving my brother home and I ask, \"Are you going to keep the kids?\"\n\nShe says no.\n\nHonestly? I was livid- but I understood.\n\nMy siblings' father was a horrible man; they watched him and learned from him. They're very difficult to deal with, to the point where my mother couldn't even find babysitters because they just caused so many problems. It's not their fault, they're just kids, but they are...hard to deal with (One of my siblings sliced another open with a boxcutter once).\n\nAdditionally, my Aunt already has a kid of her own, and she works third shift, AND her boyfriend was going to leave her if the kids stayed.\n\nI was angry, but I understood the stress that was put on her.\n\nI ask her to keep me updated, I message her every week or so, asking about the kids, I get vague responses.\n\nAnd then, a few months later, I get a letter. It's from CPS. My siblings were being placed in foster care. My aunt didn't tell me, she didn't let me know, she didn't tell me where they were going and how I can contact them. I just got a copypaste letter telling me my siblings were placed in foster care.\n\nAnd my aunt wants to come to my high school graduation. I only get four tickets.\n\nShe has never been in my life, she has never gone out of her way to message me until my mom's death, and she didn't tell me what was happening with my siblings.",

      "description": "ME: 23, no sexual encounters to date, something like 90% sure I'm a lesbian, because all instances of sexual desire have to date been for... well, women. Not out to most of my family. Very sheltered very conservative-Christian upbringing, moving around the world a lot, bit weird, probably autistic, very naive but aware of it. Heavy repression and self-loathing issues around my orientation, but I'm mostly over that and doing great now. I'm in college now and learning most of the social getting-by hacks, but the intimate-relationship ones still elude me.\n\nOther cast members are my friend Jeff, and my not-really-girlfriend Meg.\n\nJEFF: 57, adjunct instructor at my college but in a different faculty. Definitely autistic. We're collaborating on a project, because I am good at what I do and he gives me space to get on and do it. We get along very well; I consider him my best friend, and I know I take up more of his downtime than pretty much anyone else. He's made comments in the past about being 'addicted' to me, and has said that this will never be 'more than friends' unless I want it to. I love him to bits in a platonic kinda way; he's a fantastic guy, very gentlemanly and kind and just good people. If I slip control even a little I know for certain that I could very easily fall head-over-heels in love with him, romantically at any rate. Jeff has been single for a few years now but has at least three exes, all of whom are exes because of personality clashes.\n\nMEG: 18, we met when I lived in her country six years ago, kept in touch online. She's been kicked out of her parents' place because she came out to them as bi. Meg has DID. At least one of her personalities is very gay and very into the idea of us as a couple, talks about moving out here to be with me. I would love that. Meg is amazing, gorgeous, and talented in all the ways I'm not and I admire the hell out of her. She was abused as a kid and is not into the idea of having sex, ever, which I'm cool with, because it's not that big a deal for me and I like her, not her parts. At least six more of her personalities are not into me in that way for various reasons. I treat Meg-as-a-whole as a close friend or sister, and take my cues from whatever personality is in charge at any given time. Anything sexual with Meg is off the table because it would damage her, and I would cut off my own arm to avoid hurting her; I love this girl.\n\nI'm pretty sure if I went to Jeff and said 'hey, fuck me, I wanna know what it's like', he'd check to make sure that was what I wanted, and then yes, he would. I've been lowkey curious for quite a while about hetero sex; everyone seems to enjoy it a lot and I want to know what I'm missing, even though I find the idea slightly repulsive. Same with oysters; they sound gross but everyone likes them and they're not that bad in real life.\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA if I had sex with a guy who would definitely be into it, just out of curiosity on my part?",

      "description": "I wasn’t sure how else to word it without explaining. I have autism, and my sensory issues means standing in large crowds is a rather unpleasant experience. I also hate catching buses. The bus was crowded today, with a huge line at the stop. Everyone was getting on the bus one way, so I stood beside the line slightly away, intending to get on last. I didn’t need a seat as my stop was only two stops away, and there were a number of old people with big bags, and lots of women with kids. \n\nSo I intended to wait by the side. As I was stood there, waving my friend off, this old woman gave me a dirty look and made a few comments about waiting your turn. I shrugged it off. Old people can be like that. I let everyone on, some people tried to let me on but I told them it was okay. I thought I was fine, until I get on and hear her moaning about me again. The old man she was with smiled at me, I think he felt bad, as it was one of Those smiles. \n\nI don’t know. I can’t work out if I was the asshole in this situation. While looking back, I understand she could have seen it that way, but I’ve never received comment on it before, and no one else there had an issue. I wasn’t stood close enough for it to look like I was to barge in front of her, and I wasn’t stood impatiently either. I do it every time; it just makes life easier for everyone, those who need seats and people like me who don’t need a seat, is travelling alone and isn’t too far away. ",

We were still early in the relationship, and he was unemployed and attending college full time so I knew it wasn't happening anytime soon but I had wanted to lay it out there so he knew.  He told me at that time \"maybe, but not right now\"\n\nThis is basically the same answer I received from him anytime I brought up the subject over the last few years ( I didn't bring it up very often) I assumed it was because we were both a little unsettled, and we weren't married.  \n\nLast year we got married,  so about a week before the wedding I brought up the subject again and he basically told me no, it's never going to happen and to never bring it up again.  I was pretty upset about it and angry for a long time.  There was no discussion, no reasoning, just a big fat no.   I would never force him into it.  \n\nI have since dropped the subject and things are pretty well back to normal for us but I am having a hard time moving on...

      "description": "My mum's boyfriend's behaviour towards me is strange and make me feel uncomfortable. For example:\n\n\\- At a restaurant he would pull out my chair for me even if i had already sat down at a different seat at the same table and insist that I sit at the seat he chose for me\n\n\\- Reach across the table and brush my hair out of my face while I was eating\n\n\\- Refuse to drive me home if I sat in the the back seat. I had to sit in the passenger seat next to him\n\n\\-  While my mum and my siblings were away he invited me to go watch the moon outside. When I denied his request he stood outside my bedroom door and refused to leave and kept insisting that I go outside with him. Then he hugged me and stroked my hair while I tried to pull away kept asking me to go outside with him. Eventually I gave up and went outside with him where he asked me to go to the beach(???) with him even though it was the middle of the night and then he tried to stroke my face. \n\nAfter the moon incident I've been trying to avoid him the best I can. When he speaks to me I ignore him and walk away. This makes him really angry and he has been complaining to my mum about how I treat him. My mum says I need learn to forgive people and that I'm being extremely disrespectful. She always asks me why I'm trying to ruin their relationship and has threatened to kick me out if my bad behaviour continues. \n\nI have told my family about why I feel uncomfortable around him and the general opinion is that I'm over reacting. I feel like maybe they're right and I'm making a big deal out of nothing and maybe he had pure intentions but didn't realise how his actions came across. He seems like he genuinely didn't know why I was so scared. I'm willing to forgive him but every time I see him I feel nauseous. I should also add that mum's boyfriend and I have never been close and we have barely spoken since the first time we met.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry about my writing. English is not my first language.

      "description": "Okay a little back story I've been living here since October of last year this is in Serbia where things work a bit differently. People do things on people's word.\n\nSo I was supposed to leave in 3 months because I'm done with my year at school and go home j til October and move into my newly built condo that I bought. This was always temporary. \n\nI went home for the holidays and when I came back in February I noticed people fighting and shouting and crying. This building is so damn old you can hear ever thing. At first I thought the guy was beating his wife cuz he yells and shouts at 3-4 am when I assume he comes home drunk from the bar and she cries. I brought this to the attention of my uncle who is friends with my landlord and he also knows my dad. \n\nMy uncle basically said there is nothing I can do about it. Okay so I try and put up with it. But Wednesday through Friday I have class at 8 am and I can't keep waking up that early from these people yelling. A few days ago I had enough it was Wednesday morning at 5 am and I knocked on the door asking if everything was okay. He told me that his mother is in pain (don't know why he's yelling) I offered to call an ambulance or get her some pain killers anything to shut her up. I have class in the morning. After that encounter I heard nothing from them until Saturday morning. This time they did this ordeal at 8am. One of 2 days I can sleep in I'm up at 8. \n\nI don't say anything I told my uncle about me going to the door he said if it happens again we will call the police. I know this country police won't do shit. But I went and found a new place to live . And told my uncle I'm moving as I can't do this anymore. He tells me that what I'm doing is a dick move because I'm not giving his friend enough notice. I also told him I will pay for this month's rent no problems (it's only 200 euro).\n\nFastforward to today. I had to be up at 8am again. 3am it starts... At 5am it gets even worse I recorded it and sent it to some people and the responded asking me if I live at a farm because that doesn't sound human. I called the police and as soon as I said the street name they literally filled in the rest saying they had 3 other complaints. I think the police came around 7am but around 830 am I heard her yelling again. \n\nI offered to show my uncle and land Lord this recording and he's like I don't care it's still not okay what you did. I am moving out today I will end up paying 850 euros to move into this new place since I used an agency. And 200 euros for this months rent to give this man a month to find someone new. I'm here studying medicine I can't be sleep deprived especially when I'm in the hospital tending to patients.",

      "description": "5 years ago moved to the other side of the world to be with the love of my life. I accept this was entirely my choice and I have no regrets.\n\nSince moving I've traveled to see my parents a few times. 2 years ago we extended the invite for them to come and see us, and we'd pay for the whole thing. It's cheaper for us to fly them here than for us to go there.\n\nThey declined. They don't think they could make the plane journey (my parents are both in their early 60s), \"you can't possibly afford that\" (we can, or we wouldn't of extended the invite). \"We have stuff to fix on the house.\" We let it go and visited them.\n\nThen my mom got sick. Without a second thought, went to visit them. Genuinely the right thing to do and I wouldn't dream of doing it differently.\n\nMy mom is now better, thankfully, discharged from hospital etc.\n\nThis year, we extend the same invite. We'll pay, we have a guest house, you can stay there and borrow my car etc. This year they declined again...and for the first time, critically, they said \"Even before you moved to [new country] , we've never wanted to visit there\". They promised to \"definitely think about\" coming to visit us next year.\n\nIt's getting harder not to take this personally. I told them this means they won't see us this year. They reassured me that they love me but they won't be visiting. There's a petulant side of me that just wants to withdraw my yearly offer since it feels like they have no intention of taking me up on it.\n\nSome other facts for your consideration of assholery: \n- I call them 100% of the time we speak. \n- this is not new behavior. Even when I lived local, they never visited.\n- in their defense, I did pick up a second job for a while, just to help with some bills etc which are now sorted. They cited this as a reason for not wanting to put me under financial strain... However, if we couldn't afford it, we wouldn't offer. \n- my new home is still in the western world. My new country isn't significantly more dangerous to visit than where they live.\n - my dad smokes, and had cited this as a reason for not visiting. He couldn't handle the flight without smoking. \n- this year mom cited travel insurance as being too high putting them under financial strain because of her illness which I can see. \n- I know I'm lucky to have my parents. Part of this frustration is because I love them and desperately want them to visit, but there's something that stops them. I know life is short and we all don't know how much time we have with the ones we love... So withdrawing my yearly offer feels immature.\n\nSo, reddit, WIBTA for withdrawing my offer of paying for flights and just waiting for them to want to visit me? I hate getting my hopes up about seeing them and then having them constantly declined.",

      "description": "My partner and I have had a little pregnancy scare lately. I have told her that I’m not comfortable with our current method of birth control (although until recently I hadn’t taken steps to change it beyond telling her I think we should, so I’m just as at fault for that), and she’s been a few days late starting her period. This has me more than a little stressed out, so I bought her a pregnancy test and asked her to call me when she took it (we live separately, and the test has to be done first thing in the morning).\n\nThis morning I didn’t hear from her until past 10am, well after the time I knew she would be up and about. As a little side note, I work in an office and start early while she usually works from home, hence why I wanted her to call me as opposed to being there in person. She finally texts me at 10.03 with a happy/jokey message of good morning. I ask her if she has taken the test. She says she hasn’t. I ask her why not. She says she feels like her period will start today, so doesn’t feel like she needs to.\n\nI’m angry, we had agreed that she would call me in the morning when she took the test. She tells me not to worry, to which I reply with this message “I wouldn’t have to if you took the test. The reason I got it was so that you could do it, not keep it in your bag”\n\nShe replies a couple of minutes later saying she has taken the test and it indicates no pregnancy. She follows that with a message saying “I hope you’re happy now”.\n\nFor clarity, I’m going to copy and paste my whole reply, so you don’t have to rely on me paraphrasing. I send her the following “It’s not about me being happy, it’s about you realising this is a serious thing for both of us with massive consequences, for both of us, and that you flaking on doing it properly as we have discussed is very unfair to me and obviously going to upset me. I am counting on you heavily to take this as seriously as me, and you not taking my emotional state on such a serious matter and following through on what we agreed on is a small betrayal of trust. Thank you for doing it eventually tho”\n\nShe didn’t talk to me for 4 hours after that, then got in touch demanding I apologies for hurting her. She has said my comments were obviously hurtful, it lets her know what I think of the relationship and shows her what this relationship means to me. She included the comment “Everything that’s been said before kind of just gets nullified and overshadowed when such hurtful things are said”\n\nShe hasn’t apologise at all and it demanding I apologise to her. I feel completely awful about the whole situation. AITA for telling her I felt she breached my trust? Or should I have just been grateful she took the test at all? Do I need to apologise unreservedly? Or should I insist she apologise also? Help!",

They do that, and then nobody wants to eat it. \nThey ALWAYS take my food like my restraunt leftovers, something I cooked for myself, and mix it into everything else.

Green beans, grain, onions, tomatoes. \nI know this is a first world problem, but this makes me really angry. I dont even know why the fuck he would do that because now its just going to sit in the back of the fridge because nobody wants to eat that. \nI hate the fact that my parents dont respect my wishes. My stepdad always tells me how all i eat is garbage (like i have some sort of secret life where I just go to fast food restraunts all day, even though i literally eat what they cook and i cant drive????) and they eat good food. If you call that good food sir, then youd really like prison meals. \nUgh. Just ugh. ",

Politics aside, I am uncomfortable with this: we are both in college and have been dating for about four months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides this conversation, our relationship has been going relatively well. We enjoy each other's company and get along. However, she has said some other things which have been concerning to me. She constantly mentions to me how cute she finds babies, and occasionally mentions that she feels \"baby crazy\" at times and that she needs to \"calm herself down\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, not that I am superstitious, but she went to see a psychic, who said (and I shit you not) \"Be careful with your boyfriend, birth control does not work on his family.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is on birth control, and I am careful to use condoms, but this is still concerning to me. Not to get into nitty gritty, but I am 100% certain that she is not pregnant at this moment. Knowing this new fact about how she feels about if she were to get pregnant makes me uncomfortable to intimately engage with her, seeing as more than anything I do not want to have a child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am beginning to consider this a massive red flag, to the point where I do not know if I can comfortably continue the relationship. AITA for wanting to end things over this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr my girlfriend wouldn't yeetus the fetus if it came to it, and I don't think I can smash and date in confidence now",

Now that I'm trying to find a subleaser (and I'm doing my best, I'm really fucking stressed right now about it), they're not helping at all. Our living room looks cramped as hell because one of my roommates spontaneously bought a couch without notifying us, and no one has been willing to help me make the apartment look nicer.

I caught her keeping FB messenger on her “spare phone” she keeps at work to play Pandora. In lieu of the argument, she “deleted” the apps and hasn’t been in since.\n\nFew weeks ago, she asked me to help her with setting up the iWatch I got her for Christmas.  I accidentally swiped down when working between apps and found a notification from SnapChat. I went in and found those bogus conversations from other men that caused the issues since September. She was infuriated I read them. A couple of those men even called her sexy and gorgeous. (Things I call her almost daily and met with a type of rejection while she thanks these guys. ) Obviously this caused a huge fight. At the end she promised to delete SnapChat.\n\nSo we’re sitting here tonight and I ask her if she ever deleted SnapChat. She said yes. I asked her when did she get the email stating in 30 days the account would be inactive. She said she only deleted the app and that she will delete it the next time she’s on the internet. I asked her when that would be and she stormed off avoiding me and the conversation. \n\nAITA for bringing it up? Requesting the confirmation? ",

      "description": "Okay so this all happened in December but her and I broke up 2 weeks ago (not because of this) and I have always wanted to know if I was in the wrong or right here. The new smash bros came out on Friday December 7th, which happened to be the day directly after my last final for my fall term. I saw this about 2 months prior to it coming out and was ecstatic. I told my gf(lets just say H) and pretty much everyone else that I am not doing anything for that weekend besides playing and that people are welcome to play with me. H just called me a nerd and laughed it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo about a week and a half before the game came out, she told me about a work Christmas party on the 7th. I reminded her about the game coming out then and the plans I made to play all weekend, which now included some friends I made plans with. Well she didn't like my answer and basically told me that wanting to play a video game was not a valid reason to not intend her work Christmas party, which I honestly understand and normally I would've attended without issue. But this is something that I had been talking to her for the past 2 months with excitement and it was all I was looking forward too after my finals were done. Playing video games is a hobby that I haven't been able to really partake in while I'm trying to finish school, so I wasn't ready to cancel my plans for that party. I ended up following through with my plans and playing all weekend. We fought about me not going for about a week after the party but eventually got past it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that it's important to be there for your SO in situations like this, but I also feel like I communicated what I was doing well before the Christmas party and I feel like my hobby/plans should have been more respected. So, AITA for not going to her work Christmas party and playing smash bros? ",

      "description": "I (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for 5 years. We have a great relationship now, but we went through a lot of shit in college. He fell in with a group of guys who I believed to be scumbags. They took Xanax with alcohol every night, skipped class to smoke/sell weed all day, and would try and set him up with other girls knowing full well that he and I were dating. \n\nI worked hard for 2 years to help my boyfriend get clean and finally did it — but only because I forced him to end his friendship with these guys. I’m so happy that he is healthy now and not involved with shady people anymore, but I feel extremely guilty because I’m starting to notice that he has no friends. \n\nI noticed this a few weeks ago when my friends invited me out for drinks and he asked me to hang out that same night. He was so sweet when I told him I already had plans, saying he didn’t mind and to have fun, but I was close to tears all night because he was at home alone while I was out with friends and I know I’m the reason he doesn’t go out with the guys anymore.\n\nThe guilt became even worse on the day of the Super Bowl when he said he was going to see what the guys were doing, but ended up coming to my place instead. Apparently they said they “didn’t know what they were doing for the Super Bowl” which I find hard to believe from a group of boys who love football. I‘m guessing they just didn’t want him there. \n\nI don’t want him to fall back with a shitty group of people and pick up his old habits, but I’m worried that I’m controlling his life and have left him friendless.

Problem is, I've never met anyone in person through these apps before and I'm a very anxious person.\n\nHe'd mentioned that he lost his duvet at a relatives and won't ever be getting it back (they lost it too apparently). His living situation isn't great, he sleeps on an airbed that deflated and caused him to get no sleep last night and has a single blanket (to be fair it's a cute blanket).\n\nSo I thought I'd be nice and offer to buy him a duvet set, but first (and in hindsight I realise this must've been weird) I asked for a verification pic because all others I'd seen looked pretty much the same. \n\nHe tells me he is not going to do that nor should he and after telling him its because i wanted to get him a new duvet he proceeds to tell me the usual \"I don't accept things from guys I hardly know\" \"I can make it on my own\" stuff which is understandable. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting a verification pic and wanting to get a guy I hardly know yet a duvet? Also we were talking about meeting up sometime soon just to chill. Now though, I think I just killed what was going to be a good friendship.\n\nAm I the asshole?

I'm having doubts about being resentful of her presence because she's not overtly getting in my way. My two roommates and I have our own bedrooms and bathrooms, and our electric bill is not even that high, despite her always showering at our place. I don't necessarily want her to pay rent - it just bothers me that she's freeloading. I signed up and paid to have TWO roommates - not three.   \n\n\nSure, there are small things that her constant presence cause: she uses my cups and sometimes leaves them overnight, so I have to wash them to make myself a cup of tea in the morning while she's still sleeping. She takes up space in the fridge, so I have to dig through her stuff to get to mine. She and my roommate often take up the kitchen to make dinner together. But these things are small enough to make me doubt that I have a case against her being here all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same two roommates and I are moving to another apartment together soon, and I thought that this would be a good opportunity to bring up the girlfriend issue.

      "description": "This story is a few years old, but it is one I always think back to because I really question if I had done the right thing. \n\nSummer of 2017, I took at a job at a local amusement park. I was a ride operator at our main water ride. It was a river rafting ride, so just think round boats and a pretty good shot at getting soaked. \n\nWe rotate positions every hour and I was working as the counter. I counted up folks at the front of the line, made sure everyone was the approved height, and sent them on to my other coworker so they could get them into the boat safe. I also had to make sure no one had any food/beverages on them. Food+certainty it will get wet+people throwing trash in the water= no bueno. \n\nA group of four reaches the front of the line and each person has a plastic plate full of food with them. I tell them politely that they are not allowed to have food with them on the ride, so they would have to finish the food or throw it away. The group rolls their eyes at me and asks if they can just leave the plates on the platform while they go on the ride. I explained that food couldn’t be left on the platform and we have several signs that say that this is not a ride where food is allowed. \n\n(I have zero idea why they would want to leave their food where a bunch of wet people are continuously going to run past it. They would be coming back to a big disgusting wet mess.)\n\nThe group changes their annoyed tune and one of them says, “Okay, we will get rid of all this, no problem.” They proceed like they are going to head to the exit, but then they see the boat that was going to be meant for them. They drop all their plates on the platform where they think I cannot see it, then they board the boat and it takes off. I had started helping another group when I saw them heading towards the exit, so I fucked up by being a little too trusting there. Nonetheless, they were gone and I was now pissed. \n\nFood on the platform is a no, and we are told to throw away what we find. I was in clear view of my manager, so if they saw the food sitting on the platform then I would be asked about it. So I walked over, picked up all the plates, and tossed them in the trash.\n\nNow, from my experience at least, food at amusement parks is fucking pricey. So I did feel shitty about tossing it out, there’s also the fact that it is a big ass waste. In that situation, my options for passing the food along is pretty impossible, but still. \n\nThe group came back and there were a lot of “what the fuck’s” thrown around. They never said anything directly to me though and just exited after discovering the food was gone. I felt like I was in the right for following protocol, the group was pretty rude, but it was four full ass plates. \n\nI have gotten multiple takes on this, but thought I’d ask anyway. Also, sorry this is a long/choppy post, still pretty new to posting on here. \n\n",

      "description": "We've been together for almost 2 years, this is my second birthday with him. We broke up on my last birthday so I never got a gift then which I didn't care about. We got back together about 2 months later.\n\nHis birthday was 4 months ago. Now I'm not lying when I say I really really love this guy, he's amazing and he makes me really happy so of course I wanted to do something really special for him for his birthday. I got him 3 very thoughtful gifts that I knew he would love, I brought his favourite food and cocktails and cake to his house and I made sure we got to have a special day together. He really enjoyed it, he was really really happy, and he even said to me at one point \"oh my god I'm gonna get you something AMAZING for your birthday, you deserve it!\"\n\nEvery so often then until my birthday he would say something about how he was going to get me a really good gift, so by the time my birthday came around I was really excited. I ended up having a really shit night the night before my bday which is a whole different story, but I stayed the night with him feeling kinda crap. In the morning then I asked when I was gonna get my gift. He said something about how he had gotten me a gift but was feeling really embarassed by how bad it was, so he was gonna get me a new one and give it to me later.\n\nI want to be clear here that I did not expect him to do a whole birthday special like I did and get me multiple presents and spend a lot of money. I wasn't asking him to do anything outrageous, but he had been saying he was gonna get me something good so I was a little hurt that I didn't get anything but I brushed it off and expected a present in like a week or 2.\n\nIt's been a month and he keeps making the same excuse. According to him he's bought me 5 really crappy presents that he's too embarassed to give me because they're not good enough for me. Today I was in a bad mood anyway and I straight up asked him where my present was. He kinda laughed about it and handed me different bits of junk from around his house that were clearly not for me and were just lying around. I got upset and told him I just wanted some sort of effort from him and we had a big argument. \n\nHe was basically saying that he's been super stressed lately, and he didn't think he'd have to get me anything because he never gets presents for his friends birthdays, and he doesn't even have money to buy me anything.\n\nI was saying that he had told me he was gonna get me something and I felt hurt that he'd lied about that, and that I would have been happy with a $10 book voucher, or some cool pencils, or even a homemade gift, just something to show that he cared enough to actually get me something.\n\nThe argument ended with me apologising for stressing him out so much, somewhat of an apology from him, and an agreement that we'd just leave this and move on but now I can't help but feel that he's a bit of an asshole here.",

      "description": "This one I'll try to keep short.\n\nSo my boss is already an older woman. Runs her own business. I basically assist with administrative stuff. She constantly tells me to do things which I do, but she forgets she told me so I get reprimanded. This has happened many times and I can't do anything about as she doesn't use email or whatsapp or anything (last week she called me out for hiring someone that she had told me to hire, because someone else quit, and many more situations). Only phone calls and one-to-one. It's gotten to the point where I am really frustrated and decided to do only what I was told, nothing more and nothing less.\n\n2 weeks ago she fired a woman and obviously she needs to be paid. Well, when she decided to fire her she told me \"I took care of it and I told the supervisor to tell her she's done\". Usually I let the person in accounting know who left the company and who was hired, but since she told me she took care of it, I understood that she also let that person know of the firing, so I didn't. And I didn't do it out of malice, I just assumed.\n\nIt's been two weeks since the woman was fired and if she doesn't get her severance soon she can sue, but since my boss already called me on the phone to reprimand me for not informing of the firing, I don't want to remind her because it's extremely frustrating to be punished for doing what I'm told.\n\nShe constantly tells me not to challenge her with anything, as in not to disagree. Like, yesterday during lunch I told her we needed water bottles, and then 3 hours later she called me out... for not telling her we needed them. So I won't challenge her anymore and let her run her shit and get in trouble if need be.\n\nWITBA?",

      "description": "Hey all, please bare in mind I have mild autism and I am kind of bad at communicating. Regardless, here is my story.\n\nAbout 1 1/3 years ago I joined a group of people online. They're folks who built a community of support, honesty, and acceptance. They were my *best* friends. They were also very liberal, and that's not a bad thing, nor was it really unexpected, as they were a very diverse group. A lot of lgbt folk, as well as other minority groups. Now, this was a small community, and we interacted very often, and so we were very close knit. We had all been through some shit together, experiences I won't share out of respect for these people, but regardless our pain made us grow closer. However, I was always an outlier. I'm a centrist at heart, I don't consider myself part of the lgbt community, despite being bi, because I object to some of the actions and ideologies that the movement has garnered, and I'm also not a feminist for the same reasons. I was never afraid to talk about these things, and my friends were never afraid to engage in debate with me about it. Unfortunately, I wasn't good at communicating. I'd often end up interpreting things as confrontational, or let my emotions get the best of me, and these debates would devolve into arguments and not debates. It was an issue. But I did work to change it, and I still am. Unfortunately, I couldn't do so before it bit me in the ass. Big time. We were having a discussion about comedy and what is acceptable and what isn't, and at this time it was just a conversation, not even a debate. And to cut things a bit short, I revealed to them that I was very much a supporter of the \"nothing is sacred, everything can be humorous\" type of thinking. My friends were, understandably, upset. Again, to cut things short, things devolved rapidly. This subject had come up before, it wasn't new, but what ended up happening was that I was so unwavering in my defense of this ideology I had newly (in their eyes) adopted, and thanks to my lack of social intelligence, I ended up giving them the impression that I may have been associating with alt right extremists who were trying to agree with their way of thinking. This upset me, for several reasons. I thought that after all this time they would have known I don't want to hurt people, hell they were there when I decided I want to dedicate myself to pacifism. But they were afraid. They wanted me to be safe and I just wouldn't see things their way. The situation continued to fluctuate over a period of 2 days, all while I resisted adamantly. I considered that I might be wrong, but was still unwilling to change, to the point that I nearly convinced myself I WAS being brainwashed by alt right extremists. Things settled eventually, and the moderators of the community convened. They agreed I was a source of discomfort, and asked me to . They asked me to go, and I accepted. I knew I hurt them, and I felt like this was the only good thing to do. ",

      "description": "So I met this guy once while I was overseas a year ago, and he's the son of my mom's friend. He was a nice kid, but we didn't talk much and that was that. About a month ago, mom said that he wanted my Instagram. I was alright with that, I mean he seemed okay.\n\nHe started to dm me, and after a few messages he said he had feelings for me. I didn't really know him that well so I tried to decline as politely as I could. He insisted that he could get me to love him if I'd just let him \"court\" me, to which I declined again. He said that was okay and that we could just be friends. I said alright, although I was a bit weirded out. After that, he kept saying stuff like \"I love you\" or \"I have feelings for you\" and then saying he meant it \"as a friend\" after I confronted him about it. I was really uncomfortable and I told him to stop pushing it multiple times, to which he'd insist he wasn't. I eventually told my mom, and she told me to block him. He apparently has mental issues that he's been trying to get diagnosed.\n\nI went on my way for a while, but he found my alternate account and tried to message me there a week later. I turned the account on private and blocked him there too. His sister messaged me this morning saying that I needed to forgive him and that he was extremely depressed because of what happened. My mom told me to ignore it and that she'd talk to their mom.\n\nShould I have been more accepting of him? Is it my fault he became really depressed? I feel really bad about it all.",

      "description": "To be clear, I seriously don’t know if I’m in the wrong here. I’m not here for YoUr WeDdInG iS yOuR dAy validation. \n\nMy fiancé and I are looking to buy a house and make huge changes this summer. To help with this process, we got “paper married” on Friday. We still plan on having a full wedding in a year. We’re only telling immediate family and our closest friends that we got married. To the general public, we’re still engaged. We invited parents only to the courthouse on Friday.  \n\nMy mom has a history of making fun of me and turning herself into a martyr or victim any chance she gets.\n\nMy mom calls me last weekend and asks if I would invite his family to a dinner she planned afterwards. Note: she didn’t ask if I wanted to do a dinner after or what restaurant or anything. I thought it’d be nice and harmless, so I said sure. She then sends me a Microsoft Publish invitation she made for me to send to his four parents. I texted her back and said, “I love that you’re so excited, but I hate that.” I explained it’s not my style and we’re trying to keep this as simple as possible. No invites. No flowers. No cake. Even dinner is pushing it. It’s literally just piece of paper for us and a day we can be together and get married. I explained I’m inviting her out of curtesy and not because this is something that is a big family ordeal. It’s our day. The big wedding is the family and guest day. She whined that I’m her only daughter and she might die before the big wedding and she needs to do the crafty stuff. I said no. I don’t want any of it. She said Fine. No flowers. Nothing. But she added her signature, “whatever.”\n\nI show up to the courthouse and as I go to stand with my fiancé, she hands me a bouquet of flowers she made. I say, “No. mom. I said last weekend that I don’t want flowers.” So I set them down. She pouted while his parents looked at her in sympathy. After the ceremony, his stepmom asked me to hold my flowers for pictures because I made my mom sad. Sure. we went to dinner. At the restaurant she giggled and said, “oh she’s gonna kill me.” She pulled out a cake she decorated. I looked at her angrily and she laughed in front of the whole bar of the restaurant and pointed, “oh haha look at her face.” I played nice and we had a fine dinner while she berated some of my life choices. She kept us there for 3 hours. By the time we got home, my fiancé and I were so tired that we spent no time together and passed out.\n\nI told my mom that if I can’t trust her to respect my wishes and not change things last minute in public, I don’t want her at the big wedding. I made super small requests. She broke those requests in public at my wedding. She lied and said she wouldn’t do those things. She embarrassed me and railroaded the whole night. It was all about her. I cried when I got home because she put her own feelings before mine and I’m hurt. ",

Would IBTA if I publicly out him about this? \n\n\nOk, so a year and half ago, an individual I’m acquainted with started an indigogo campaign for a project they were working on. \n\nI was interested in the project because I was fond of this individual’s work and because it related to an issue/subject matter that I’m very passionate about. \n\nNot only did I make a significant investment as a backer, but I also used my influence to garner additional support for the project by featuring it and the individual one of my professional platforms which has a significant reach. \n\nThe impact of my organization’s endorsement of the project was substantial. The campaign was coming to a close and had stalled. After I featured the project, they reached a monetary milestone which allowed for completion. \n\nIt’s been a year and a half though, and not a single campaign “perk” has been fulfilled. \n\nNow, I’m connected to this person on social media and saw that instead of making an effort to fulfill their current campaign, they were involved in yet another major project. \n\nI was pissed beyond words so I contacted the guy in June and was like, “Hey _____, what’s up? I’m really happy that you were able to complete the project. I noticed that there hasn’t been any activity on your campaign with regard to perks (they haven’t even sent promised thank you notes) and wanted to know when your backers can expect fulfillment?”\n \nI made a substantial contribution that entitled me to many valuable perks so I sent him a copy of my receipt. \n\nHis response was to make assurances and excuses with the promise of updating me on the situation. That was in June and I haven’t heard anything. \n\nI was hoping that he would have chosen to be transparent with the backers at that point and communicated something about the delay, but he didn’t. \n\nI’m considering publicly outing him about the situation because he’s just recently signed on for another project! I’m a stickler for accountability and it pisses me off to no end that people think they can just can take people’s money in a good faith agreement and completely fail to uphold or fulfill their end of said agreement. \n\nHe’s looked up to in his community and this is just BS. I think hundreds of other backers who got screwed might be afraid to challenge him on it. He’s representing a very marginalized demographic and my concern is that he is manipulating the privilege his work and education have brought him by using it against the very people he claims to want to empower. \n\nAm I the asshole for being pissed about this? Would I be that asshole for outing this guy? \n\n\n",

      "description": "Growing up, I had immense love for my brother. He was always a scumbag, always a weirdo. A lot of people have never liked him, and when he was 18+, he would prey upon young girls. Im talking middle school aged girls. I never defended him, but I also wasn’t angry because I grew up very sheltered and didn’t know/understand the full extent to what he was doing. \nAs I entered high school, his friends would prey upon me. They’d come into my bedroom at night, drunk, and sexually assault me. 2 of them. My brother called me a slut to other people, and would tell me not to tell my parents because then his friends wouldn’t be allowed over. \nHe ended up helping his close friend make a fake fb profile to harass me and other girls around a year ago. They’d say gross sexual stuff to girls, fat shame, post racist shit. I was at my wits end. I said some awful shit about him and he got screenshots and showed my parents. I couldn’t tell them why I hate him so much. \n\nIt’s been about 6 months and I’ve barely talked to him. We live in the same house. I’m 19 and he’s 24, struggled through college and has no plan on moving out, he’s a massive loser. \n\nMy mom cries about us not having a close relationship and whines about how annoying it is. I don’t love him. I don’t miss him. I don’t feel sorry for him. And after I move out, I plan on never seeing him ever again unless I have to. \n\nAITA for feeling this way? ",

I told him that I don't care what he wears while I am not working with him, but when I am to not wear it.  It also gets VERY uncomfortable in public because when someone walks up to him and asks \"your in the military?\" He will lie and say that he is and starts trying to explain what he does and I have to intervene and explain the situation.

      "description": "Ok so, I have had anxiety and minor issues with mental health since i was about 8. im 18f now and i have only now gotten help and have been able to talk about it.\n\nalso a bit of background, my mum and dad divorced before i could remember, my dad has a new wife and had two sons with her when i was 8, shes been around since i was 4 i think\n\nThe root of my anxiety is my dads temper, being that he would occasionally scream, not yelling, actual screaming out of rage. this would happen about once every 2 weeks at his worst when i was about 13-14 and my brothers were 4 and 5. I would wake up to him screaming at them to get their shoes on, i wanted to go and stop him but id be frozen in my bed out of fear. A lot of the time my stepmum wasn't there. He got better as they got older, as in he would loose his temper less, at least to my knowledge (i alternate houses to my mums and my dads) His temper was almost always directed at my younger brothers. I know of two occasions where he has actually hit the older one, once a slap across the face, and another time the night before his wedding when my older (21 at the time) brother had to pull him off of my 9 y/o brother.\n\nI didnt experience this level of anger at their age, only the screaming. And i remember at 10 years old praying at night asking god if he truly exists, that he wouldn't let me wake up in the morning because i thought any other way of killing myself would be too painful.\n\n**So this is what i feel like an asshole for:**\n\nI was babysitting my younger brothers, the older one and I are in the kitchen listening to music and talking about it, i play a song by frightened rabbit. He says he likes them and i tell him i wish i could have seen them live.\n\nB= brother M= me\n\nB: why cant you see them now?\n\nM: because they aren't together anymore\n\nB: why did they break up?\n\nM: the lead singer died\n\nB: How?\n\nM: He jumped off a bridge (this is the bit i regret, i felt like i was too graphic and i feel awful about it)\n\nB: why did he do that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom then on, i explained that he (the singer) was in a lot of pain, he was struggling with his thoughts. I told my brother how important it is to tell people you trust if you are struggling mentally and that there are people who can help. He doesnt know i go to therapy, i havent told them because i worry that my stepmum thinks im trying to influence them. I told her about my dads temper and some of the things she hasnt seen, i told her i was worried about my brothers but she blew it off, she thinks im just trying to tag my mental health to my dad and that her dad was like that all the time.\n\ni dunno.\n\nam i an asshole for maybe being too graphic to my younger brother? is he too young to know about this? i genuinely feel bad for telling him and i want to know if what i did was wrong.

      "description": " I am friends with both M27 and F26. And I am pretty close with them. With F26, not so much anymore. They have been dating since Sophomore year of high school and have known them since. They are engaged for about a year now and getting married in 3 months. \n\nShe is very manipulative and my friend is heavily influenced by her philosophies. He has become a completely different person over time, and has expressed notions and opinions that are definitely not coming from him. \n\nIf he wants to hang out with the guys, it’s her say and 90% of the time she says no. We are his closest friends and rarely see each other. Time spent is usually just catching up over dinner and is a very wholesome time together. \n\nThe rare dinner happened where she showed up. She mentions that he is “way more talkative than usual”. A few weeks after, in an attempt to try to make our group closer with her, we attend her birthday and played board games.  Our friend is like a completely different person. He is clearly putting on a facade and wouldn’t make the jokes he would usually make or say things he usually says. He never laughs either.\n\nWhenever I call, you can tell he’s with her when his voice is very quiet and inhibited and it’s always “I’ll call you back”. I even hear her raising her voice at him in the back sometimes. \n\nShe got a job 1.5 hours away from the city and forced him to switch jobs close to her as well. After getting married she wants to buy a house in that area- very quiet small town. \n\nMy friend works in trades and is having a change of heart. He wants to become an entrepeneur and stay in the big city. He doesnt want to live so far from friends and family and wants to pursue it. She completely hates the idea and does not support him. My opinion is that I know she is a very methodical person who goes according to plan. She probably thinks that it is risky and would want him to be safe and keep providing for her at a job he hates. \n\nThe wedding is coming up and I really feel for him.  He’s one of the nicest guys in the world and he deserves so much better. I plan on taking him out for a beer and I’m just going to straight up tell him that he’s makjng the biggest mistake of his life by marrying her. AITA? \n\n ",

      "description": "  \n\nA month ago it was a holiday and I decided to get drunk. I got drunk because I wanted to play and talk with my now ex-online best friend (call him Philip) since we rarely ever do that together. 30 mins after I started drinking I go to fetch more alcohol so I could get more drunk and 10 mins after that Philip says he was going to go play with a girl. I didn’t have problem with that but I was pretty bummed out about it. I thought everything was going well so I asked when they would finish and he said it would last a few hours. He then left the voice chat (VC) and I was really sad about it. I called him a cunt and then went to sleep. When I woke up I was hungover and I was in a really bad mood. I was hurting all over, I felt unwanted and betrayed. \n\nI was sad and angry that my best friend would never prioritise me over anyone when I thought we were best friends. He’s in VCs with other people daily for long periods of time (6+ hours). I then decid that I had enough of it and just ignored him completely which lasted about 1.5 weeks when he suddenly messages me when he was drunk saying that he was sorry and felt bad about what he did. At that point my friendly feelings that I had of him were nearly completely gone, I was still upset and wasn’t interested anymore.\n\nHe pressured me and I eventually said “I can try moving on and talk again” and we started talking again but it just felt awkward. Everything said felt forced and the responses felt forced as well. I was also getting ignored more when I said anything. A week later I post some pictures and say a few things about the pics to see if he would ignore them or talk and he just ignored them. I tilted at that and told him that I was not interested anymore and that I was still upset and mad and there was nothing to show he cared about me more. \n\nHe responded that he had been smoking weed which just pissed me tf off so I created a new discord account and moved to that. \n\nA week later I’m having loads of fun talking with other people in a new server on a new account and people say they like me and enjoy talking to me. I was feeling good.  The other guy (call him George) from the original server sent me a screenshot of the server chat in which Philip said that I was childish, a cunt and can’t be a real man for a fucking minute. He also said that he hopes I \"off\" myself if I ever read the message.\n\nI didn’t expect him to get that mad without messaging me trying to argue/explain his point of view which I would have read and then decided the next step. But it seems like that won’t be the case. \n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\ntl;dr: Online best friend ditched drunk me for a girl. I felt betrayed and really upset. I told him he was a cunt. He said sorry a week or so later. I said we could try being friends again. His behaviour didn’t change so I ended it.",

      "description": "This happened around two years ago, but I just discovered this subreddit and I had an interesting argument with some roommates back in the day that I think is appropriate for discussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (male) used to live with three women, one of which was my girlfriend, in a small three bedroom apartment. We got along really well for most of the time that we were living with one another except for this one specific incident that still bothers me to this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a viral video of a 4 year old russian girl \"fluently\" speaking seven languages. Here is the link to the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa0vQh3uSdw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa0vQh3uSdw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were all watching this video in the living room on the TV, and after watching the video, I said something along the lines of \"That's pretty cool, but there's no way that little girl fluently speaks seven languages.\"\n\nMy roommates challenged my logic by saying \"Some people are just smarter than you, just because you couldn't speak seven languages when you were four doesn't mean she can't!\" \n\nThis struck me as a kind of troll-y comment, because I in no way insinuated that I was more intelligent than this 4 year old girl-- rather; that it was very unlikely she was truly proficient in seven languages. They called me a total asshole for even remotely doubting this little Russian girl's language skills and made me feel like crap for having any doubts as to the video or the girl's legitimacy. \n\nIt became such a heated discussion that there was actual tension in the air, and ultimately I apologized to them because it seemed to really make them upset. To this day I am impressed by the girl speaking 7 clear sentences on live TV and nailing it but (and maybe I'm wrong here) there's no freaking way that ANY four year old proficiently and fluently speaks ANY languages above a basic toddler level. \n\nAITA here lol?",

      "description": "Husband [32M] and I [30M] are a same sex couple, children have always been on the planning and we have both agreed early on that if we decided to have children we'd choose to adopt, more specifically adopt a slightly older kid.\n\nMy husband's sister (Emma, fake name) and her boyfriend are very problematic and will be losing custody to their 7 year old son. The reasons why are too personal to get into and not relevant now. \n\nTo avoid their son going in care and being separated from his family there have been a lot of discussions going on about who will be suitable to be the boy's legal guardian. His side of the family nominated us and my husband thinks it's a wonderful, beautiful idea. The boy is lovely but a handful and that's an understatement. He has autism and it is suspected that he has ADHD too. \n\n* Our marriage is not the most stable currently. \n\n* We work long hours, especially my husband works a very stressful job, fitting a child into that will be difficult and unfair. * The boy's school is very far away. \n* I suffer from depression and take medications for that and right now I don't feel I have the motivation or ability to take care of another person, let alone myself. \n\nI also feel the child deserves someone far more equipped and with more parental knowledge. I don't deal well with stress. \n\nThe other alternative is his other sister Lauren who has a psychology background, however she lives far away too and in a one bedroom shared flat.\n\nI don't think my husband and I are suitable to take on this role for the reasons above and I have said to him.  He flat out asked me if it's because of the autism, I confirmed that and he said I'm an \"heartless asshole\". I disagree but what like different opinions on this.

      "description": "So here’s a bit of background. I just met my dad about 4 years ago. I’m 14, and he’s trying to get custody of me. He is an alcoholic, and I’m pretty sure he is racist and homophobic. Also misogynistic. But anyways, here’s what happened.\n\nSo last month, for Thanksgiving break, my dad came to see me. We went to my boyfriend’s house for his birthday. During the day, we all went to the shooting range. Everything was good. Later, we went to my bf’s house to have a small bday party. My dad brought alcohol, but he didn’t ask if he could. He was smoking in the house after bf’s mom said he can’t. He had brought his 2 year old German Shepherd, which was fine. But he started to make his GS and my bf’s pit bulls fight. He thought it was funny. He wouldn’t leave me and bf have one second alone. Dad kept putting his arm around me, like dude fuck off. At this point, I was really pissed and embarrassed. He started to throw around the N word (bf is mixed). \n\nAround 11:00 pm, my mom showed up. Note her and dad are not in any kind of relationship, and he treats her like shit. She could tell that bf’s mom and stepdad were getting ready to just tell him to leave. Dad comes in bf’s room where me, bf, and his friend were just watching tv. He said “C’mon, it’s time to go.” We walked into the kitchen. My mom, bf, bf’s stepdad, and bf’s friend was in there. I knew my dad was drunk, and had more than just a few beers. He said again “Well, c’mon, let’s go”. I decided I would go home with my mom, since she was sober, so I said no. “What?? What did you just say??” my dad said. I said “I said NO.” He started cussing and yelling “Oh hell no, you did not just say that”. (A few years ago, my mom was in an abusive relationship, and my dad just then reminded me of the douchebag she had dated).\n\nHis yelling caused my mom to start yelling, and she was trying to calm him down. My mom and bf’s mom said that I didn’t need to be in the car with him, and told him he should head to our house. My dad tried to grab my arm, I fucking yelled and he stomped out of the house. I was shaking and crying, and my bf and his stepdad came and hugged me. He drove off. This was so fucking embarrassing, especially since it was on my bf’s birthday. \n\nWhen we got to our house, my dad was yelling and packing his things. Me and mom live with my grandma, she is the one who has custody of me. He told her that he didn’t give 2 shits if I didn’t come to his house for Christmas. He got in my face and yelled “You listen to your fucking father. Your the child, and I am the adult!” Then he drove off.\n\nThe next morning he came by and “apologized”. I told him it was ok, we are human, we all make mistakes. The next day he texted me, and said we still needed to talk(?) I called him, and he said that regardless of if he was drunk, I should have gotten in the car and listened to him. I told him that he made me feel embarrassed, and he said “Well, who provoked it?? You should have listened to your father (keep in mind he hasn’t been in my life for the majority of it; and I never see him). He brought up Christmas break, and I told him I don’t wanna come. He got pissed. I tried to tell him why, but with everything I said, he just kept questioning me and acting like a child. I finally just said I need to get ready for school tomorrow and told him I loved him and hung up. As soon as I did, he called my grandma. He started yelling, telling lies, and just being a jerk. She hung up. A few days later, he texted me. He began to put the blame on me for everything. He wasn’t taking any responsibility. \n\nSo yeah, a few other things happened, but that’s pretty much the situation. He did things like this a few times before. Sorry if I didn’t format this right or anything, thanks for reading.",

      "description": "First post ever and I’m wondering if I’m the asshole here. Nephew is 2 years shy of 13 and has been staying with my wife, of 15 years, and I for the past couple of months due to family medical issues.  Staying with us for an extended period of time is ok - sharing our bed on the daily with him is a bit much at his age in my opinion.\n\nMy wife wants him to sleep with her every night in our bed and it turns into an argument every night that it’s brought up.  I give a gentle no and she turns eventually very angry and hateful. He’s still slept in our bed 6-7 nights because of finally breaking me down after hours of arguing, him coming in after we’re asleep saying he’s scared or just can’t sleep, or I finally go sleep on the couch after my wife gets so angry she’s ready to end our relationship over me sticking to a hard “no” on him sleeping with us.  When I say angry, I mean level 10 having never seen her get this angry, angry. \n\nShe will eventually go sleep in the other room with him because he wants her to and will cry when she doesn’t and blames me for her not getting good sleep as a result. It’s not out of the ordinary for him to cry when he doesn’t get his way. Claims are that I have no compassion and I’m heartless for “making” the two of them sleep in the other room. Side note - she is welcome to sleep in our bed at any time without issue, but I’m “hurting his feelings” by telling him that he can’t sleep in our bed.\n\nAm I The Asshole here or what? It seems pretty reasonable to me to want a good night sleep without a third person crowding the bed. ",

She is now mad and calling me unreasonable for not being more open to the idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this all started with a quick conversation with my wife during the week. She advised her friend was part of a MLM for \"Rainbow\" vacuum cleaners, and needed to demo them for people. My wife volunteered us to host a demo, but said we weren't going to purchase as we were just helping her friend hit her quota for demos. I thought this was fine, and definitely didn't want a new vacuum as we just spent about $300 on a new one in November.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe host the demo, and the vacuum definitely works very well, but it is also $2,500. My wife is super caught up in getting the vacuum cleaner now, as it can help with allergies, stop asthma, etc. I say no we are not getting the vacuum cleaner, and that she put me in a bad position, since we originally had no intention of purchasing the vacuum. No I look like a jerk who doesn't want to spend money in front of my wife's friend, and my wife is mad at me for not being more open to spending the money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So this year, a new girl moved to my school, and I started crushing on her hard. Let's call her Gwen. I don't have any classes with her this semester, and I really want to find some way to hang out with her. \n\nProblem is, it seems luck isn't on my side: we don't have the same lunch, we don't have any of the same classes, and the extracurricular activities she's in are stuff I can't join, being a guy (lacrosse team, cheerleading). \n\nSo I turned to my last resort, my friend Lindsey. So, Lindsey and I have been friends since 8th grade, and she's also on the lacrosse team with and is friends with Gwen. So she seems like the perfect person to ask to set something up between me and Gwen, right?\n\nProblem is, she has a crush on me. She doesn't know that I know, but her friends have told me. I don't really feel the same way and just say he as a friend, so I pretend I don't know so things don't getawkward. \n\nAnd I didn't really want to ask her, and looked for all other options, cause I feel like it's kinda a jerk move to ask a girl who has a crush on you to set you up with her friend. But I really want to find some way to hang out with Gwen, and I don't have any other options.\n\nSo I did. I told Lindsey I like Gwen and asked her to set us up. She agreed, but I feel like kind of a jerk.\n\nAm I? ",

The problem is, we found out a while ago (before they got close) that she had sent nude pics to my friend’s friend (the two of them didn’t have any relationship). I found myself losing respect for her because of this, and since my friend got close with her I’m losing respect for him too. He said that he’d never date a girl who’d do what she did but he ended up sinking to this level anyway, and I was really disappointed in him even though it’s nothing that bad. Now I can’t see either of them in the same way and I just feel very little respect for either of them. I don’t insult, ignore or harass either of them or do anything like that, I just personally can’t respect them as people, even though that sounds really bad.",

      "description": "TLDR: I (24f) confronted my two best friends (23f, 23f) (since high school) for both being into + excessively flirting with our other best friend (23m) despite the fact that we have all been best friends for years. Am I the asshole?\n\nI have been best friends with the same friend group for over 10 years now- since high school. We are three girls and one guy. Recently our guy friend (23m) has matured and become rather attractive. We were helping him find a gf. \n\nI (24f) am in a happy and loving relationship with my bf of 3 years. One of my best friends, let’s call her X (23f) recently went through a really bad breakup, and the other, let’s call her Y (also 23f) has been in an on/off but now sort of steady relationship with her bf of 5~ years. \n\nRecently I found out during a big argument between X and Y that they are both very attracted to our mutual guy friend and were basically fighting over him. Y knew him longer and was closer to him so she felt entitled to him even though she has a boyfriend and X was single so she felt it was her right to be able to flirt with him. Considering we have all been best friends for so long I personally find it weird and kinda gross. I see him as a brother. \n\nAfter X and Y “made up” around a week later, the four of us hung out and reddit, let me tell you, I have never felt more uncomfortable with my “friends” in my life. They were blatantly flirting with him and trying to one-up each other to the point where the three of them were cuddling in MY BED. I felt like a fourth wheel.\n\nThe night eventually ended and I confronted both of them separately, telling them I’d like to spend time with them just us girls because I feel a little bit uncomfortable with our guy friend around. I told them about feeling like a fourth wheel. They seemed to take it well. \n\nFast forward to now, it has been 2 weeks since we all hung out ( we usually hang out 1-2 times a week and have a pretty active group chat) . The group chat is dead. X is in minimal contact with me and Y has pretty much dropped off the face of the earth. I’m pretty sure they are both avoiding me and think I am in the wrong about this. Am I the asshole for confronting them about this?\n\nThanks reddit. I’m genuinely confused here. ",

He’s really gotten into the idea of immersive, full dive VR and is doing a world building exercise where he’s come up with classes and spell buffs and armor and weapon stats-all that good stuff. I’ve tried engaging with him, but I might have done it all wrong. The texts are down below, you guys can see for yourselves. I’m mainly upset because he has a tendency to hyper focus on things like battle mechanics and like that; which is awesome! No game can thrive without it. But I’ve always liked games with lots of lore and backstory, I’ve been a big fantasy fan since I was little. I mentioned that I would really enjoy doing the things that he would just farm out to the AI like coming up with backstory and class conflicts and he said it was all “boring human bullshit” and he doesn’t want to do that.

      "description": "Last year I picked up a single long stem rose for my girlfriend on my way home from University on Valentines day despite me not really celebrating or endorsing the day.\n\nWe've discussed at length that I don't really care much for valentine's day (I always make sure to celebrate her birthday and our anniversary). I just think the day is more for businesses than it is for couples. I always make an effort to treat her well every other day and will often grab her small surprises if I'm coming home from work or uni like her favourite chocolate or a bubble tea. Nothing massive but little gifts that show I love her.\n\nI also don't just ignore Valentines day either - I always set the day aside for her. This year we went to breakfast and had planned to go for a picnic lunch but I had to drop my youngest sister at work for my parents who are currently taking care of my other sister who just had surgery the day before Valentines. So I asked to move our picnic to the evening/dusk, she loves sunsets and it'll be a little cooler than mid day in summer in the park. I thought it would be fine however she is complaining a bit about how it is interfering with the day.\n\nI bought her a rose last year but the previous one I did not, instead opting for a special day/night that ended with us hand making Gnocchi and eating it by candle light. Last year we did something similar so I wanted to change things up this year with the picnic. \n\nOn top of all this I recently started a new job and my PhD which is draining a lot of my time and energy - I've communicated this to my girlfriend but I find myself a bit frustrated still. I come home in the evenings and do my best to spend that time with her, I'll help make dinner or make it and I'll wash up, then we'll chill on the bed and chat for an hour, usually more, about the day and other things. I feel as though I'm not really getting down time between these things (I appreciate some time to chill out and play a couple hours of video games or watch some Netflix to unwind). I don't have a great deal of energy for Valentine's day but took the time off my PhD to spend the time with my girlfriend because I love her and thought she would appreciate it. \n\nDespite this she has been somewhat passive aggressive in the way we've discussed me not getting her flowers. We went to the store earlier to buy some food for the picnic and I tried to pick her up a nice rose from a florist she likes but she insisted I not do that. There have been tears today from her but she won't tell me what exactly has upset her so much. \n\nAnd after all this I still feel guilty as fuck. I feel as though I am a good partner, better than many, I always make an effort to make my girlfriend feel loved, I just don't really like Valentines day. Yet,. I still feel like shit. So reddit, am I the ass hole?\n\nPs. Sorry for the formatting  I'm on mobile.",

      "description": "My parents have been pushing me to learn a new language faster which is beneficial for me and yes I have been doing my best to learn and practice with other speakers. All in all I'm happy to be picking it up. The problem arises when nearly every other day I get a \"Have you been talking to your local friends more?\" \"You should speak more X language\" \"Why won't you speak X more with us?\" They've done this before with many other recurring questions which honestly makes me feel like I'm a child that has to be reminded constantly of something even though I'm 20.  \n\n\nThe answer is always the same \"Yes.\" Because I have and I know I'm doing my best. But it's been going on for so damn long (technically my whole life but more so in the past 2 years) and I fuelled by building annoyance and hormones I snapped and told them to \"get off my back for 2 damn seconds\". My dad responded by saying that I shouldn't be mad because they're just asking out of concern and that if someone is asking out of concern, you shouldn't get mad at them. In a way I get that, and I'm feeling kinda assholeish for going off on him like that, but at the same time I've already told him that constantly asking me the same question makes me super annoyed which he responds with \"well you shouldn't\". I'm now more mad about how he won't just respect my wishes and not ask me every other day and can't tell if I'm just being a hormonal bitch, or my dad is really just being a mosquito about it.  \n\n\nNot exactly related to whether I'm the asshole but my relationship with my parents ain't good to begin with, mainly cause my mom is a narc and my dad is an enabler so trust and respect on my side is basically not there anymore, which may have influenced why I've been more impatient with them. Also I happen to be on my period so quite literally hormonal and in pain so I don't trust my own judgement too much here.",

      "description": "TL; DR at the bottom.\n\nSo a little backstory, I'm a DJ. I produce music both for myself and others, and I also do live shows. Usually I charge between $150-250 a show. There is a house of guys across the street from where I live, so whenever they throw a party, I DJ. I've done around five shows, but since these guys are my friends, I haven't been charging them. At the last party, I did my thing for a couple hours then went home early. I left my gear there so the people still there could listen to music. I know it's a stupid idea, but I had done it for all the parties before this one and there had never been any porblem. This time, I came back the next day and there was alcohol spilled all over my MacBook pro, my speakers, and my turn tables. My MacBook is completely toast, and my turn tables are extremely sticky. I brought up the mac to the guys and it turns out none of the guys saw what happened, so they agreed to split the cost and pay for it. Today I found out they planed on having me pay for part of it, to which I responded by saying that it wasn't my fault that my equipment was broken. I feel like they should be responsible, because I had asked them to not let anyone touch my stuff, but I also feel like I share a little bit of the blame for leaving my stuff there. Am I the asshole for asking them to pay for the computer?\n\nTL;DR: Mac broke at house party. No one knows who broke it, so I'm asking the hosts to pay for it. They've asked me to pay for part, but I feel like they should cover it all. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm gonna get right into it, basically, a few years ago, I dated this girl. We dated for about 3 months before she broke up with me because she had to move away to another state. We stayed friends, and occasionally we would Skype. About 4 years after we broke up, I met a girl. She was funny, she was smart, just about everything I wanted in a girl. We only ever talked on Snapchat because she lived in the state that my ex lived in. One day, I decided to go down to her house and surprise her for her birthday. When I got there, I knocked on the door, flowers and chocolates in hand, and it felt like a teen movie. She invited me in, and I sat down on the couch. Then I noticed something. She had framed photos of her and my ex. I thought it was weird, so when she came back from the bathroom, I asked her who the other girl was. She said, and I quote, 'Oh, that's my best friend blankity blank, we've known each other since primary school. I felt this sinking feeling in my gut. I said to her, 'Oh, we used to date!'. Me being the idiot I am, I didn't realise how stupid it was to say that. Her face fell, and she asked me to repeat myself. I said it again in a more confused tone. She said that I should have told her that I dated her, and we got in a fight about how I didn't know they were friends, and I didn't know I was supposed to tell her every girl I've ever been with. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "This is a very long story, but I tried my best to make it as short as possible! Also, English is not my first language, so this will have a lot of grammar mistakes...\n\nEmma: The girl who we don't want to be friends with anymore\n\nSo 9 years ago Emma, me and my twin became kinda friends since we were classmates. We only talked a little, but I would say that she was our friend.\n\nA couple of years from that, my twin, Emma and two more girls became close and began to hang out together. They would play together (they were on 4th grade) and do all kinds of fun stuff. Anyways, I started noticing that sometimes Emma would hit my twin's head and my twin would come home with bloody head(bc the headband she was wearing had little spikes). I thought it was odd that friend would do that but I ignored it.  A year later, Emma's mom and sister passed away(cancer) so the whole class gave her loads of support. We did everything for her and she didn't do anything in school(example: when teacher asked her to read, she just said no and didn't even look). Well we all understood since she was in a lot of emotional pain. A couple of months later Emma and the two other girls would discriminate against my twin to the point where they didn't talk at all. They would also sometimes call her names and such.\n\nWell, a few months later, the two other girls just disappeared (didn't want to be friends with her) and somehow we(my twin, me and Emma) became \"best friends\". She then began to act super weirdly. She would ask constantly about where we were, at what time we would arrive, if we were late she asked if we were dead and stuff like that. Emma would grab our bag or our hoods when we were walking which made us VERY uncomfortable (we do not like to be touched at all!) but since we are super shy, we didn't say a thing. Emma started commanding us to do basic stuff for her, like take her keys or water bottle from her bag or make us bring her school papers from the front of the class. Things escalated quite a bit, and she began to talk about her 'kill list', some torturing devices she designed, self harm and her suicidal thoughts. Things that we didn't want to hear. We became even more quiet, to the point where we didn't sometimes want to answer her stuff(like when she judges people's appearance). She then started hitting my twin when we didn't answer.\n\nWe decided to tell our guidance counselor about that and she came to the conclusion that making a child welfare report would be the best. She did it and we thought \"okay great, now she gets help, everything will become normal now!\" Well, she sent us a super long text about how unfair and meant we were and that she would be okay if we took a break from the friendship, which we agreed to but we didn't want to start argue so we didn't deny the statements she made about us .\n\nWe had made some mutual friends from our dance crew and we thought that this \"thing\" that happened wouldn't affect the friendships. Well, Emma was fast to tell them that we were bullies and we \"reported her to the authorities\" and we made things up. So she took our \"good\" friends, at least we thought they were, and now we have only each other. The \"friends\" attacked us on social  media media saying \"how could you  do this to someone whos mom and sister are dead???\" and stuff like that.. And since I'm super shy and stuff, I feel super guilty about this whole situation. AITA?\n\nTl;dr: Me and my twin told our guidance counselor about our friend's kill list and she called us bullies and liars and we lost our friends because of that.\n\nAgain, English is not my first language, so I am terribly sorry for all the mistakes!",

I looked over at one of the other pumps nearby, and there's an older lady there, sitting in the car with her door open. I'm sure she could smell my rank air pollution.\n\nI definitely didn't want to pass gas inside my car, since my wife and kids were in there. And I always figure that the gas station already smells pretty bad, with all of the gasoline fumes wafting about. But, of course my contribution to the stench was totally different, and would probably catch you off guard. I just didn't expect to see someone chilling with their car door open.\n\nShe promptly closed her door, didn't say anything or do anything to make me feel like she was upset, so this story isn't anything, but I figured I'd still post since it might be fun to hear some opini\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So to preface this, my GFs been going through some stuff, as a while ago she was in an abusive relationship and will be going to trials against him, etc. \n\nWe've been together since the beginning of last November, and at first things were great, but we've had problems since last February/March, and haven't had sex since then. It causes problems, and more importantly I've distanced myself recently due to feeling like she was uninterested, as she rarely wants to hang out with me, primarily when it's anywhere private, and has shown no interest in sex and blocked my attempts/requests.\n\nTonight she confessed she thought I was cheating on her, and we got into a long talk about it, where she said she was not in a state where she'd be ready or willing to have sex, and that she'd understand if I didn't want to be with her because of it, and she felt that she couldn't be what I wanted to be.\n\nOf course I understand her situation and for this long have been supportive of her and never pushed her too hard on having sex, nor have I insulted her for it, but I find myself more upset and frustrated at the growing length of no sexual interest on her part.\n\nI've even had feelings of anger that maybe she's uninterested in me and cheating on the side, considering the amount of excuses as to why she never wanted to go out places or be somewhere private. For the moment I need to decide if I really want to stick through it for a possibly indefinite amount of time until she's comfortable with having sex. I'm unsure of at what point it'd be considered unreasonable to wait any longer.\n\nMy question is, is it wrong to be upset with a partner if they are unwilling to have sex, even for (obviously) justifiable reasons?",

      "description": "Basically, I know I'm an asshole for betraying his trust in the first place by telling one person. I feel really bad about it already, but I wanted to know if I would be the asshole if I didn't tell him that the one person I told went and told three of his friends. Here's the context to the story: \n\nI was fighting with this best friend, and my boyfriend (at the time, who is now an ex) asked me what was wrong. The problem my best friend and I had couldn't be explained without his sexuality as a context, so I made my boyfriend promise not to tell anyone and that this was really important and could ruin his life if it got out (his parents are very homophobic and threatened to kick him out of the house). Anyways, my boyfriend assured me that he wouldn't tell anyone, so I trusted him and told him the story. He was the first person I told about my best friend, and I felt guilty but assured myself he would keep it under wraps like what he promised. \n\nFlash forward a few months later, I break up with him because I don't think it's going to work. Anyways, I find out today from his friend that he told three of his friends (including the friend who told me) about my best friend. His friend says they've known for four months now, and says they have pretty much forgotten about it and don't plan to tell anyone. Now I'm not sure if that can be trusted, considering my trust was violated the first time. His friend says that if I tell my best friend about this, it would cause unnecessary drama for everyone. He says his friends would automatically know it was him who told me and would be mad at him and lose their trust in him. He's trying to tell me that I shouldn't tell my best friend about this because a.) his friendship is on the line and b.) it would restart drama that was already forgotten. \n\nI am conflicted because on one hand, my best friend has a right to know that others know about him. It is his secret after all, and it is my fault for telling my ex-boyfriend in the first place. If he gets mad at me, then I should take it because I deserve it. On the other hand, I'm afraid telling him would make my ex's friend who told me mad and that he would have to go through the drama with his friends for \"betraying their trust\" and telling me. \n\nSo WIBTA if I didn't tell my best friend about this? \n\nTLDR; I was fighting with my best friend who is gay at the time, and my then boyfriend (now ex) asked me what was wrong. The problem we were fighting about couldn't be explained without my best friend's sexuality in context, so I told my boyfriend and made him promise not to tell anyone. He tells three of his friends once I break up with him. \n",

      "description": "My (17f) mother constantly makes fun of me in terms of how I look ever since I was a small kid, for example \"You are getting so fat.\", \"Your eyes are so small.\", and \"Your skin looks so dark.\" etc. (I am asian but she has big eyes and lighter skin) I would get a bit upset but she will just laugh and thinks it's very funny. When I was 9 I wanted to start playing piano so she arranged lessons for me, but after it got more serious she wasn't that supportive so I was practicing on my own. She wouldn't be that willing to take me to competitions and to concerts in which I had to play in. However I would get angry when she asks if she could not come so I would drag her with me. When she gets there she wouldn't pay attention to the music because classical music is pretty boring to some people so she ends up scrolling on her phone. I would feel pretty hurt but at least she still took me to the venue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe often makes judgements against people when we are out such as \"Her stomach is hanging out how gross is that\", \"How could she wear that out\" and this includes many racist remarks against black people, the muslim community and anyone who don't identify as straight. When I speak out about this she would get angry at me and say how she is only saying all this because we are close and I am her daughter and that I need to stop being fake being a \"good\" person. I was clinically diagnosed with major depression and anxiety around January 2018 and she was pretty devastated. She does not know anything about mental health and a year leading up to 2017 I became very agitated and would refuse to talk to her so she would say even more mean things like I am a curse and a demon etc. My self esteem and confidence were at a new low and I couldn't get out of bed in the morning in which she will resort to violence. This has always been the case since I was young and crying wasn't allowed as she found it obnoxious so she would threaten me with more violence if I continued. I started playing games extensively around September 2016 and couldn't care for anything else. So she ended up taking away my gaming things which later she would destroy as I no longer felt safe in the house and ended up going to Centrelink to ask for youth allowance for people aged under 18 and wants to move out. When she knew I tried to leave she beat the crap out of me, ripped apart my monitor and tossed the whole PC into the bin. Though later she replaced them.\n\nI do admit she had always been very generous with paying for my expenses though she would always complain how I am a waste of money, and what a failure I am. I received a scholarship to my school because I had good grades but as my mental health deteriorated my grades dropped as well. Though she just ended up becoming more angry because I played more games instead of studying. All the constant comparing with my friends and other people, purposely scolding me when other people are present. I feel scared when I see her as she always end up lecturing me about something and just more scolding. She says I am ashamed of her because we aren't as rich as some of my friends and that she can't speak english as well. When I tell her how nice and understanding my friend's mother had been she became very defensive and said if I thought she was so nice then I should just go live with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDad has never really played a role in educating me as he is not good with words and parents have constantly fighting about money and divorce. She had just handed in forms for divorce a week ago to the court. I just think I have lost lots of respect for my mother as she always had been manipulative and would threaten me to do things, she made me feel like a failure, a sub-human and someone who is not deserving of anything. I have tried to talk to her about this several times but every time she just ends up being defensive and would get angry at me for being ungrateful. AITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway because my brother reddits. A couple months ago my little sister (16) came home from school with a brand new pair of AirPods. She said one of her friends gave them to her for free because he had an extra pair, and felt bad that she didn't have a pair (she is allowed to listen to music in school as a special accommodation). I thought it was weird that someone would just give her $150 headphones on a whim, but she said his family was rich. I've asked my parents if they believe her story several times since then, and every time they just say to drop it and move on.\n\n2 days ago she came home from school again with an iPad that she said a different friend gave to her for free. She said that her friend bought a new iPad, and didn't need this older one. Even though the iPad isn't new, I looked it up and  it's worth at least $250. My parents are complicit, saying that she's lucky for having rich friends. I was skeptical after the headphones, but I can't imagine any reason why two of her friends would give her very expensive gifts for no reason - it wasn't her birthday, etc.\n\nThis morning I called her out and said I didn't believe her. I basically asked her if her friends parents knew their kids were giving their stuff away for free, and if we could contact them to confirm that. She got pretty defensive, saying she shouldn't have to and we should believe her, and then locked herself in her room. I talked with my mom after, and told her I suspected that either the electronics stolen, or she was stealing money from my parents pay for them. She told me to drop it, though she has noticed money missing from her purse over the last few months. My sister had never worked, which is understandable as she's only 16, but that means she has no money.\n\nAITA? I know I'm not her parent and that I'm not in charge of her, but I'm not sure why they aren't taking this more seriously. ",

      "description": "Ok - long story short: in October, I made a friend at work with whom I became infatuated. She is married and there is no possibility of anything happening between us, but that didn't stop me from swooning over her every text message. I did not tell her about these feelings or make any kind of advance since I had no real expectation of being with her, so for the past few months we've been  talking regularly and hanging out on occasion as friends. No big deal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to 2 weeks ago. I had finally come to terms with the fact that this has become a very unhealthy situation for me, and I probably need some time and space from it. I wanted to tell her this in person, but I did not have the courage to look her in the eye and  a) confess my feelings, and b) tell her I need to back away for a bit. So I sent her a text explaining that I'd caught feelings, it had become unhealthy, and I thought she deserved a friend who was in it for the right reasons. So I'd need to back away for a bit. She was gracious, if cold, in her reply: she said she'd had no idea about my feelings, that she hopes she didn't do anything to make them worse, and that she respects my decision. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe haven't spoken much at all since then, and I have gone well out of my way to avoid her at work because I do NOT want to make her feel creeped on or uncomfortable. Any contact we have had has been muted and pretty cold from her end. But, in the time since I sent her the feelings text, I've realized that the way I wrote it likely implied that I only ever became friends with her because I want her. SO, I've spent the day drafting a letter explaining carefully that our friendship - the ACTUAL friendship we'd built over the past months - was not part of some long-term agenda to be with her, and that my feelings are incidental to the friendship. I can't stand her thinking that our whole friendship was a lie, and I've already told her that my hope is for us to be close again someday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or WIBTA for reaching out to make her to understand that I didn't have bad intentions? Have I forfeited my right to try and explain myself to my friend? ",

Every year I am confronted with dozens of adults who join us for extended weekends on our houseboat, with our children and their children.  It's hot, I mean it.  103 - 110 degrees.  Adults drink, kids see it, adults do funny things, kids see it. Adults lose their tempers or get agitated, kids see it.  Lots of food, lots of water skiing, fishing, tubing, all is well.  I mean these guys are firefighters.  Doesn't that make it okay?  AITA for thinking its not okay?  Oh and my DH is the ringleader and I am put down, told I am the \"funsucker\", over ruled, made to feel uncomfortable and generally the loner.  And yes, I have no power to stop this.  AITA?  Oh yes, they are drunk.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery year my DH has his friends over for Halloween trick or treating. They drink yet again, walk around with a beer, or a strong cocktail, even get drunk.  I have voiced my opinion, \"This is a kids holiday,  let the kids enjoy it without alcohol being present.  Adults can do adult things when it's not a kids holiday\"   The result of my opinion is that annually I am made fun of, \"remember how mad you were? hahahah\"  I'm still mad.  It really ticks me off.  I find ways and excuses to separate my own children from my very own house on halloween.  My husband again, a very gracious host.  Yes, some of them get drunk.  AITA?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple times a week my DH has a drink before bedtime, he gets a buzz. He's funny to the kids but it's not funny to me.

Eventually I decide I've had enough and I go up to her and tell her I'll whisper it in her ear.\n\n(At this point I find it relevant to mention that I'm also a girl, since I don't think this would be appropriate for a guy to do to a girl or vice versa since it's a bit of a personal space thing IG??)\n\n\nInstead, I blow lightly in her ear. She shrieks and freaks TF out, which is normal, but then she yelled that I spit in her ear and that it's wet. However, I'm pretty damn sure I didn't spit, and that it was just the cold that made her think that.\n\nEither way, a bunch of kids in my class were like \"ew, why would you spit in her ear\" even though I didn't.\n\nI feel bad that I might've spit. Even though I don't think I did I at least acknowledge that possibility, but I don't think she needed to shriek and make such a big deal out of it like I harassed her or something, especially when she was the one harassing me about the theme in the first place.\n\nSo, AITA for possibly spitting in her ear?\n\nOr is she possibly TA for harassing me and making a big deal out of the ear blowing thing?",

      "description": "Throwaway account for privacy reasons.\n\nMy husband and I were cleaning the house for a delivery that was to be made this week. I was cleaning under a bookshelf when I pulled out a piece of paper. It clearly wasn’t mine, but was what looked like a medical results page for an exam of some sort. Radiology, I saw on the header. My husband snatched it out of my hand, made a joke about how long it’s been since we’ve cleaned under there, and promptly threw it away. I asked what it was, he said it was none of my business because it’s his medical information. We’ve both taken classes on information security and are aware of HIPAA regulations, patient privacy, etc., but I was still taken a little aback at that. \n\nI don’t have many medical issues, but am open with him when something comes up. He’s prior military and has had some problems in his knees, back, elbow, joints, etc., and is a little heavyset but not concerningly so. He’s been fairly active around the house, so I hadn’t thought anything was wrong, but his abrupt reaction was a little out of character for him. I know he’d probably be concerned about worrying me if something were wrong (I am guilty of being a worrier, I have to confess), but I’d like to think he’d be open with me in return if something were seriously wrong. At the same time, it’s been bugging me since the incident happened, both his reaction and the paper itself. He can be a stubborn asshole (affectionately) sometimes, and I’m afraid if I push he’ll just double down on the secret.\n\nSo, I turn to you for judgment. WIBTA if I push him for details about the document he threw away?\n",

      "description": "A bit of backstory; me and my GF have been together for 3 years and a year ago we found out she was pregnant. I'll admit at the beginning I was not supportive, its my biggest regret. I did a 180 when she was about 4 months along and since he was born he is the best thing in my world. My GF and her sister have always been close, they tell each other everything. Her sister has always been a bit off, thinks she's never in the wrong EVER and the entire world is against her. \n\nAbout a month ago, when my son was 4 weeks old, she was angry that her Mom was not giving her enough attention (she bought herself a puppy a few weeks before my son came along. The puppy is a nightmare, and she doesn't discipline it or even take care of it). Since she was not getting attention from her mom she got her puppy and started saying \"Look at the baby. Who's a good baby?\" To the dog and brought him over to my son. The puppy is feisty and squirmed almost scratching my son in his grandmothers arms. I got mad and took my son into my GF's room (we've been staying with her mom since they live far away). When I walked out of the room she called my son a dumb baby and said he was ugly. She came into the room later and told me to give her the baby, I told her no. My GF agreed I did the right thing, but her sister decided I hate her and is taking it out on her mom. She screams at her mom constantly about nothing and told her mom that no one can drive her mom's car (we have been borrowing it while we are here to get around) not even her mom can drive it only her and she will drop her mom at work and keep the keys during the day. \n\nAfter a month of her screaming and saying everyone is ruining her life she decided that her dog is more important than her nephew. Her brother was playing with her dog, which she didnt like, he was rubbing its belly while she screamed \"STOP RAPPING MY DOG!!! IM CALLING THE POLICE IF YOU DON'T STOP NOW!!! WHY DONT YOU GO AND TOUCH (GF'S NAME)'S SON'S DICK INSTEAD!!!\". My GF had to stop me from confronting her because I was livid. I decided then that she would not see my son until she got right. \n\nLast night we were at our friends house, we are a few days from flying back home. She texts my GF angry because her brother told her I dont like her. She started saying some really fucked up things to my GF about her, my son, and me. My GF told me what she was saying and showed me the texts. She told my GF that I dont love my son because when we first found out I wanted to abort. I regret thinking it everyday, he is the best thing and I dont know what I would do without him anymore. I snapped and called her some really bad things to my GF and almost cried because it hurt that bad. I have now refused to let her come visit us and told my GF she should stop talking to her. \n\nTL;DR: FSIL acts fucked up around my new son, I get angry.",

      "description": "You know how some people in wheelchairs are lovely people who go out of their way to help others and rise above their disability? Well this girl in our class wasn’t. She was a petty nasty bully. So one afternoon my friend told me his plan for getting revenge. He had a common but strong padlock and while the girl wasn’t noticing he hooked it to her wheelchair and hooked that to a table. Then when everyone else left after the break the padlock held her fast. This causes considerable embarrassment and a lot of drama for her as she couldn’t ultimately get free. It took the school janitor to ultimately remove the padlock. I provided my friend with an alibi which he never needed. Years later the girl in question has become far nicer but we will never tell anyone the secret least of all her. Looking back I regret it but she needed someone to teach her humility.",

It freaked me out, and I thought he might hurt me.\n\nHe constantly ask me on dates, though he knows I don’t have the money or a job, so I had to pester my parents for money they didn’t need to spend. He says he hates to lie to his parents, yet he made me lie to mine every time we went on a date. He once told me to, because I “do it every time”\n\nHe told me that if anyone outed him, you’d cry. And I sad it to. Yet, when someone caught us kissing (which I don’t like to do in public), he told me it wasn’t a big deal,  I shouldn’t be nervous, and didn’t even care.\n\nHe tells me I’m dumb. He tells me I’m smart, then says something like “I take back what I said”. If I try to defend myself, he laughs and says no. I never call him stupid or anything close. It’s a really mean thing to do to someone, especially to someone you are dating.\n\nHe pushed that I did something against my morals, which I didn’t . You were rude about it too.\n\nAll he wants to do on dates is kiss, we can’t even have a conversation.\n\nHe over compliments me. \n\nWhen we went on a trip, he kept trying to kiss or cuddle me in the hotel room even though I was obviously nervous and uncomfortable. I didn’t want our roommates to see us but he didn’t care because “everyone already knew”. Only stopped after I explicitly told him to. \n\nHe takes joking to another level, and  picks up and drags [x] around, despite [x] saying no.\n\nHe threatens people if they say anything remotely threatening, even as a joke.\n\nHe hurt my hand and didn’t care until he found out I was mad. And after anything happens between us, he immediately wants to jump right back in to a normal relationship.\n\nHe wants me to like everything he does, yet doesn’t care about what I like, then gets upset and puts himself first.\n\nHe tried to shame me in front of our friends. He said that I don’t spend enough time with you, and I hadn’t done it for three weeks once. He knew we spent 16 hours on a bus and shared a room for 2 days, twice. One  time, I couldn’t relax because he kept asking if I was okay if I even moved. The other, he told me I did something I would never do to anyone.\n\n(I want to break up with him, but I feel like shit for thinking about it.)",

As the day went on I’m no less angry about what she said to me, but I’m also feeling a guilt bubbling in my stomach about getting her in trouble. \n\nI’ve known this woman for a long time, I was the one that on boarded her when she joined the company and even though we have very different views (she’s an outspoken Trump supporter and Christian and I’m about as liberal as they come), we have always had a good working relationship. Whenever she shares on Facebook things from right wing media about “evil immigrants” or building the wall I’ve just made a point of ignoring it, since she is just a colleague and I’ve never felt it’s my place to challenge her views. \n\nLast week I finally received my 10 year green card in the mail, after 5 years of extensions and endless legal hoops and thousands of dollars in fees. This is a huge milestone for me, and my family, friends and coworkers have all made a point of congratulating me and overall making the whole thing feel really special. \n\n Earlier today I was at work, having a casual conversation with a (different) coworker when she approached, gave me a high five, and congratulated me on my green card finally being accepted. She then proceeded to say “Thank you for doing it the *right* way”. It was pretty clear that the whole reason she had interjected was to say this. To make sure to let me know that I was a “good” immigrant, and not one of those nasty “illegals” she goes on about on Facebook.\n\nI felt so angry about it that I decided to take it to HR. There have been many times at work that coworkers have said things that are stupid, like referring to me as a “90 day fiancé” or making up nicknames for me because my name is “unreasonably difficult”, but this is the first time I have ever felt like there was actually prejudice behind it. \n\nA part of me feels absolutely justified reporting her and another part of me feels like a huge asshole that got her into trouble. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not going to my grandmas birthday dinner because of my social anxiety and depression?",
      "description": "A little backstory: my mom has been married to her wife for about 7 years. And my stepmom has been one of the biggest causes of my anxiety and depression for years. She throws a tantrum whenever she doesnt get her way, so we have to do whatever to please her. \n\n\n\nSo last night my family (Mom, step-mom, sister, grandma, uncle) were going to go out to teppanyaki to celebrate my grandmas 85th birthday. I had planned on going until I was hit with a wave of depression about an hour before. There was no way I was going to go, not only because of the way I was feeling, but because I didnt want to be that one person at the table looking all mopey and upset, while not eating. \n\nI then texted my mom \"is it okay if I don't go to teppanyaki tonight?\" she came into my room about 3 minutes later asking me why, and so I explained everything. She then said I should talk to my stepmom about it because we were celebrating her mom. I declined because talking to her would increase my anxiety, which would decrease my confidence. \n\nShe comes back after about 5 minutes and says \"shes real adamant about you going.\" and then says she hates being the middle man, so I tell her I can talk to my stepmom face to face to explain. \n\nI go to their room and explain to her how I hate eating out because of my social anxiety, and teppanyaki makes it about x10 worse, And how I was feeling depressed. Mind you I’m being polite trying to explain, with no rudeness whatsoever. And she says “you’re gonna go.” And I just shrug and say “I’m sorry but I cant.” She then says that it was disappointing and to “get out of my room”. \n\nNow I’m back in my room and my mom comes in and says that it’s a family thing and that I need to go. I then tell her how fucked up it is making someone with these mental issues, go against their will. And she says fuck it and storms out. \n\nI leave and go to my girlfriends house so I don’t have to deal with their anger and stay the night. My mom texts me and says I should stay with my gf for the week to avoid any heat from my stepmom. And I’m pretty okay with that. \n\nMy mom then texts me that I should bring my grandma flowers in the morning so she doesnt have to “suffer” as well. So I bring them the next day (today). But before I bring them my mom sends me a novel of texts saying things along the line of “we’re your family, shes done so many things for you, you basically said go fuck yourself”, and many other things. \n\nSo I respond asking her If she would make me go if I had a physical injury, how I never said anything close to go fuck yourself, and how I always have to say yes to everything she asks and that I said no this time and she threw a tantrum as always, and how of she would consider my meth-head dad part of the family. \n\nAnd she responded with\n\n “Please dont lecture me about mental health.  Or bring your shitty father in to this when we are talking about someone who actually gives a shit about your well being. No, he is not my family. Your sanctimonious and psuedo rebellious response shows you don't want any input but from those who agree with your behavior. Please bring grandma her birthday  flowers today and plan on being here Wednesday night for Thanksgiving. I love you always.”\n\nSo it seems to me that she doesnt really care how I feel by writing off my valid points as “sanctimonious and pseudo rebellious”\n\nSo help me out here Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\n",

Me and this friend hit it off really well, we had a lot in common and if we met under different circumstances I think I would’ve went for her. However, 2 months go by and I decide to confess to Lily, I get the usual rejection phrases, it’s not you it’s me, I want to focus on school etc. I can’t say I wasn’t expecting this response. This is where things get complicated, me and Lily never had any classes together but me and her best friend did. We even sat together one of them. I know for a fact she knows me and my confession but she never brought it up. I was still getting over Lily at this time and I think part of the reason I fell for her best friend is because I was looking for someone to fill in the empty space in my heart. I don’t know whether these feelings are real or not but I can’t stop myself from trying to start a relationship with      her. We’ve hung out a few times alone and she’s kind of my go to person atm she also doesn’t seem to mind my company. My main concern is that I might seem like I’m just leading her on. So AITA?",

      "description": "This happened a couple days ago. Also on mobile so excuse the formatting mess. So me and a couple friends of mine are looking to get into a pro wrestling school around where I am, but we come to the realization after sitting in on a class and talking to the trainers that our cardio is “worse than Hogan’s in that sex tape”, according to one of the trainers. So lately we’ve all been making a point to hit the gym and go to the Y and get some swimming and basketball games in. It’s been helping a lot, and on this particular day, it made us really hungry after working out all day (and I do mean all day, about 10 to 12 hours). So we decide we’ve earned a trip to the buffet. \n\n\nMe personally, I don’t normally eat that much, even after going at it all day. The two guys I’m going with though can put away food like it’s nobody’s business. I guess on this day we were prepared to test how far that “all you can eat” motto goes. \n\n\nWe get to the restaurant and the place is packed. It’s the weekend and I guess everyone else is hungry too. While we wait for a table to clear up, another guy approached us and asked us if we were interested in splitting up a table if one opened up. Now usually I wouldn’t mind and I don’t think my friends would either, but two things stopped us from splitting with this guy. One, the dude straight reeks. We had all toweled off at the gym and we weren’t that pleasant ourselves but this guy was just plain offensive. Also, the wrestling school we’re all trying to get in to isn’t really popular in the area since they turn down people all the time and most everyone in the area thinks that wrestling is for hillbillies anyway, which is bad for three guys that want to be wrestlers talking to a stranger. So I politely tell the guy we were meeting up with someone and couldn’t split a table. \n\n\nAfter about 15 minutes of waiting we get seated and storm the food area. We sit down and enjoy the food and get to talking about some of the stuff going on at work and what happened on SmackDown and all that good stuff. About 30 or 35 minutes pass and this cycle continues. Until a manager of the restaurant comes up to the table and asks us to leave. Naturally, my friend asks why and the manager tells us that we need to leave because we’ve all been to the buffet 19 times between the three of us and we were rude to the guy in the lobby and caused even more of a crunch for them. I might have been to the buffet three times myself, but even with the other two guys I was with, 19 times sounded really excessive. And, I know sometimes people lie on the internet, but I was actually being polite when I told the guy in the lobby we wouldn’t sit with him. \n\n\nI tell the manager this and my friends throw in some protests of their own, but the manager stands firm and says we needed to leave and we weren’t welcome back as long as he was working there. At this point, I had had enough of this guy making stuff up and getting onto us for it, so I just tell him we weren’t leaving unless he gets the police to take us out. I tell the guy that it is “all you can eat” after all so it doesn’t matter how much food we’ve had and if he didn’t like it, he was just going to have to deal with it. \n\n\nThe manager says he’ll call the police and he’d be back. We figure out that even though the manager is just being a certified prick, we’re not really hungry after the encounter and really don’t need the trouble since the gym in the county jail probably isn’t up to par, and we leave. \n\n\nSo AITA for refusing to leave or by telling the guy in the lobby we wouldn’t sit with him? I feel justified by everything but a second opinion couldn’t hurt. ",

Celiac diagnosed last year when it'd gotten so bad I threw up every time I ate, was bedridden. I eat even a breadcrumb now, I basically have 3 days food poisoning\n\nCharacters:\nMe: Mom in car wreck last June, got brain damage, needed live-in caretaker. Dad asked if I could delay job-hunting to do it, cheaper to keep covering me than hiring full-time nurse. I agreed, wanted to help, they helped me for so long\n\n(F)Fiance:Been together~13 years, has aspergers\n\n(FBF)Fiance's Best Friend:Met him 8 years ago as I deteriorated, became unemployed. He has OCD, copes by smoking weed(it does help). He's been very supportive of F through it all, while accusing me of being a lazy dead beat &amp; source of F's stress. In last year (after treatment), said he sees me improving and doesn't feel that way about me as much anymore, but time will tell\n\nBackstory: \nF and I struggled for years not being able to afford to live on our own, managed by renting from friends. Most recent one is a messy hoarder, verbally abusive. F and FBF have been renting from him since July, eager to save up enough for deposit on apartment\n\nMom finished most therapy in March, still can't drive. I now have time for a 25-30 hr/week schedule\n\nI did legwork to find apartment. F&amp;FBF want it ASAP, I'll not have had a job long enough to submit 2 paystubs to be on lease. F&amp;I can't afford 1-bedroom, we have to get 2-bedroom together with FBF\n\nFBF, F&amp;I discuss apartment desires. F doesn't care, wants roof over head, we can figure out what we want. I want no smoking weed in the main areas of apartment, as it's my furniture (couch, rugs, table, dining chairs). FBF disagrees, he wants his own place where he can live as himself, doesn't need my furniture, only needs his beanbags, tv, coffee table. Fine, can he get an air purifier? No, if it bothers me, I should get one. Ok, Fine\n\nOne parking spot per apartment, others have to walk from guest parking. FBF claims dibs since he's paying 40% of rent, F&amp;I are splitting 60% for master. Fine\n\nI want veggie garden on patio to do cooking for apartment. Some disagreements, but resolved. I'm happy, FBF feels magnanimous\n\nISSUE:\nEveryone always eats at coffee table, kitchen is tiny, I'd like to claim tiny breakfast nook as a GF place, do all food prep at my table. Can't risk getting sick if I'm responsible for rent and utilities too. He doesn't want to be restricted from using a table in his apartment. I tell him it shouldn't be an issue, since I'll be making a lot of meals, which will be GF\n\n\"Yeah, I don't want to just eat that, I want pizza and stuff.\" That's fine, just don't put it on the table. FBF disagrees\n\nF says we can just put down a tablecloth that I remove to use the table. I say tablecloths are porous enough for flour to get through. I just don't want to risk getting sick. FBF asks if this is \"really the hill I want to die on?\" Yes.\n\nAITA?",

No one else seemed interested so over several hours on the first day I put together a couple hundred pieces by myself. The next day I got up early and continued on, getting to to about 2/3-3/4 done. \n\nUp to that point the other members of the household hadn’t really looked at it. They’d maybe put a piece in if it was easy while they were waiting for dinner or whatever but nothing major. \n\nOn the second day, when it was around the 75% mark, I had to go and pick up a friend from the airport. I was gone for a couple of hours and when I came back, the puzzle had been finished - except for a single piece that had been left for me. \n\nAm I the asshole for getting upset about this? Finishing a puzzle is always the best part and I had spent so long getting it up to the point where I’d left it. \n\nMy partner didn’t understand and out of anger, he pulled a section out of the middle so I could go back and finish it.

      "description": " \n\nSorry for the Jeremy Kyle style title but I really didn't know how else to put it. Also sorry if the format is bad I'm on mobile\n\nBackground info: my dad has never been around much. He was until I was 6 but then he got a new wife and a new kid (F) and I basically saw him once a month, then once every few months.\n\n I had a fairly unstable childhood, my mother is amazing but has had bad luck with men and jobs and as a result of this plus my dad's abandonment I had some major behavioural and mental health issues growing up. My mum was always there for me but my dad just used it as an excuse not to see me. The real kicker is he broke up with his second wife so my brother F is from a similar broken family situation, yet my dad has always been there for him, has him every weekend without fail, buys clothes and games and whatever he wants. He also had two more sons, T and H, from a new wife (A) whom he is a perfect father to.\n\nHe's been slightly better with calling me lately but it's still only once every two months or so. We have a slightly better relationship than when I was a kid, which is why the following events hurt me as I was beginning to think we could maybe repair our relationship.\n\nSo the current situation is this: a few weeks ago A posted a pic of F, T and H on fb and I commented 'I have the cutest lil bros!'. A pretty harmless comment. Anyway I saw the post a while later and she'd deleted the comment. I thought this was weird but oh well, maybe I didn't actually post it or she deleted it by accident or something.\n\nAnyway last night I decided to do a little test, she posted a pic of T and H pulling faces and I commented 'crazy kids... you can tell they're my brothers!' Anyway an hour later and the comment was gone. I screenshotted it so I know it was definitely posted.\n\nI've had a feeling for a while that a lot of people in my dad's life don't know about me. He's literally asked me to go upstairs and 'watch F play fortnite for a bit' when his friend popped by before. Anyway I saw this as proof, and so I confronted them about it.\n\nSure enough they confirm they deleted my comment because \"some people in A's extended family and some friends don't know about you and we don't want them finding out over fb\". I ask why it matters how they find out and why I'm something he's never mentioned. He claims I'm taking it out of context and that it shouldn't matter to me as I 'barely see him'.\n\nHe then begins having a go at me for posting the comment, saying I was 'starting drama' and being manipulative.\n\nAITA? Should I not have posted the comment? Am I overreacting?",

      "description": "This was a few weeks ago. We’ll call my friends Jake and Candice. \n\n\nSo around 11pm Jake snapchats Candice telling her how depressed he is with school (we all go to the same university) and that he thinks the people in his life would be better off without him. \n\n\nCandice panics and texts me telling me what Jake said. We talk for a bit about what to do when Jake snapchats Candice saying he wants to kill him self. \n\n\nCandice texts me telling me this and then immediately messages him back with no reply. She then tries to call with no answer. \n\n\nSo I give a try messaging and calling him with no response. Around this point it’s 1am and I call my mom asking her what to do. \n\n\nShe suggests calling the police and I agree with her. Quickly I message Candice telling her to also call the police. \n\n\nCandice and I both call the police but we haven’t been friends with Jake for very long so we don’t know his address. I tell the woman at the police station his name, phone number, birthday, and the city where I know he lives. \n\n\nCandice and I chat for a bit about not knowing what to do. We’re both extremely worried at this point. We keep talking because at this point we both know we’re not going to be able to sleep. \n\n\nAround 2:30 I get a message from Jake that just says “I fell asleep”. I can’t get anything else out of him. He does tell Candice that the police showed up and scared the crap out of him and his roommates. \n\n\nAt this point he’s pissed at us for calling the police. He says “he wasn’t serious” about killing  himself. Candice has told me in high school he attempted suicide and he’s been depressed most of his life. \n\n\nAITA for calling the police at 2am trying to stop him from killing himself? He still won’t really talk to us, he’s still mad that we called the cops. I always thought that if someone threatens suicide you should call the police. ",

      "description": "My SO is an immigrant, and English is not his first language (his first language is relatively obscure so I won't list it here). I do not speak his first language - I have been learning a bit so can understand some, but the pronunciation and grammar are very difficult for me (due to the different language roots, and my general lack of linguistic talent), so I really cannot speak it at all in a way that would be understood. Additionally, in the part of his country he's from people speak extremely quickly, so my ability to understand or respond appropriately in the course of normal conversation (as opposed to slow and clear learning exercises) is pretty much nil. Sometimes I'm able to guess what the conversation is about based on context and the odd word I can pick out, but that's about it. \n\nWhen we started dating, he still lived at home with his parents. When I'd visit, friends of the family would often be present, and we would often have conversations that would basically begin in English but quickly devolve into their native language. At this point I understood literally none of it, but I'd feel paralysed - people would still be looking at me as if I was part of the conversation, and every so often everyone would laugh or make an exclamation, but I'd have no clue what was going on! Sometimes I'd start to fiddle with my phone, and someone (never my SO) would shoot me a look or make an offhanded comment like I was being rude. I talked to my SO about it and he was like you're definitely not being rude, we're being rude by not including you, and he would constantly bring the conversation back to English but they'd basically ignore it. He'd go \"come on guys, let's speak English!\" and everyone would agree but then revert back within the space of a sentence or two. On some occasions it would end up with him literally carrying on his end of the conversation in English while everyone else would answer in the other language, which is actually pretty comedic if you think about it. I felt like a burden, after all it wasn't my house and I was the only one unable to speak this language while everyone else there was at least bilingual. Basically I ended up generally just sucking it up and being as polite and involved as possible.\n\nSo that was a long time ago, now. We moved in together after a couple of years and his family moved away, so it really hasn't been an issue. Until now.\n\nRecently my SO's mother has moved back nearby. She has started coming over once or twice a week, which really is not a problem for me - she's his mother, after all, I like her well enough, and she rarely outstays her welcome. Her English is good, and she's fine with staying in English when chatting with both me and him. However, over the last few weeks, she's started inviting over some family friends in the area every now and again, with our permission of course. I like most of these people and have chatted with all, they are all professionals who speak fluent English. But for whatever reason, when they're all together, the conversation always ends up changing to the other language. My SO has been trying the same conversation tactics to switch language, with the same results. His mother is no help in that respect whatsoever. It's just like before, except now I feel way more put out about it, because I'm not the guest or the outsider any more - it's my house. I feel like I can't get a word in edgeways or cut in because the way they speak, it's like they're all shouting over each other - no gaps at all. \n\nI talked to my SO about it. I said that I don't particularly want to stop them from coming over, and to be honest it doesn't even bother me too much if they want to hang out and chat without me, I just hate being in the room and feeling ignored. He suggested that if they start to do it again, to get up and just leave, and that maybe that will also drive home to them how rude they are being. So I tried it, and the results were... Not great. My SO had tried again to ask them to switch to English but as always, it didn't stick. So I grabbed a glass of water and just left without saying anything to go watch TV in the bedroom. Soon after I heard some shouting and then the front door slamming a bunch... Apparently, my leaving the room caused several family friends to immediately start bitching about me being rude, which cause my SO to blow up and tell everybody to get out, which has now caused significant strife between my SO, his mother, and their friends. I haven't seen her since. \n\nI feel like such an asshole. I know they were being rude but at the end of the day I'm the one who doesn't speak their language, and I can see how to talk a completely different language for the benefit of one person is inconvenient to say the least. I feel like I've fucked up my relationship with my MIL! My SO says that they are the assholes, and I was entitled to be as rude as I liked because they were being disrespectful from the start. I'm not sure if that scans. What do you guys think? \n\nTL;DR AITA for being rude and walking out mid-sentence because the group was not speaking English, causing a rift between my SO and friends and pissing off my MIL? Or ATTA for not speaking English in the first place? ",

      "description": "I'm pretty sure I have my own asshole-ness to bear in this tale, and I imagine the title condemns me already. This happened a while ago, but my anxious mind can't let go of it, and it's turned into bitter obsessive thoughts I can't get over and it's. Sometimes you wish you could just purge your mind, you know? They say that writing about something can help you cope with it, so here we go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (M26 at the time) met an attractive girl (F19) in college. Large age gap, I know. Software development course, so there are hardly any. Cute, fun, immature, sexual and promiscuous and flirtatious (possibly a nymphomaniac). Bit of a tomboy interest wise, yet feminine. Everyone joked she had daddy issues, which she felt really self conscious about. Commonly attracted to the \"bad boys\". Had a boyfriend, and complained how much he verbally abused her, or didn't pay enough attention. A lot of people were kind of shocked to find out she had one given how she acted. Surrounded herself with people who supported (or enabled) and validated her, and flirted with half the men in the class (including a teacher in his mid 40s) Great at playing the victim, although I don't doubt she was one. I was naive myself, and felt sorry for her but at the same time did not trust her. She would say emotionally neglectful, or patronizing things to others and did not understand why they were hurtful. She was not totally cold hearted, and seemed to be longing for an emotionally fulfilling relationship. Needy for empathy, yet almost incapable of giving any, yet capable of feeling guilt especially when those things were pointed out to her. She would push that guilt deep down inside. Had very proud, and judgmental gay BFF (M29) who acted like a protective parent over her. Imagine trying to get with a girl while daddy is always watching. Seemed like a codependent relationship to me. Had gay friend ones who called these kind of men \"F\\*g Hags\". Which was kind of shocking to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am blunt, somewhat conflict seeking and probably a bit of a contrarian. The way I was able to confidently stand up for myself when challenged by others and not get pushed around seemed to attract her. I was very conflicted about her, and probably guilty myself of leading her on a little. Used lots of little other techniques to build attraction. The kind stuff you would probably hear from a pick-up artist today, that generally mostly work on emotionally damaged girls but I more or less naturally picked up over the years from my own experience. Don't want to get into details on that. I feel a bit manipulative for having done so myself. I think almost every guy pretends to have more confidence, or less insecurities than they do when meeting women. I try to stand my ground, keep my head up and stand up for myself or what's right most of the time. So I can come off as a bit pretentious as I try to keep myself together under pressure, but put myself in situations where I adopt a lot of responsibility and take a lot of pressure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually she started dating another guy her age (M19 lets call him Mike), even though there was a kind of attraction between us, it was mostly platonic. She got bored with him after a week. Started nagging on him about the features she didn't like, and chastising him for them. Plus suggesting he buy her jewelry. She was getting frustrated he didn't initiate any kind of sexual interactions yet. Walking right behind me and talking full volume with her BFF. Maybe they were sending me a message. Her BFF tried to tell her that maybe she should initiate something sexual. Couple days later she starts ghosting him. Cold shoulder treatment. He acts like he doesn't know whats going on. Chases after her like a dog still thinking he can make things up, but he's in the \"doghouse\", as they say. At the same time she starts pursuing me. Following me at lunch, while he's following her around trying to fix things but having no idea how and maybe not even knowing what he did. Starts calling Mike a pathetic looser, and talking about how she \"needs someone older and more mature\" in front of me to send me the message she was ready to \"upgrade\". Never broke up with Mike, because admitting to the fact they were dating (kind of) would mean admitting to herself she was cheating on her long time boyfriend. She loved bringing up polyamory. She was onto people knowing she was cheating on her BF, and used it as a kind of passive aggressive (not sure thats the right term to describe it) defense of her behavior, while never admitting to being polyamorous herself. A good way to escape the idea, and create plausible deniability about her cheating. A way to avoid feeling guilty and not take responsibility it seemed to me. No one really believed that idea and it became kind of an inside joke. I kept my distance, but stupidly enough still kept occasionally joking around with her in a flirtatious manner. I was stupid and indecisive and it pissed her off. At one point I kind of teased her about 90% of her 800 Facebook friends being male, which really pissed her off. I'm probably an ass for being jealous of all those guys myself. I kind of hinted at why I was not making a move, but she resented me for it. We shared some of the same friends. After this most of them turned on me, especially after I regretted it, because now I started to get the cold shoulder from most of her friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was the fact our final group project pretty much devolved into \"Lord of the Flies\". Everyone was moody and sleep deprived. I made an easy target because her BFF already hated me for criticizing his precious little innocent girl. He saw her sexual and attention addictions as more of form of liberating sexual expression it seemed. He thought that if she just found the right guy all her issues would magically disappear. I think I kind of believed that too at the time. Plus her other male friends generally didn't say anything about her because they were all thirsty AF (We're nerds in programming. What do you expect.), and didn't want to ruin their chances. Which she of course was pretty happy about. I regretted it because now I was the one send to the \"doghouse\". She was gloating and basking in my misery at that point. Went from being sad and disappointed and thinking she was not good enough because I did not ask her out, to an almost sadistic state. I guess my regret was seen as more validation to her. I found it baffling how someone who complained about her BF not showing her enough empathy and abusing her, could go and do the same thing to others. I think this explanation makes sense, though. It's an MMA fighter who was picked on as a kid talking about bullies becoming abusive because they learn it from their parents. I think it's not out of the question that people can get that from fractured relationship with their significant other. She treated her friends better than the men she got into relationships with. Although, naive about other people's feeling she was generally kind and sweet to me before this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt college grad night we all got pretty drunk. I felt like I was on the verge of a mental break down at this point. I already had work burnout before college from stressful shift work job, and it started to come back in these last few months. Some minor issues at home at the time as well, but they they were not a big a deal, it just all snowballed from all sides. At the end of the night she was pretty wasted, and still pretty proud of herself. She went up to me, tousled my hair, and said to me in patronizing tone in what I believe was a final act of revenge: \"You know, you're a \"nice guy\" and I would like you to be my friend.\". She then got up pointed and yelled at another guy I knew across the room who got her number: \"Call me!\". Maybe I was being paranoid, and this \"friending\" was well intended, but given her recent behavior it just felt like a way to spite me. A final dagger in the back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe guy who got her number didn't last 2 days with her. Maybe he seemed more attractive when she was drunk. Dude was sad for a few months. I don't know if she used him to spite me or if it actually was well intended on her part. The thing is that in my attitude at the time everything she did seemed like it was aimed to spite me. It may have just felt like that at the time because that's the lens I was seeing things through. It's tough to see things objectively when you're stressed. Luckily I had some friends to back me up. They pretty much tried convince me she was a horrible, narcissistic, human being, while at a party she was not invited to. But not before letting me know how pathetic I was for still believing in her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA month later we all had a BBQ for the company we wrote the program for. She was there and you could tell she was having her own nervous break down. No more men to flirt with now that she had a real job (I'll get to the trouble she caused there later). I was being a moron again and assumed that maybe she had changed. She seemed to show remorse or some kind of regret. I, a friend of ours and her, all went out one night. I think I was the one who organised it. Stupid mistake looking back on it. I still had faith that things could go somewhere, or that I could make things up somehow and that I owed her something because I felt guilty and belittled. She on the other hand came there hoping I was again the confident, funny, and charming guy she first met, before I let her walk all over me and send me on a guilt trip. Really I was probably closer to the mental and physical state to that of a meth addict by now. And she let me know it by shitting on me some more. Took a group selfie and proceeded on talking on how creepy and pathetic I looked in it. (Probably had like 10 hours of sleep that entire week",

      "description": "So English is not my first language so I will try and explain this as best I can. Sorry in advance if I Don't make sense \n\nSo in 2018 I (19M) dated, let's call him Dave(18M), for 5 months till Feb last year. We decided to remain friends but that didn't work out as I thought for he just ignored me right of the bat and acted like I didn't exist. ( he broke up with me btw). This had upset me and decided that it's not worth my time and ignored him as well.\n\nAt the end of 2018 he started taking to me again and we hanged out a couple of times. Everything seemed fine and I thought that we were becoming good friends again. He then dropped this bombshell on me that he is in love with me and can't stop thinking about me. This just startled me because he ignored me for almost a year and now that we just started hanging out again he is in love with me? That didn't make sense and I was over him so I politely declined. \n\nA few days ago he asked me if I wanted to chill and get a drink at a bar or go see a movie. I REALLY wanted to see bohemian rhapsody and thought it wouldn't be the worst idea to go out. I made it clear that we are going as friends and that it would not be a date. He came to pick me up and I asked him were we are going and he told me that we are gonna chill at his house... This kind of made me mad because I wanted to go out and see a movie, this also made me feel uneasy because we haven't hanged out alone since we dated. I expressed my feelings that I wanted to go out and he told me there is no other choice because his sister(26 fucking years old) is scared to live alone in the house. We got some liquor and \"chilled\"  and then again he drops the question \" do you want to take this further?\". I declined again and said I only want to be friends. He started crying and told me he can't see me anymore because his feelings for me is just to much(this didn't make sense to me because he ignored me flat for almost a fucking year). We talked for an hour about it and he later told me that he is mad at me for not giving him a second chance which is also false. Back in October 2018 he asked me to start things up again and I told him I would. He then ignored me again for 2 fucking weeks and I ended it again. So AMITA for rejecting him? \n\n",

      "description": "Background: 25 year old male, working professional in a major city. I've been on and off the dating apps and have met some women through friends, but no one I've met has struck me as a potential girlfriend (personality wise).  However, going without sex for months on end can be incredibly frustrating and bad for self confidence. As a result, I've been having some casual relationships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently met a girl on a dating app who I was very clear with about not wanting to get into a serious relationship. We decided she would come over for a movie, and everything went well. We hooked up, chatted for a while after and went our separate ways. I was really polite and didn't rush her out or anything. Ideally, I'm attracted enough to the girl that we continue to hook up in the future but that wasn't the case here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe asks me to hang out again a week later, and I wasn't really in the mood. I told her I was too tired, but maybe I would come over if she just wanted to blow me. She was happy to do so, but when the time came I started feeling really guilty. I decided to back out and I explained that it felt wrong to do that because I didn't have much interest in her outside of the BJ (didn't word it that bluntly). I felt like I was doing the noble thing here by not stringing her along with one last hookup.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe responds asking me to hang out another time without hooking up. I declined and was subsequently blocked. The situation is strange to me, because everyone always complains about being \"ghosted\" and says they wish people were more up-front and honest with dating.  But I feel like had I just taken the BJ and ghosted, I wouldn't have been blocked and she would be less upset. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for not forgiving my friend right away?",
      "description": "Okay so background context is: I've known this girl since we were in fourth grade, we're now 23, so we have a long history together. Part of that history includes her getting with my boyfriends after I've been with them with the exception of one guy I 'dated' for two days then we broke up (never did anything with the guy in that time) she has held that against me ever since, even after she slept with my boyfriend, now husband, for a week to get back at me for something (don't remember what she said she was getting back at me for now). Anyways, I go ahead and forgive them both for that (obviously since I'm now married to him).\n\nRecently (about June of 2018) we (my husband and I) have decided to try out being Polygamous/amorous because we both feel there's always room for more love in a person's life. After my husband decided he wanted to go into the Navy, we put searching for more partners on the back burner. Especially since we had a bad experience trying to let this girl into our relationship and she chose to be with another guy instead. Which we were fine with because we didn't want to be with him. After this she continues to talk to my husband in private messages, which they both say it's just as friends and I believe. \n\nTime goes on and she ends up with this new guy, who we like (as a friend). We all go to the beach with another/fifth friend as a little vacation before my husband ships out and have a great time. We all spend a lot of time together and two weeks before my husband goes off she asks me if we would be interested in helping her fulfill one of her boyfriends fantasies (a foursome). My husband is for it because he's never done anything like this so I reluctantly agree. Not without telling my husband how I think it's a bad idea because our past with her and not wanting her to end up thinking something was going on with me and the guy afterwards (she's had three ways with other friends of hers and her boyfriend(s) at the time and after the fact completely shunned them because she felt they were \"up to something/conspiring\" behind her back.) We all get drunk, play strip poker and when it's time to call it a night she follows us into our bedroom insisting we do stuff, I tell her no because we have other people (the fifth guy from before and our roommate) and that would be rude, trying to find an excuse not to do it. She goes and talks to the fifth guy, who is still in the living room, and comes back to say he's fine with it. Not being able to think of any other reason to say no we have the foursome (because I don't want to hurt the guys feelings because it's not that I didn't necessarily want to just know her and wanted to prevent her from being how she's been in the past) \n\nThis is where the issues start. My husband leaves for the Navy and slowly she stops talking to me. I try to reach out to her on multiple occasions, even in group chats with other friends and she would just ignore me. I even ask her what's wrong or if I did something. This goes on for at least two weeks, so I message her boyfriend (the guy we had a foursome with) and ask him if she is mad at me, he tells me he doesn't know but he can find out if I wanted him to, I tell him no thanks maybe she'll respond to me soon. The conversation stops there. Maybe a week goes by and she messages me saying she thinks he's going to propose to her, even though they've only been together for about a month, maybe a little longer, at this point. She tells me all this stuff about what she hopes he will do (saying it in a way that leads me to think she wants me to tell him/suggest he do these things). So, I message him and suggest he does these things if down the line he is thinking of doing that. While we're talking about their eventual proposal, they apparently have a fight and he asks me for advice (because we're all friends here, right? That's what friends do, right?) Apparently not. She gets mad and accused us of having our own thing because if either of us wanted to know something about her we should've went to one of her other friends (she gave two of our friends names) because they know her better, that I shouldn't be asking him, I should have asked her (which I did she just wasn't responding to me) and he shouldn't be asking me (any of our other friends is fine but not me).\n\nAfter a long conversation with her accusing me and him of doing stuff together I finally have enough and go to bed, I wake up in the middle of the night to see a message saying she's sorry, which I ignore and go back to sleep. Later in the day she sends another message saying she's sorry and I tell her I'm not going to just tell her it's okay because it's not, I'm tired of feeling like I have to prove myself to her with everything I do for that one mistake that happened a long time ago. To which she tells me what I did she considers worse because sex is nothing to her and dating is everything. To which I disagree and say they're both equally as important and I feel like she should stop holding those two days over my head when I feel like her sleeping with my husband for a week is much more and I forgave them both to which she gets mad again saying I'm trying to make her into the bad guy and I'm the only one holding on to the past and she didn't tell me to prove anything and I try to explain to her that I wasn't trying to make her feel bad I just wasn't going to forgive her as easily as I did in the past for treating me like this but she blocks me and turns all of my friends against me telling them I no longer wanted to be her friends even though I was willing to be friends just not going to forgive her so quickly this time and she blocked me.

      "description": "So, I have three cats. Two of them are 12 years old, the third one is about 8. I got the two oldest ones when I just moved out of the house and I actually don't know why I got the third one...I really enjoyed having them for most of the time. The cats moved houses with me, and experienced the different boyfriends I had throughout the years. They all used to sit with me on the couch and stuff. \n\nSix years ago I bought a house by myself and moved in with my three cats: single cat lady...More than enough room and the cats could also go outside and enjoy themselves there. I had a full room dedicated to them with everything they needed in the room. At that time I expected to be by myself for a long time...but than I met my now-husband. And I fell pregnant. Suddenly the house that was once big enough for me + 3 cats, was now kind off cramped with the cat-room now being a nursery. \n\nLong story short: Three cats suddenly feels like a lot. They are always in the way. Sometimes my kid climbs on the couch and suddenly I notice cat hair all over him, even though I vacuumed a few hours ago. The two oldest cats hate my kid and don't go near him. They seem annoyed with me and I am annoyed with them. I can't feel the bond that I had with them anymore at all.  \n\nI went on a week long holiday (my mom took care of the cats at home) and I was overly aware of my enjoyment of not having cat hair in the vacation house, how I could leave all the doors open without cats sitting on everything all the time. I didn't miss the whining over food 24/7...I didn't miss them at all, actually. \n\nMy thought process so far consists of: They are better off with someone that actually wants them there and is welcoming of them instead of annoyed by them. But on the other hand I am totally like: they are going to miss this house they know and love and they will probably also miss me even though we don't connect like we used too. \n\nAITA for not wanting my cats anymore? The cats I had for almost a third of my life. I am totally behind the: if you don't want to take care of an animal, don't take them. But I think I kind of miscalculated how much my life would change and how they wouldn't fit  in my life anymore once I had a kid.  \n\nI must add that at the moment I am only THINKING about the ‘not wanting’ part, and I am in no way taking any actions towards doing something with that. I obviously do still care of and for them and it is not like I would ever ‘kick them out’ just like that. \n",

      "title": "AITA for not cleaning up anymore?",
      "description": "I’m a junior student at university who lives in campus housing with 3 friends. We share common areas (kitchen, living room) but have our own individual rooms and two separate bathrooms (roommate A shares a bathroom with roommate B, and roommates C and D share a bathroom).\n\nI keep my individual room somewhat clean. It gets messy every now and then, but I always make a point to pick up and not let it get too far, especially since when I’m home, my room is my chosen place to hang out.\n\nRoommates C and D spend all of their time in the living room, and it shows. The coffee table is constantly covered in their items/things that they’ve used, and the couches often have their various clothing items on them.\n\nLast semester, myself and Roommate B always made it a habit to clean at least twice a month. Everyone is supposed to help out with the common areas, and the bathrooms are by discretion of those sharing them. Roommate C has always made it a point to do the least amount possible, if anything at all. Halfway through the semester, it became clear that only myself and Roommate B were doing the cleaning, for areas that, though common, were rarely used by us.\n\nOnce this semester started, I talked to both Roommates C &amp; D individually, and asked them to help out more, especially since it was primarily their mess. Plus, I’ve lived with them before without Roommate B, so I thought it’d be more effective coming from me. They said they would, but have not at all.\n\nSince then, I have made it a point to only clean up after myself and Roommate B if she hasn’t done so already. That means that I only do my or Roommate B’s dishes (or clean items that belong to me). I only pick up trash that may have been left by me or roommate B. This unfortunately means that we live in a garbage heap. The coffee table was covered in old takeout containers, food that was made last week is still sitting in a pot on the kitchen table, and there were at least 5 bags of garbage sitting by the door waiting to be taken out.\n\nRoommates C and D have stopped talking to me or even acknowledging me ever since it’s been clear I’ve only really been cleaning up after myself. They only started talking to me again when I broke down and deep cleaned the shared areas of the apartment because people were coming over and it’s honestly embarrassing (to me) to live like that, and especially to have new friends see that.\n\nAm I in the wrong here for only cleaning mine and occasionally Roommate B’s stuff? I didn’t sign up to parent my friends, or be their maid, but I also don’t feel like I should have to live like this, and we all live here so there should be some shared responsibility. I choose not to use the common areas as much as the others, so I don’t mind cleaning it occasionally, but repeatedly cleaning up after the people who use it the most only to have them turn around and make it messy again less than a day later also doesn’t seem right.",

      "description": "I've been friends with this guy, call him Harry, for a few years now. \nOver the years, me and all my friends began seeing his *unknowing inconsiderateness, his inefficiency, and unreliability.* However, he was still somehow a pleasure (or just fun/funny) to be around, and (I'm sure) had good intentions for all of us. And we all truly loved and cared for him as we did our other friends. Harry quickly became a part of our friend group.\n\nFast forward a bit, and I noticed Harry started giving me special treatment as compared to everyone else. He would start up problems and arguments over silly things, or things I personally thought didn't matter. He would seek attention from me specifically, as if he had a middle school crush. And side note, I am also a dude.\n\nIt wasn't a huge problem back then, as it didn't get in the way of our friendship. But it started growing; happening more frequently, more BS involved, and more time wasted. Until over a year ago, **Harry actually confessed that he had feelings for me,** but was confused about it (\"figuring himself out\" phase, I suppose). This did catch me by surprise, and explained a lot to me. Now, I have absolutely nothing against homosexual people, and honestly find most fun to be around, so this didn't bother me, as I clearly didn't return the feeling, so the confession was just that—a confession.\n\nBut that's what I thought, I was hoping nothing would change cause I knew I wouldn't let it bother me. But the previous things Harry did that bothered me not only continued, but *amplified*, as (I'm sure) he became more insecure about it, and even told me he's not sure if telling me was the right thing to do (which I convinced him it was).\n\nThis went on for another year—Harry being especially inconsiderate, petty, and quick to anger with me. I couldn't help but feel it was his attempt to get closer and in a way \"bond\" more with me, so I tried addressing it, asking him directly if he still had feelings, to which he replied no. \nNow I'm not one to call out a claim without proof, but I'll just say that it did not sit right with me nor make sense to me.\n\nAnd it continued for months and months again. **Repeating cycle --&gt; he does something frequently, I call him out and get angry, he reciprocates saying it's my fault as well, we come to a consensus, I hope he learns something, he does not, and goes back to the same way in a month or two.**\n\n*Until today.*\n\nI personally think about my friendship with Harry a lot, and personally I've found it detrimental to my mental health and growth as a person. But who am I to say that, which is why I'm posting here.\n\n**Today's long story short:** \ndid something small he frequently does, and that was enough to set me off and tell him that I'd had enough. \nI told him I did not want to be part of this \"personal change\" he claims to be going through (which I have not seen all the years I've known him), and continue to be a mental punching bag for him to do whatever he wants.\n\nSo, in a sense, *I lost a friend today.*\n\nTLDR; Had a dude who always causes trouble for our friend group confess feelings to me, a dude. He gave me special treatment of illogical arguing and inconsiderateness that amplified after confession. Dropped him today after he pulled a little inconsiderate thing on me again today.\n\n",

      "description": "We met while living in the same apartment community, which I happened to work for. Sarah made excuses to drop by while I was at work, which wasn't weird since my job was to attend to the apartment residents. We started actually talking beyond polite conversation last summer, and eventually I found myself on a date with her, though I didn't realize it at the time.\n\nI was apprehensive to date Sarah for a couple reasons: 1) I didn't feel physically attracted to her from the start, only neutral 2) I didn't think I was emotionally ready for a relationship yet. I took years to get over the HS girl I \"dated\", largely because I had undiagnosed depression. I thought I needed more time for personal growth. \n\nWith this in mind, I broke things off with Sarah quickly after the date, because I didn't think I could be her boyfriend. What I didn't tell her was that I wasn't attracted to her like that. I guess I couldn't bring myself to say that because  I was still trying to be nice.\n\nI felt like I took a step backwards in my dating progress. I wanted to actually try. Those feelings combined to make me re-evaluate the idea of dating at that point in my life. I had been infatuated with HS girl, and I was not with Sarah. Because my feelings became warped and unhealthy in the HS relationship, I thought that infatuation from the start wasn't something to necessarily pursue. I also began to think that I would never be \"ready\" to date and that I owed it to myself to actually try with Sarah.\n\nUnder this reasoning, I asked to try again with Sarah and she said yes. I felt awkward and uncomfortable about being with her at first, but I wanted to believe that was a result of my inexperience. Over the next several months, we got to know each other pretty well and I strived to be a good partner. \n\nThe problem is I suppressed any doubt about her, rationalizing it as a temporary growing phase. I never talked to her about my feelings on this. I had become afraid of losing Sarah and thought if I could resolve that fear on my own that I could move forward positively with her. \n\nI tried to continually be satisfied with Sarah and did not express my negative feelings more than a couple times, in which I lied by omission because I didn't want to leave. In January, I finally decided I had enough of bottling in my stress, so I confronted my feelings to Sarah and explained everything as best I could in my heartbreak. \n\nI did not want to lie to play with her feelings or hurt her, but I had been lying to myself about my feelings to avoid confronting painful emotions in the hopes of growing to wholly accept and love her. I see just how much pain that caused and how damaging it was in hindsight. \n\nAITA for dating Sarah anyway even though I had initial doubts and was running from my emotions without realizing the impact?

      "description": "So, let me begin with obligatory statement acknowledging that I am a novice, and to excuse if my post is done incorrectly.\n\nBackground first, I have been married just over 2 years and have a 1 year old. I work for the military and get paid well, but half of my income is from additional allowances for food, rent, etc. Financially my wife has never had a job that paid more than 20-30k a year, and is unable to comprehend how a budget works, so we tend to barely come out even every month (spend what I earn, minus contributions to 401k).\n\nWe have argued over this many times, but to summarize it I am putting it into one story: I haven't traveled out of the country in years and in a hope to start saving a bit each month I've brought up the idea of saving towards a fun trip (i.e. machu picchu, europe, south america, etc). After much thought, my wife came back with disneyworld or a week in Jamaica for an event for the band Hanson (yes they still exist and have a die hard fan base). I have been to disneyworld multiple times, even with my wife and our daughter will never remember a thing so I see that trip as a waste. I have also been to Jamaica, and am not interested in spending $4k to sit at a resort to occasionally see a band that I think is average.\n\nFor that same cost we could walk to mount everest base camp in nepal, or spend a week or two in spain/france. Am I an asshole for saying that Jamaica is a dumb waste of a trip? Granted when I am older, I am all for it, but at 33 I want to travel/explore the world. I also suggested she do Jamaica and I do my own hiking trip since the baby wouldn't be able to do that anyway. Unfortunately, I know me going anywhere on vacation alone would be the end of the world. Hell, I spent a month in the california desert for training living in a truck and my wife tried to say it counted as a vacation. \n\nI feel like my wife is a bit immature. She never left home until she married me, and her parents always lived above their means so it has been a tough adjustment for her. Saying that, we continually argue about the same BS, and I am interested to hear thoughts of others.",

I'm just here to hear some opinions on this. \nSo basically my cousins and I are pretty good friends and I always kind of enjoyed their company but since they got girlfriends they basically keep them around 24/7. Yesterday we agreed last minute on meeting today, hang out and maybe grab some food. I should probably mention that the last times we tried to meet up never really worked out just because I always had other things going (Birthdays, school work and other kinds of shit). So I always worried that they already think that I 'm constantly flaking on them (I don't blame them. It really did seem like it.). But this time I decided to flake out for real just so I wouldn't have to be the fifth wheel. Now my mom is just blaming me and talking with other family members about how I flaked on my cousins( she doesn't know about their girlfriends). I know this isn't a big thing but I still feel guilty. I mean I could tell them about my feelings but I'm sure they wouldn't understand (they're younger and aren't really the best people to talk to when it comes to feelings) and that's the exact reason why I didn't tell them in the first place. \nAnyways, I'm sorry if my thoughts were all over the place but I hope some of you could give me some feedback whether I am the asshole in this situation or not.",

      "description": "I’m currently traveling alone in Armenia and last week I became unwell. I’ll spare you the details but I had an issue that was rather embarrassing. \n\nA few days ago I had reason to go to go to the hospital at about 10pm. A lady who worked at my hostel (that I hardly knew) left her dinner with a friend and met me at the hospital to translate and evidently protect me from scamming doctors. \n\nAfter the all clear and my shitty hospital experience I went for a walk with this lady to calm down. We had a long chat and bonded over our very first lengthy conversation. We spent a handful of hours walking around and talking about each other.\n\nThe next day she booked me in for a appointment with a doctor she trusted. When I got to the appointment, I found out she was on loud speaker translating...despite the fact the doctor spoke English. I found it very weird as she is not a medical professional, practically a stranger and as I said before, I had embarrassing symptoms.\n\nThe doctor had me do some tests and the results would be given to me within 24 hours via email.\n\nWhen I returned to the hostel I had a conversation with the lady. I told her that I didn’t like how indirect and vague the doctor was with his answers. To which she explained that she told the doctor to be indirect with his answers because she “knows that I would worry”.\n\nTrying to keep my cool I went for a walk. When I returned to the hostel she sat me down in a rather open are and told me the doctor called and she has the results for one of my tests. The doctor told THE LADY THAT WORKS AT MY HOSTLE my results. She then loudly announced what the results were.\n\nThe results and how they were delivered to me were quite shocking to me, so I stormed off. \n\nThe next day I left and accidentally did without saying good bye to the lady. Who did have my best interests at heart.\n\nWhen I arrived in the next city many hours later I noticed my results had not been emailed to me despite it being hours past the ETA. Coincidently I got a Facebook message from the hostel lady ten minutes later.\n\nShe explained that the doctor couldn’t get ahold of my email and SHE HAS THE RESULTS. She then proceeds to tell me that the results are negative and that I should be happy.\n\nIn response I asked her why did he not just ask her for my email, why I was once again the second person to know my results and stating that I think the doctor is unprofessional.\n\nTo this she went ballistic. Calling me spoiled, a snob and rude.\n\nI can’t be the arsehole in this situation right? She did have my interests at heart, she did protect me from the scamming hospital and she did spend the night calming me down and I never specifically said she shouldn’t be involved. But...privacy goes without saying right? A total stranger was involved in very personal information and was given MY test results before me. Just over 24 hours prior she would have been a total stranger.",

      "description": "TLDR at end\n\nI work in a small environment and there's only about 18 employees. We work at a sandwich shop and most of us have known each other for years \n\n I have one coworker who I cannot stand. He's lazy, we have few similar interests, he's a liar, and a chatty cathy (mostly about gossip between our coworkers that is not directly related to either one of us). I have another job in the evening as a bartender so I already have enough drama from my regulars there, I would like to just go into my day job do my work and go home.\n\nSo I finally had it today. For the past month I had been actively avoiding him UNLESS it is work related. He occasionally tries to chat about my personal life or gossip with me.\n\nI was working on the prep list while he went to shoot the shit with my boss out back smoking a cig (it's lunch rush and they always take forever). We got really busy my coworker and I had to manage the store for almost 25 mins. They finally come back from their smoke break when it's dying down and I continue my prep work. He nonchalantly came up to me and asked if I heard about the new superhero movie coming out. He literally asks me this once every two weeks. I usually respond I'm not into those movies.\n\nSo this was my breaking point.I turned to him and told him not to talk to me anymore UNLESS it's work related. He walked away. I am aware I hurt his feelings (my boss pulled me aside and asked me to be nicer to him) I do not like the guy and try to avoid him. Am I the Asshole? \n\nTLDR:  Am I the asshole for telling my coworker to not talk to me UNLESS it is work related?",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nIt's Christmas &amp; around 1, my dad asks if I want to come over for lunch. I love my dad &amp; after everything we've been through as a family, I make it a priority to spend time with my family. \n\nMy bf &amp; I  go &amp; hang out in the backyard since I'm uncomfortable going in the house bc the lady he lives with had made me feel unwelcome. Also she doesn't like my bf so he's not allowed inside. \n\nMy dad knows I don't like going inside but he tries to get me to go in for soda. When I don't, he calls me lazy. My brother goes for me. We chill, have walnuts, pecans and chat. Then he tells me that there's food. I was expecting for the lunch to already be served, not that I'd have to go inside to go get it. Same thing happens, he tells me to go inside \"No one's there\"  My bf goes &amp; gets us plates. \n\nAfter the \"lunch\" is over, he messes around with a kid the lady adopted. He keeps going in &amp; out of the house. My dad bought the kid 2 presents &amp; I didn't get anything. Not that I wanted or needed a gift, but I'm his actual kid. After an hour of this, he just doesn't come back. He goes inside, doesn't come back. So I just chat with my brother &amp; cousin. We're probably at his house for 2-3 hours at this point &amp; after not seeing him, I realized he wasn't coming back out. I'm upset now bc I feel insulted &amp; ignored. \nI decide it's time to go.  \n\nI text him bye &amp; go home. \n\nI didn't get to spend time with my dad like I wanted to. It's like he just invited me over to ditch me. \n\nTL; DR: Dad invites me for \"lunch\", then ditches me after an hour or so. \n\nAm I the asshole for feeling upset &amp; for leaving? ",

      "description": "My parents &amp; grandparents have put me in a difficult situation and forced me to struggle and continue to accrue college debt by not paying towards my loans. I was going to work two jobs in college, but my grandmother told me on about 7 or 8 occasions, up until I was looking at another job offer with more hours halfway through my senior year, that she was going to buy me a car when I graduated college. I finished college and... nothing. Took a job for a few months that didn't work out in another state where i lived in a 4 bedroom apartment and rented from the company. Struggled to find something within walking distance of my home.  \n\n\nI'm working part time at a grocery store now. I asked my grandma if she could give me a small loan towards a car a couple of times, and she didn't respond the first time. The second time she said that she didn't have any money. Well, my dad just told me a week ago that because I had smoked pot in my sophomore year of college (this is now 3 years later) that I wasn't \"clean\", and he told my grandparents that when they were about to buy me a car.  \n\n\nI feel bad now because my grandpa had a small brain tumor and got minor brain damage from it. But they really raked me over the coals and put me in an awful situation. My parents will threaten to kick me out over anything minor so I really try to avoid communication with them. I visited my grandparents a couple of times in the past 6 months, and I know they're getting old and could suddenly die. But it really feels like they fooled me into my current situation and, they bought my other cousin a 3 grand car and my other cousin a 10 grand car. I asked for a loan in the $500-$1000 range, or to live with them where more work opportunities are and pay $100 in rent a month for 6 months until I could get on my feet (they're very well off, she donates like 3 grand a year to wolf foundations). They claimed no one could live with them right now because of her back pain.  \n\n\nSo now, my father has lied to my grandparents, my grandparents discussed it in no way with me and just said they weren't helping me, but now my grandpa had brain damage and asks to see me. I feel bad but at the same time I feel like I'm the one they cast to the side and said \"haha fuck him, he smoked the marijuana plant a few years ago. We're not gonna help him\".  \n\n\nMy mother is a narcissist that tries to push my buttons until I say something mean, and then uses that as fuel to create drama with my father for attention or as an excuse to be angry.  \n\n\nAll in all I feel like my parents' behavior is the reason I have panic attacks and I feel as though I should cut off communication when I'm stable, and put my focus on bettering myself over taking the time to visit my grandparents.  \n\n\nIn 6 weeks I should have enough to quit my job and get sleep apnea surgery because if I move into the wrong position I wake up gasping for air and get black circles under my eyes, and extreme fatigue.  I'll be able to have a car for my dad to teach me to drive in. I just think that my family has toxic behavior even though my parents helped me go to college and gave me rides to work when I was under 18, and gave me 2-3 meals a day of decent to shitty food. The years of harassment and screaming at me when I try to have a conversation with them about anything has really fucked with my head and its taken a long time to learn how to be human again.",

We have a 4 year old daughter. I have no kids with my ex. \n\nMy wife and I divorced because we eventually found that we were incompatible. I met my current wife a year after our divorce. We got married 6 years ago. \n\nA few months ago my ex wife reached out to me. She wanted me to know that her brother (46M) passed away. He was battling cancer for a long time. I was still with my ex when we found out. I was pretty good friends with him and kept in touch with him every now and then. One thing lead to another and we were telling each other about our lives. We’ve been talking ever since. \n\nI do admit that we’ve talked about our relationship and what we could’ve done to fix it. There’s been some pretty emotional conversations. I believe the farthest it has gone is us agreeing that we should have tried harder to work through our problems. I’ve also told her about some of my personal issues I’ve had instead of telling my wife. She has also been emotionally relying on me for the past few months. \n\nYesterday, my wife saw our messages. I was never hiding them but I also never told her we were still talking. She does know that we talked about her brother for a little bit. She was crying and went to work without saying goodbye. When she got home she went straight to the guest room and locked herself in there. I’m not sure what to do but I obviously still and will always care for my ex wife. We were married after all. \n\nI’m not sure if my wife is the asshole or if I am. I feel like she can’t expect me to not care for my ex wife. I don’t think she understands because I’m her first husband.  \n\n",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I live together and frequently see her family 2-3 times a week - each of these times being an all day event that I get feel guilted into going to by my girlfriend. It has just been too much for me. I'm happy to see them occasionally and do my duty so to speak, but it's just been too frequent for me. In no universe do I want to prevent her from seeing them, but I feel that I need to be opting out more often than not recently. She has gotten frustrated with me whenever I opt out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer family are genuinely great people, but it is exhausting being with them. We connect politely, but I don't really have much in common with her parents or her sister. When we're over there she is enjoying her time, chatting, doing whatever -- but I'm always left twiddling  my thumbs (and I try to make small talk, connect, etc.). I swear I have tried, but the experience is 9 times out 10 just immensely boring - and I feel that I need to be sort of \"on my best behavior\" - which is exhausting. What can be frustrating too is that she'll go off with her sister and literally ignore me when I try to continue a conversation with them -- or just hang out. I get that seeing her family is a part of the deal, but spending time with them is killing me and I don't get why I have to be there along with her so frequently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCase in point: we went to her family's for Thanksgiving. We were there for the day, awesome, cool, normal Thanksgiving. Then, it's like 7 pm - about time to leave right? Great to see you, hugs, bye - then, she decides to sleep over. She poses this as a question to me - but it's not really a question, it's an answer yes or I'll get teary eyed, pouty, and become a mute for the rest of the day. So 7 pm to 11 pm is spent watching fucking America's Funniest Home videos with her family, who I've already spent \\~10-15 hours with that week -- and literally just kill me. The next morning we are then still there until like 1 pm - she's talking to her parents about different things, while I am twiddling my thumbs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this sort of a came to a head today. She's going over her parents to make perogies for Christmas. I offered to come for 4-5 hours to help out. She was less than content with this idea. She told me she doesn't know when she wants to leave (read: we will be leaving at 10 pm and the entire Saturday will be spent with me attempting to make small talk and twiddling my thumbs). I offered to drive my own car and leave after the 4-5 hours. Same answer. I can't imagine that I was being unreasonable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole and does anyone have any advice moving forward?",

      "description": "I have this neighbor that’s kind of a cocksuker. Basically he spends most of his time in his apartment smoking weed and playing loud music. Normally this wouldn’t annoy me but we started to have an issue with him being aggressive and weird. \n\n\n\nIn NYE I had a small family get together. It was my family and my BIL family and their spouses. We had some salsa playing and my neighbor knocks on the door and not only does he look higher than a giraffes pussy but he says something about how he’s a salsa instructor and he’ll be right over? I was like um I don’t think so I think we’re shutting down especially as some of the guests where passing out that was the end of that. Whatever my husband was downstairs and on the way back upstairs the neighbor barges in with my husband and he starts to get kind of rowdy(yes you read that correctly my husband didn’t allow him in he snuck in). I get side tracked for a min and when I come back he was getting in one of my guests faces and they’re pushing each other around. I tell the neighbor to please leave and we actually had to force him out by pushing him. Long story short the fucker tries coming back and this time he tries pushing the girl who opened the door out of the way to get in and she pushes him out and locks the door. \n\n\n\nThen a couple weeks later we got home from the bar at like 230 and he was sleeping  on these benches our floors have outside. He wakes up and begs my husband to let him sleep in our house bc his fiancé locked him out. Again he looks high as fuck and he creeps me out and we lied and got out of that but he followed us and tried coming in. \n\n\nThen another couple weeks later he locks HER out of the house and starts a giant scandal of her banging the shit out of the door from 1 am to like 4 something. Then he lets her in. \n\n\nAnyway from that point on I haven’t felt very safe and i don’t like the fact that he gets super drugged out (apparently it’s coke by what he’s mentioned to my husband in passing). \n\n\nSkip to last week the apartment gets an email that someone on our floor has been smoking and that ends their contract. I know for a fact that the only person we’ve seen smoking is him and that would mean he gets kicked out of the apartment. I have access to their balcony view which means I can totally report him therefore getting him kicked out. Normally I don’t do shit like that as I’ve also smoked (weed) but he scares me and seems like a dangerous person to live next door to. I  don’t wanna rat on him but this seems like my perfect chance.

I called it, and it wasn't for anything specific he had done wrong, I just needed some space to see if we should continue this relationship, as I haven't been happy but he thinks we're going to get married one day. We decided we would update each other about once a week and cut all other contact. \n\nThen, a few days ago, he decided to take the day off work, drive to my school (2 hours away) and surprise me with roses and food, etc. He knows my work and class schedule and knows I'm pretty busy from 6a - 6p. He walks into my job at 7a, and acts like we never were on a break, hugs and kisses me, asks to come back on the weekend, and says he made dinner reservations tonight. I tried to play it off as I didn't have time to have a serious conversation with him until after classes and work, so when he picked me up for dinner I told him that I understood he had good intentions but it was really inappropriate for him to drive up here and do this. He was upset that he had put time and effort and money into it. Am I wrong for not being appreciative? ",

      "description": "Tl;dr at the bottom. \n\nObligatory throwaway because my gf is on reddit and knows my primary. \n\nMe and my now gf are college sweethearts and have been together for almost 5 years now. After college ended, we both went to different cities for our careers.\n\nWe've been in an LDR for 3 years now, though we do meet every 3 to 4 months. Initially, my job didn't pay much, so she visited me, and now that I've got a good income, I visit her. I don't think the issue lies in this, but wanted to give proper context.\n\nA year and a half back, we decided to meet each other's parents. She came over to my house first. This is where my question starts.\n\nMy mother is a bit of a snob. Quite a lot, actually. She believes she is a great person and has achieved a lot. Honestly, she has achieved quite a lot in her life, and inspite of being a woman (my country had a glass ceiling for women when she was in her career's infancy). But she shows a lot of attitude. I've grown used to it, given she is my mother, but I know my s/o would feel different. I had discussed this with her before the meeting.\n\nMy mother behaved fine other than one really humiliating episode over etiquette. That was BAD. And not in front of me (though I know it happened, my mother's and my gf's versions match)\n\nAfter my gf told me, I fought with my mother and have stopped talking with her more or less. I apologized to my gf on behalf of my mother. I forbade my mother frok ever talking to my gf and showed my gf this when it was brought up.\n\n3 months later, I went to meet her parents. They are delightful. Her brother also welcomed me happily. They have very strict rules on hygiene, which I didn't know about and fucked up quite a few times. Her mother explained them to me each time politely and I soon adopted them inside her house. But my gf kept shouting at me, both in front of her parents and without. \n\nNow its a year since and her parents had a medical condition they were being operated on. I came to help them to their house. What started out as a simple operation soon developed complications. All throughout this, my gf has been berating and shouting at me over every small thing. I can understand to some extent if it's not infront of her hospitalized parents, but she even does that in front of them.\n\nFor context, our country doesn't look too well on physical comforting in front of parents. Also, my gf doesn't shout at me otherwise, just at her home (barring the twice a month fights we have)\n\nTl;dr Am I the asshole for being angry at my shouting gf? She suffered one humiliating episode with my mother and I didn't know their hygiene rules, which I flouted.",

He used to be so sweet and weird and fun and kind and supportive. I loved him so much, and then he started being manipulative and jealous and drive all my friends away. I broke up with him after a long time together. \n\nThe third installment of the series is coming out soon and seeing all the fanart and gifs and commercials is making me have these stupid thoughts, like what if I made the wrong choice in breaking up with him? What if I gave him more time to work on the jealousy? Maybe we would still be together. \n\nThe worst of it is that I daydreamed about asking him to leave his new gf and take me back. Just awful shitty thoughts. I’m just scared of watching the newest movie with my current SO (who I love very much and have been with for 3 years now) because it brings up old uncomfortable feelings. \n\nAm I an asshole?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for six months. We both go to college, but we each go to a different school, located about two hours away from each other. Needless to say, it is difficult to maintain this long distance relationship. To combat this, we have vowed to see each other as often as possible. This began as just trying to find days to see each other in our busy schedules, but soon evolved into me just driving the two hours after classes on Friday, spending the night on Friday and Saturday, and leaving Sunday afternoon, because I’m the only one with a vehicle. This system has worked relatively well. We have had to work around our jobs, social lives, and families, but we’ve been able to make it work. However, my job often requires me to work strange hours, and sometimes I need to work weekends. My girlfriend knows and understands this, and she is fine with seeing me whenever I am able to make it out there, when it comes to my job.\n\nThis weekend, however, has turned into a total shitshow. I was not originally scheduled to work the weekend, but I offered to cover for my pregnant coworker. My GF was fine with this, as our schedules worked out to where I drove over this past Tuesday night and spent Wednesday with her. She asked me to come on Sunday, as that’s the only other day I didn’t have to work. So I am working today and tomorrow, but on Sunday, my father just informed me we are having a big get-together for my brother’s birthday. Being together to celebrate is very important in my family, so I have an obligation to go. It’s also important to note that I haven’t seen my family in weeks because I only leave campus to see my GF. I told my GF that I could not make it to see her on Sunday because of this birthday party, but she was welcome to come if she wanted, I would just go pick her up. She has always expressed disdain towards my family, so it’s understandable that she wouldn’t want to go.  But now she is upset with me because I can’t see her on Sunday due to this unexpected change in plans. She says that I never make time for her, and that I should want to be with her more than with my family. I think she’s overreacting, because I’ll see her again next weekend.\n\nSo, AITA for skipping a predetermined day to see my girlfriend for an impromptu family event?",

      "description": "I usually take the bus to and from school, since the public transport in my city is usually on time, and my family doesn't own a car. Today, I had more luggage than usual for a couple reasons. One, I had gym class and practice for my sport, so I had my gym bag with my clothes, sneakers, uniform, etc. Second, my backpack was pretty voluminous, since I was bringing home textbooks to study for my exams next week. The luggage rack at the front of the bus was already considerably full of stuff, so I opted not to leave my bags there. The gym bag is a sling/cross body one that I kept on when I sat down, while I took the backpack off. I put the backpack on one knee, while keeping the sling bag tight to the other side of my body. It was poking a little bit into the seat of person sitting next to me, but they didn't seem to mind when I asked them if it was alright. If I had chosen to stay standing or put one of the bags on the floor, they would have taken up a lot more valuable standing room than they were already. So, the stops pass, and the person next to me gets off and nobody takes their place. The way I have my sling bag positioned, its taking up some of the adjacent seat, but that's the best I could do with the space allotted and the size of the bags. If somebody wished, they could easily sit down. At this point, the entire bus is packed with people, but not to the point where you can't move around. This young-to-middle aged guy standing a couple feet behind me taps my shoulder roughly to get my attention, and he tells me, a person who is wearing a school uniform and is *clearly* a student to, and I quote: \"Move my bag because its f*****g crowded\". Obviously, I'm not used to being spoken to this way, so I tried my best to adjust my bag so it's off the seat. It wasn't much of an improvement, but the seat was a bit more open. Even after this, nobody moved to take up the seat that was \"vacated\" by my bag, including the guy who told me to move it. I kept a straight face on the bus, but I felt terrible after getting off. \n\ntl;dr I had big bags on crowded transport, random guy tells me, a student, to \"Move my bag because its f*****g crowded\", despite me trying to minimize the space it took up.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My fiance and I are quiet people and decided that we really don't want a  big, fancy wedding and we wanted to keep things really simple. We have been long distance for a while now (different countries) and we also like to smoke weed (this is relevant later). We are planning on having an elopement style wedding in Colorado where we won't need to have witnesses, no big reception, no small talk with acquaintances we'd feel obligated to invite, no pressures to put on a show or make our special day something that someone else wants. We wanted to have a small get together so my fiance can meet and get to know some of my close friends that he hears me talk about all the time. They all either know we smoke and have no issue with it or smoke themselves. I also currently live in California where it's legal. \n\nMy mom was the head cheerleader in high school and has the lasting personality traits to match. She always dreamed of dressing her daughter in pink and planning my wedding and loves watching what I consider garbage shows like Say Yes To The Dress and 90 Day Fiance. She also has a hard time seeing things through others' perspectives. We're clearly at odds on this wedding. I asked her if she was ok with us doing an elopement on our own since my fiance's family can't come to the wedding and we wanted to keep it fair so by just us doing it as just us, nobody's family feels left out and we get to have our small and personal wedding. My mom said she was ok with it and that we're in our 30s and that it's perfectly ok for a couple to not want a traditional wedding. \n\nMy mom insisted on throwing a celebratory party for us at her house when we get back from Colorado as a married couple. We agreed as it would allow us to get together with my close friends like we wanted. At first she told me the guest list for it would be up to me and we could keep it small. Not too long after that, she started talking about wanting to have the party catered and inviting a bunch of people including neighbors (some of which I don't even like), her coworkers that I've never even met, family friends I don't really talk to... needless to say the guestlist more than doubled with just the people she wants to have there. She also demanded that we don't smoke while people are there even though she doesn't have a problem with us smoking in the garage at hers any other time. \n\nI told her I needed to draw the line there and that this is supposed to be a party for me and my fiance and shouldn't include people that we don't know, don't want to see, and who would have a problem with us being who we are. I told her that if we were having a full wedding reception, we wouldn't be inviting all these random people so this should be no different. Her response to this was \"there will be so many people, you won't even notice\"... which is ***exactly*** what we don't want. I also mentioned that it's not like we'd be super stoned or inviting any minors (she wants to invite my 16 year old cousin) to partake and that we'd smoke in the garage as usual and that'd it'd be no different than people showing up and everyone having a glass of wine in their hand. When I stood my ground and said that if she wants to invite a bunch of random people and make this a bigger party than we wanted, she needed to make sure that the people she's inviting know and are ok with us smoking weed casually. She threw a fit and said if we can't go a few hours without getting high, just to forget the whole party and now she's refusing to host the party and won't talk to me. \n\nI mean I get that she isn't getting to have the big wedding for her daughter that she may have always imagined and maybe she feels like I'm also taking something else away from her by not wanting a big reception too. I just don't think it's too much to ask that if she's going to throw us a party that it be within the limits of what we would actually enjoy or am I supposed to just be grateful and suck it up? Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "This is probably going to sound weird to a lot of you, but here goes. \n\nMy boyfriend (31M) and I (23F) have been together for 4 years and living together for more than 2. I've been finishing up school, while he has a very well-paying job and also substantial family money. He pays most of our day to day expenses, though certain things I have always paid, like some food, clothing, my own phone, car, and tuition. Our condo is owned by his family business.\n\nWe regularly attend events associated with his work or go out ourselves to clubs in the city. We like to get dressed up - for ourselves and for each other - and I spent a lot on clothes, shoes etc. as does he. We're open when it comes to communication, and he has certain expectations for my own appearance at these events, especially work-related ones. I'm sure some of you are scoffing at me as a trophy wife (or gf) or something, but it's more to do with his reputation and also making connections in his industry, and it's something we both enjoy. Anyway, a short dress and some nice heels are frequent themes.\n\nSince I have student debt and a limited income, I feel it would be reasonable for him to pay for my expenses when we're going to an event that is related to his work. While he may gift me clothes or accessories, he says I should still be paying for my own clothing on a day-to-day basis. He'll buy me drinks, but I sometimes have to pay cover at a club. In a way, we split things as if we have equal means, but we don't at all.\n\nThis issue arose again when I decided to get breast implants. It's something both he and I have wanted for a while, but I expected that he would pay the cost for it himself. Instead, he thinks we should share the cost, because I'm going to benefit from it in the instagram modeling that I do. He's probably right, but given our finances I was just expecting that he would pay for it. He then said that if he was going to pay for it all, then he'd want input on it and some terms. That doesn't bother me - I want his input anyway - but I'm sure his terms will be to wear certain outfits as I know that's a turn on for him. \n\nAnyway, it seems to me that he has the means to pay for essentially all of these expenses - food, clothing, car etc. - without so much as a dent in his own finances. I could pay off my student debt and we'd be on our way. While I've hinted in this direction, I haven't asked directly yet. Before I do so, I thought I'd ask if this makes me the asshole for expecting this or thinking it is reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hey reddit, I’m almost 20 and I’ve been on my learner’s permit for 4 years now. There’s nothing particularly bad about my driving (my parallel parking leaves something to be desired, of course), but my mother’s reasoning is that I do not have a vehicle. Fine, fair enough. I got a job as soon as she allowed me and figured I’d fix up one of the two vehicles that have just been sitting in our driveway as it wouldn’t take more than $600 - She disagreed with this and barred me from doing so. I proposed an offer to her wherein she purchased a shitty vehicle of my choosing that would pass our mutual expectations - I’d also pay for my insurance and all maintenance with the exception of something big happening. I told her I’d pay her back plus interest for any expenses incurred that she paid for. I just want her to fix the mess she made with my license in the first place (I went to drivers ed and finished everything with high ratings but she never let me go back for any of my paperwork or the test... 4 years ago). I’m not in the mood to go through all of that again and I told her that she wasted $400+ because of this but she’s very childish and believes that anything she thinks is the truth, regardless. \n\nAll that I’ve asked for for any occasion has been my license and a vehicle. She won’t let me purchase my own but will not let me do anything else. I’m forced to be dependent on her yet I don’t live with her and I resent being dependent on anybody. In my opinion, this is ridiculous and illogical. I want to get a job but I cannot without a vehicle. She will not allow me my license until I have a job where I currently live. I don’t really care if I don’t get anything for the next several years at all, I just want these two things. I understand that we had money issues but she just spent $8k in ~3 months on various unnecessary items so I don’t really find this to be anything valid. She likes to bring up all the things she’s purchased “for me” that “I don’t appreciate” but 99% of these items were  not requested by me, nor do I have any interest or need for them. I appreciate the gesture but I don’t see the point. \n\nSo reddit... AITA?",

      "description": "My grandfather died in early February and he left  his house to me since i'm the eldest grandchild and all the belongings in the house to his children. However he gave his wife a life interest which means she can stay in the house as long as she wants to so i share the house with her.\n\nBit of backstory, everyone HATES his wife because she treated my family like shit for over 20 years. A few weeks ago my mother came by the house because she wanted to take one of his TVs to her house and the widow threw a tantrum, openly disrespecting my mother and threatening to call the police if she didn't leave. My mother told her she didn't want any trouble she just wanted the TV which was rightfully hers and that would be it. A lawyer came and settled it and my mother took the TV and that was that.\n\nYesterday she sent my mother a cease and desist letter at her workplace as well as a restraining order preventing my mother from coming near the house. My mom used to be the only person in the family who actually liked her so this caused a rift. Now the wife is threatening me with a lawyer because i don't pay bills (I'm still a student so i don't work yet).My close family think she's doing all this because she wants the house for herself. So i decided to end all this and sell the house and all the stuff in it.  Now her family who have nothing to do with the issue are attacking me saying she'll have no place to live and i'm a horrible person but i've had enough of this conflict. Am i the asshole?",

I'm sorry if there are unnecessary details in there, but I'm just trying to clarify my situation as much as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's this girl I know who goes to the same university I go to. We don't share any classes or anything, but she's friends with both my brother and my cousin, so I see her around. I've noticed over the past year that she's been trying to get closer to me; she even said she wants to be friends with me, rather than just acquaintances. I don't really mind, but I'm pretty sure what she really wants is to start something between us. I know she's into me (for several reasons, not the matter of discussion here) and I'm not interested. Not in her, not in \"finding love\", and not in any sort of romantic and/or sexual relationship. So I figured, since she's not really my friend and she might bring drama/complications into my life that I'd rather avoid, I am not gonna let things grow more than they have to. I never start any conversations, never plan any hangouts that involve her, and just generally drop subtle hints that I'm not interested in relationships at this stage in my life. Regardless, she still talks to me/hang outs with me every now and then. I am not annoyed, since she's reasonable, not too clingy, not overdoing things. We're basically closer to being \"friends\" than we were before, but we're still not.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow a week or two ago, she texted me and told me she really needs to talk. I say \"sure, whats up?\" and she proceeds to open up to me about her depression and suicidal tendencies. She told me that she tried to commit suicide and we had a long talk. I don't care for her much, but she's human and I tried my best to listen and help, and I recommended that she sees a therapist. And thats it. I didnt ask again. I met her at uni a few days ago and we just had a short small talk and thats all. I dont consider her someone close to me or a friend and I don't really care about her (I mean I do care to an extent, since she's a decent human and a person I know, but not more than that), but I really feel bad. I'm scared that she's trying to lure me in to build a connection, but I'm even more scared that she'd actually commit suicide and I'd have to bear the guilt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also know that she didnt open up to my brother and cousin (who are pretty close friends with her). So AITA for not being there for her when she chose to open up to me of all people?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should also note that a very close friend of mine recently turned out to have been a lying/deceptive asshole for the past 4-5 years, which is why I'm generally more careful with who I believe/trust than I used to be.",

      "description": "Before I start, I want to say that I'm using a throwaway account for this because I don't want to take any risks with my family, since I'm not entirely sure what platforms they all use.\n\nLet me start by saying that I'm a 19 year old full-time student going to a community college. I have around 3-4 classes a day, and I take the bus 3 cities over because I don't own a car and my parents can't take me because of conflicting times with my other siblings. Fair enough, the college pays for my bus rides all semester which is included with my tuition, and it's about a 2 hour bus ride from my house to my college anyways. Being a full time student is rough because I don't have time to work later in the day which means I don't have any income for myself to spend on movies, food, etc. I get all my money from doing chores around the house and my father gives me money from time to time. I greatly appreciate him for this, and fully know well that he isn't required to do this. However, he's been using this as an excuse to get me out of my room.\n\nOne of the main reasons I stay in my room is usually because I'm either doing my homework, which has been overwhelming me lately, and to listen to Spotify and chat with my online friends while I get my stuff done. I close the door so I can focus and only ever come down to eat once in a while. However my parents don't really like this and usually tell me to get out of my room, which I do after I finish all my work. If they don't ask, I usually just spend the day playing some casual games with my friends to help me relax. When I'm downstairs, I don't talk, I don't do anything. I just sit there and look for any chance to go back up to my room.\n\nThe main reason I don't like to socialize with my family is because they often decide to poke fun at my personal life, saying how I'm never home, how lazy I am of a person for not doing anything all day, and all that. I absolutely despise this, and have told them all numerous times that I take the damn bus to school. They tell me I should get a job so I don't have to worry about that and I tell them that I can't because again, I take the bus. (My classes start at around 8:00am and I have to grab the bus at 5:30am because of the long rides. Classes end at 4:00pm and I get home around 6:00pm, depending on whether or not the bus is behind schedule, which it usually is. Bus service around here sucks. Keep in mind by this time it's usually dark.) This leads to even more bullying by my family, saying I \"always have an excuse for everything\", which supposedly makes me lazy? \n\nAfter all this bullying, I've tended to completely avoid them as much as I can. But even more so lately, my father has always called me down to take care of my brother because he wants someone to play with. I wouldn't have a problem with this (during my free time) if it wasn't for the fact that all he ever does is watch the TV, and on full blast too, like he's in some god damn theater. Same goes for my mother, always on her phone either chatting with relatives or browsing Facebook. I always ask them why they can't take care of him when I actually have things to do and they're just sitting there. They then turn the finger on me and make me seem like the bad person, saying that I never want to hang out with my brother and that I \"hate him\". This isn't even close to true. I love my brother with all my heart and would take a bullet for him, and hearing that really just aggravated me and making it seem like the guilt trip is working. Whether I like it or not, I'm forced to have to go downstairs and stay with them, but the entire time is just hell. The TV is on full blast of course, my sister is allowed to stay upstairs and chat with her friends on FaceTime, both my mother and father are laughing and enjoying themselves and I'm downstairs with nothing. If I pull out my phone, my parents tell me to put it away. They don't want me to be entertained at all. I'd at least enjoy it if I had someone to talk to.\n\nNow for my siblings, they don't get off on bullying me like my parents do, but they usually never pay attention to me and use me as \"the bait\". I'm always the one getting blamed for anything, and my parents, being the bullies they are believe it. I know that probably sounds exaggerated, but believe me, it's not. My sister only ever talks to me when she has literally nothing else to do, and her talks are incredibly short. My little brother can barely talk at all, so I can't really communicate well with him.\n\nOn weekends, they tend to go out to fun places like parks, fairs, and have even gone to amusement parks 3 times without waking me up first and asking if I want to go. They only ever absolutely need me on the weekends if they're going to the store or to run errands, to make me do all the heavy lifting (like carrying grocery bags or pushing the cart).\n\nTL;DR - Full-time car-less college student can't work, never has time for family, and they guilt trip him since he never hangs out with them, despite parents bullying him and siblings never wanting to socialize. This leads to him not wanting to hang out with his family in any way and bad relationship with them.",

      "description": "I’m on mobile, so sorry for formatting. \n\n\nMy friend recently came out as gay to us. We were nothing but supportive and accepting of her. She was worried we would think she had a crush on one of us and we told her not to worry about it because we are children and even if she did have a crush on one of us it wouldn’t change anything. \n\nPretty mature in my opinion. Imagine my surprise when I got home and looked on Instagram (this happened a week ago) to find a photo of lesbian stuff (women kissing etc) with the caption “I just came out to my friends. I don’t care about the hate I’m getting I’m just happy to be me”. \n\nIn my opinion this came across as my friends giving her hate based on her sexuality and I didn’t want to be portrayed as that kind of person. I confronted her at school the next day about it and told her to either edit or remove the post. She said I was an asshole and that I didn’t have a say. \n\nMy friendship group is massive. It consists of over 15 people who chill with me everyday. None of these people gave her shit for it. \n\n\nAITA for insisting she remove a post that paints me in a bad light?",

I listed them online and did a social media post and have been getting some pretty decent offers and I really need the money right now (between jobs and moving). \n\nI got a message from a friend of the ex (who I haven’t ever talked to or heard from since we split almost a DECADE ago) and he says that the system is his and he recognized the games from his childhood and he wants it back. \n\nI really need the money right now, AND I took the system because we EACH had one (2 in the house, one was mine and I guess the other one was actually this friends’) and we split up the games and each took ones we liked or separated ones we had doubles of. \n\nAITA for saying “sorry dude, this is my system and maybe some of these games were yours but ur friend effed up and they’re mine now so I’m selling them; I need the money.” ? \n",

My mother told me that she would pay his ticket and I was getting angry because I felt being used but it was already too late to cancel the movie, she wanted me to pay the ticket for him and then on a later moment she would give me the price of the ticket to myself.

      "description": "Something that's been weighing heavy on me. Long story short. I fall super in love with this girl. But things are going on in her life so we stay friends for a couple months. I made it clear I wanted more than friends, but I was still helping her out around her house as just a friend. Always making it clear I wanted more. I'm this time we were together a lot. We both flirted etc. Anyway, she finally let's me take her out and she's miserable the whole time. We've went out as (i paid) and everything was great. \n\nThis is the bad part. Not saying I was in the right, I absolutely wasn't. I drop her off after the date and walk her to the door. I go in for a kiss and get a hug instead. Ok, she's not feeling it. I was ok with that. Here's where I go stupid. As she walks away my plan was to grab her shoulder, turn her around gently and give her a frown face kinda to let her know I was mad. So I grab the hood of her hoodie, and she tells me goodnight, I'm ruining my chance for a second date in a harsh tone. I was kinda in shock so I held on longer than I wanted to. I'm fully admitting I messed up. That wasn't ok.\n\nSo the next day I call her first thing, I planned on helping her out more with her house. I said sorry and asked if she was mad. She said no. I got to her house and could tell she was pissed. I told her to yell at me and tell me it wasn't ok, to which she replied I was fine. Then she goes off on me. Telling me to get out. Comparing me to her abusive ex and the guy that raped her. She told me to call her in a couple weeks, but we never could've fixed that. I left and that was that.\n\nThat was 10 months ago. I never would've done anything to hurt her, and was just playing around like we both did. I get it, it wasn't ok. I made a mistake. I still beat myself up over it. Obviously there's more to the story, but I don't want to paint her as the bad guy. So am I the asshole for making the mistake, or do I just need to forgive myself?",

I put it out there because I don't have the same views as everyone and I respect people enough to use drugs as they please, but I will not be in a relationship with someone who smokes weed frequently. \n\nShe agreed and said that it wasn't something she liked either. \n\nWe went out for a second date days after and I could smell marijuana on her as she was in my car. This confused me as it didn't make sense because she also said that she disliked weed and other drugs too. \n\nAs we kept seeing each other her breath and clothes some days (not all the time) would smell like weed here and there, but not every single time I saw her. I didn't say anything because I didn't think it was my place and since I'm a little bit anxious I didn't want to offend her if my suspicions weren't right. \n\nA few days ago she asked me out of the blue \"To what extent do you hate weed?\" (I'm paraphrasing) so I answered and told her that I would not be in a relationship with someone who frequently used it. \nThis is when she came clean and said she used to use a lot of different drugs but now she only smokes weed as a way to sleep, fight anxiety, feel happier and laugh. \n\nI was unhappy and felt disrespected that I was lied to. I asked her how frequently and I found out that it was a multi daily thing. I like this girl but as I said will not date someone who uses it frequently. \n\nShe is never going to stop using it. \"It's apart of me and I can't be happy without it\" in her words, and I wasn't going to ask her to stop using it. \n\nI met with her tonight and suggested a breakup and she understood my reasons, we ended it on good terms but I can't help but feeling like an asshole. \n\nAm I?",

I checked the menu and it was well out of my budget, but friends had already finalized on the place with a time. I was worried about cancelling and being viewed as flakey, and so I went with the honest route. *'Sorry I can't join for dinner at restaurant due to my budget, but I'd love to catch up in another way while you are in town.'* I tried following up with plans for the friend in town to cater to his schedule with cheap options, such as coffee, but got barely more than a 'lol ok' for replies. Feel like shit, and am super worried I am the asshole.  \n\n\nTLDR; I feel like a huge a-hole for ghosting a friend who was in town, but I did a budget for the holidays and I just couldn't stomach the dinner cost.

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years. We have been planning our engagement for a bit, and I had one big rule for the proposal and that was that he not involve anyone else in the proposal but us. I don't want to get too far into the backstory, but my ex husband essentially went behind my back to ask my parents for my hand, and I ended up forced into the marriage by pressure from him and my parents. My boyfriend knew this and definitely knew my rule because I asked him over and over not to include other people.\n\nIn spite of this, he decided to propose by first asking my children (from my first marriage) for permission and then included them in the actual proposal by having them hold up signs during the proposal. I wanted to be happy in the moment, but I was so hurt that he went against the one request I made.\n\nI ended up taking him aside and asking him why he ignored what I asked of him. He told me it was different because they're my children and us getting married is their decision as much as it is mine and his. This really hurt me given that he knew how important my autonomy in the decision was to me. I told him I couldn't say yes to the proposal given the circumstances.\n\nMy children are furious with me and my oldest won't even speak to me. My friends called me selfish for not seeing the thoughtfulness in his proposal. I feel like no one is on my side, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm the problem. Am I an asshole for saying no to his proposal because he asked my children for permission and then included them?",

      "description": "I dated my ex for 3 years and ended up finding out she was cheating for about half of that time. I broke up with her about 4 months ago and she moved out of my house. I ended up hearing from friends that she was painting me as the bad guy who drove her into the beds of all those guys she cheated with. No one believed her and she ended up isolating herself from the friend group because people really didn’t like the way she handled things as far as cheating and with the break up.\n\nHer parents recently were killed in a bad car accident. It’s a shame, they were very good people. I enjoyed the time I spent around them and they treated me well. They died about 5 days ago. \n\nMy friends have been telling me over the past few days that she was asking about me and saying she wishes she could be with me and talk to me about the loss and apologize. \n\nI don’t buy the bullshit. This isn’t about her being sincerely remorseful about anything. This is her wanting to manipulate me into emotionally supporting her through this. Her parents dying sucks and I’m sure that’s awful to deal with, but it is firmly her problem, not mine. \n\nI told my friends this and they said they’d soften it but make sure she knows I’m not the one she should be calling or coming to.\n\nShe came over to my house early this morning a mess and crying and apologizing and begging at my doorstep. I thought about what I’d say but everything was going to be needlessly cruel so I just shit the door and she screamed so loud and for so long my neighbors called the police.\n\nI didn’t get in trouble or anything but it was embarrassing and I had to deal with explaining things to them. \n\nMy standing on this is pretty much that it sucks for her and more for her parents. But this isn’t my job anymore—to deal with supporting her through anything.",

      "description": "Obligatory I'm on mobile warning and a tl;dr at the bottom for those who don't want to read. \n\nI live in a rental house with a few other people and we are all miserable. Our lease is up in May thankfully and to help the move I've been packing the stuff from my bedroom that I'm not using and moving it into a storage unit.\n\nRecently I've been debating on moving all my stuff that's in the shared spaces too. You see a few of my roommates are a little inconsiderate when it comes to using other people's things. \n\nI've supplied 95% of the kitchen things (the microwave, toaster, all the plates, dishes, pots, pans, etc.) and a few things in one of our living rooms (tv, xbox, ect.). I have no problem letting people use these things, but my roommates have been testing my limits.\n\nIn the living room downstairs another roommate has a TV for all of us to use, the others broke it and didn't tell her. They still wanted to watch/play video games there, so the decided it'd be a smart move to take MY TV downstairs to use rather than just using it upstairs. When I found out I was pissed. I kind of yelled at them and I'm not proud to have raised my voice. \n\nAnd it's not just that case either, they have no regard for things that aren't their's. One of them has been caught using shower stuff that isn't theirs and both of them have been caught taking food or drinks without asking, and using things without cleaning them or putting them back where they belong. They have a history of not locking doors (the front and back), getting upset that we won't let them do certain things in the house (have parties), and other various things.\n\nNow, I'd like to believe that I'm a good person, but they've broken me. I want to pack all the kitchen things up (except for a few things that I'd keep in my room for myself) and everything else that's mine in the living room and move it.\n\nSo, will I be the asshole?\n\nTl;dr I want to move my stuff that my roommates have been abusing out of our house and want to know if I'm in the wrong.\n",

I'm not sure if he has anger problems or if hes just not all there. He gets EXTREMELY pissed off for no reason, the first day he started yelling and cussing and everyone on the other team and on my team for not scoring something, he would say something along the lines of \" YOUR Fing CHEATING YOU F**GOTS!\" and he just went on and just yelled different stuff. Eventually everyone just got sick of it and he would just continue to insult and threaten people and the entire class hates him. Skip to 2 weeks later (today) he was playing basketball 1v1 with someone and my friend and I asked if we could make it a 2v2, he was being ok at first he was still kind of being an asshole and a sore loser but nothing really serious. Anyways we started beating them really bad and he started the usual cussing,throwing a fit,threatening. I wasn't mad at this point but I was kind of passive aggressive like if he missed I would say \" oh too bad, maybe you'll make it next time.\" To kind of piss him off and he was just yelling and threatening. At some point I said \"Hey it's your ball, I hit it out of bounce\" and I wasn't trying to be passive aggressive anymore of taunt him I was just similar telling him it's his ball. I was not expecting him to say \"STFU BIT*H, ILL BEAT YOUR ASS.\" he said that to multiple people in his short time here and everyone hates him. I dont know why and i dont usually act like this but for some reason it infuriated me like i was shaking i was so pissed off i replied with \"BEAT MY ASS, BEAT MY ASS RIGHT FU*KING NOW\" I said it a few times while walking towards him and he said \"Fu*king pu**y\" and he walked off.\nI feel like I instigated a little so that's why I'm not sure if I'm the asshole part of me feels like I did the right thing and the other part feels like a didn't \nSo you tell me",

      "description": "Ok so basically my freshman year of college is just starting, and I've already found a group of friends I enjoy hanging out with. In this group there is one girl in particular (We'll call her \"E\") that I am interested in. \n\nE and I are really good friends, and she tells me that she really wants to find a group of people that she can get close with. She also mentions how she's looking for a husband. I tell her that I'll be her friend.\n\nAs time goes on, E and I have more and more good conversations and I'm discovering that I have a love interest in her. I really like who she is as a person and think that her and I could be good partners.\n\nMore time passes and I'm certain now that I'm developing feelings. I go out of my way to do nice things for her and I take every opportunity to be with her, but it feels like it's one sided. I figure that she is just bad at expressing how she feels. \n\nOne night, her and I go to an activity (with other people) and we have a good time. I decide that I'm going to see if she would want to catch breakfast on Saturday, so I pop the question: \n\"Would you wanna go to breakfast this weekend to talk?\" \nBasically, I'm asking her out and am planning on telling her how I feel about her, but she doesn't know that.\n\nShe says that she doesn't want to go out this weekend but she isn't giving any reason why, so I keep pestering her. Eventually, I flip out and say that she's being ridiculous. I decide to distance myself from her for a little while. \n\nTwo weeks later, after letting that sink in, I decide to talk to her and apologize for acting immaturely. Also, I tell her that I was going to tell her that I really liked her, and that I wanted to take it to the next level. She says that she doesn't like me that way and that she wants to keep the friend group intact without making it awkward. Understandable. I am completely fine with this outcome.\n\nA couple weeks after this, a new guy transfers onto campus and E is all over him. She finds him super attractive and wants to start something with him, so her and her friends start to introduce him to our friend group.\n\nNone of us really like him, and it seems like E is forcing us to be friends with him. I find him super sketchy, cause he's had a rough past and has girls all over him. Also, the fact that he just decides to pop into our friend group so quickly makes all of us wary.\n\nEventually, E and this guy get into a relationship. The group is annoyed and decides to distance themselves from E for a bit but I become angry. How is it fair that I spend so much time cultivating our friendship and then all of a sudden a super hot guy transfers onto campus and you want to be in a relationship with him? I find her actions extremely shallow and heartless. So I cut her off completely. I haven't talked to her in over a month. \n\nMy friends say that I am bitter and that I need to make an attitude adjustment. I think that she put the entire group in Jeopardy just because she wanted to be with this guy.",

      "description": "I do nails for a living and a couple times these friends have asked me to do their nails for them at my house. They’ve never asked me to do it for free but it’s pretty implied it was so they wouldn’t have to pay full price at the store. So I would carry all my supplies after working 12+ hours and do their nails until almost midnight. We’d do the awkward “it’s okay you don’t owe me anything”, “no let me give you what I have” back and forth but in the end I’d accept whatever they wanted to contribute. Which was $9 TOTAL for doing this 2 or 3 times. Then they’d say “I owe you dinner next time” and never reached out to honor it. I thought I was fine with it until she started coming to my store and requesting someone else to do her nails. So now she’s willing to pay full price $25-$35 plus tip to our other friend that she’s known for a year when she’s known me her whole life. And I know it’s not a matter of quality. She doesn’t even live near my store so she can go anywhere else. I am in no way possessive or expect everyone I know to support my business. But I think it’s fucked up that she would come to the very place I work at and show more support and respect for someone else’s time. If I didn’t already do it for practically free I wouldn’t care. I was cordial the first time she came in but by the second time I didn’t even want to look at her. Then I felt bad so I asked her how she was doing, but I was getting more heated just talking to her. Someone else said “maybe she wasn’t paying you a lot because she wasn’t working yet”. But I think that’s bull because she could afford expensive makeup and purses. And if that was really the case, why not return the favor when she did have the means if she kept saying she “owed me one”? Again, I wouldn’t care if she paid me nothing if she didn’t go on to pay someone for doing the Same (if not less) work. I just think it’s the principle of it. Now I learned my lesson and know the value of my work. It’s crazy that strangers are willing to pay full price for me but this friend did not..yet she will pay someone else. So that night I posted something about “true friends won’t ask for discounts because they support your time, business, and work”.  AITA? ",

      "title": "AITA: For not turning in a group project",
      "description": "So a little lot of background. At this point in time I was moving between states (u.s.) with the new state I was moving to requiring a state test for each subject (only one test for a subject but it was spread out over three years). The school I recently went to had no such test so it's not like I was properly prepared. I had to take all the freshman tests (algebra and biology) which was a problem because the school I moved from didn't even teach biology until junior year (I was a freshman taking the junior level courses at my new school). So of course I failed the test (like super hard and they wouldn't exempt me from it or at least wait a year) so I had to take the remedial class for it! Yay!\n\nThe class was simple. It was just environmental science. Science might be my weakest subject but this class was the easiest class I was ever in.\n\nThe only problem with the class were the kids in it. Most of them had some ieps or we're just honestly stupid. The kids in this class were very annoying too. They acted like it wasn't worth their time and they were above it (most of them did drugs). The teacher was no charm either. So working with them was a pain.\n\nThe first group project comes around and we were forced to work with people around us (aka the people you sat with and seats were assigned) so boy oh boy. My group consisted of me, a girl I knew as a child who will be known as S (I lived in the area beforehand for like two years as a child), and this other girl who I swear couldn't tell the difference between a pen and pencil who will be known as L. The project was literally measure water and it's temperature and seeing if there was a difference between anything. I joke you not. That was it. The weird thing though is it was like 100 - 150 points. Homework was only like 20 - 25 so it was way more than double.\n\nNote: (S had an IEP but that was for history and English and L was just stupid and didn't put effort into everything)\n\nI couldn't get them to do anything. S wouldn't do anything other than sit on her phone snap chatting and texting her boyfriend. No matter what I told her she'd ignore me. L on the other hand was always on her school issued laptop (everyone had one and they sucked) on Skype chatting with her friends. When I told her to help she told me she didn't know what to do. It was measuring water and it's temperature. Not that hard. But I did give her the benefit of the doubt. I showed her what to do. Helped her do it. Then had her do it in front of me. Keep in mind this entire time she kept messaging her friends.\n\nWhen I asked her to do her part of it (for a stupid project there were like five pages of shit to do) she told me she didn't know how and yada yada and kept refusing to do it saying \"I don't know what to do\". Taught her what to do. The teacher showed her what to do. Nothing.\n\nSo I go to my teacher (I already had everything done but still) and asked if I could switch to another group or do it by myself. His answer. \"No. The groups are full and we don't have enough supplies.\" There were more empty groups then full groups and there was enough supplies (they had extra because we were working with glass and kids are stupid and drop glass). I asked if they'd get credit for the project even if they did nothing. And he told me that the everyone in the group would get the same grade.\n\nSo I didn't hand it in. It didn't really effect my grade considering I did the homework and classwork. But when the end of the marking period ruled around he came up to me and asked if I was going to turn it in. I asked if they were going to get credit for it. He said yes. He even went on to say how they'd benefit from it (aka they wouldn't be failing). So I outright said no. L had her friends corner me when I was leaving school and tried to force me into submitting it. Her friends were the really weird social outcasts that always smelt and not would talk about fucking Pokemon or something/one weird. In fact one even tried to stab and shoot up the school (in different years). I'm not popular in any way. My only friend was the longest time was my sister (I really didn't like the kids there) and I'm not even athletic so they probably thought if they teamed up on me they'd get me. I just laughed at them and walked away and reported it to the principal (who did something about the teacher but not the kids). S just called me a bitch more than once and made fun of the fact I stutter.\n\nS eventually got pregnant and dropped out (all at the magical age of 15). I know a few of L's friends got arrested for threatening and attempting to shoot up and stab up the school. I passed the class with an A average.\n\nThis happened a few years ago and I recently told this story to a professor I train with and she called me essentially a bitch saying \"I needed to give them a chance to pass yada yada it's my fault the one dropped out and the other got held back.\" I never felt bad for this. My mother even praised me saying while it wouldn't fly in a workplace I still did the right thing. Now I'm unsure if I did the right thing.\n\nTDLR: group members wouldn't do work teacher wouldn't do anything. Group members called me names and threatened me for not turning in project that I did all the work for. School is shitty as always.",

Since I have the biggest room in the house and, they had a lot of things with them, so I agreed expecting they'd honor the three months agreement. \n  I first realized that I had made a mistake when I reminded them a couple weeks before that the three months would be up and that I would like my room back by the end of it as agreed upon. They're are two more rooms in the house and they had gotten rid of some things so I didn't feel to bad about telling them.\n  Well my sister wasn't to happy about that so she went to my parents and told them that I wanted my room back and that she didn't want to go to a different one, my parents reminded her that it was my room at the end of the day and that I could do what I want with it.\n  Skip to about a month after the agreement was up and I got tired putting up with her Bs \"I work and do school I don't have time\" since every other day she's post pictures of her and her husband going out and eating and doing random things on there free time. Since I pay the internet bill and she gives me less then half of the bill I just told her to not worry about the bill or the internet anymore (Wich they both use for school and work) and blocked all there devices.\n  I feel bad but at the same time i honestly just got annoyed with her excuses \n(Ps: if it helps for the story she's 19 and I'm 18)\n\n",

And I think if it happened to me then I could brush it off and see the humor in it.\n\nWe ended up walking back to my apartment and we didn’t get coffee.

      "description": "First time posting, sorry it’s so long. I have a 6 yo son who was  “friends” with these 2 brothers, ages 6 and almost 11. Theyre neighborhood kids and the 6 yo is in my sons class. We’ve had issues with the younger one several times so here’s some back story... Last summer He smacked our siding with a shovel and damaged it after us only having it 2 years. He also drew on said siding (which is white) with black sharpie. We took pix and showed the parents and they shrugged it off basically saying it wasn’t their kid even tho he WROTE HIS OWN FUCKING NAME. (Just an fyi: We moved to this very little  town from the inner part of a biggish city about 3 years ago now. In the eyes of the people here we’re “alternative”. So the people around here can be pretty shitty. My husband is 6’4 n about 270 lbs very large framed with long hair with tattoos all over his body up to his chin. We are in the process of buying this, our first house, from my father in law. We’ve never ever had anything so nice so it’s a big fucking deal to us. Also It’s been def culture shock.... very different from where we’re used to. But that’s a whole other story.) Their kids are absolutely never in the wrong, even when it’s blindingly obvious. Which is clearly why they act the way they do and have no respect for other people’s things. And they so obviously think they’re better than us...  they have 2 newer nice cars and for some reason think that’s like, SO important. Also last summer, the 6yo was here for a play date, but the mom decided that means I’m full on babysitting for the day and she took off without telling us so the kid couldn’t go home when we wanted him to. I called her probably a dozen times and it kept going to voicemail. I finally hunted down the dad and he had to literally track her down by her phone. It was insane. He tells me she’s hanging out with a friend and some dude in like, a sketchy ass parking lot or some shit. He came to pick up his kid finally after he’d been at our house for a fucking 10 hour “play date” and was apologetic but kept almost yelling at me about how I shouldn’t ever trust his wife because she’s “a lying whore”. Her husband said that to me. In front of their kid. So they haven’t really hung out since all this. \n\nAnd now to what’s going on currently...so the 2 kids came back into our lives the other day. Wanting to give them another chance because my son liked the older kid so much(and we always thought he was a polite genuine good kid who helped keep his lil bro in check), we let them come and hang out. Ended up being an ok day and so they wanted to have a sleep over the next night. We said ok and they came back the next day. The mom asks if she should bring snacks, normally we’d say no but the 6 yo is constantly rummaging around the kitchen looking for snacks so we told her yes please. Well, never brought em or threw down for ordering dinner. Ok fine I can move on from that. Then the 6yo finds a paint scraper and starts trying to scrape walls all over the house. I told him stop 3x and eventually had to just take it out of his hands. Am I crazy for thinking an almost 7yo kid would know not to do that!? And having to repeat myself like that to someone else’s kid to the point I’m yelling doesn’t feel right. Ok...Things are getting tense. They’ve been over since about noon and it’s now 8 at night. Why anyone would just send their kids over to a sleep over that early in the fucking day without contacting the parents first to find out a time and then just let them hang out all goddamn day, I’ll never understand. So finally at midnight the 3 boys  are hunkered down in sleeping bags and the 2 little ones are asleep. The 11 year old is awake still and asks for some water because he has an upset stomach. I get him some and ask if he wants to sleep on the couch instead. He does. So hes wide awake sitting on the couch and we’re just talking a little and I’m asking how he’s feeling and he without even attempting to move or get up, turns his head and projectile vomits directly on our couch. It was So. Much. Puke. So my husband calls kids mom and she comes over to pick both kids up at around 1am. She comes in and kind of apologizes, then says he gets an upset stomach sometimes from certain things he eats... that’s pretty pertinent information to share with other parents who are caring for your kids, dont ya think? I could’ve completely avoided that had I fucking known. So she finally takes the kids and leaves. Then I wake up the next morning and my son asks if I could set up his tablet and I get on it and there is so much fucking porn searched into google image search... Mia Khalifa xxx. And also another porn site open and yet another porn video site called xxxyvideos.com open and playing. I totally lost my shit. My son said it was the 11 yo. I obviously totally believe that because these 6 yo kids do not have any idea how to do that. They wouldn’t put any of that together. They’re 6 going on 7. We also had another kid over who’s a friend of theirs and is 9, who spent the majority of the evening hanging out too but didn’t sleep over. So I immediately contact his parents who I’m cool with to let them know what’s up before I confront the brothers mom. His immediate reply was, it was the 11 yo and he was showing it to everyone. I remember something from that evening, the boys came and said he was doing something inappropriate and when we came to investigate, no one would tell us what it was so we thought it was just inappropriate language or something and just took the tablet and left it until the morning. What a shock to see close up penetration pix on your 6 year olds tablet, let me tell you. It’s obviously normal for kids to be curious, but this just barely 11 yo boy looked up “pussy” and specifically Mia Khalifa! So I take some time to calm down and compose a very level headed and probably too polite message to her saying what happened. And she immediately deflects and tells me all the things my kid did to her kid...(none of it was even valid or comes close to the porn shit. They’re kids... they wrestle and play fight. But after last night it’s apparent the 6year olds don’t get along and I found myself apologizing for my son and his behavior which fucks me up So bad!) and she actually wrote to me in all seriousness, “I KNOW when my kids lie and tell the truth and he’s telling the truth that he didn’t search that”. Wow. Because every little boy who gets caught watching porn is totally going to admit it, especially to their mom. And I’m pretty sure the way she went about it with her kid was the total wrong way... See what I mean about how their kids do nothing wrong!? She also goes right to blaming the 9yo and also insinuates that it could be my fucking 6yo!?!? Seriously!? A 6 year old!!! So I wrote back a message just completely ending it by telling her the searches have date and time stamps on them and my husband saw your kid with the tablet at that time and he was literally the only one on it pretty much all night, especially who was being tattled on for looking at inappropriate stuff. And I told her I know all she’s going to do is deflect and I don’t want to go round and round so let’s just leave it at your kids are never allowed here again. Don’t get a message back because I don’t think there was any way to reply without sounding hella petty. \nBut here I am a full day later, still stewing because, she never even offered to come help clean up her kids vomit, like didn’t even give an inkling that she wanted to try and make anything right. It’s soaked thru to the fucking core. I’ll never fully get the smell out. And after all the shit they’ve trashed in our house, I legit want... something. I know it was an accident on his part, I don’t blame him. (Even tho he’s 11 and was totally fine until the second and didn’t even try to like, not puke on our fucking couch.) But like I said she never ever lifted a finger to try to help me clean up or to write to apologize the next day or anything. I personally can’t imagine doing that. So, am I the asshole for wanting her to pay for the professional cleaning of our couch after her kid puked on it? If she wasn’t so fucking dismissive it wouldn’t be so bad and I’d manage but I’m fuming mad about her insane entitlement.",

      "description": "There was this night we had studied together at his place and I stayed the night. It was rather uncomfortable from the get-go because he was saying he wasn't feeling well, but he didn't have a fever and didn't think it was serious. Anyway he was very agitated in bed.  \n \n\nI had finally fallen asleep, when I woke up and found the lights on, and my BF kneeling in front of a puddle of vomit on his carpet. I ask what's going on and he says like \"sorry, do you think you can help me clean? Keep falling down\" He was speaking weird like speaking was annoying him. I told him he couldn't make me clean after his own mess and he was cryptic and I think now he said something like he thought he was allowed to ask but he wasn't making demands.  \n \n\nAnyway he's just staying there doing nothing and I start telling him the smell is horrible. He tells me to take the blankets and go sleep on the couch. I tell him he should just ckean it up he says like \"sorry can't clean\". I leave the room to go for the couch and I just see him lie down on the carpet next to the puddle and I ask what he's doing. He says like \"can't get up. Need sleep\".  \n \n\nNext morning I find him asleep there on the ground. The smell is horrible. I wake him up and tell him he must take care of it now. He says he will but he is barely moving and is also not getting ready. (He has to be at work in an hour). I had to leave for school. At the lunch pause I had given it enough thoughts that that experience had been disgusting and he was trying to get me to clean it up as he wasn't touching it. So I texted him to tell him I didn't want to date someone with that flaw of character and I was breaking up with him. He responded that he understood and thanking me for the good times.  \n \n\nSince then our friends have been texting me nonstop that I'm the worst partner in the world if I will not help someone who has a stomach flu.  \n \n\nI've asked my brother and my dad to go fetch my thing I left at his place but he refused to let them in. My friends say I'm terrible for that too because I didn't tell him they would come, and he couldn't have boxed my stuff and it's normal he wouldn't want to invite them in his place so they can just grab my things themselves. He says he would have given them my tablet but he couldn't because they'd force themselves in if he did.  \n ",

      "description": "I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting issues.\n\nI'm 14 and in 9th grade now, but this happened about a year ago in the 8th grade. Not too long of a story but I'm getting hate for this again and I dont know if I'm the asshole or not.\n\nI was in 8th grade, really liked this girl and all that. My friend was over at my house, just me and him. We decided to play rock paper scissors and the loser would have to text his crush that they liked her. Of course, I lost... I text her and turns out she likes me too. Shocker. Let's call her Girl A \n\nWe had been \"talking\" (both like each other, just kinda like a step before dating) for a couple months and she had told me she loved me the night before, so I thought I was doing pretty good. Next day, I ask her out. She says no. I'm confused af and dont know what to do. She starts liking another guy, then about 2 weeks later she begs for me to come to a school dance with her (really just a place to hang out, no real dancing or anythin). I go, she seems sad the whole time. I text her after and ask her what the problem was, and she said she \"REAAAALLLLLLYYYY\" liked me and it was upsetting her that I wasnt talking to her anymore. I tell her I still liked her, and we start talking again. \n\nChristmas break comes around, and I feel like were doing fine. Then she doesnt text me for a while and I text her a couple days before Christmas. She completly shuts me down and stops texting me. She doesnt text me to apologize, anything like that, for a few days. I'm also going through some family stuff as of then, but I won't get into that. So I'm really sad about all that's going on, and some other girl texts me, we'll say Girl B. So Girl B tells me that she is into me and all, I barely know her but she is helping me not be so sad. I havent heard from Girl A for a while so I say fk it and go for Girl B. Now we start dating. \n\nI get back to school after and my whole friend group hates me (Girl A is in this group, girl B Is not). I'm so confused, as I thought Girl A stopped liking me, but apparently she still had feelings for me and I guess I was just missing it. Girl B and I split after about a month, because she cheated. A couple months later, I run into Girl A in the hallway and she hugs me and tells me she is sorry. She walks away without saying anything else.\n\nOkay I know this is cringey as hell but I really need to know if I'm the asshole or not. Ofc this is biased, like 99% of the posts here, but I gave it my best to make it fair. \n\nLet me know if you need more info. I'd also love someone to talk to right now. \n\n",

      "description": "AITA here? I've been talking with this girl for about a month and a half. I find it difficult to find people both physically and emotionally attractive but it clicked for her. The last few weeks she's been really distant so I asked her \"hey are you still interested, or is it time for me to move on? I'm not gonna be upset if it is.\" She told me she was still very interested and had just been really busy with work so I accepted it. She's blown me off twice before this pretty majorly since we started talking by way of rain-checking last minute on a nice dinner, then doing the same on the reschedule for \"family reasons.\" I figured \"Hey NBD, it's not my place to get involved in her family matters especially if we aren't exclusive.\" She also randomly has called me in the middle of the night a few times incredibly depressed and me trying to show I'm boyfriend material stayed up with her and consoled her. So yesterday she was having a bad day so I told her to tell me about it and she responds \"well I'm super drunk and I spent the day trying to get my ex back and found out he's dating someone new.\" I asked her if that was why she'd been so distant lately and she confirmed. I was calm about it at first but angry a few hours later and just told her \"stop playing games with me and fuck off. I'm sick of putting so much effort into you and you only putting it back in when it's convenient for you. I'm not your rebound or your toy whenever you feel like it. You've been stringing me along because telling someone you're interested in them while you actively pursue your ex is bullshit, especially if you aren't up front about it. You don't have to reciprocate the feelings but at least be fucking honest.\" her friends have been blowing up my phone all day saying what I did was uncalled for and that I'm a real asshole but I feel like I needed to stand up for myself sooner or later.",

      "description": "I (23F) dance West Coast Swing. I started dancing in September on 2018. It's my favorite social hobby. I want to continually improve in both following and leading; I accept any and all feedback at all times; no feedback for me is unsolicited. Today, my instructors had a dance gathering at their house, and about two hours in I asked one of them for feedback in my dancing (because she knows my dancing far better than I do). I have a competition coming up the weekend after the next, so I want to improve as much as possible before then. She pointed out that I tend to take ginormous steps and bend my legs (she said this in a much nicer way, of course). I am very happy that I was made aware of this; however, I wish that someone had said something earlier because bad habits are much harder to break over time... I'm more of a social dancer, and my first ever private lesson is during the competition weekend, so I understand that in socials people tend to focus more on their own dancing and having fun rather than their partner's dancing. Also, SOP is usually \"no teaching on the dance floor,\" but in order for me to improve, I need to be aware of all of my mistakes... AITA for wishing that someone had said something earlier? Is my head up my butt? Am I basically asking people to think less of themselves and more of me? The world doesn't revolve around me; I wouldn't want anyone to have to bend over backwards to help me with my dancing, but maybe just a few tips or points to make me aware of some things that I can't see in my own dancing (coming from a third-person point of view, impossible to see from a first-person point of view)......",

      "title": "AITA for banning someone with Asperger’s from my group?",
      "description": "I run a weekly group for people with, or have experienced, anxiety.\n\nTwo months ago a guy joined.  He seemed friendly enough but suspected he had a learning disability.\n\nOne of my regulars told me that he had been messaging her and that it was strange.  I saw the texts he sent her; kinda weird, not dirty or explicit, more like a very socially awkward attempt at flirting.  She didn’t seem very upset about it but was slightly uncomfortable.\n\nThen I remembered he would always ask about where female members were if they didn’t attend but never the men. \n\nDuring next meeting I clearly reiterate the rules like keep it platonic, not dating group etc and thought he would get the message.  \n\nSo,  a new woman joined the group and was also present for this.   I don’t know much about her but I did hear her ask the guy to meet up some time near the end of the meeting.  \n\nA couple of days later I get many messages from her saying the guy has been texting her a lot saying how attracted he is to her.  Also, when they did meet up she went into some shop, told him to wait outside, he walked off.  She seems pretty angry at him but that’s all I know and haven’t seen any messages he sent to her.\n\nBy now I had to make a decision, 2 women were complaining about his messages and feeling uncomfortable despite me reiterating the rules. I decided to ban him and message him why.\n\nNext thing I know hi and family are texting me saying how horrible I am and should accept his behaviour as he is a good person and had Asperger’s.  Tell them I get it but I have others to consider others and he is aggravating their own issues.  Also, it’s a group for anxiety not specific learning difficulties.\n\nHis family kept trying to join the group so up a secret new location and told members privately.  \n\nSecret meeting goes ahead but somehow the guy shows up.  Don’t know how this happened but my guess is the second woman, who didn’t show up, told him.\n\n  \n I ask him to leave, he is really apologetic and says he walked off from the meeting with the second woman because she was being weird with him.  \n\nI feel bad but he knew the rules and broke them.  Unsure if it’s all his fault or not but I decided it’s best not to take the chance.  AITA?\n\nTLDR:  guy with Asperger’s joins \n group, sends flirty texts, I ban him, his family get angry, he shows up to a secret meeting, I tell him he’s still banned.  AITA",

      "description": "I've done some stupid things in the past and because of that I'm known as a slut to this specific groups of guys at my school. Guys ask me for nudes and it's ruined some pretty good friendships because of the guys being too horny to see me as a person and me realizing too late why they hung around me. \n\nSo when a guy I knew for all of the first semester and thought was funny and cool asked me for pictures of my tits like I was just passing them out I got pissed off. He was being so persistent than I said \"no means no\" and I think he got the hint and backed off. I was still fuming though so I sent him \"just a word of advice, if you're this persistent with girls in the future you might get yourself in some trouble, he responded k and we haven't texted since. \n\nI know he was probably only asking because of the stupid shit I mentioned at the beginning and he backed off as soon as I mentioned that he was being too persistent, but was my continued insinuation of rape after that an assholish thing?

      "description": "I have been with my boyfriend who I met online for roughly a year and a half or so now, and for numerous reasons my parents have not been made aware. I think they are suspicious due to offhand remarks they've made, but I don't think they've cared enough to actually ask. My bf and I are long-distance, and in the next month I will be telling my parents about my relationship with him and proposing that they come with me to meet him for the first time so they feel more comfortable and involved in our relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my boyfriend has a facebook account. I do not, but I've seen his account of course. It's mostly posts that are years old from his early teens (I'm 18, he's a few years older), other than a single recent post -- a picture of his motorcycle. However, among his old posts are a few pictures of girls asses, pictures he took with girls in clubs, etc. It hasn't bothered me, as it's old and he's beyond that now, but I know my facebook savy mother will immediately look his page up and be turned off by this. My older brother did exactly that, and berated me for weeks about how people don't change and I shouldn't be with someone who would post stuff like that, yada yada. Of course my family and I have very different opinions on most things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo avoid that drama, and due to the fact that they're old photos and irrelevant now, WIBTA if I seriously asked my boyfriend to delete his old posts of that nature on FB? Not everything, just the pictures of half-naked girls or him posing with girls at clubs and what not. I half-jokingly suggested the idea in passing after my brother blew up about the whole issue, and my boyfriend only shrugged it off as not a problem and that it wasn't important enough to bother with, and I didn't push the issue because at the time it really wasn't important enough.",

      "title": "AITA for yelling back at a stranger who upset my GF?",
      "description": "Long time lurker, first time poster... this has been bugging me for a few days so I figured I'd share and see what you guys think,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImportant background: my (27F) girlfriend (28F) has autism - she's high functioning, but she spends a huge amount of mental energy constantly worrying about how she acts/reacts around other people, especially strangers, and freaks out massively if she thinks she's accidentally done or said something \"wrong\" or rude.\n\nA few days ago we go to a pet supply store so she can pick up a few things she needs for her fish tank. When we get to the tills there's one customer being served at till #1 and a middle-aged woman and her presumed husband standing in front of till #2. There's no cashier at that till, but the way they're standing and positioned makes it look like they're probably being served and their cashier has just gone to check something/collect an item they've had ordered in (happens a lot at this particular store due to them stocking a lot of bulky items, so it's not an unlikely scenario). We queue in the usual spot, standing away from the tills. After a minute or so another cashier arrives and, apparently reaching the same conclusion I did, jumps onto till #3 and calls us forward. The woman at till #2 doesn't move or react in any way at this point as far as I can tell. Girlfriend carries out her transaction (takes less than a minute), and as she's finishing up the woman from till #2 suddenly starts yelling at the cashier. Apparently she wasn't being served after all and she's pissed my GF got served first. It's understandable she's annoyed, and the cashier probably should've verbally checked she was being served (to be honest I wasn't paying particularly close attention at that point, so maybe she did), but it was clearly an honest mistake. While the cashier is apologising, the woman turns her attention to me and my GF and starts chewing us out for apparently deliberately jumping the queue. She's way out of line, but I've worked a fair few service jobs in my time and recognise she's just your standard asshole customer, so I give the cashier a sympathetic look and decide to ignore her. My GF on the other hand panics and frantically tries to explain herself while repeatedly apologising. I tell her to ignore it and let the staff deal with the woman, and whisk her out of the store because I know what's coming - by this point she's in full melt-down mode, in floods of tears and unable to speak, convinced she's committed some massive social faux pas. Angry woman is still making a huge scene and yelling at the staff, and on the way past I say something sarcastic along the lines of \"good job, way to yell at a total stranger in public\".  She rolls her eyes but at that point she's focused on the two cashiers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce we get out of the store I'm obviously focusing on my GF and trying to calm her down (this happens from time to time, so we have a whole protocol worked out). As I'm holding my GF, I see Angry Woman sneering and staring at us as she heads for the door. I'm absolutely furious with her at this point, like full on shaking with rage, and call her a fucking selfish bitch. She looks like she's about to respond but her husband (who's been silent the whole time and seems pretty embarrassed by the whole thing) drags her off into the store next door. Honestly, my instinct at that point is to follow her and give her a piece of my mind, but obviously I don't do that. My GF, who was too deep in her meltdown to even notice the exchange between me and Angry Woman, actually handled the situation pretty well and was mostly back to normal within the hour, although she's convinced it was all her fault for days afterwards despite my reassurances.   \n\n\nTo be clear, I am in absolutely no doubt that Angry Woman was a massive asshole. What I'm less sure of is whether I was \\*also\\* an asshole for yelling back and swearing at her. It's totally different from how I'd ever usually act, but I was absolutely furious for what she'd done to my GF, plus if I'm honest there was probably an element of catharsis at not having to act the perfect customer service role for once after years of shitty retail jobs while I was in grad school. That said, there's obviously no way she could have known my GF would react in such an extreme way, plus I have no way of knowing what might have been going on in her life to allow her to justify her behaviour to herself the way I'm doing to myself.   \n\n\nSo, AITA for not sticking to the moral highground and biting my tongue?",

He stops what he's doing and takes my hand and motions like he's going to pull my joint (while saying \"Okay now I'm going to pull your finger and...\") so I yank my hand away because this is something he knows I don't like, and something I think might hurt my hand as he isn't a doctor.\n\nHe got really pissed and took this personally. Angry for the rest of the morning and left without saying goodbye and I love you etc. He said he was angry because I \"cut him off and didn't let him finish speaking\" by yanking my hand away and \"not trusting him\". I told him it wasn't personal and that I wouldn't trust anyone but a doctor with my hand- he didn't care and remained pissed off.\n\nI don't really understand why he's upset or if what I did was wrong.

My mother was always slightly abusive to first my dad then my brother. My brother and I were brought into court to talk about who we want to live with (brother is 18). In court I said firmly that I wanted to live with my Dad\n When the judge told my parents my mum began to act betrayed by my words. Whenever I shared my views she would call me screwed, slanted and down right autistic. At that point I stopped spending alot of time with her. She worked hard to undo the order my dad had placed that allowed me to leave her house and go home alone if I felt endangered and now my dad has to leave his own house 3 days a week for her to come visit. I finally put my foot down and decided I wouldn't talk. She started crying and telling me that I was so abusive  and she was hurt deeply. \nTLDR am I an asshole for not wanting to talk to my mother who in the past 4 months I haven't had a single conversation with in which she didn't insult me?",

      "description": "Context: I'm a Level 1 tech working in a IT Helpdesk dedicated to our company as well as a few external clients; I'm fairly new as I've only been working there for about 5 months.\n\nOne of my colleagues, who shall be known as Steve for the point of censoring, has been working for about 2 months, doing exactly the same job as mine and sitting right next to me in an open office. We have the same manager, who's taking care of about half of the helpdesk's techs. I like him, I really do, but he's having a nasty habit, and I want him to at least be warned of the said nasty habit rather than getting fired.\n\nAnyway, I've noticed about two weeks ago that sometimes (about once per two days), he's having a hard time dealing with our users (which I don't blame him for), he mutes his phone and says rude comments such as \"Shut up\", \"I don't care\" or just a plain old \"Fuck you\".\n\nNow, since I do exactly the same job as his, I get the frustration I might have. I gave him my own trick when this happens (albeit it's much more rarely since I'm fairly patient): to use my hands and do a soundless strangling gesture; I also advised him about how another of our techs has a stress ball for this exact reason.\n\nAnyway, I also warned him that our calls are recorded, and that he could be in huge trouble if he would either forget to mute himself or if someone from our QA program were to get ahold of a phone call where he'd be doing this; huge trouble as in one from QA, or even worse, external clients/employees could report this to higher management than our manager.\n\nSpeaking of our manager, he's pretty understanding and got our backs; I'm almost certain that he'd let it go this time since he's fairly forgiving and due to the fact that it's pretty hard to get fired here.\n\nObviously, I'd ideally not want to go through our manager, but after telling him more than 5 times, I believe he needs a firmer warning before it gets in higher management.\n\nSo, redditors, WIBTA if, despite my best efforts, I were to report my coworker's occasionnal rude behavior with the goal in mind that he stops before he gets fired for it?\n\nTL;DR: Coworker's rude towards our clients, and his job is half customer service; I want him to be warned rather than fired, and my own warnings wouldn't go through.",

      "description": "So I'm a university student who has been sharing a house with four other people since last September. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only communal space in the house is the kitchen. It's only a small space but so long as anyone has friends over, that's where they chill out. Most weekends I'll make the short journey back to my family home so that I can have a break from university life. My problem starts when I return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery Sunday evening without fail I'll get back to the house to find the kitchen has been turned upside down. We're talking food splashed on the worktops, oil splatters on the stove, bowls/pots full of food left laying around. The sink's plughole is usually blocked with pieces of food too. People have a tendency to use my crockery, as if they know there's a chance I'll clean up purely because it's my plate/cup/tray that's been left dirty. This irritates me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was away from the house for a week a few months back and we'd received an email informing us that some students would be coming to view the house for the next academic year. A few days later we received another email saying that the kitchen had been in such poor condition when the landlord arrived that he'd had to clean it just before the students got there, and that if it was left in that state again we'd have deposit money deducted. I understand that the kitchen is a communal space, but I was annoyed by the fact that whichever housemates had been in the house and had left it looking messy hadn't taken it upon themselves to clean it prior to the viewing. It's so disrespectful and speaks volumes when it comes to the standards these people have set for themselves and their living conditions. I have never, EVER lived in a place where the residents think it's okay to treat communal spaces like this, and I spent two years living in on-campus student halls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite myself and another housemate (the one I knew before moving in) taking it upon ourselves to deep clean the kitchen and have an intervention with the other residents, nothing seems to be changing. I'm still coming home to a filthy kitchen, and in all honesty I don't have the time or the energy to clean the place from top to bottom; I've got work to do and classes to attend, and I really don't understand why these people can't just clean up after themselves. Not only this, but I feel that if I clean up other people's messes they'll just continue to make them, because someone else will deal with me being a slob, right? With that in mind, whenever I now walk into the kitchen and see dirty stuff everywhere, I walk back out again. This is what makes me concerned that I'm being the asshole. Should I just be taking one for the team and cleaning up regardless of who made the mess? Or am I right to be standing my ground and letting others take responsibility for being filthy? I really don't know you guys. :/",

Lots of food and alcohol, games and conversation and sports. My closest friends don’t live in our city, they are my childhood friends and most live about an hour away. I love them and I invite them to everything we do. Same goes for my family who live in the same small city my childhood friends live in. Here’s the thing, every time we have a party, at least 1-2 people understandably want to stay over in our guest bedrooms. \n\nI am sick of having people stay over. I want our out of town guests to leave when everyone else leaves. Of course I don’t want people to drink and drive, and I love my friends and family, but at the end of a long night I want them to get out of my house, and I definitely don’t want to run into anyone in the morning and have to deal with varying degrees of people hanging out for too long before I have to literally and awkwardly kick them out. \n\nWe just started a monthly wine club where there will be a fair amount of drinking, and these friends and family are participating. My question is, would I be the asshole if I declined their requests to sleep over after these wine club meetings? It would basically mean they couldn’t really participate, or they’d need to get a hotel, but I don’t want to open the can of worms of having people sleep over once a month. I’m having a hard time figuring out if saying no would be setting a boundary or being a jerk. ",

Girls want to take things slow, mysterious, play games, idk. I love women, I really do but it gets very frustrating when my friends advice is: \"Take it slow but not too slow, overt but not too much so.\" My depression is also pretty bad that I often don't leave the house much + I work from home and work long hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's also been 9 ish months since my ex and I of 2.5 years broke up and I still feel pretty fucked up over it. I crave the comfort I felt with her and still miss her everyday thinking about all the mistakes I made. I'm looking to move past but it's hard some days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, this brings me to the AITA. I downloaded Grindr and realized how quickly things work with guys. The conversation flows much easier, they're straightforward with what they want while also always respecting boundaries. I can't develop attraction for men but I have met up with them. It leaves a complete hole in me every time I do it but because I don't get chased/complimented/desired by women as easily, I keep going back. I don't enjoy the sex, I don't enjoy the conversations, nothing about men attracts me yet I still do it and I don't know why. I can hook-up with a guy who's super attractive and he'll call me attractive but attractive women don't come anywhere near me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for leading on some men? AITA for using men for comfort and then ghosting when I realize it's wrong or I've had enough?

      "description": "Throwaway account just in case.\n\nAbout four months ago, I (M18) asked another guy (M19) out. For the sake of simplicity, we'll call him Sean. I'm openly bisexual (my parents were very loving and accepting despite their southern beliefs; don't stereotype, kids!) and I had a crush on him for about two months before working up the courage to tell him I liked him. We talked about it and decided to start dating. \n\nSean is a closeted bisexual and is dead-set on the idea that his parents would immediately disown him on the spot and informed me on one of our first dates that he was \"not out and had no intention of coming out to [his] parents in the future, ever.\" For someone who spent a multitude of years hiding their sexuality from their parents, I loathed the idea of keeping our relationship a secret. However, I liked him so I was willing to wait things out and see how it went. \n\nAbout two weeks passed and I started to feel like I made the wrong decision. Sean had a lot of emotional problems occurring at home and pushed a lot of that onto me. I still gave it a chance though, as we were only two weeks in.\nIt was exhausting, however, because I was also dealing with escaping from a very emotionally abusive friendship and all of these factors left me drained. Even as I knew the relationship wasn't going well, breaking up with someone added on anxiety so I figured if I waited, maybe I'd regain the feelings I felt at the beginning. \n\nMy university let out for winter break and I was struck by the full-force realization that things weren't going to work out between us- and to make everything worse, I realized that I had a real crush on someone else (20F) that felt truer than any emotion I felt for Sean. Since Sean lived about five hours away from where I was staying for break, I steeled myself to end things with him as soon as winter break was over. But the moment I got back, I was slapped in the face with a multitude of legal battles against the person who abused me the semester prior. Under the stress of fighting to get a restraining order and coping with the anxiety that comes along with having a stalker, I simply could not bring myself to break up with him.\n\nNow he is opening up about his innermost anxieties and talking about a future together- which would make me uncomfortable even if I was in a long-term relationship (I'm 18, I'm more worried about keeping up my grades than my future family). I don't think I can keep this up, but he is so emotionally reliant on me that I'm worried he's going to hurt himself if I break up with him. I feel like I'm the asshole for letting things get this bad even though I had other stressors to deal with. Am I?\n\nSide note: Sean has been telling me recently that he experiences a lot of homophobic thoughts, going as far to say how he thinks his life would be much easier if he was straight (before quickly following it up with \"I feel so guilty saying that to you\") and its taking a toll on my mental health.",

      "description": "So the gym in my apartment complex is pretty small. I guess you could say it’s a “semi private” gym because it’s only open to residents of the complex. It’s one room and has about 4 cardio machines,  and 1 weightlifting machine. The entire room I can estimate to be about 25 ft long and 25 ft wide, so being such a small space naturally it can get a little cramped at times. \n\nThere’s this girl who started working out at the start of January. The first time she came in, she started playing her music out loud. My first reaction was to give the benefit of the doubt. It’s a new year. Maybe she’s just starting out and hasn’t gotten around to buying headphones? Okay that’s fine. But it’s been weeks now and every single time she comes in to workout, she plays her music out loud for everyone to hear. Even with my headphones on and the volume turned up, I can still hear the drone of her music in the background. I know other people in the gym are annoyed, or seem to be cause I’ve seen a few people giving some stares, but no one has ever said anything. \n\nMaybe I’m being way too sensitive and making this up, but isn’t it customary to use headphones when listening to music while working out in a gym? Especially if there’s other people there? Would this annoy anyone else or am I being dramatic? I just don’t understand cause personally, I would never in a million years even think about forcing other people to listen to my music out loud in the gym. I’d be too self conscious and worried that I was annoying other people! \n\nI’ve thought about saying something to her, politely of course. But I haven’t because 1) I hate confrontation and 2) I’m still unsure if I’d be an ass for even saying anything. \n\nI understand the gym doesn’t revolve around me, and if it bothers me I guess that’s my problem. But at the same time I think it’s quite rude of her to constantly play her music out loud because every single gym I’ve ever worked out in that’s always seen as bad gym etiquette. ",

Within the first month of their relationship he had cheated on her, been busted for possession (I believe it was meth), and attempted to assault the officer who arrested him. She has since pretty much stopped talking to a lot of her friends, including me. She doesn't seem to want to end the relationship, even considering all the shitty things he'a done. I feel like I should try to contact her, maybe help her or offer some advice on her situation, as we were very good friends before this fiasco and she seems pretty miserable, but at the same time I don't really know how I feel about it, as she doesn't seem to want to talk, or hell even be friends at all anymore. Plus I don't know how I feel about being friends with someone who is willing to be in a relationship with lying addicts. AITA here?",

      "description": "20m and i'm In college with a 18f. I hooked up with this girl one time 7 months ago, used a condom and she said she was on birth control and 7 months later I get a call last week saying that she's pregnant and that it's up to me if I want to be involved in this child's life. She's not pursuing money (her family is filthy rich) and she just wants to know if I want to be a father and that the reason she hasn't contacted me is because she wasn't sure what my name was and she just found out.  I wonder if she was lying about being on birth control, I know I used a condom and did my part. If I would've known sooner I would've suggested an abortion or something. I'm not signing any papers saying i'm the father or claiming any father rights. I'm also getting a paternity test just to be 100% sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI moved and am now 5 hours away from this girl and I don't see how I could throw my life plans away to be with a baby that I feel no attachment too and a girl I don't even know. I'm in nursing school and time strapped as it is. I know nothing about the mother. I grew up with a shitty father and I know from my experience that the kid would be better of with a non existent father then a shitty one. I told the girl that if she ever needed money I would help anomalously, but I do not want to be a father and that i'm sorry that she's going to have to go through being a single mother. I don't want kids and I'm fairly certain I would make a shitty father, due to not wanting to be a father. I also don't think that because I had sex one time, that it justify's me to have to raise a child and have the total responsibility of how this individual works out in life, I do realize that financially i'm required to support it and I have no problem doing that. I honestly think that the child would be better off without me in life and being with someone who teaches the child healthy boundaries and other things that I have no clue about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n She's not holding me responsible and I'm not holding me responsible because what 20 year old wouldn't hook up with a pretty girl. I don't feel bad for the kid because she seems like the type to make a great mom and her family is financially and emotionally secure, meanwhile on my side I don't have family, my parents abused me so I left and my uncles and aunt's told me to fuck off when I needed them, So I don't have family. I honestly feel he's better off not knowing who I am and him knowing that his family from his mom's side is good and it being a mystery on his dads side of what he actually comes from. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the kid got famous or became rich in the future I wouldn't come out of the woodworks and claim it because I don't see it as my child. If he came to me in the future when he got older, I would probably let him get to know me, but I wouldn't try to act like his dad. I don't want any part in raising a child. It's either all in or all out and I'm all out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole",

      "description": "Title. \n\nMe=me, GF=My dads girlfriend, Dad=D, Her little brother= LB\n\nSo some background, I (14M) met my dads (45M) girlfriend (26F, I know it’s weird) about a year ago. She’s a typical 20 something girl, for example she’s basically given everything to her when asked and also connected to Internet and instagram 24/7. She also wants all the expensive stuff like, Gucci, Louis V, iPhone XS Max, AirPods, etc. She also has a little brother who is 8 and he keeps me entertained. \n\nAlso, she can be a real bitchy person when pissed off and she gets pissed off easily. My dad can also be “hard headed” but not all the time. So when they argue it’s a real big fight. I’ve seen this happen and it’s caused her to move out two times back to her moms. My dads been through her shit enough times to where he knows just to sometimes leave it alone and that’s what he told me today. It’s kinda annoying to see them argue when I see them do. \n\nI’ve never really had a problem until today. So we were flying from Puerto Rico back home. It’s Me, GF, D, LB and his mom. Now, we had a layover coming back. Now keep in mind all of us have barley eaten except for maybe one meal. \n\nSo while waiting for the next flight we sit at little place while charging our phones and I order these meatballs and LBs mom gets him Cheezits. When it comes it’s just 4 regular sized meatballs. Now I won’t be eating for about 4 more hours that’s a long time for a growing teen like me. LB also looked interested in my food and then his mom goes you can’t have any of his food, I’ll get you some if you really want some. Then GF comes over. \n\nGF: Can &lt;her little brothers name&gt; have a meatball?\n\nMe: No, it’s going to be...\n\nAnd before I got time to explain she walks away. Now I was raised as single child and taught to share pretty good and so I would’ve usually but they could always buy him his own if he wanted. \n\nShe went back to her phone while I finished eating and then go to the restroom before it’s time to board and my dad pulls me aside. \n\nD: &lt;GFs name&gt; is pissed off because you didn’t give &lt;little bros name&gt; a meatball. \n\nMe: Oh. Well we won’t be eating for awhile and I haven’t eaten all day. \n\nD: I know but I was going to tell you we could order more food. \n\nMe: Oh I’m sorry I didn’t know. \n\nD: Just...don’t say anything. \n\nThen we go back and by then they ordered him some meatballs. \n\nThen we have our tickets and it’s spilt up 2 and 3 like the last couple of flights and it’s usually: GF on window, D in middle, Me on middle and little bro and his mom on the other side but this time she wants it to be me and my dad and the rest while obviously pissed off. I see my dad texting her while we are sitting and she said \n\n“I just can’t get over it. Sorry.” So I asked my dad \n\nMe: “Did I piss her off?”\n\nD: “She’s always pissed off. *Sigh*” \n\nNow I’m writing this as we fly. \n\nSorry it was long I just wanted to know your guys opinions. \n\n",

      "description": "Bit of a longer one. I'm a recovering alcoholic for starters. And I realize I have a lot to fix but my wife has a friend that absolutely hates me. Has on occasion tried to get her to divorce me, talks badly behind my back about me. 1st we were all friends and all was well until my alcoholism took control months and months ago. Said friend told my wife I'm no longer allowed. That was fine when I was drinking. But now I'm sobered up 8 months no drink and feel better than ever. But whenever my wife even asks me to go over there I'm begining to feel betrayal. She will go over there at odd hours of the day, most recent one that got me was when she left at 8pm said she would only be an hour and come 10 11 PM here she is finally just leaving there house. \nSo I called her out on it and only created a major blow up. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, she asked me if she could go over for a couple Christmas joints. With out me, I about lost it. Again i felt like she didnt want to be around me. So i told her do to whatever she wanted and that our daughter and I would just enjoy the day here by our self's. I'll admit I wasn't very nice about it. She ends up not going and I ruined Christmas for her apparently but getting upset that she wanted to go over there. \n\nBit more back story, we are severally broke due to unforeseen problems. I continue to tell her we dont really even have the gas for her to be going across town every day. At this point it's a daily for hours on end shes gone over there doing God knows what in my mind. We dont have the extra funds to be buying pot ect. This has again somehow fallen back to me being a controlling narcissist.  I admit I've got issues, but I thought I was being pretty rational about it. \n \nI have offered to go to counseling to no real effect, I've offered just a once weekly it's ok to go over there with backlash. So one of the last times she was gone longer than what she had said I blatantly told her I thought she was cheating on me. And that ended badly also. Shes not cheating. Theres so much more to this that I cant quite get it down here. But aita for getting upset with her for doing to a friends house the I've been explicitly banned from?\n",

In my opinion, it went very badly (I had given my resume to a previous coworker who works at the company currently. Even though I am a masters student and haven’t had research experience since Aug 2016, the company wanted me to apply to their data scientist opening. The qualifications on the posting were: Masters degree and at least 2 years experience in data science) Of course I was upset after getting off the phone but I figured “oh well, I’m sure I’ll never hear from them again”. \nWell, soon after hanging up, I got an email saying that they’d like to do an on site interview the following week where we would talk more about my experience/background for 15-20 minutes and then they’d give me a tour of their labs. I agreed, even though I felt that the phone interview had gone horribly. I sent my availability for the next week. \nThere response was basically “let’s do 9am on Friday. You will need to make a 20 minute long presentation about your past research. Send the PowerPoint to me the night before.” \nSo, I graciously backed out, saying that I didn’t believe the position was a good fit for me at this time. \nI told them that I had virtually zero research experience over the phone. Why would they tell me to create a 20 min PowerPoint knowing that?\nEither way, apparently the team I interviewed with spoke to my former coworker and said I seemed to be “scared off or something”. \n*I would have never agreed to the second interview if they had told me straight up that I needed to create a presentation* \nAm I the asshole for backing out after initially agreeing? \nThanks, y’all.

      "description": "I get the feeling I am being an entitled child.\n\nDated my husband for a few years then got married. My parents were abusive so I kinda moved in to their place shortly after. It wasn’t official but they were extremely welcoming and I was extremely unintrusive. (I never left the room except for work, I would even wait to use the bathroom after they went to bed)\n\n\nI moved out with my husband to my brothers house. My husband comes home one day after finding his father dead on the floor and his mom going through a 30 hour surgery on her back and I demanded we move back in to take care of her. \nI Stripped the apartment clean (It was a hoarders paradise) and scrubbed and steamed the floor where the body was.\n\nMy husband did not want to move in but I felt too strong to leave it to chance. \n\nI did any renovations she needs.\n\nShe signed a contract years ago that her heat and hydro didn't cost extra and Currently the rent is $1200.\n\nShe is on disability and makes just over 2K a month. She has some medications not covered by OHIP but my husband pays for her cable and her car insurance. \n\n\nMy husband is a student in college and I work minimum wage. \n\nI am extremely struggling to handle both our bills.\n\nEvery so often she asks for rent money, not every month but I do feel like she does want it every month. Nothing outrageous, a very generous amount of only 300$ a month. \n\nThat being said it is sometimes two of my paycheques and I Feel an intense amount of guilt if I don’t have it that month. \nWhat I Feel like a bratty child about, even despite living almost living rent free, she still expects it from us when she’s aware how bad we are struggling. \n\nShe does buy food, an *Intense* amount of food, more then a family of 3 could even eat. But almost all of it goes bad. She barely eats and my husband and I buy our own food. She also knows this but still buys a great amount of fresh fruit and meat. We have two freezers and a fridge overpacked with rotten food because if we throw it out she’ll buy more.\n\nI guess my gripe is that I see her wasting quite a bit of money on food and not things that she could enjoy like hobbies or personal care items but still asks for money from us to buy more food that goes bad.\n\nI know another part that makes me the asshole is I Do not help around the house. I used to try, but if I do go out there at all she hovers around me and can get upset when I try to throw garbage out. She’s not an intense hoarder but It causes a huge amount of tension so I try to avoid it as much as possible. \n\nI do want to clean more but I've had chronic depression and living here makes it worse. Im overwhelmed. \n\n\nI essentially come home, go straight to my room and hide all day. She never used to charge my husband rent when he was working full time before I moved in.\n\nSo I don’t take up extra utilities, I don’t take up extra room.\n\nI'd be happy to  pay if my husband was out of college and my hours pick back up.",

My friend sitting in the back with me ignores me the whole ride home, and she was cracking jokes with my other friend the whole time. I stayed quiet the whole way home. So, am I the asshole???

      "description": "Some backstory - she used to have a thing for me. I didn’t have mutual feelings but we agreed to stay friends.\n\nWe used to text a fair bit but the last few months I don’t text anywhere near as much as I used to. Partly because I find it tedious but also because I’m genuinely busy with social and uni life. If I do text someone in my free time, it’s usually someone I’m close with.\n\nIn all fairness, I do take a while to reply to her. But we aren’t having a conversation. She’ll tell me something and the conversation is kind of at an end. I’m not really interested in continuing the conversation so I don’t. Today, I finished university at 5pm and got back in my flat at 20 past. By half 5 I was greeted with a “What the actual fuck is going on?” Because I hadn’t text her since last night. This is the second time this has happened so I lost it a bit. My response:\n\n“Are you fucking serious right now? You’re not my girlfriend. I’m not in any commitment with you. We’re friends. If I don’t reply to you for a few hours, there isn’t some malicious reason, it’s a) I’m busy, or b) I’m not interested in talking with someone. If it was serious, you can call me. I’ve recently broken up with my partner and I’m not going to be treated like I’m in some new commitment with you because you can’t go a day without texting.”\n\nI know it seems harsh, but seriously this person is overbearing. She’ll make random sexual comments in a conversation, which I make no acknowledgement of, thinking she’ll get that I’m not interested. She’ll try to get my attention by claiming something awful has happened and it turns out to be absolutely nothing. We’re friends, that’s all, nothing more. I’ve told her this. But for some reason she’s making it seem like I need to “accept some responsibility” and “try to understand [her] position.”\n\nThis especially is irritating when I’m currently speaking to someone who I am genuinely quite interested in.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: girl is acting like I owe her some commitment despite me clearly stating I’m not a big texter.",

      "description": "Bit of backround: I work part time while going to school and my girlfriend pay for groceries and gas on my own, while me and my girlfriend split the rent. For chores, I cook supper every night (lunch when we're home), clean both our dishes everyday, and clean the kitchen and the dining table and do the trash by myself while she cleans our living room and does laundry once a week or every 2 weeks (sometimes I do it for her). I also drive my girlfriend everywhere even though she has her licences and sometimes have to drive her 10 mins to home and back because she doesnt want to have to wait 20 mins for takeout to be ready for example.\n\nThis happened yesterday, I asked her to make supper last night as I wasn't feeling up to it that night. She let's me know while I'm about halfway through my shift that she doesnt want to cook so we should just go out to eat. Fine I figured we'd just go to the restaurant by our place nbd. We get in the car and asks to go to X restaurant about an extra 10 mins away. Okay, we get there, I pay for both of our meals,both fairly large portions, ones that she's never been able to eat in one sitting before. We get on the road and I make a comment how it's not a bad meal and she says that it would've been better with ice cream. This irks me because I've already left the drive through and apparently the food I bought her wasnt good enough. I offer to go back through but she refuses. She makes little comments like these all the time and I've told her it hurts my feelings so I mention that I don't feel appreciated when she says stuff like that. She then says it's not a good enough reason to get mad at her.  \n\nSo am I the asshole for getting upset? Should I just not mention it anymore?\n\ntl:dr took a break from cooking, went out to eat with the gf, bought her fast food and she said it wasn't good enough because I didn't get her ice cream. Told her I didn't feel appreciated, she said I can't feel that way.",

When we started to do the experiment, she left and began talking to another group that had to read something. She was gone the entire time and made us do the work/clean everything up. We could have used the extra set of hands, but the loss of her made the entire thing harder. It also took us a while to clean everything up while she was having fun doing nothing and talking to her friends. We go back to our table and I get mad at her for leaving us when she asks for all the answers. It wasn’t too harsh, no yelling or anything, I just got mad and just said that she should pull her own weight and not expect us to do everything for her. The other group mates also shared their anger by just nodding or saying, “yeah.” After a while, I noticed she started to cry, I kind of felt bad, but I still felt we were rightfully mad and she was the one over reacting. I still feel bad, so I want to know what everyone else thinks.",

      "description": "(sorry if none of this makes sense, I'm quite tired, and I'm typing this on my phone which has a messed up keyboard or something)\n\nSo I made this account just to make this post. I need some outside opinions (people that haven't met this person because they all agree with me). And this one's gonna be quite long, sorry. I have a lot to say. And I wish I could try to think of what her reasonings were, but I just can't. If this kind of falls underneath the validation thing in the rules, feel free to delete it.\n\nSo I had this one friend, lets just call her M, and if she somehow has a Reddit and finds this, oh well, now she'll know my side.\nAnyways, M kinda forced me to be her friend in middle school. She'd just come up to me and start talking about horses or something (my favorite animal and she had 2). Well flash forward a few years to high school, my junior year, her sophomore year. We had hung out countless times, going to movies, the beach, etc. We we're BFFs. Over these years, I've spotted little lies here and there like M would say her dad steals her money from her room or she would tell me she was failing a class, then a week later tell me her mom grounded her for that bad grade but swore that she had an A in the class and her mom was just evil (she's actually pretty cool lol). Oh and at this point I am participating in a program called Running Start, where instead of the last two years of high school, I go to college. \n\nThe next year, she starts Running Start as well, but different college, and I'm continuing on doing my thing. She starts telling me that she's failing classes and that her teachers are purposely failing her. Now this is a big turning point for me... I had a medieval class where instead of a final test, we had a feast where we did presentations and had music and 'authentic' food. We could bring a guest so I asked her. She gave me this big long drawn-out story about how she couldn't go because she was failing all of her classes and her mom grounded her and she had chores to do blah blah blah. I just brought my sister and we had a blast. On the way home she text me asking if I could go to the beach... Some of you may see why I got really pissed. I was super excited for her to come and meet my classmates and my professor, but nnoooooo, she had to do what she wanted to do and I had to make time for her but God forbid she make time for me. And after this I really started to notice things like that, her demanding that I hang out with her, but she wouldn't make time for me. \n\nThen M goes to Alaska for the summer and it was all right, we just texted when we could and went about our daily lives. And then she came back, everything was the same old \"make time for me and not yourself\" routine for a whole year. Oh yeah, and we asked her to watch our two dogs 5 cats and God knows how many chickens while we went to a Seahawks game, and my grandma said that every time she stopped by here to double-check, nothing was done. Like NOTHING. no food, no water, the chickens were not let out. NOTHING. Neighbors saw nothing too. The only evidence we had that she was actually here is that my dad asked her to record the game we went to see because he's weird( wanted to see if we were on the phone and see close ups of the stuff we missed etc.). I don't say anything to her because I was just so angry I didn't know what to say and I just continued on as is.\n\nSo it summer of 2018 and M goes to Alaska again, but this time, she constantly texted me about how I should move up there and I need to explore and travel or something ( I am a homebody, I have no desire to travel, I did enough of that as a kid, I just want to stay in one spot right now). She was almost demanding that I move up there or at least visit, and at this point things were getting good at my new job and I couldn't ask for a whole month off, especially since one of my co-workers actually quit because he was going up there with M + family. Again, she wanted me to drop every aspect of my life to visit her. We get into a huge fight, I call her out on her BS, and I stop talking. Well apparently she called her mom and her mom called me to see what was happening, and lo and behold her mom agreed with me. We kind of start talking again but I'm still really angry.\n\nI believe it was right after the 2nd Alaska trip, M decided to join the national guard. Now I have nothing against the national guard, but I guess I should describe my friend. . . she's like five foot four, like a hundred twenty pounds soaking wet just this tiny gal and she had a broken/messed up hip at one point that still gives her lots of trouble (bucked of a horse). Now, I kept telling her that I don't think it's a good idea because I don't think she can make it through boot camp with her hip because she can't even go on a walk without complaining. I just tell her to think about it and not rush into things. During this, she told me that she was going to have a higher up spot just because her dad was fish and wildlife so she kept saying well my dad has connections I'm going to start at a higher rank blah blah blah. More lies (unless that actually happens, let me know but that sounds like complete and utter BS to me). Oh yeah, and since her dad was fish and wildlife, apparently that got her out of getting speeding tickets??? or it was that she got a ticket even by mentioning her last name so she couldn't get her story straight with that one either. And she didn't need to use those park permits for when parking in special locations( like parks and lakes) ?? Yeah righr, total BS. \n\nOkay, and this is the last part I have to say. I was on Facebook minding my own business and I came across a video of a dog in a shelter in California, I live in Washington, and she was going to be put down. And she was just a beautiful sable German Shepherd, my favorite breed of dog. I already have two, Ben and Delia hence the username. I'm assuming that M has always been jealous of my dogs in a way. I got Delia and then she got a dog. I got Ben and then she was on the hunt forever for another dog but her parents wouldn't let her have one because they already had two other family dogs ( So 3 in total). She always brought up the point that I have 2 and she has 1, but I have to keep telling her that she technically has three. Oh yeah, and two of the dogs get to sleep inside while there duck hunting lab has to sleep out in the garage in a kennel, I definitely don't think that's fair.\n\nI had my heart set on this dog. I don't know what it was but I could not get her out of my mind, I knew I had to try and save her. I kept telling everyone that if I don't get this dog and someone else does I'll be happy I don't care, as long as she gets adopted but I'm the only one that took interest in her (but don't worry guys, she eventually did get adopted ). I was planning a road trip down the California, every small detail from what restaurants we would stop by on the way what gas stations I would need to stop at. Everything. I asked M to be my navigator and second driver. She signed up immediately because there's huskies in the same area as the dog I wanted ( her current dog is a husky so she wanted two). I think something flipped in her head that reminded her that she would only technically have two dogs and I would have three so she was just \"well I don't think this is a good idea\" and \" you need to work more with Bentley &amp; you don't have time for another dog\" etc. Now I love her dog to death, he is such a character, but she has no idea what she's doing with a husky (granted, I don't have any husky experience but I can see that she doesn't know what she's doing). She has this dog wearing a harness, a collar, a pinch collar, and a head collar or a muzzle all at once because she can't control him (i.e she complains that he pulls when she uses his harness, HE'S A HUSKY! NO SHIT!) And you want two? Good luck! So that's pretty much what I told her. I told her that she honestly does not deserve another dog because she can't even control the one that she has and I told her that if she wants another dog, get the dog out of the garage and take care of it. There are probably some other things I said, but I don't remember because I deleted the conversation, I was so done. I do know that the last thing she said was \"if you go, don't ask me to come\" or something along those lines, as if I would!\n\nI have not answered any of her texts, I have not answered any calls, I've talked to her mom a little bit but I have not told her the while shebang, I just told her that I have my reasons and I will get back to her. They recently got back from a vacation, and I don't know if she's lying or not, but she said she got mugged. Now if she did, I feel terrible, I do, but knowing her history I can't believe her. She even texted my mom telling her that she got mugged. She texted me \"I got mugged while on holiday figured I text you before I get a new phone\" or something like that, but she texted me on her phone in messages... Then she went and sent me messages on my Facebook messages all like 'oh we miss you' and assuming sent a picture of her family? So if you need a new phone because you got mugged, how are you texting me on your phone?? and remember the whole national guard thing, she got in and she's leaving, really soon. So there's that guilt trip will as well.\n\nI think that's it, I'm sorry this is so long but there is just a lot. Sorry if there's any spelling or grammar mistakes that don't make sense, had a really long day and I just discovered that this subreddit was a thing and I just had to make this. \n\nTLDR: caught my friend telling lots of little lies, she never made time for me, but demanded my time. Always used her dad as an excuse to break the law/tried to say she get a better position in the national guard because of",

It was end of semester, and I really did not want to miss any lectures, so I completely planned out my schedule that day, to make the most of my time.\n\nI had a really important lecture to attend right after my presentation. So, the moment our team completed the presentation, I informed my team-mates about the lecture, and left the auditorium.\n\nTurned out that the judges really liked our team's presentation, and we got the first place. However, I couldn't attend the prize distribution ceremony because of the lecture. I only realised that our team won a prize after I met them outside the lecture hall, after the lecture, when they handed me my trophy and certificate.\n\nBeing the *team leader*, my team mates told me that I should've missed this lecture to attend the prize distribution.\n\nTL;DR - AITA for attending an important lecture and missing the prize distribution that was held right after the event? Does being the team leader make it important for me to *be with the team* while receiving the prize?",

      "description": "Hello r/AmItheAsshole, I'm a huge lurker on the sub and I have a situation that has been bothering me and wanted some judgement.\n\nMy uncle is around 50 years old now and has the mental capacity of a kid nowadays. It wasn't always like this. At an early age (maybe 10 or 12?), he was an extreme alcoholic. He would steal money from my grandmother and steal items from all of our families houses to pawn off for some money for beer. My father isn't in the picture and my mother would have to work a lot of shifts while I was growing up and I never felt comfortable with my uncle driving me to school because he was drunk as a skunk so I would walk. When I got back from school, I would be at my grandmother's house (where he used to live) and would stay in her room the entire time until my mother came. When I was old enough to get a job, he would beg me for money and I thought that I give it to him, he wouldn't ask my mom (I just want to ease her troubles) and gave in. \n\nIn addition to his alcoholism, he's diagnosed with schizophrenia and that would frighten me even more especially when one Christmas the family had to lock him out of the house because he was screaming and banging on the windows screaming he will kill us. That night, it was very icy because of a recent snowstorm and he slipped and cracked his head open. We rushed him to the hospital and found that he had some brain damage and because of him constantly drinking, he developed so many ulcers in his liver that the doctors said if he were to drink again, it could very well mean death. \n\nNow that my uncle now has the mental capacity of a child, my mother is so selfless and took him in when my grandmother passed away. When I used to live in the house (moved for college), I rarely made conversation with him. He would only remember nice memories of our relationship like how I got my nicknames and how we used to jam out of ACDC. But it doesn't seem that he has a recollection of how he used to be which makes me question my actions. My mother tells me that I should try to make an effort to talk to him but I don't know. I still remember him as the person I used to be scared of as a kid because of the things he would do to hurt others. \n\nAITA for not letting go of the past and start fresh with my uncle? Any insight will be helpful.",

      "description": "My father was given my grandmothers house. My father put my aunt on the house too as he felt bad she was not included in the will. \n\nAunt passed away and because her name was half on the house it paid off the mortgage(a very small one for repairs). House then had her 2 daughters named added. \n\nMy dad lived in the house from the day my grandmother passed, my aunt planned on building on the property(100 acres) on retirement which is why she was happy her name was on it too.\n\nMy father passed away. My stepmother continued to live in the house. Me and my cousins communicated often regarding the house and my stepmom living there and not taking care of the house or paying taxes. All conversations mentioned the house was all 4 of ours..my 2 cousins and me and my brother.  My dad from the time my aunt passed away repeatedly said the house is between the four of us and the cousins never debated this.\n\nWell, until they sold the house and took the entire profit for themselves ($60,000).  They knew financially I could not fight it in court as in Canada this cannot go to small claims.\n\nThe fun part, the house taxes were never paid by my stepmom, so the house went up for tax sale. I informed my cousins as they do not live near by. I called the tax office and they said the house was only in one cousins name. \n\nAt that point the house was sold and the agreement was the profit would be divided. After fees, taxes, travel, moving costs, lawyers, the profit was to be divided. It was casually mentioned by them daily it was the 4 of ours.\n\nI am angry they did not divide it. They feel they are in the right and did nothing wrong, called me money hungry when I asked about my share. We have not spoken in 4 years. I feel that they led me to believe there would be no issue and the house would be divided evenly without question. \n\nWhy this bothers me is I loved my cousins up until then. After that they were so cold about everything and denied it was ever mine.  I guess they knew all along but I didn't,  why talk for years like its ours? \n\nThis week their father passed away. He was sweet and kind, no hard feelings there. Oddly enough they distanced themselves as he stole money from his mom. I want to message them and say sorry for your loss. I am, but I really don't want to speak with them. If they would admit wrong doing maybe...but... I want to forgive them but I just cannot. They both inherited half a million from an aunt, they did not need they extra 30,000. It would have helped me and my family greatly. \n\nI honestly cannot get rid of my disgust for them. Do I have money issues?  I am kind to everyone I know, I work with people with disabilities, I can look past do much in my field of work. I feel guilty for not being able to look past it. \n\nShould I forgive and forget? Is family more important than money..yes it is but it feels like stealing. \n",

      "description": "Let's start off fast, my gf lost her virginity at 14 to a 17 year old she didn't know all that well. He used her for her body. And this is the one and only time she has had sex. \n\n     While she is the person I lost my first kiss too. I have had no other relationships. When we started to REALLY talk she told me she was a virgin and I completely believed it and I was excited a little (because it's always sort of been a cute thought and idea for a sweet couple to lose their virginity together) but a week or two in too our serious relationship her friends leaked that she had sex with a man, she then agreed and said she lost her virginity. I wasn't said \"heartbroken\". I was just upset that I could achieve the cute connection that was shared between my gf and that guy she had sex with. But I asked her some questions about it and she said she dated him a week and she said that she hated him and all this stuff. But other than that we never brought it up again untill she pulled out and old diary that had a few logs in it.\n\n   Now this is where I feel like I'm an asshole. She read this diary and it listed that this guy she had sex with being 17. I never knew that untill this point which is a month or two into the relationship. But I started to just cry. I don't know why but I did. I was so angry and sorrow. And she went into detail in the situation. They both lived in the same neighborhood and they talked for a couple days and then he molested her on the bus. But she still had the ability to date him and kiss him and have sex with him IN A WEEK. And that was after the bus situation. And I was for some reason ferocious with her. I couldn't and can't help myself, but I will get back to that. \n\n\n   After all that she went into detail about how much she hated him and that eased things for a while. Untill a couple months later when she said their was an entire different side of the story where she ACTUALLY LOVED HIM. And I yet again broke out in tears and rage. I didn't even know what to think. I was so fucking jealous and sad that I couldn't experience that kind of love. Then she went into detail about what happened in the sexual situation and now, I can't get that thought out of my head. When I'm doing homework, boom their. Showering, boom there. It's always their and I hate it so fucking much. \n\n\n  She lied about her feeling for him. And her virginity. And I can't get that idea out of my head. \n\nAnd I'm so damn jealous that this molesting monster got to take this amazing girls virginity within a week of hanging out with this girl rather than me and hers full year.\n\nAm I the asshole? Am I a dick for wanting to take this girl's virginity to myself because I love her so much and I thought it would be cute and romantic? Am I a prick for being jealous of this guy's opportunities? \n\nIf no/yes please don't hold back\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "hi yall, first post here. i made a post a while ago in r/relationship_advice but since then nothing has really happened for better or worse. i’ll try to keep things short but i admittedly kinda suck at that so tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nmy coworker (27 F) is entirely two-faced. she is really kind and sympathetic in front of me, buying gifts for my pets, chatting about video games and netflix shows, yknow generally being cool with each other. but somewhere along the way she started saying REALLY nasty things behind my back. it started with petty high school level crap like scribbling down notes that i’m ugly or that i smell and all that, and if it were just that i’d be fine. not like i haven’t gotten bullied before. but recently it turned from pettiness to bigotry after she purposefully made a horribly transphobic remark about me in front of another coworker (who happens to be a friend of mine). said coworker told me as soon as i returned to work the following day.\n\nafter a few times confronting my bosses about it, they’ve said the same thing every time: that it will be taken care of. but i don’t think it ever does get taken care of. at most she gets a slap on the wrist and a lecture about respecting your coworkers, and then a few weeks later i start hearing the insults again. i think she is starting to feel that she can’t get in trouble, since we are a small business with like 8 employees. she’s also a good employee, and never acts out of bounds in front of my bosses, usually offering to help when things get tough or schedules get tight.\n\nshe knows that i know what she’s been doing at this point, but whenever we work together (which is often), she pretends nothing happened at all. she still acts really friendly and supportive, which at this point is just infuriating. and when i get snappy or ignore her she acts like I’M the douche!\n\nnow i’m just furious and deeply uncomfortable. i tried to be professional for months, but i can feel myself slowly losing my cool. i’m not a confrontational person but somethins gotta give.\n\nbuuuut the store is undergoing some pressure from within rn; clashes between grooming and bathing, bathing and staff, staff and staff—morale blows and tensions are high. even though this whole thing has just really messed up my work mood, i hesitate to push that my bosses should do something more that lecture her because it would just make everything more stressful for the rest of the staff.\n\nso, here’s my ultimate question: WIBTA if i kept pushing my bosses about the issue? or took things into my own hands? if she ends up getting fired or having her hours cut, we would be down a person and everyone would have to pick up extra hours until we could find AND train the replacement. with all thats going on i wonder if i should even bother and just take it for the sake of the store.\n\ntl;dr coworker has been harassing me behind my back with everything from high school insults to transphobia, nothing has been done. store is under pressure and i’m not sure if it would be a dick move for me to push for some semblance of justice with everything going on.\n\nalso i’m sorry if this sounds stupid as hell; it really is and i just want it to end in a way that doesn’t have me out of a job",

      "description": "Most mornings I am responsible for getting my kids up, lunch packed and getting them to school on time. My job is relatively flexible while my wifes job has a set schedule. Generally, when one person does the morning drop off the other person does the pick up. Over the past few weeks I ended up carrying about 75% of both drop off and pickup, so we decided to designate days. Today was my wife's day to drop off. \n\nThis morning as I was about to leave my house to get to work early, I saw that my kids were nowhere close to being ready (no lunch, kids not dressed, school bag not packed) so instead of leaving I spent 30 minutes to get things ready at home. I'm honestly unsure what my wife was doing other than being in the bathroom and making coffee. \n\nBy the time my wife was ready it was time the kids time to go to school. There are 2 separate school drop offs, so I did one while she did the other so that she'd be able to make it to her work on time. \n\nI got a phone call after drop off calling me an asshole for taking over and getting the kids ready 'my way'. I acknowledged that I took over but it was because there would be no way for her to handle the entire duties by herself and not be late for work. \n\nI get that by taking over this morning I essentially relayed that I think she could not handle it. But I really don't think she had the situation handled. AITA for not wanting her to fail?",

      "description": "My neighbor travels quite often, usually every other month for two to three weeks at a time. While she’s gone, she asks me to get her mail, mow her (small) lawn, water her plants, etc. I do it, begrudgingly, even though when I go out of town, I pay a petsitter to get my mail and water my plants, and I don’t need my grass mowed since I’m never out of town longer than a week. \n\nI never ask favors of her but she will often mow my grass before she goes out of town or do other things that I don’t ask of her. She’s one of those people that will tell you she did something for you instead of simply doing it and not expecting recognition. Most of the things she does, I don’t notice. She recently power washed “my” sidewalk but I didn’t even notice as it’s not my property or responsibility. She also told me she pulled a couple weeds from my yard, even though they weren’t close to her property line. They were “bugging” her. Basically, I don’t need her help but she relies on me when she goes out of town.\n\nShe just informed me that she’s going on vacation for quite a while and asked me to do the things mentioned above. She was very specific this time about how I should handle her mail: she wants me to get rid of all the catalogs and other junk mail before I give it back to her. She’s asked this of me before, I did it once, and quit doing it because why should I take my time to sort through her mail when she could do it herself? I lied and told her that I didn’t feel comfortable doing it because I might get rid of something she wanted. She told me not to worry about it and that she didn’t want to come home to a month’s worth of mail. I’ve suggested before to her that USPS will hold your mail but she tried it and said it was a huge hassle to pick it up.\n\nAITA for not wanting to take a couple minutes to get rid of her junk mail, which will make things easier on her when she gets back into town?\n",

      "description": "Ok, Im really conflicted here. Around in, August one of my roommates and his girlfriend (who doesn't live with us all) got a cat, and they decided to leave it here without telling anyone else in the house. I don't care, I love cats so it wasn't a problem. \n\nThe problem is he never takes care of his cat beyond feeding it and cleaning its litter box. I will give that to him he never starves him. But he never plays with him either, and he always has all this energy and there's only 2 or 3 cat toys in the house, and I bought one of them! Most of the time he isn't even at the house, he's at his girlfriends house, where he'll be for days at a time leaving his friend who lives here to take care of his cat. When he is here he's playing video games or watching TV, and when the cat is asking for attention he usually just yells at him. \n\nThe worst was New Years. I was the only one at the house during the few days around New Years, and one day I got back from work and realized he had left his cat locked in his room while he was at his parents house. \n\nWhenever anyone comes over the cat always runs to them begging for attention, which he usually ends up getting from my friends or one of my roommates gfs who likes the cat. \n\nAnyway, this one girl I know is a huge animal rescue/rights person. She hates the way he treats his cat and told me multiple times she's gonna take him. I don't know 100% because I haven't asked her, but I'm about 95% sure she took his cat. The other 5% is he might have negligently killed it and is lying about it. When he asked me if I knew I said I had no idea and helped him look for his cat. ",

      "description": "First time poster, and a mobile user.\n\nFirst off, a bit of backstory:\nEvery tuesday I stay late at my school and have some extracurricular activities; meaning that my mum will pick me up at school.\nLately, she has been calling my phone whenever she is near the school so that I wouldn't take long to come out and go to my car. But last week, she basically screamed at me for answering the phone, telling me that I was wasting her phone balance, and then told me to not answer and just hang up the phone from then on.\n\nToday, I stayed at school like usual, and waited for my mum to come pick me up. Like always, she called my phone, but I had forgotten that I shouldn't pick up the phone, so I did. But as soon as it happened I remembered and so proceeded to hang up.\n\nWhen I got to the car, she was really mad at me, and started freaking out because I was wasting/spending her phone balance. I, not wanting for her to be mad, told her that then I would pay for her bill next month because I had made her waste her balance. (Even though I made her waste only $200 COP [0.064 USD])\n\nShe then just started freaking out even more, yelling at me, telling me that I was an ungrateful idiot, and that I mustn't try to humilliate her. She said that I shouldn't be such a dick just because I had made some money selling stuff at school (I don't get an allowance and everything I buy I buy with my money) and that I was being an ungrateful prick, all the while she seemed like she was in the verge of tears.\n\nIt wasn't my intention to humilliate her or anything like that. I just wanted to try and make things right, I guess. I just wanted to at least repay her for wasting her time. But she didn't take it well. \nI didn't even give her sass or a bitchy tone. I just wanted to repay her.\n\nTL;DR: My mum gave me hell for answering the phone when she called me, and when I offered to pay her phone bill for next month, she said I offended and humilliated her.",

      "description": "So, back story...\n\nWhen we first got together, I was in a vulnerable place. I just came out of an abusive relationship. The first year and a half, everything was good. After a day of raking and burning leaves, the wind kicked up that night and blew some of the embers into the garden that was right against a side of the house. My house burnt down. With no where to go, due to the constant fighting with my granddad, I moved into her place with her parents/grandparents. Her parents took care of her grandparents. I had absolutely nothing except a car, and the clothes on my back. So I worked on establishing myself again. This is when I felt the tension and a bit of uncertainty appearing. After thinking about it, I'd come to realize it's because we were in our early 20's and we hadn't gotten any time to work on just us, cause of her super dependent family always wanting her attention. So we finally get to a place where we can move out into a house with 2 of our best friends. \n\nAfter a year, everything was going good again, but thats when it all started to get hard again. \n\nBoth of her parents grew sick. Her mother: renal failure. Her father had a stroke. With no other choice, I decided we should moved back in to help out around the house. She agreed. Then her father died. That same year, her mother broke an ankle and busted her knee real bad from a fall, so she couldn't walk anymore, so she became dependent on us due to muscle atrophy. The next year, I lost both of my grandpas. Including the one I had lived with and had been my support even if no one else would. After some processing and kinda learning to cope with my misery, I actually started to think about everything that had happened in the past years. I couldn't figure out if I had still loved her and was supporting her because I love her or if we had an impossible situation that I'd be an ass for walking away on.  I tried to talk to her to talk to her about the situation but we didn't get far.\n\nThen, her grandma died. Everything got put on halt again and I did the same thing I've always done. Tried to support everyone. After almost another year, the thoughts have come back, but now, because of 4 different funerals in a 3 year time span, we've both accumulated a LOT of debt that we're trying to get the reigns on again. I'm having thoughts of trying to find a good stopping point and trying to talk to her about this and how I feel and maybe I'm just filled with anxiety and it's making me want to retreat or if I'm actually looking at it from a reasonable standpoint. I mean, between my work schedule, her work schedule, her mother's dialysis schedule, her grandfather's everyday routine and everything in between, we get maybe get 2 hours to spend together every 3 or 4 days.\n\nI don't want to sit and wait to try and wait for everything to \"get better\" whether it's because someone else passes or something, and find out that I had lost feelings along the way.",

      "description": "So, about a year ago, my school was having a “Play-back night”, basically Lip-Sync Battle but without the “battle”. They were just a bunch of fifteen year olds dressing up as celebrities and acting like they sung. At the event, they were selling pozole (mexican soup) and I knew buying some was a bad idea as soon as they served it in a ceramic bowl. The table where they were selling it was very far away from the show, so if I wanted to watch it and be with my friends I was gonna have to take the bowl full of scalding liquid to my seat. \n\nI sit down, try to eat, but it’s too cold. Meanwhile, a 3 year old kid was making his way through the row of seats, supporting his body on the legs of the audience. I hadn’t noticed him until he put his hands *in* my pozole. He fell down, pouring the entire thing over himself and my legs. I was kind of pissed off but the kid didn’t know better (what was he doing unsupervised, I do not know). \n\nI told my friends to watch my seat as I went to the restroom to clean up and check wether the burns were serious or not (they weren’t, thankfully). When I came back there was this 50ish year old lady sitting in my seat. I asked my friends something along the lines of “WTH guys?” But they just said she ignored them when they told her the seat was occupied. I told the woman “Excuse me, you’re in my seat. I just went to the restroom”. She goes on about how she is very old, while I’m in my prime, and how chivalry has been lost. How, back in her day, kids would gladly give up their seats to elderly people (I should clarify, she was *not* that old). \n\nIf she had apologized and gotten up I would’ve let her stay there, or if she had asked me for it, or if I had seen her looking for a chair, but she took it like she owned the school and was not willing to give it up, so I stood my ground. She then threaten to call the principal, so I had to back down (the principal would automatically take her side because the woman was a parent). \n\nAm I wrong for thinking she should’ve given me the seat? It wasn’t even my fault I had to get up (though she had no way of knowing that). I was having a pretty rough night, but am I the entitled one?",

      "description": "TL;DR - I said I didn’t want to eat Mexican food, my ma said I had to pick the restaurant. I didn’t pick and we went home in a bad mood. My ma later commented on how she was hungry because I didn’t pick, I said that it wasn’t my fault, she could’ve picked. She said I should’ve said I didn’t want Mexican earlier, and I got angry because I did say something sooner. Everyone else went out to eat Mexican food, I ate some bagels. Things were tense for a day or so. Was it my fault?\n\nOver the weekend, my parents and I went to the mall and then out to eat. My ma said that she felt like driving by a local Mexican restaurant, and I said that I didn’t really want to eat Mexican food, but we drove there anyway.\n\nWe pulled up to the restaurant and there were a fair amount of people there. My parents said it looked like it was going to be tasty, I sighed and grumbled and my ma asked me what was wrong, and I just said that I really didn’t want Mexican food. She said that if I didn’t want Mexican food, I should have to pick the restaurant. There are few things I hate more than picking the restaurant, so I said that I didn’t want to pick the restaurant and she said that if I didn’t pick, we’d leave without eating out. I said that I didn’t want to pick, and we left the parking lot, and started the way out of the town. The car ride home was tense and silent.\n\nWhen we got home, I was looking around for food because I was still hungry. My ma brought something up about her being hungry because we didn’t eat, and said it was my fault. I told her that we could’ve still ate out, I just didn’t want to eat the Mexican. She told me I shouldn’t have waited until we got there to say something, so I got mad and said that I did say something, she just didn’t notice. My ma said that I should’ve picked a different restaurant if I was going to be bitchy about the food. My parents and my brother went to a different Mexican restaurant for dinner, brought back leftovers, I ate bagels, and that was that. Things were tense because of my “attitude” for a day or so, everything’s dandy now. \n\nBut, I have to know. I don’t think I did anything wrong, but the rest of my family did. Was I the asshole? Was the fight my fault?\n\n",

      "description": "This happened a week ago. I'm kind of feeling anxious about this even though my friends reassured me I did nothing wrong. I just wanted reddits opinion. \n\nLast week, my friend (Rob) and I visited Victoria, B.C., and we came back to Vancouver on a ferry that was absolutely full. It was the most popular crossing time back home and throughout the duration of the crossing, the steward kept making announcements to please remove jackets and bags from seats because people have no where to sit. Stupidly, my friend and I decided to eat before finding a seat. Once we were done, we walked around the ferry, all levels, trying to get a seat with no luck. Finally, we came across a row of seats that were empty, with 2 books taking up seats right in the middle. In my brain, this meant that those 2 middle seats are \"reserved\" by someone, so my friend and I took the seats on the sides (aisle and window). We both thought this would be fine, as we left the \"reserved\" seats empty. 20 minutes later, a couple comes by. I was reading, Rob was sleeping. I heard them talk (not English) so I looked up at them and then they asked me why we took their seats. I haaaate confrontation as I have pretty bad social anxiety. I politely told them that my friend and I were looking for seats and we took the 2 that were empty. They are welcome to return to the 2 seats they reserved. Then they told me that they had in fact reserved all 4 seats and that their friends are coming back. I apologized again, but I said I wouldn't move because:\n1. Only 2 of 4 seats were \"reserved\". \n2. There were 4 people in their party, they couldve left someone behind to guard their seats. They brought their food and drink over to the seats so it's not like they just went to eat in the cafeteria area of the ferry. They were going to eat in their seats. \n3. Rob and I walked over 20km that day, I wasn't going to walk all over the damn ferry again. It was too cold to sit outside. \n\nI would appreciate your opinion. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, am on mobile. \n\n",

He’s in a band and performs away from home at least once a month. I happened to be at one of his away performances in January of this year and saw him cheat. He even confessed to me over text everything that went down. \n\nIn February I then met his gf and I felt super bad for knowing what I did. I asked my friend 3 or 4 times to come clean but he refused. So I asked him a final time, he said no, so I told his gf myself. Of course he knew it was me and got pissed that I didn’t give him a heads up so he could prepare. \n\nI’ve told people in my life this story and have gotten both “well done” and “you’re a cunt”.

      "description": "Last week I was working the weekend with a really nice girl (we work at a bar in a theatre). On Saturday we closed around 10:30 p.m. and she went to a party straight afterwards. The next day, the shift startet at 2 p.m. and she had just woken up, and not having had the time to go home came straight from the party. So she was wearing the same clothes (about which the manager had told her that she needed to dress a bit more nicely and in black for work) as the previous day and just smelled like sweat (and alcohol, but that's not really something she can control). So she got to work, went past me and told me that she just came from that party, which is when I realised she smelt bad. So I asked her in a laughing voice, if she had some deodorant with her, to which she replied \"Oh no. Why? Do I smell?\" And I said \"Yeah, but I don't have any deodorant either, so I guess we'll just have to muddle through\". Again, as I said that I was laughing and I perceived it as a friendly exchange. However, later another colleague said that the girl had told her that I had said that she smells and the colleague told me that I was a bit too honest and that it was kinda rude. I, however, think that when someone makes the decision to stay out all night and then come to work without even a change of clothes that that is kinda inconsiderate for your co-workers and guests. So AITA for calling her out on it?",

Well, tonight we went to a friends house and played board games. One of the games asked the question \"have you ever slept with someone on the first date\" and I answered yes. She was totally shocked at this, not sure why, but whatever. \n\nSo on the ride home, she asked me if I actually did and I said yes, I didn't lie. She has the lowest opinion of men, assuming all they want is sex and will do anything to get it. However in the one instance I had sex in the first date, I didnt initiate at all. It was the womans call, she did everything. I was 20, she was attractive...wasn't about to say no, right? \n\nIn my SO's head, I apparently lead this girl on or something when it was the complete opposite. When we got home, I was visably angry. Someone I've been with for years wont even hear my side or believe me at all. So I said \"because the person I've shown you isn't who I really am.\" \n\nShe jumped out of the car and ran inside. I left to stay with a friend. AITA for any of this?

      "description": "(I'm sorry if this is pretty long. It's been bothering me for a while so I decided to finally post it here.) \n\nOur friend group has someone who gets triggered by the littlest things. Let's call her A. We are usually okay with A's behavior, even if she does get too emotional sometimes.\n\nShe had a fight with one of our friends and I, being one of the calmer ones of our group decided to be their mediator. I do not normally pry into other people's affairs but their fight is going so bad, it's affecting everyone. A is inciting drama and is purposely trying to catch attention of other people so it would seem that we are isolating her, which is very far from the truth. It went from her fighting with one of our friends, to her saying she's mad at all of us for \"being fake friends\".\n\nShe says we're purposely isolating her, that she doesn't fit in and she feels ignored, when it was her who leaves our hangouts without texting us and gets angry at us if we do not immediately know she's not doing fine. She also gets sad when we don't talk to her, but when she is with other people, she usually leaves our group and does not even tell us where she's going so her valuables sometimes gets left behind like her phone and we have no idea what to do sometimes when someone calls and she's not available to answer her phone. The longest her valuables was left in our care was for the entire weekend. It's usually a do or die situation on who's gonna be taking care of her things and would shoulder the burden of her sermons about us not returning it to her when she forgot about it. \n\n One time, we were all so busy with research and we're all in the library, trying to finish our requirements earlier than the deadline. All of us decided to grab a bite to eat because we haven't eaten all day; she declined the invitation saying she still has to work on her project. We all agreed and asked her what she wanted to have and we'll order takeout for her.... Which I thought was fine until she suddenly got really mad and caused more drama saying she was left behind again. \n\nBut that's not really what I'm gonna ask about. \n\nSo that thing with the library became the trigger for an even bigger fight with her and our friend, our friend was the one who decided to apologize instead but A was the only one who felt better about the confrontation. Cue in her telling us how we're all horrible people and how we're so childish and immature that we basically couldn't function without her who's older than most of us. Everyone was really silent, one of our friends who have anxiety couldn't sleep because the situation is bothering her so much. But the last straw which made me finally confront her was her calling me \"heartless\" and my friend \"weak\" because we couldn't understand her. \n\nI was very calm when I talked to her, I told her what she's doing is not okay. But before I can even suggest we have a heart to heart talk later after our classes, she made an outburst and caught everyone's attention. We were at the public library then and she started bawling her eyes out. I told her we can talk about this somewhere more privately, but she refused to listen and cried even more, then walked away. \n\nWe eventually smoothed things out with her, or so I thought. \n\nMonths after, she posted a public status namedropping me being a \"jerk\" and surprisingly, my friend who she initially had a fight with was siding with her. I just found the situation funny because I was just the mediator between the two of them and they're making me the bad guy for telling her the truth. I was more disappointed with that friend who I confided on. I told her I don't do really well with A because she is too emotional for me and she actually snitched me. \n\nThe whole situation is confusing the remaining people of our friend group. I asked them if I really came off as a jerk when I talked to her but all they're saying is that I was very calm when I talked to her. And oh, it turns out A wanted to make it a bigger issue by telling the Dean of our school that she's being bullied. \n\nP. S. I gave friend A and B a private message telling them to take the post down and talk to us in private instead of their issues with us, which they fortunately complied. \n\nTldr: Friend A is very emotional and sensitive, she usually tells us how horrible friends we are to her. I was a mediator of a fight between friend A and friend B. Friend A said I was a jerk for telling her that her behavior isn't okay. Friend B is a snitch and told friend A that I can't handle friend A too well because of her sensitivity. Friend A took this as an offense and made a public status about how a horrible person I am and how fake me and our friend group is. \n\nI just want to graduate in peace. So can I ask you guys... AITA? \n",

This obviously wakes me up, My housemate says that \"rent isn't cheap, I should be able to make as much noise as I like\".

      "description": "Only have a short time to post this for now, but will respond to questions later. Throwaway because any one of my friends will immediately know who I am based on this post.  \n\nMy group of friends has one girl who is (imo) pretty disrespectful. Late to everything and doesn't care about other people's time. Claims she's always broke but her parents pay for pretty much everything, and it doesn't stop her from going on vacations, going out to the bars all the time, doing a lot of fun activities. \n\nTo give you an example we were all going camping last year, 7 or 8 of us. Most of us have to leave work or school early to get to our meeting spot. She's the only one who didn't have to work that day, and somehow she shows up an hour late. Doesn't apologize, acts like she wants to brush it off. It pissed me off and I blew up on her, but my friends seemed to think I was overreacting.  \n\nRecently we had a pot luck game night. She shows up late, empty handed, because \"She already ate\". Well, I'm not sure how that precludes you from the responsibility of bringing something for the rest of us since you agreed to the pot luck, but okay. Anyway, within a few minutes, she starts loading up her plate. Initially I don't say anything, but as I'm getting progressively more drunk and see her eating more of our food, it just pisses me off. My wife and I went to 3 different stores (literally!) to get specific ingredients for the dessert we thought everyone would like, and specific drinks we knew people would like. She has the audacity to show up late, only think about herself, and then eat our food. I blew up. I called her out in front of everybody for being disrespectful and immature. I didn't call her any *insults* or swear at her or say anything that was purely malicious. I just told her, without sugar-coating, and in front of everyone, exactly what I thought.  \n\nMy friends brushed it off as \"she's always been that way, she's not going to change, just drop it, who cares, we don't let her have any input in our plans\" etc. I would have thought they'd be on the same page as me; it blows my mind that this late-20s girl isn't expected to be responsible.  She always has an excuse and doesn't think there's a problem. \n\nAnyway, AITA? My friends think I need to apologize to her so we can all get together again comfortably. I can apologize but I'm worried nothing will change and I'm not okay with that. ",

      "description": "My cousin is an odd one. \n\nHe's the kind of person who walks past a cemetery and talks about how he can't believe humans still bury their dead. He's the kind of person who knows the age of consent in most Asian countries. He's the kind of person who uses the term \"normie\" frequently, and condescendingly. He's the kind of person who speaks in obscure 4chan meme terminology and seems frustrated if I just don't get it. \n\nMaybe you get the point by now. \n\nI already have a generally negative view of him. My biggest gripe with him, though, is that he's seemingly impossible to impress. And on top of that he's very condescending to other people's opinions - often going as far as to say that when it comes to things like sports or certain kinds of music, people must just be pretending to like those things. (I don't like sports either, but I'm positive people's love for them is genuine) So whenever I'm around him I basically have to avoid talking about anything I've done or seen recently that I've liked because it will just be met with *\"I just don't see how people like that\"* or *\"how on earth can you stand that?\"* with pretty much anything. \n\nWell I had enough of it a few nights ago when he was at my house. I had Lord of the Rings in, and he sat there most of the time just complaining about his job and every single frustrating encounter he had for the past several days, talking almost as if he honestly thinks the world has been set against him. After all, he is the only right person in the world and everyone else is just a mindless sheep. Eventually he looked at the tv and (he didn't know much about lotr) after letting out a frustrated sigh *\"Is this just standard high fantasy?\"* This was sort of the straw that broke the camel's back for me and I went off. \n\nI don't remember the exact words I used, but basically I told him that you can make anything sound shitty by merely putting the word \"just\" in front of something. But I continued on (shouting) telling him that I was so sick of hearing everything he said be so negative and condescending, and that he needs to get it through his head that people by and large don't like what he does, and that those people are most likely perfectly fine as they are. He let out a sigh and said \"yeah I'm gonna go\". That was that. \n\nI still believe the idea of what I was telling him is correct. But I feel somewhat bad about the shouting. I'd never really confronted him about this before, and I feel that in the past I could have just told him something like \"yeah I don't know about that, man\", and had more discussion about it from there. I think he's convinced I went off on him solely for speaking bad about a movie I liked. While that's not true, I still wonder if my reaction was rather infantile?\n\n",

The only issue is when we're alone and she starts talking about it i get aroused like crazy. It often leads into sex.\n\nShe has come to terms with it as her wanting to control the situation while still reliving the rapes, so that she has more power over the memory.\n\nHowever shes recently begun questioning why I get aroused by her stories.

      "description": "AITA for trying to understand my hard of hearing mom?\n\nSo This happened when I came home. I had Band practice and I did not know if he wanted us to stay later to practice so in the morning when she asked if I wanted to go I said no about 3 times. I get home and my mom (a little hard hearing) comes to me and says to have a shower before we go to the haircutters. I say that I have a lot of homework and I can't go tonight. She says that she has a coupon for $3 off and I again say no. She then gets mad at me and starts to yell about she waited all day just for me to say no and how they may accept the coupon later. I ask her to say that again and she tells me that she said it before how it expires today. I say then ok we can go but she instead gets mad and says forget it and rips the coupon up and storms out the door. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill provide more info if needed.",

      "description": "I'm working with a team for a lab project. Our lab proposal was due yesterday, but we asked the professor for an extension to today morning, since we were busy with exams and other coursework. Our professor was lenient enough to grant the extension, but he made a comment that he would rather have us submit a thorough and precise lab proposal than one that's rushed for the sake of completion. And during lecture, he basically said that he knew some of us would be submitting our proposals late, and that he wasn't too bothered by that.\n\nAnyhow, we got our lab proposal finished in the evening instead. As I was working, this one member texted the group chat. She first stated that she couldn't see the shared Doc, but followed it with a \"nvm.\" Later, she said that she wanted to help out but didn't know what was happening. Frankly, I was irritated that a) she hadn't done *anything* up to this point, and b) she couldn't figure things out on her own, so I left the text on read and continued working instead. After I finished, I told her to refer to the lab protocol and the research study our project were based on.\n\nDuring the last hour or so I was working, my group members popped in and out of the Doc but didn't do anything. Eventually, they left altogether. After I finished, I waited for \\~30 minutes to see if they'd add anything. Since the proposal was complete and I wasn't seeing new activity, I decided to submit our work. In hindsight, I realize the best decision would have been to message the group and ask for permission, but since we were already running late, I didn't want to wait any longer when our work was done.\n\nAfter I submitted, one member pinged the group chat with a question. It wasn't anything big, but it was something we could have made clearer on the proposal (i.e., a valid revision). But now, it was past the point of revision.\n\nSo, in short:\n\n1) I ignored a team member who asked for help because I was annoyed with her laziness and incompetence, which I attributed more to an unwilligness to look through the material for herself than not actually understanding the content.  I don't think what's on our proposal is that difficult to figure out; anyone keeping up with the class should be able to comprehend it.\n\n2) I submitted the proposal without asking or waiting for a confirmation from my team, since they'd logged out and I was the only one working on it at the time of completion.\n\nI understand that there's room for improvement and that I should be more cooperative in the future, but was my conduct unacceptable? AITA?",

We’re both in college so I gave it to her as soon as I got back from break and she wears it everyday. \n\nFast forward a few days to Christmas when I gave her a Stirling silver necklace of a butterfly...again quite pricey. She made it kinda obvious she didn’t get me a present which is fine except the she ended up leaving her butterfly necklace at my house on Christmas. She’s been to my house at least five times since then and has never asked for it. \n\nAm I wrong for wanting to keep it for myself now? My boyfriend says I should text her and ask if she wants it but I believe that if she really wanted it she would have asked for it back by now.

      "description": "Basically a friend I know online from a game was messaging me about how he was depressed, he was trash, he wanted to die. He would also send me memes and songs about dying. I had him added on discord and facebook. I've only known him for a couple of months but recently he got worse about dying especially after i told him we couldn't be in a relationship because we were too different. \n\nI tried encouraging him to get help by talking to someone, going to counsellong, seeing a doctor to get medication etc but he refused to do so as he's tried counselling before and the medication turned him into a zombie. I told him the right medication at the right dose wouldn't do so but he still refused.\n\nI got so worried about him that I ended up messaging his mum on facebook about it a couple of days ago. I had thought about it alot before doing so and had discussed about it with a couple of my friends who agreed with me. She didn't reply so I ended up messaging her fiance tonight after my friend talked about dying more.\n\nApparently they blew up his phone with texts after that message as they were at work. As I am in a different time zone to them I hadn't realised they were. He messaged me basically telling me never to message his family again and asking why I did so as he's an adult not a teenager. I explained that I was just worried about him.\nI ended up deleting him on facebook, discord and the game however as I don't see our friendship being the same anymore and to be honest it got fustrating trying to talk to him when he was negative all the time and wouldn't talk about anything else.\n\nOh also I'm 23 and he's 24.\n\nTLDR: Messaged online friends parents about him being depressed and talking about dying. He got mad about it. Ended up removing him as a friend from everything i have him added on. ",

      "description": "CONTEXT: I live in a city where the public transport system (PTS) allows monthly pass holders to get in and out of bus relatively fast. Basically, from morning till late afternoon, buses allow pass holders to get into the bus through its exits in addition to the original entrance (two exits + one entrance per bus usually). Since this incident, the policy has changed quite a bit and they only allow it at subway station stops.\n\nAs you can guess, there are people that abuse it, hence partially why the PTS has security details of its own to enforce rules and give fines to non-pass holders. The enforcers dress like cops and will be referred to as \"Agents\" in this story.\n\nSITUATION: It is late at night and buses have become scarce. I get out of the subway and see my bus. Along with six to seven other people, we rush towards the bus to not miss it. Every single one of us enters the bus through its rear exit as it is the closest to the subway station exit.\n\nSo I'm chilling in my seat, getting ready to doze off a bit before my stop when I hear an agent come in from the same rear exit pointing at me and declaring:\n\n\"You, come out.\"\n\nI comply and we stand outside of the bus exit.\n\nThinking it's just one of those routine checkups, I offer to give him my pass so he can scan it and I would be on my way.\n\nMe: \"Here's my pass.\"\n\nAgent: \"Do you know how to read?\"\n\nHe was pointing at a sticker on the bus that described the buses' open door policy.\n\nMe: \"...yeah?\"\n\nAgent: \"What does this say? You can't use the rear exits after X hour.\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, but do you want to see my pass or..?\"\n\nAgent: \"I can give you a fine for this.\"\n\nMe: \"Look, I have the monthly pass, and entering from the front or the back wouldn't have made any difference in mu case. I simply didn't want to miss my bus so I entered from the back. Can I go now?\"\n\nAs if on cue, the rear exit door closed and the bus left.\n\nI looked at the agent, baffled. He looked at me, then at the bus, then back at me; He shrugged.\n\nAgent: \"Too bad.\"\n\nMe: \"Are you serious?\"\n\nAt this point I was livid and really wanted to rip him a new one. It's like 10-11pm, I'm tired and hungry, and this dipshit has nothing better to do than to loiter in front of the bus stop to lecture my ass? \\[100% accurately describes my feelings back then\\]\n\nMe: \"You just made me miss my bus! What was the point of this???\"\n\nAgent: \"Not my problem, don't break the rules.\"\n\nMe: \"Are you kidding me? You seriously have nothing better to do?? You wanna fine half the bus passengers too??? I have a goddamn pass!! Forget it.\"\n\nI realized I was getting really aggressive so I walked away to cool down. Had plenty of time for that though, it was 40 minutes until my next bus. ",

      "description": "Hello,\n\nRight now I'm working as an English teacher overseas. I'm teaching a class for a group of students in their late-teens / early-twenties who have little-to-no interest in learning English. \n\nI'm not the *best* teacher, but I don't think I'm the worst. I believe I manage to make the class not miserable for the students by joking around and creating a relaxed atmosphere. \n\nThere's a class in this classroom right before mine, which is led by a nice, talkative, older lady who speaks good English, as well as the native language of my students. \n\n^(I want to withhold judgment of her so I don't skew this post, but personally, I find her a bit nosy--she always asks what we're doing today in my class and asks to see my material and textbook and stuff (when I'm trying to set up for class in the 10 minutes between our classes). I think she's legitimately curious and interested in learning more English and stuff, but it's kind of annoying)\n\nAnyway, she sometimes asks to sit in on my class. For all intents and purposes, I feel like I should be OK with this. Again, she's very nice, and she helps out the kids who are struggling and stuff like that. It's like a free teacher's aide, which should be helpful. \n\nHowever, you know that feeling when someone's behind your back watching you work on something? I have this feeling the entire class whenever she's in there. I feel like it affects my teaching ability to a certain extent--I try to like \"follow the textbook\" more and joke around less, which is pretty boring for the students. And, yeah, it just kind of makes me feel anxious having another teacher in the class.    \n\nSo today, when she asked if she could sit in on the class, I said no. Actually, I said, \"How about next week?\" because I didn't want to say no outright. Haha. \n\nAITA for telling her she couldn't stay in my class? Follow-up question: If I'm not, how should I get it across to her that it makes me feel uncomfortable having her in there?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**: I'm a teacher and another teacher asks to sit in on my class sometimes. She's nice and helps the students. However, it makes me feel nervous having her in there, so today I said no, I didn't want her to stay in my class today. AITA? ",

      "description": "TL;DR at bottom but I’ll try to keep this concise. I [20F] have been dating this guy named Todd (not real name) [20M] for two years now. We have our problems like every couple and have really good communication. The current situation may be a dealbreaker though. I have a low sex drive, I identified as asexual in high school but dropped that label in college to see if maybe it was just my previous relationship. I have come to the conclusion that I am okay with sex like once or twice a year but it’s really just not for me. I’d rather be doing anything else. I don’t want sex, I don’t want oral, I don’t want to be the giver or the receiver. My boyfriend on the other hand wants sex once or twice a week, and he’s been willing to compromise and play on his own but now it’s coming to a point of problem with the two of us. I asked him recently to go on more dates with me recently and he has put in the effort and now he’s asking me to put in more effort for sexy time, however I don’t want to. I don’t want to put in effort into something I don’t enjoy. I’ve told him if he’s not happy in our situation I won’t be upset for him to break up with me, and yet he is upset I’m not willing to put effort into it. I feel like he’s trying to change who I am but I can understand how he thinks the way he does and I feel bad that he sees me as not putting in effort.\nI’ve decided I don’t want to try to enjoy sex and sexy time when I don’t but this will really upset him, am I the asshole?\nTL;DR I don’t want to put effort into sexy time and he does and he sees me as not wanting to put in effort but I see it as not wanting sex period.",

      "description": "This sounds bad, but hear me out. My partner and I are in a loving, healthy relationship. We’ve worked hard for 3 years to build it this way. We’re happy and have lived together for 2+ years.\n\nThing is, we met when we were both broke. I found my way into a decent paying job, my partner never did and so I spot all the expenses. Our end game is to buy a house in a cheaper state within the next few years. He’s been working his way up academically and just got into his dream program which would train him well for a job. It’s a 1.5 hour flight from our town.\n\nIn a few months we’re moving into a brand new space that’s close to my work and family. Our current house is far, shitty and expensive. I’m honestly so excited to be moving back to my hometown, to a nice place, and...to have the whole place to myself!!! \n\nPlease remember I love my partner. But I want him to do this big thing for his future and our future. It’s in a state we want to live in and I feel like I’ll finally get to breathe a little when I live alone in this new space close to everything I love. Obviously I will miss him, but living alone in a spankin new house sounds like - honestly - a much needed vacation. \n\nThe plan is to work remotely next year and join him after 6-9 months apart. AITA for kind of looking forward to living alone?",

Long story short, they met on a server, having a relationship, became a staff, and here we are. Everyone congratulate them in the DMs, so they created a channel solely to congratulate them.\n\nThen, on the next day, I wrote a message for them, but, besides of the congratulate message, I warned them to not cause any relationship drama, because the server has friendly vibes, and also a Discord partner. I was having a vibe of r/imgoingtohellforthis, but I sent it anyway.\n\nOn the next day, they deleted the message (I guess, afraid to look at it) and wrote a message that they will delete negative response on sight.\n\nI was having that feel again. I don't know if I should feel bad for this, because they are having a good time, and I messed it up. Tell me guys what you think.",

      "description": "This is a throwaway. Also sorry for any spelling / grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (24 F) have been together with my boyfriend (26 M) for a litttle over a year now. He is white (German) and I'm asian (Chinese). Our relationship is going amazing so far, so no complaints here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn two weeks, my boyfriend's mother is going to celebrate her 60th birthday. It'll be a pretty big event, they ordered a huge banquet and there is going to be a dress code for the party (formal evening attire). Since I don't own any fancy dresses, I decided to wear a Qipao to his mother's birthday party. For those of you who don't know, it's a traditional Chinese dress. Mine is green with lots of golden embroideries, so all in all it looks very pretty and elegant.\n\nWhen I told my boyfriend about it, he thought it was a good idea. His father on the other hand suggested that I should probably wear something more \"normal\". I'm not even gonna unpack this statement (I guess traditional Asian outfits are just too \\~exotic\\~ and \\~out there\\~ for some people) any further cause I can't be bothered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I'm pretty short on cash at the moment. I'm a Uni student and my side job's salary is decent, but I had to spend a lot of money on all kinds of stuff this month (rent, repair costs for my flat, insurance, meds, etc.). All in all, I simply can't afford to buy a dress right now. I even asked his sister and some of my friends if I could borrow one of their dresses, but they all either looked too big on me or didn't really fit the occasion.\n\nI told him him about that and he insisted on me wearing something else. At that point I was just annoyed by his persistance, so I said \"If you want me to wear something else that badly, you can either buy me a dress or just uninvite me, plain and simple.\". Needless to say that statement pissed him off, but he eventually gave in and said I can wear whatever I want.\n\nFunnily enough, he was the only one who had an issue with it (which is funny cause it's not even his party lol) but he's a really bossy person who is used to getting his way so nobody else said anything about it (not even his wife).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough I'm happy this issue has been solved, I'm starting to feel doubtful now. His request was pretty ridiculous, but I wonder if my response came off bratty and entitled. Since it looks like me and my boyfriend are in it for the long run, I really don't want his father to have a bad impression of me and think that I'm rude or whatever. Part of me thinks I should apologize for the way I said it, but on the other hand I also feel like my reaction was justified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Obvious reasons for throwaway (hence the new account, I know this subreddit hates \"new\" accounts even though they are clearly allowed in the rules). \n\nIn early January, my sister called and asked if her former roommate could come stay with me in March while she attends several job interviews. For reference, my sister and her friend are 28, I'm 25 and I now live in the LA area while I'm going to grad school. I knew this girl by reputation and said that would be totally fine, especially since my roommate was moving out and a week help with the rent while I look for a sublet was a huge lifeline for me. \n\nTwo weeks ago she arrived at my apartment by uber and there was an instant attraction. She is very physically attractive. I knew from my sister that her friend has a problem with lying, maybe even pathologically. I also realized very early on that if I just sort of ramble, I had a good shot at hooking up with her. What was clear is that she is completely full of shit, even if I hadn't known her by reputation, her stories about her past are so fanciful and out there that a two year old could tell she was lying. After four days of hanging out and her being on a high from getting a sick job (pharmaceutical sales, she's going to be a billionaire with her looks and ability to spin a yarn) she asked if I'd like to have drinks with her. One thing led to another and we had completely consensual sex. She liked it so much that she ended up staying for almost 3 weeks instead of her originally planed one. It's not my place to be gratuitous so I'll spare details but it was a great time. \n\nShe just got home yesterday evening and my sister both called me and emailed me calling me a piece of shit, asshole, loser, scum bag and every other name in the book. She said I had set her friend's mental health back by \"years\" by not calling her out on her bullshit. That it was my job as her brother and \"decent person\" to not play in obvious lies for \"selfish reasons.\" I explained to my sister it was completely consensual, my sister's exact response was \"I know that you fuck wit, I'm saying that you needed to be a bigger and better person and help JXXXXX out in her recovery from past traumas but you set her back by years!\" I feel I need to clearly explain that while I knew this girl was a liar, my sister never explained to me that I needed to stay away from her or that she was in \"recovery\" or counseling when my sister set up her staying with me. \n\nAm I the asshole here?",

I completely support legalization and I have no problems with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I do have a problem with is the smoking habits of my boyfriend. He smokes basically every evening and weekend and it's really starting to annoy me. I should stress he doesn't smoke for medicinal reasons, it's purely recreational. It's always the same thing. We're going to watch Netflix? He needs to smoke first. We ordered pizza or whatever, he needs to smoke.\n\nHe becomes incredibly lazy when he's stoned. He sits on the couch or in bed and doesn't really move. It also stinks up the entire house (he does smoke outside but it reeks) and he can become incredibly childish and immature. He always gets horny but I don't enjoy sex when he's high so we don't do that anymore. I don't want to sound like a stuck up bitch, but it's really getting to me.  I asked him if he could tone it down, and he said he would try. A month later nothing has changed and he told me that he's having issues trying to cut back. I told him that it sounds like he doesn't care what I think, and that I would be more than willing to help him out. He said he doesn't need my help, but yet he's making exactly zero progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for asking him to cut back or stop? It's like he doesn't care about what I think.

So fast forward to today, where my brother (15) had a plan to get my parents a gift. But my dad was home so only one of us could go, which he already decided was him. So he went, and took my money, which was over $20 but I didn’t care. After all, it was a gift for my parents. So then he went and grabbed it and came home (where my dad was cooking so he didn’t see him) and ran upstairs. He then wrapped it and told me he would tell me when to write a card for them, which I wanted to do. I forgot to mention I was EXTREMELY worn out because I took a straight 3 hour test (too hard to explain) and I went and played CS:GO. So he was writing cards and called me up to write my cards. I said “in 2 minutes”, and I actually meant that. But his immediate response was to shut down my computer forcefully and give me a death glare. And obviously I’m gonna get banned in CS:GO (but that doesn’t matter). His stare obviously meant I’m not writing anymore cards, and I was pretty bummed out. \n\nBut here’s the AITA part. Since I didn’t write one my brother used my letter to write why I was selfish and only cared about myself. My parents read it and agreed and didn’t bother to hear my story. I got so many “you’re so selfish” I just want to make sure I’m not even though 3 other people think I do. So what is it, Reddit?\nAITA?",

This year, Brenda became president of the club, and I feel like she's changed completely. Before becoming president, she and I would usually always make fun of the stereotypical club member. We also didn't take the club that seriously.\n\nOver the last semester, Brenda became part of some leadership committee in the club. She complained constantly about the committee leader, Samantha.  She would text me daily bitching about something Samantha did or said. She also wanted to make a report against Samantha for being unprofessional. \n\nFast forward to today, and Brenda has done a 180 on everything. She now \"loves\" Samantha and says stuff like \"Omg, I love Samantha, but I really wish she would stop taking all the cookies\". When I try and mention how much she hated Samantha just a few months ago, she'll usually just brush it off. She also now claims the club is the most important part of her life. She's always talking about how she loves all the members she used to hate, and how the club really is a meaningful organization. \n\nI understand changing your mind about something but completely reversing your opinion on something/someone after two years feels so artificial to me. I've also started noticing various other ways Brenda seems to change her mind to try and fit into whatever role she wants to be. AITA for thinking this new change is totally fake and that Brenda is kind of a fake person in general?",

      "description": "Okay so, I’m on mobile so sorry about formatting. \n\nLittle, kind of long, back story. My wife and I meet and staring daring, got married, lost our fist girl, then was able to bring another girl home last year. Before our first pregnancy, we bought a house and during it worked it the house. And so our weekends was taken up by working on those house, now this house is literately seven minutes away from them, but we would always come over when they asked us to, but they would never stop even thought we could see the pass on the road. We always tried to get the to come over and see us, not work or anything as my father worked away from home and I felt bad for asking them to help when he has two days home. \n\nWhen we told them we was pregnant all my dad could say was you need better insurance, to which we had good insurance. We didn’t have to pay for anything. \n\nBut, we lost of first daughter, got the house done and moved then wasn’t long we had our second. But, and this is when crap hits the fan, has my father and I was watching the nurse check on our daughter in the nursery my father said something to me. I forget the exact words at first, but it confused me at the time. And I looked at him and he said this staring into my eyes “. Don’t screw up next time and have a boy.” I don’t know about you all, but to me you don’t say that to someone who lost their first while they are checking on your one hour old daughter. \n\nWe bring her home and stuff. Hardly ever got a call or text about her from him, my step mother would come by during the week, but when it comes to the weekend they stop by for 30 out of the whole weekend. We tried for two months straight to make plans and do stuff with them, but it’s always were going somewhere. Later down the line, I’m hurt cause I can’t get my own parents  to spend time with their grandchild, and they ask if they can take her. And my and wife and I said, before you do we would like for her to know you before so. And that sets them off, don’t speak to us for like three months. \n\nThey start seeing her some, but stop talking to my wife and just try to go through me. They try to take her, after telling me that “it doesn’t matter that we want her to know them, they’re her grandparents.” And that sets us off, and I don’t say anything about it, because I want to see how far they’ll go to see my daughter.\n\nContinue in comments.

      "description": "My boyfriend used to smoke every day, multiple times a day, bowls at a time.\n\nHe quit, and has been “clean” for about a year. He got a job that drug tests, which is a great motivator for not smoking.\n\nYesterday, in a conversation with my sister, him, and brother in law, I mentioned that “it’s not the smoking part that gets me, its the potential loss of his job”. I ultimately didn’t want to seem like a controlling girlfriend, so I said i was “fine with it” because I can’t control what he does.\n\nI don’t have anything against smoking weed (I personally don’t like the sensation and only smoke to help my immense pain in my joints, but only as a last resort), but my boyfriend smoking weed/doing drugs could ruin his job. He only gets drug tested if he fucks up/gets injured work, but  he’s already been injured once or twice before, since he’s a welder and there are risks that come with it.\n\ntoday, My sister and boyfriend were talking while I was playing video games with a headset - so i couldn’t hear the conversation. What it ended up being was that BF was going to go to his old plug, get weed, and he and my sister were going to split the money for the weed 50/50. \n\nBF looked at me and saw my demeanor change as he was getting ready. He asked “Why are you upset? you said it was okay”. \n\nI looked at him and said, “you said you needed to be tight with money. THIS is not being tight with money. and what if you smoke and go “fuck i missed this”, and start smoking more? and what if you get injured at work, are drug tested, and then BAM, you’re out of the job?”\n\nHe assured me he would only smoke a little, and after he left my sister tried to talk me through what i was feeling. I said I wasn’t mad, but I was definitely upset. I was upset and fearful of the possibilities that could happen, and ruin his life. The job he has is hard to find in the area I’m in - he’s tried looking for other jobs. He’s a good welder, but only has been welding for 6 months, so he’s not “experienced”, which puts him in a rough spot IF he lost his job. \n\nAITA for feeling this way? My sister thinks I’m mad at her, BF now feels bad, and I feel bad for essentially contradicting what I said vs. how i actually feel.\n\nIt’s easier to say “I’m fine with it”, but when it actually happened, my mind went into overdrive about shit that can go wrong easily and negatively effect him.",

      "description": "Hello Reddit,\n\nNot sure if I should post this over here or at relationship advice. \n\nEnglish isn't my native language.\n\nLast friday, 15th of February, I received an anonymous package of chocolate from a webshop who delivers cards/flowers/chocolate etc. Since it was the day after Valentines day I assumed it was a day too late. My first reaction was to thank my boyfriend  - classic mistake, it wasn't his. I asked my friends thinking it was a joke or something, but none of them did it either. At first my BF and I were joking about it, but I didn't really feel good about it. The mystery of not knowing who it was (an ex who tried to reconnect? Someone else I'm not aware of?). Besides that, My relationship isn't exactly hidden. I'm very open about it so for me it felt like someone was disrespecting my BF. He wasn't too stoked about it either but we had a good talk about it and laughed it off. \n\nOr so I was thinking. Because this morning he called me, telling me he called the webshop who delivered the chocolate. Apparently the webshop forgot about their privacy policy, and apparently my BF knows how to lie and sound very convincing, because the webshop told him who sent the present. It was very innocent, one of my nieces sent it because I helped her with a personal matter and she wanted to thank me. As soon as my BF told me, I got very mad and sad, hung up the phone and decided to call the webshop myself. I had a good talk with them about their privacy policy and they apologized, told me what exactly happened, and also told be there should have been a card along with the chocolate. I'm not sure what exactly happened that the card didn't make it, but they'll send it again.\n\nLater today my BF called me, immediately apologizing and saying that he should not have done that. I told him he absolutely shouldn't, and that I don't want to talk to him for a while. I said that I need some space and time and that I'll let him know when I'm ready to talk again. \n\nI know him well enough to know he did this out of insecurity, out of fear to lose me, and a bit out of jealousy. Besides that, it was 'only' my niece so nothing to really worry about. Now I have my emotions a little bit under control I feel like an asshole for ignoring my BF and being so mad at him. Am I making this bigger than it is? ",

      "description": "Throwaway obviously. It might be hard to write this without it being seen as r/iamverysmart so forgive me if so, that's not how I'm trying to come off. Apologies for the length of this too.\n\nSo, background: I'm in the last year of high school and we've just had a round of practice exams for our subjects, which we take to prepare for the real, national exams we take later in the year.\n\nWe got the results back for all our practice exams recently and I'd done amazingly well across all my subjects. Like, top of the 150+ people in my year, and the grades I received would put me roughly the top 1% across the country if I had achieved them in the real exams. I was obviously really happy since I'd worked really hard in the month leading up to these exams.\n\nI'm known in school to be kind of the \"clever kid\" since I perform well all-round. People assume that I'm just naturally really smart, which I suppose is true to a small amount, but I'm certainly not the genius kid that people believe me to be (not my own words, this is what other people have told me that people think of me, since it's not like I'm one of the popular people).\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that people often dismiss all the hard work I put in and just assume I do no work at all and just come out with good results because I'm naturally clever. It's not uncommon for people to call me things like a robot or liken me to someone with little social ability which I find quite upsetting.\n\nFast-forward a few weeks and I'm in a class where I sit next to someone I find kind of annoying. Not because they say annoying things, but because they say stuff like how I'm so smart and they wish they were me and wouldn't have to do any work. I've explained to them several times previously when they've said things like this that I still do have to work hard just like anyone else but they don't seem to either believe it or listen to it.\n\nSo in this lesson recently the person next to me starts saying about how they heard I got really great results, to which I just smile and politely say thank you. Then they keep going and say something along the lines of \"I can't believe you did so well in this subject without any work. I only got &lt;low grade&gt;\". From this I get quite annoyed and just snap back \"I do work hard. Maybe you just aren't working hard enough\". \n\nI didn't realise how harsh it sounded until I'd already said it, and so they kind of just went quiet and looked quite upset. In the moment I didn't think to apologise since I was still pretty annoyed at them. Bear in mind this person isn't stupid at all, just around average in the subject.\n\nI understand I said something that I shouldn't have said looking back, but I'm unsure whether I was the asshole considering how I've explained to them previously that I do put in work and they still continued to disregard that all and see me as someone who doesn't put in effort.\n",

      "description": "AITA that I (20f) dont want my partner (23m) to have his friend (24m) stay over night as often?\n\nTo give some back story, they've been friends for nearly 10 years, they both want to start up a food stall together and to do that they need to meet up every week to talk about it.\nThe flat we live in is very small, the kitchen and living room are one room, there isn't really a hallway just a small room to put your shoes, and there's our small bedroom and bathroom. For anyone to use our bathroom they have to walk through the bedroom to get to it.\n\nJust before Christmas time he was coming round every Wednesday night at about 10pm after his band practice, which stopped for awhile during the holiday period, but now he's back over. My boyfriend cooks them a meal idea for the stall, they eat it then talk a bit about the business, then proceed to chill out, the next day he'll either leave in the morning or, like today, he'll stay until 2 or 3pm.\nI work as a waitress and I usually work split shifts which means I'll start at 11am, finish at 3pm, then go back into work at 5pm, and work until 9/10pm, which means unlike anyone that works 9-5, I have literally no free time apart from my days off which are Wednesdays and Thursdays. This is the same routine for my boyfriend except he's a chef.\n\nI feel like I can't be free to do whatever I want in my own home when he's here. I can't sit in bed in my underwear as if he needs the toilet he has to walk through to get to it. The same applies if I want a lie in. I feel like I can't get up, put on my own music and put some shelves up and do some tidying because it's rude, if there's a guest round I don't feel completely comfortable being myself, doing whatever I feel like. I need to ask what they would like on, or if they're okay with me drilling the walls for awhile...\nAnd I can't ask my boyfriend if he would like to go out anywhere or give me a hand with anything because that would rudely leave his friend out. \n\nI also need to give him a lift to the train station, not that I'm being forced to, I agreed to, I would feel too bad to say no as it's a 30/45 minute walk uphill. But now (my own fault) I need to change my plans to help him.\n\nNothing I wanted to get done has been done, and now I need to wait an entire week to get any of it done again, which might not even happen if he's staying over again.\n\nI spoke a bit about it with my partner, as he knew something was wrong. But I don't want to tell him he can't have his friend over, I'm not sure when they would talk about the business any other time as our schedules are just work.\nDon't get me wrong, I really like his friend, he's a lovely guy and very polite.\n\nAm I just being selfish? WIBTA to ask him to stop staying over?\n\nTLDR my boyfriend and his friend want to start a business together but the only time they can talk about it is on my days off, in our tiny flat. I don't feel comfortable in my own space. AITA for not wanting him here?\n\nThrow away account as my boyfriend is an avid reddit user...",

All this has sparked was an attitude from her, and she does nothing to change it. \nHe pees everywhere in the house. The walls. Shits and pees on the couch. The carpet. Theres literaly not a DAY that doesnt pass by where this isnt pee (im really not joking. There can be up to three puddles a day and they completely ignore it expecting someone else to clean it up)\n\n&amp; its not like they dont have time to clean it up or take him out? She goes outside on the porch to smoke 5x+ a day but she still doesnt let him out, even if hes whining at the door.\n\nIve witnessed her blame it on MY dog (medium sized shiba inh, LARGER poop than a chihuahua &amp; i walk him DAILY. even if he does go i pick it up as soon as i see it), Ive seen her just leave it there for MONTHS (literal MONTHS. not exaggerating). She had a teenage daughter that could let it out in the morning and afternoon but she doesnt. I feel bad for the dog because its just decoration to them at this point. \n\nObviously, I already know some people are gonna recommend i take him out myself. I just wanna say that im absolutely NOT going to do this. Its their dog, Its not my responsibilty? Why get a dog if you arent gonna take care of it?  I feel like if i take care of him for them it just reinforces the behavior that they dont have to take care of him at all. Thsy have no care for the fact everything smells like shit and piss and dont care about cleaning it up AT ALL. Theres literally a puddle of pee on a suitcase near the couch thats been there for a week. Im sick of cleaning up after them. \n\nHes not registered under a vet. Has has no shots. Eats out of my pets dog bowl. \n\n\ntldr: sister and her daughter negldct their 7+ yr old dog, lets him shit and piss everywhere and ignore it/dont clean it up bc they expect me or someone else to.

So we’ve been talking.\n\nI came down with “flu-like” symptoms (that’s what the pharmacist said) and haven’t gone to my classes in 2 days because of it and have been in bed the entire time and my Mum was aware of this.

      "title": "AITA for disliking how my dad has been parenting after a divorce?",
      "description": "First, some context. Also, this might seem biased, but I’ll be as objective as I can. Also I know a stereotype of teenagers is that they hate their parents, even if their parents are right. So I want you guys to let me know if I’m the asshole here. Or if it’s my dad. \n\nMy parents divorced a few years ago. It was anything but amicable. The whole time my dad was being an asshole to my mom, basically blaming her for everything wrong in his life. It was awful. I was depressed, and had frequent panic attacks. The whole time my mom just stood by and did nothing.\n\nNow I alternate between their homes every week. Things were good, until I found out my dad wasn’t (and still isn’t) paying any child support whatsoever. My mom is very generous and forgiving, so she never retaliated. My mom can rarely get anything for herself. His defence is that he doesn’t have enough money, yet he managed to pay for a 7-person trip to Florida for spring break. \n\nNow, what motivated me to post this was the fact that my dad timed it so that he would have me for 3 weeks straight. My parents agreed to a 50/50 alternating every week. \nI arrived at my dad’s house last week, would be going to mom’s this Friday, but he decided to time it so that we leave tomorrow and it lasts throughout spring break. Since my mom was nice, she let it slide. The problem is that when I get back next Friday, I’m staying at my dad’s place for another week. His justification is that because if he hadn’t taken me I would’ve been at my mom’s house during spring break, and I would end up at his house at the end of the break and have to stay there for a week. I don’t understand this. \n\nI personally don’t think it’s fair and respectful of my mom, and how she wants to spend time with me as well. He is using her kindness so that he can only have us, in what I believe to be his attempts to make us there full time. He believes himself to be more worthy of me than my mom, as he frequently says that he wants me full time, and that my mom is a bad parent, because if I do anything he doesn’t approve, he says my mom taught me to.\n\nIf he sounds like a narcissist, that’s because he is. As far as I can remember, he has always thought of himself as better than everyone else. He believes that he can never fail, and if anything happens, it’s not his fault. \n\nAll in all, from my point of view he has been selfish about raising me and ignorant of both the fact that he is not my only parent and what I want, and he has no respect for the woman who is saving him money and has yet to retaliate against any of his aggressive actions he still makes years later.\n\nEven if you think I’m the asshole, I would be thankful if you could let me know why, so that I can understand where I was wrong.\n\nThanks.",

I am not a fan of this band whatsoever, I decided to be a bit of a \"memester\" and make a couple of memes about kpop etc. I thought they would just laugh it off or something, but they were just REALLY offended.

      "description": "The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlong with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents \"expect\" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was \"grounded\" because i turned my phone off in the theater.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her \"slave\" for the rest of my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here? ",

      "description": "So this story takes place about a little over a month. I started talking with an old friend of mine from 7 years ago again and long story short we got together (for a short while). I would talk with her every night and tell her good morning, try to be with her as much as possible, and overall be with her. She had it rough as she was suicidal and had it rough those 7 years so i felt obligated to do anything to show her that i cared for her. After a couple of days she would start getting more depressing that usual and it scared me but I would still try to talk with her and hopefully calm her or at least something to ease up her suicidal thoughts. Luckily I managed every time. Also before we dated she was a bit of a physical person so she loved to punch people as it apparently “soothed” her. (I call bs) So she would punch me daily. Soon after she broke up with me because she wanted to get with her best friend who was a guy. I felt heart broken but there wasn’t anything I could do. After a while I stopped talking with her in which her friends would ask me about her. I would all tell them the same thing. “We aren’t together anymore.” And then maybe a couple days later something happened to my best friend so i was with her for the longest while and apparently my ex was watching. For that longest while i comforted my best friend you know like being by her side 24/7 if possible, showing her love, holding her hand, etc. It just looked like we were together. Bad part my best friend was also friends with her so my ex would fabricate lies saying how im abuser, or that im just gonna hurt her etc. My best friend didnt believe her since she knows im not like that. Soon after my best friend confronted me asking me if i was using her to make my ex jealous. Of course i said no as I wanted nothing to do with my ex anymore. Conversation continues and she confesses that she’s been in love with me for 3 years. Long story short we get together. (Still together for a month now :) ). Soon later most of my ex’s friends start texting me or straight up telling that i didnt love ex, that i used her to get to someone else, or that i straight up was just an asshole to mentally abused her. Idk what lies ex told them but the harass just keeps coming am I really in the wrong?",

      "description": "tl;dr  Open-office rage.   I cannot get over my hatred for my co-worker, to the point I have to change jobs, and it will let down important projects for a lot of people who I care about.\n\nAITA for not being able to get over the following concerning, let's say, \"Chatty Rob\"\n\n* The setting:  we work in about a 20x40 \"team room\" open office containing 12 people.   Close your eyes and consider how tight this space is.  Whatever one person wants to talk about is basically what everyone has to talk about. \n* Meet Chatty Rob, the compulsive one-way talker who can turn any interaction into a 10-minute digression\n* He's not an un-nice guy, midwestern nice, except the aforementioned overtalking and things I'll mention below\n* He really wants everyone to know all about his hobbies, which are guns and martial arts (sidebar - he has no military experience, I do, and he's not much interested in my perspective)\n* He has a loud boisterous ringtone, I believe it's Looney Tunes 'That's All Folks'\n* Rob doesn't have much sense of personal space.   Which is fine, except\n* He doesn't seem to be a big fan of flossing, judging from the black cloud of death emanating from his gums\n* When he comes to work in the morning we get 15 minutes of sports, traffic, weather from Rob.   At 3PM he declares he needs to leave to get ahead of the traffic, then digresses for another 30 minutes of news, sports, weather, and the latest idiocy from those idiots at headquarters.\n* Last thing... I'll lose some sympathy here probably, but when it comes to politics in the workplace, I believe in being very passive and neutral because it's not relevant and nobody needs the conflict.   Chatty Rob on the other hand freely goes on about building Trump's wall, putting Hillary in jail, and similar themes (seemingly oblivious that we share the space with a woman, a black dude, a chinese dude, and 3 Indians).    Those are the exact opposite of my politics, so naturally I hate them, but more than that I hate that he talks about them in a shared space where anybody with half a brain might realize, hey, maybe not everybody wants to hear my thoughts on this shit.\n\nI've raised this with management a couple of times.   They don't respond, we're a conflict-averse organization.   I try to drop hints like walling myself off with 3 monitors, or saying \"OK good chat Rob\" after 30 seconds.   None of it works.   I don't even know how to broach the subject that someone has bad breath.   It seems ridiculous that I even have to waste brainpower on this in a Fortune 100 company where everyone is supposedly professional.\n\nIt's really sad because I want to do a lot of good things to help this organization, and a number of key projects depend on me.   But quite honestly, for my mental health, I just can't work with Rob anymore.   Ever.   Can't even be in a meeting with him.  I've gone to working from home 3 days a week to avoid the shared space, and mentally speaking, it's making me kind of mental to be so isolated.\n\nSo I feel like the asshole because I unprofessionally cannot find a way to get over an annoying co-worker grudge.   In fact, am I?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hey guys, so since November, my girlfriend and I were planning to go to somewhere for a 3-day weekend before school starts (Vegas, Lake Tahoe, LA). Shit had hit the fan because last semester I joined a business fraternity where I had became friends with many people. Beforehand, my girlfriend had occupied so much of my time, we'd talk 6-8 hours a day and had led me losing any of my close friends. When the semester started, I loss touch with her, I became more involved with my fraternity and shit had hit the fan because she became jealous of other girls that I was getting to know (not flirting or anything, but becoming friends with), so as the semester ended we tried fixing my issues of lack of communication and openness. \n\nCue the end of December and my fraternity announces a retreat to Tahoe, to potentially party, have very fun moments and really develop bonds with other people in the fraternity I haven't got to know. It is on the same date that my girlfriend and I had originally planned to go on vacation together, and I was torn in between these two events. For one thing, I had never had gone on such a trip with friends and for another thing it's from what I hear something people in my fraternity won't forget. So I am allured to that idea. I feel like going on a trip with my girlfriend is so expensive FWIW (Each of us are looking at $500 which is not really wise for both of us who are in college, in comparison to $55, but I can't bring her). I also feel like there may be fights and horrible experiences just because are relationship is just pulling itself back together. In fact, we just started planning this 2 days ago when it should have been 1 month ago minimum. \n\nDeep inside I just wanted to have fun on a trip that I may not be able to experience again, and I was hoping my girl can trust me, but she can't because I had deleted a text to another girl saying Happy thanksgiving\" when I told my gf I wouldn't reply back. It seems crazy and childish, but a lot of trust was lost because I was replying to other girls texts before her. I wasn't trying to get with any of these girls, it just feels so great being friends with people. In other words, I've been in a controlling relationship and I just started having these experiences.",

      "description": "this happened a while ago, but ramifications are still relevant, and I've been told different judgements by different people on if I'm an asshole or not...\n\nso a while ago my best friend and I decided we wanted to get together and have an epic road trip.  we live quite a ways away from each other; 2800km (1700 miles).  so the plan was for her to fly out to where I lived and then we'd road trip back to where she lived.  once there we were going to spend about a week together just having fun and reminiscing (we were college friends and hadn't seen each other in a couple years).  along the way stopping in different places and generally having a great time.  \n\nthe first part of this plan went off without a hitch.  she flew to my place, we had an awesome time, and then the road trip began.  we had a blast-- blaring music, sleeping in the car under the stars, swimming under waterfalls, and exploring interesting off road attractions.  I noticed, however, that she was getting anxious because she wasn't getting money in from her work that she was supposed to (something about papers that were supposed to be forwarded in time).  I told her not to worry about it-- I had enough money, and that she could pay me back anything when we got back to her place and sorted it out.\n\na major part of our trip that I had wanted to do was visit a big city near where we were going to be.  she knew this (we'd made a rough plan of everything we were going to do on this trip), and knew that we were going to take a bus into the city from a smaller town so as we weren't driving in an unfamiliar city with millions of people in it.  well the day we were going to the city her grumpiness and agitation had begun to get to head.  she didn't speak the entire bus ride there, so I let her be, thinking maybe when we got there she'd be in a better mood (after all, we had lots of fun stuff planned for the city!).  once in the city, however, she immediately declared how much she hated it, and how everyone there was always so stupid and angry and how the city smelled funny and went on and on.  I snapped and asked her why she didn't say something \\*before\\* we'd gotten there.  no response.  regardless, we went to our first destination.  she noticed how much this place cost to go to, and said she didn't have enough money.  I said that was fine, that I'd pay for it.  she said no-- told me to go by myself.  I was angry at this point, and said that was ridiculous and began to walk away.  she said she was just going to stand there and wait for me to go to which I retorted 'fine', and just continued walking.  \n\nI ended up walking only about thirty feet to a nice fountain where I was able to sit and relax and calm down a bit.  I looked over and saw her a few minutes later walk away; she obviously didn't see me.  I bit later she text me asking me where the hell I was.  I told her where I was, and she was \\*furious\\*, saying she'd already walked all the way back to the bus station. (I will add here that we are, despite the immaturity this may all seem-- fully grown adults).  I went back to the bus station, and she wouldn't say two words to me.  when we got back to where the car was she said she was calling her boyfriend to pick her up (we were about 400km from her house only), and that I should just leave and go home (a nice 2500km drive... by myself with no warning).  not that I objected as I was \\*very\\* angry at that moment-- I'd spent a lot of money on that trip, and I didn't understand why she was so furious at me.  \n\nand since that day she hasn't talked to me since-- nor has any of our mutual friends as, apparently, I am an asshole.  \n\n...am I?

      "description": "For as long as I can remember my father has always been literally a terrible person. He’s very toxic, he’s always negative things, talking bad about people being two faced.I have some many examples but I’ll name a few.\n\nWhen I was 11-14 yrs old I hated wearing shorts and only really liked wearing pants/capris  he called me a lesbian because of that.\n\nAnother time his exact words which were very hurtful he said “ If your mother were to suddenly die one day  I’m putting you and your brother up for adoption because you guys are old enough to take care of yourselves” I WAS LIKE TEN when he said that WTF.\n\nMy mom is the real MVP here for sticking around all these years trying to work things out with him because she still lets him come over to her HOUSE,after everything he’s done. He cheated,he really mean to her and when I was younger my dad divorced my mother without her knowledge SOMEHOW apparently he got someone to forge her signature (I’m not sure how that’s even possible but I was 4yrs old at the time)  \n\nSome more info...my father has 6 other children, was married to 3 different woman and 1 from the first wife,4 from the second and 2 from his last wife being being my mom. \n\nI’m unsure of why my father and his second wife divorced but because of that divorce he cut off his 4 children from that marriage (In fact he disowned off all of his children including me) but his exact words “ they sided with their mother” and my whole childhood/teen years he manipulated my brother and I to thinking that my other siblings were bad people but I now know that’s not the case because I got in contact with them a few years ago and I’m good friends with them now and they told me what the relationship was  truly like between their mom and our dad.\n\nI got in a huge argument with him a few months ago because he was upset that I didn’t call him for his birthdays, Christmas, send him cards for the Holidays. I told him that” It’s a two way street with communication because first all you don’t call me either or send me anything and plus why would I do that for you if you don’t deserve any of that?”He got angry with me and said I was being disrespectful and that Parents come before their kids and regardless I was supposed to call him and send him cards. Every time I stand up to him and defend myself he said I’m being disrespectful but I’m not. I do not call him names or don’t curse him out.\n\nTo please my mom I actually tried  calling him a few for his birthday this year he did not answer the phone at all.All of these things and more is why I decided I never want to talk to him again. My mother/my moms family does not want me to do this, they urge me to call him for his birthdays,Christmas and I refuse to do that\n\nI just wanted to know AITA here?  \n\nThanks for reading in advance and I apologize for the novel.

She used to have relatives but they kinda forgot about her so now her only friends are neighbors. \n\nA couple of weeks ago she went to my mom and asked if she could come to her birthday party. My mom said that she wasn't sure since she has a lot of work to do but she considered it and bought her a gift. I wasn't invited and frankly, i wouldn't even want to go since i have really bad social skills and would feel awkward. \n\nToday, i heard a knock on my door at 6:20 PM that sounded like someone jamming at it. I was a little scared but when i looked it turned out to be her and she asked if i could come. I hesitated and didn't give her any clear answer except an awkward smile. She just looked really happy to have at least someone come to her birthday. \n\nThe idea of being at a stranger's house alone isn't very appealing to me, considering that i'm a minor. I called my mom and she told me that i could use extra homework as a reason and not go inside.

      "title": "AITA for comparing work conditions in other strip clubs with my boss?",
      "description": "I worked at a strip club in a rural area for over a month. I have two other jobs, this stripping job was more of a side job as it doesn't contribute to my resume.  I had warned my boss that I couldn't work the following week as I just started a new job. Now in this industry (in Australia), the management is supposed to work around the dancer's schedule and that's why they hire a lot of girls, so they can cater to the club's needs and dancer's schedule. Sometimes they have minimum shift requirements each week but you can take a break if necessary, as burnouts are quite common in this industry. It is a small club but from my time working there, half of the dancers come in once a month or once a fortnight,   \nI should note they have been working there for years. So a little background to these texts, the clubs hours are 8:30pm-4:30am and it takes me 1-2 hours to drive to work.  She expected me to come down to work despite giving her a week's notice and she was unprofessional about it, see links for screenshots of her messages. Also, I am aware that I have made some grammatical errors in my messages, I was typing them between work breaks.\n\nTLDR version - [https://imgur.com/a/RnFizVF](https://imgur.com/a/RnFizVF)\n\nThe whole conversation - [https://imgur.com/a/rAODTej](https://imgur.com/a/rAODTej)\n\nThere are times where she will deceive the dancers just to get them to come in. For example, she will say there's a bucks party booked when no such group is coming in that night. So I thought this was another one of her scams or guilt trips to come in, a dancer (we'll call her Bree) corroborated with my theory as she said she has been receiving similar texts earlier that week. Also, I highly doubt that she will close down the club because of one girl not coming into work, she also owns 3 other mansions and hires them out for Airbnb, so her livelihood doesn't depend on the strip club. Bree advised that I may have misinterpreted the texts but under reasonable circumstances. Bree has been working there for over a year and she has dealt with some similar work incidences herself but she stays calm and collected about it, and understands what my boss is trying to communicate. I may have let my anger get the best of me, I rarely get angry or stand up for myself but when I do, I can take it too far and/or misinterpret some messages. \n\n\\*\\*TLDR; My boss wanted me to work but I couldn't, despite giving her a weeks notice. She was very unprofessional about asking me to come in, so I defended myself by saying other clubs would not do this and ended up getting fired.\n\nSome additional personal info that might be useful, I only chose to work at this club as it is small and it's quite intimidating to start at a city club as there are 80+ dancers on Friday to Saturday nights and more creepy customers, so I thought I would work on being assertive and hustling skills at a small club and work my way up. I knew the other clubs would have an issue with my full-time summer job, hence why I haven't moved to a city club sooner. ",

The incident:\n\nWe were all pretty drunk at this point in time and it was about maybe 2 am. My friend Jen went outside to smoke a cigarette. While outside she was followed by this man that had been a part of a group of maybe mid 30s guys that had been watching our group from the other end of the bar all night. We had witnessed this guy get punched in the face earlier for an unknown reason. He asked if he could smoke her cigarette with her, she declined and gave him his own. For whatever reason he still insisted on smoking hers, she told him no again. \n\nShe came back inside and told us about it.

We laughed, we moved on (I thought.)\n\nThis guy Alex that was with us pulled me aside and told me how messed up my joke was and that the guy heard me. I told him the messed up thing was following some strange girl outside and asking to smoke her cigarette with her. Alex was someone I had a fling with in the past, but stopped talking to when I realized he didn’t really respect me or women in general.

      "description": "TLDR at bottom. My husband and I used to sell weed. My friend is an ex-customer and my current BFF. Even though we quit dealing, my husband and I occasionally helped our friends find stuff if they need something. This past summer we helped my BFF and her boyfriend get some and it snowballed after that. It turned into a weekly, sometimes bi-weekly, event. Kind of obnoxious when that's not your actual lifestyle anymore, but they don't have very much money and we could find it cheaper than they could. She texts me almost daily to see if I can get anything for her. \n\nLast week, however, she told me something that pissed me off. She said she has yet to buy her children anything for Christmas because she is too broke. I've watched this chick buy $50-100 of weed weekly since summer and now she's telling me that she \"can't afford\" to buy her kids any/many toys for Christmas. Then 2 texts after lamenting this to me she, you guessed it, was asking for weed again. \n\nI know she probably doesn't have any other options for weed at this point, but I don't care. Her kids have been through a lot of trauma and drama in their short lives. She fell into hard drugs for a few years along with their bio dad, who just recently went to prison on some serious federal charges. She has turned her lifestyle around completely and has stayed clean for years now, and I'm very proud of her for that. However, she is always talking about how life has been \"rough\" for her kids and how \"they deserve something special\", like she is some sort of martyr, yet continues to buy weed in lieu of actually doing/buying for the kids. My husband and I excessively dote on our child and buy all the toys and take all the trips we can, so I always chalked it up to different parenting styles. But after she complained about finances for Christmas then immediately asked for weed, my opinion changed completely. I now think she is just being a selfish twat, or a poor planner at best. \n\nSo I've been telling her that I can't afford to go get weed anymore because \"I spent all my money on Christmas for my kid\" even though I've been done shopping for my kid for weeks. Every time I look at my child's stash of toys and remember that my friend's kids have absolutely 0 makes me sad and angry. \n\nTLDR: I refuse to sell my BFF weed because she hasn't bought her kids Christmas gifts yet.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So this happened about an hour ago. \n\nSome back story... I get along with all my neighbors except for one. I wouldn't say I don't get along with them, but I have no interest getting to know them. The street parking in this neighborhood is pretty limited, and this neighbor for some reason has a ton of cars (like 6). They use all of their driveway and park two in their yard. If they have guests they usually park in front of my house. I don't really know who lives there because there's so many people that go in and out of the house. Sometimes the men over there will cat call me when I walk out to my car and just make me feel uncomfortable. They also have a lot of loud parties that go until 2am.\n\nNow that you have some info, I came home today after a long day to see a truck parked in front of my drive way. It blocked maybe 60% of it, and I somehow squeezed in between to park. I was annoyed that someone decided to park their car there, and I suspected it was the neighbors I described earlier because they were having a party. Instead of going over there to figure out whose car it was, I just called the nonemergency police line and reported the vehicle. Someone came by and gave them a ticket and asked if I wanted it towed. I have roommates who need the driveway so I told them to tow it. As the tow truck came, 40 drunk (I'm assuming college.. They were pretty young) people came out of the house cussing a storm. Some got in their cars (that were blocking other driveways) and drove off. The truck in front of mine re parked his car and looked visible pissed about the ticket. The neighbors got out their flash lights and were shining and pointing at my house. I could hear them saying that it was fucked up I called the cops and I could have asked them to move.\n\nI am not the type of person to call the cops over menial things, but I honestly don't feel like an asshole because I don't feel like it's my responsibility to figure out whose car that was. I think they are assholes for even parking in front of my driveway. Am I in the wrong here?",

      "description": "Reposted third time because the first version was removed, I didn't write the acronym for \"Am I the asshole\" in the title. Throwaway because my gf is on reddit. PLEASE DO NOT UPVOTE TOO MUCH, I DO NOT WANT HER TO SEE THIS. \n\nSo recently, my gf and I went to visit my grandmother and great grandmother down South for our spring break. We are both 19 year old college students and we go to school in New England (USA). They really loved her. They spoiled her throughout the week, and she was so grateful, and so was I. We were both so happy that they took to her so nicely. I had definitely been nervous about it. We stayed in my great grandmother's home (she lives directly across the street from my grandma, they live very close to each other) for 7 days. It was a blast.\n\nNow that we are back at school and continuing the semester, my gf keeps asking for my great grandmother's address. Both my great grandmother and my grandmother were English Lit teachers, and my gf keeps saying she wants to write a letter to each of them to thank them for everything they did for her during our stay.\n\nHere's the thing: I get where she's coming from. I do. I just don't want to give her the address. She did not know it while we were staying there (purely because she never asked and never paid attention and I was driving everywhere in my grandma's car). I think it's kind of creepy and stalker-ish to do. I told her I could give her their phone numbers to text them, but she said that she thought they would really appreciate a hand-written letter, and she said she'd rather do that because it seems more personal. I told her I think it's creepy and that I think they'd find it creepy, and she got upset at me. She said that I blew it out of proportion and it's how people communicated earlier anyway, and she just thought it was a thoughtful thing to do. I am not budging on this, don't worry. I'm not gonna let her force me into it. But she is upset at me and hasn't spoken to me properly since our fight (last night). So I want to know: who is the asshole here?\n\nThere's more to it, though. My grandmother was married to a really vile man (my grandfather-- I don't talk to him) and he was abusive towards her physically and verbally. She left him and they divorced. For years after the divorce, he continued to stalk her and send her threatening letters. She and I are very close, and she confided in me that she still gets nervous opening letters from people she doesn't know. She had a restraining order against him, but it does not matter now, because he is in hospice care a few states away. I am worried that if my gf sends her and my great grandmother a letter, it will freak her out. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm a college student, and I rent a house along with 4 other guys. Our landlord can be a bit much sometimes but for the most part we haven't had any issues with her. One day last week I walked home through the back gate, the way we always enter as it's the quickest way to get to/from the bus stop, and I saw a lady I had never seen before, walking with a dog through the backyard. We have no side fences and our gate does not lock, so I thought I was seeing somebody who thought our backyard was a nice shortcut through the neighborhood, and maybe a good place to let her dog take a shit. \n\nImmediately I got defensive, and shouted \"Hey, what the f\\*ck are you doing back here?\"\n\nThe lady responded: \"I'm here with the owner, that's what the f\\*ck I'm doing!\"\n\nAt that point I remembered that the landlord was coming over this afternoon. However, she did not tell us anything about bringing a friend. Of course, if I had seen this lady accompanied by the landlord, or if the lady was ostensibly working on something (we have plumbers, contractors, etc. at the place periodically because the house is old) then I would have reacted differently. Our lease agreement states that we require 24hr notice before the landlord comes, and she should let us know if she's bringing anyone with her.\n\nI explained to the lady: \"Listen, you've got to understand where I'm coming from. I see someone that I don't know in my backyard, I get defensive. You could have been anyone.\"\n\nShe wasn't interested in my explanation. And for that matter, I wasn't interested in apologizing, especially considering the way she fired back at me.\n\nLater in the week, the landlord came to visit again on business. I stayed in my room but heard her talking to my roommate about the incident. She had some pretty strong opinions about how I should \"act more grown up\" and be more understanding of/patient with people (strangers?) on the property.\n\nI'm glad that I wasn't out there for her to lecture me about it. She would've gotten nowhere. If landlord wanted to bring a friend, she should have accompanied her at all times or let her stay in front of the house.\n\n**TL;DR --** I yelled at a random lady in my backyard. Turned out it was the friend of our landlord, but landlord told us nothing about bringing a friend. Now landlord is mad at me.",

      "description": "Context: this is a bygone relationship, just asking out of curiosity. My ex was not an especially sexual person but at the time i believed that she was okay with it now and again. We're about 17-18 here.\n\nAlso, mobile, so sorry for format\n\nMy ex and i started doin the deed about 4 months into our relationship. My ex had previously stated that she'd like to wait till we were both 18 for whatever legal/personal reasons and I respected that, but we carried on with lesser stuff (handsy thing, you get the drift). However, handsy things lead to greater things and we ended up doin it before either of us turned 18. It was a mutual thing after a nice long dinner.\n\nThis was fine and dandy and we continued having sex occasionally but never incredibly often. Over the year long relationship we probably did it 8-10 times. Often i'd begin to intiate but she'd decide not tonight and instead of telling me straight up, she'd just say \"eh\" and shrug, leaving me very confused about what she was feeling. Even if i prodded which made me feel like i was trying to pester her into sex, she'd just say \"i'm not really sure.\" Usually this bummed me out but i'd never throw a fit or anything, just lay down and cuddle with her more. I suppose this sequence of events often left a sour taste in her mouth because usually on those nights she'd leave quiet or vaguely unhappy. (In my parents place so she'd never stay the night) I may have been a little too persistent as this was my first sexual relationship and it was hard for me to know when was okay and when wasnt so i'd generally try a shotgun approach and always throw a hint in that i'm down tonight. If she said no, i'd usually back off completely, and if not completely, just more throwing hints.\n\nHowever, when the end of our relationship inevtiably came, she claimed that the only time she'd ever agree or initiate sex, she did so solely because she thought it would make me happy or make our relationship better, not because she actually wanted to. She added that when i'd get bummed out (slightly, mind you. It's not like i was upset that she isnt readily horny for me), she'd feel like she was letting me down or upsetting me. This left me a little hurt, because if she'd told me she just wanted to stop having sex i'd have agreed in a heartbeat until she felt ready. She later decided that she's asexual and I havent really heard from her since then.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA for not taking hints, or am i in the clear for trying to have sex with a girl who I was under the impression wanted it?\n",

      "description": "The title is pretty self explanatory, but I guess I must include some context. My S/O had been diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome about 4 months ago and was due an ultrasound as a follow up in her regular clinic. She went to the clinic and was told she had to visit a Gyno ASAP for a proper follow up as her current clinic had no Gynos available.   \n\n\nShe later set an appointment with a friend of her that she's known for a while who is a Gynecologist and just told me she was going to visit him to get a checkup. I kinda shrug it off at first, but then I started not liking the idea of a guy she knows getting all up in her stuff. I am not a jealous guy by any means, but something was just not clicking right considering how shy my girlfriend usually is when it comes to talking about her sexuality and how she gets super nervous even when she gets a checkup with a female doctor, so her being so cool about it sort of disturbed me in a way of ''Uhmmm that's a lot of confidence in a friend that will be looking at -your- genitals and perform an invasive ultrasound'' and I told her I would feel much more comfortable if she saw another Gyno, perhaps her sisters Gyno?  \n\n\nShe got upset and said she couldn't believe I was being this way considering how anti jealousy I generally am when she tells me about dudes who try to hit on her. This is true, but she only says that dudes try asking her out and give her compliments and she quickly corrects and says she is in a relationship so I don't feel I even have to be jealous because there is no invasion of personal space, etc.. She ended up going to her sisters Gyno, but not without saying ''I can't believe I am letting you decide what doctor I have to go visit because NOW you decided to be jealous''. It goes without saying that things are a little sour right now and no matter what I try to say to explain how I feel about the situation, it never ends well.   \n\n\nAm I being the asshole here? ",

      "description": "My partner in a previous relationship was very confident. And at first, I took most things he said at face value. Eventually I started to notice certain things were off. For example, certain \"facts\" I would find out we're just untrue. When I found out the correct version, I would usually say something like, \"hey, I found out today that [fact] actually happened like this - isn't that crazy?\" or something like that. I didn't want to be all \"I told you so\" about it, but I think learning is good, and I like the facts to be straight! Also, he had a hard time accepting when he was wrong so I tried to be nice about it.\n\nIn time, it got to the point where he would constantly make false claims about all sorts of stuff. Not just random facts. He would say that I had said something that I didn't, or that he had told me something that he hadn't (is that gaslighting?). It was very frustrating, and it led me to start fact checking a lot of things.\n\nThe thing is, whenever I would say something like I THOUGHT he may be incorrect, or that I WONDER if it happened a different way, he would just straight up tell me I was wrong. He would get really pissy when I wanted to look it up.\n\nEventually I got so tired of it. He would say something (that I KNEW was false) and I would just fact check him then and there. I got so sick of him making things up. He accused me of being pedantic and that I shouldn't care about little things. \n\nWe're not together anymore, so I don't have to deal with it, but I'm curious. Was I the asshole for constantly checking his \"facts\"?\n",

      "description": "Background: I’m 26f and engaged to a guy I thought was the one. I love him so much it hurts and I can’t bear the thought of life without him. We have a great life together.\n\nOne of his fantasies is me with another girl. He’s said he’d love to see it, he loves to hear stories about the dew times in college i kissed other girls and he loves it when I tell him stories about other girls while we are having sex. \n\nI went on a girls trip this weekend. On the trip was a very cool girl I’d never met before and she and I stayed in and drank wine while all the other girls went to a movie and club. One thing led to another and we ended up completely booking up in the Airbnb. It was very fun and felt amazing but we both agreed that it was just a hook up and no emotions, it wouldn’t happen again and that the only people we’d tell were the respective men in our lives because her husband has similar fantasies. During the whole thing I was so excited at how turned on my fiancé would be when I told him what happened. \n\nWell just got home and was so happy to see him and i told him what happened. He freaked the fuck out and told me I cheated. I asked him how was it cheating if he’d tacitly given me “permission” by telling me hundreds of times how much he wants me to hook up with other girls. He said I should be smarter than that and it was “just pillow talk.” I cried and cried and told him how sorry I was but I did it “for him.” He said that was bullshit and stormed off and the last thing he said before apparently turning off his phone was “not coming home, need to re-evaluate if this is the relationship for me.” \n\nI’m devasted but can see this going both ways. I didn’t mean to hurt him in fact just the opposite but part of me sees his point. \n\nAm I the asshole here? Please help me see this more clearly. ",

      "title": "AITA for being hurt that my parents gave my sister significantly more help towards her wedding than what they're offering to me for a house?",
      "description": "I’ll try to keep this as brief as I can while still including the details I think are relevant.\n\nI’m the second of five kids and the oldest daughter. (Hopefully this is not relevant but I’m also the only gay kid and my parents are conservative Christians.) My mom has always said that when it came to weddings, she and my dad wanted to help out each of their kids because they felt that was what the parents were supposed to do. Even in high school I knew I never wanted a big fancy wedding, just something simple and low-key, and several times my mother said if I didn’t want a big wedding, she and my father could contribute towards the down payment of a house instead.\n\nMy youngest sister was the first of us to get married last year. She and my BIL were 23, one year out of graduating college. The wedding was extravagant and beautiful and though they tried to cut costs in some places, it was expensive. Leading up to it, my parents threw them a big engagement party and contributed towards an expensive bridal shower at a restaurant. My sister and BIL had a second ceremony in the country where they got engaged, which my parents flew to and also stayed for a few days at a resort so they could attend the ceremony at my sisters’ request. I have no idea what they spent on the wedding itself, but my other siblings and I have guessed anywhere from $10-20k. Side note - my sister is in many ways the stereotypical baby of the family; my parents have always helped her out financially and she has very little understanding of the value of money or financial responsibility. \n\nI’m 32 and got married this past fall. My wife and I had a very small and inexpensive wedding, just immediate family and significant others, in a pavilion we rented out at a public park. We paid for almost everything — park rental fees, photographer, etc. As mentioned before, I never wanted a huge wedding and she was onboard; buying a house together was a much bigger priority for the two of us. We all went out to dinner afterwards and our fathers split the check, which we thanked them for and appreciated, but were prepared to pay for ourselves. We didn’t register for gifts and we got a nice card from my parents, but no formal wedding gift. My wife told her parents to hold off on a gift until we had a house, since we really don’t have space right now, and since our mothers talk a lot, I thought maybe my parents might do the same.\n\nMy wife and I have started the homebuying process. Her condo is on the market and we found a house this week we’d like to put an offer on. I’ve worked really hard to save over the course of my career and have lived fairly simply, so between the money I’ve saved and what we’re getting from selling my wife’s condo, we can afford to buy ourselves a decent house in an okay neighborhood. Based on the conversations going back several years with my mother, I was expecting some help from my parents for the down payment, but fortunately we’re not dependent on it. Any help would go a long way since there are so many costs involved beyond the down payment of a house.\n\nMy parents told me around the time of my wedding that they wanted to talk about the house/financial stuff at some point but they kept putting it off, which didn’t seem like a good sign. My wife and I met them for lunch yesterday right after making our second visit to the house we’re putting an offer on. They were asking for details about the house and seemed excited for us.\n\nJust as the food arrives, my dad says “Well, your mother and I would like to help you, and we decided that we won’t necessarily give each child the same amount when it comes to weddings and that kind of thing. It should really be based more on need. Like if \\[other sister and her boyfriend\\] won the Powerball, we maybe wouldn’t even give them anything. So we figured that if you and \\[wife\\] decided to throw a bigger wedding reception once you have the house, we’ll contribute up to $2000 for food.”\n\nFortunately I had mentally prepared myself for the conversation to go this way, although I really wasn’t expecting them to say they would help with a party that my wife and I don’t want and never planned to have. My wife and I held it together throughout the rest of the meal and eventually got onto other subjects before leaving. No fighting, no awkward silences, but it wasn’t exactly comfortable either.\n\nMy wife and I both work in public education — she’s a teacher and I do IT. We don’t make anywhere close to Powerball money and we never will, so I don’t know where that comment came from. My sister is also a teacher while my BIL is an engineer. My BIL probably already earns more than I do, and will certainly have the potential to make more over the course of his career. I mention this because of the “based on need” thing. Had my sister and husband waited a few years, they would have been in the position to pay for a lot more of their wedding, but they decided to marry when they did.\n\nSemi-TL;DR: I feel like my sister wanted a wedding beyond her means and was rewarded for it, while I worked hard and have been carefully managing my finances and I get…the satisfaction of doing it for myself, I guess? I know that on its own, that might sound incredibly entitled, but the main reason I had any expectation of help is that my mom had been suggesting it would be there since I was in high school. (I hate to think this had anything to do with it, but those conversations started when she thought I was straight.)\n\nAnd it’s not so much the amount of money itself that’s what’s important. I feel like they wanted to help my sister substantially to have her dream wedding, but they don’t think I deserve their help for what I want. It seems like they gave my sister way more money than they could afford to give each kid, and now they’re trying to rationalize why they can’t spend as much on the rest of us and I happen to be the first to find out.\n\nAITA for feeling hurt about this?",

      "description": "Hey all first post here.\n\n Background info:\nI work in a hospitals lab with very little patient interaction and no direct care. We are currently super short staffed (down 1/3 for various reasons ). There are several point age positions ranging from contingent to full time and anything in between.  On average everyone  picks up 4 to 8 extra hours per week to help with the staffing shortages. I myself pick up minimum of 8 scheduled hours per week usually 12( i work nights so i come in 4 hrs early two to three times a week) \n\nThe problem. \nI want to leave when im supposed to leave. If im scheduled to leave at 7 i want to be clocked out by 7:05 (barring any projects, tasks , emergencies) tue problem is when morning shift comes in and takes their sweet time starting to work( morning chit chat, coffee, slow and waking up ). So the morning rounds begin at 4 and my shift ends at 7. Often i will begin the work at 3 to guarantee it is done or reasonably complete by 7 (the bulk 90+ % done, work always trickles into the lab ) before i leave. We have these older coworkers who take their morning breaks religiously ( not lunch breaks ) and more often im stuck staying late to help with the trickle of work that comes in after im supposed to leave so they can get their breakfast in. \n\nAdditional info: \n-on nights we only get our 30 min lunch\n-numbers alone i do 50-60% of all the morning rounds work, even though there are 2 other people to split the work.\n- its usually 30 min to an 1hr after im scheduled to be done that  i get to leave because they go slow and won't pull their weight.\n\nI want to leave when its my time. I don't want to stay to help with routine work or to cover for breaks that i don't get. I don't like the morning shift coworkers as colligues or perosnaly so i hold no desire o help them out of good will and I'm already working  12+ hrs of overtime. \n\nTLDR; coworkers are slow, and cause me to stay 30 to 60 min late 3 out of 5 days. I want to leave when im scheduled to not when its convenient for them. ",

      "title": "AITA for cutting out a close friend for extending an invite to someone I hate",
      "description": "This has been eating at me for some time now and I just really need some outside opinions on wether I'm in the wrong here for terminating one of my closest friendships due to a third party. Forewarning, this will be pretty lengthy but if you can stick through it I promise your judgement/opinions will be appreciated greatly. I really need an unbiased person to tell me if I'm an asshole, but I feel like that can't be done without background so if you can, please just stick it out. Like I said, I'd be incredibly thankful for anyones time and feedback regarding this situation. \n\nA few months ago, during my first semester of college, I met four girls who all became close friends of mine. I met the girl who I ultimately cut out, lets call her Kim, in a class of mine along with her roommate. We all clicked pretty well off the bat, but Kim and I especially.\n\nAt the same time, I met two other girls in a separate class that I also got along with really well. One of which remains my best friend to this day, lets call her Mel, and the other is the girl I now hate, let's call her Jess. In this class, we realized we had other classes together, and agreed to start sitting with one another in those classes as well. We started sitting with each other in our English class, but I noticed that Jess was pretty standoffish from the get-go, and I noted hints of jealousy when me and Mel would joke around with one another or have side comments during lecture. Jess would often interrupt our side comments to see what we were talking about, or crane her neck over to get in on the conversation which was a bit weird since we all sat in a row and Mel was usually in the middle of us. I figured she just felt left out a bit and should be included in conversation more. This is something that still happens to this day, and I've come to learn that Jess can't tolerate not being included in anything and everything.\n\nKim and I began getting closer and I invited her to come sit with Mel, Jess, and I in English as well. The first day I invited Kim to come sit with us, Mel was extremely welcoming and friendly to Kim, Jess was standoffish as usual. After the class ended, Kim even mentioned that she felt like Jess disliked her and that there were weird vibes there. I assured Kim that I felt the same way about Jess, but to let it ride out as she lightens up a bit. That night, I got a text from Jess asking if I wanted to grab some coffee. It was a bit odd being she had never spoken to me outside of class, and I couldn't help but notice how the invite came the same day someone new was introduced into the circle. I said yes to coffee, but looking back I wish I hadn't. \n\nThe first time we hung out was a shit-show. I could tell that Jess thought it was a blast, but in the hour that we hung out, she somehow managed to use the n-word (she is white), bring up her homophobic beliefs as well as her families', and make sly racist remarks about black people. I am neither black nor gay, so I don't necessarily feel like it is my place to be policing what people can and cannot say regarding these matters.... but my father is a brown-skinned native man who has been called the n-word many times in attempt to dehumanize and embarrass him despite him not even being black, so I understand the negative power that word can hold when said by someone who has never been called that. I have black family members who despise the word so much they don't even allow their own black children to say it casually. Also, my grandfather was a gay man who lost his life to aids and lived a tortured life in the closet for decades... so I really don't give a fuck about what you think is right or wrong in regards to this subject, and I surely don't want to hear about it in a way that makes me feel like you somehow think I will approve of this mindset. As you can see, this really set the tone for my relationship with Jess from here on out.\n\nI immediately went home and had a long conversation with someone from back home that I knew I could trust and basically explained to them that I know it's early to just axe her out, but Jess has obviously shown me that she is someone who I can never expect to understand me on a deeper level, and she sure as hell won't ever understand my family or my moral roots. My friend explained that not every friendship has to be deep, and to set boundaries with her instead of being so cut and dry with my relationships, so I did. \n\nLater, I confided in Kim about my night with Jess and Kim told me that what Jess did really wasn't okay. Kim explained how she also had a strikingly similar family history as me and that Jess's opinions were unnerving to say the least. I assured Kim that I was talking to her in confidence, and that I wanted her to find out her own opinions of Jess and not pre-judge her before getting to know her. Kim said that she was already feeling very excluded by Jess and that she didn't see them ever being real friends, and that aside from my experiences with her, Kim never felt great around Jess anyway and didn't want to tell me because she didn't want to create unnecessary strife. \n\nAs Kim and I got closer, we started going out and partying with one another. When partying was introduced to our friendship, I think things really started to go downhill. Looking back, Kim was never really that great of a friend, but I think I put up with a lot more bullshit than I'd like to admit because I really wanted her as a friend. Some things that really hurt me included making out/ dancing on guys at parties that she knew I liked. She'd also blatantly tell me things wouldn't happen that \\*did\\* happen when I was drunk, in order to twist my reality and make me look like an idiot. To this day she will tell me to my face that I didn't kiss a mutual friend of ours that I had a genuine thing for, even though I \\*know\\* I kissed him and did so in front of her and her roommate. For what gain? I have no fucking clue.. \n\nOur \"going out\" group was pretty big, so I didn't think much of it when Kim suggested we invite Jess out with us one night. Bigger is always better when it came to the number of people in the group and I figured if Jess got to be too much, creating distance wouldn't be too difficult. I was very wrong. Jess has a boyfriend in another state who she emotionally manipulates in order to make him jealous and chase after her. For example, when she was getting ready, she mentioned that she wanted to just wear some jeans when she went out because she had no one to impress. But when she told her boyfriend she was going out and he asked her what she was wearing, she put on a skin tight black dress and took a picture of her outfit and sent it to him. When he called her and told her he was genuinely worried about her safety wearing something like that to a frat house, she laughed about it and told us that she loves when she makes him jealous. Throughout the night she would go around flirting with guys and take pictures of her hanging on them and send them to her boyfriend, telling him about the new \"friends\" she made. She would then come up to me and laugh about how mad her boyfriend was getting about the pictures. She even started dancing on a guy and then started bawling and ran out of the house saying that he \"forced himself on her\" even though I saw her back up onto him with little to no concern about her relationship. Then, she made the whole night about wether she should tell her boyfriend about how she danced with another guy. Insinuating that she wanted to because it would make him jealous, but she didn't want to hurt him. I hope my reasoning for absolutely hating this girl is becoming more transparent, if not crystal-fucking-clear. \n\nWhen I tried to mention how I was feeling about Jess to Kim, she told me that she just thought I was jealous because Jess was pulling hot guys. I assured her that wasn't the case, and if it was I'd be honest about it. But, I was feeling like Jess was using her looks to manipulate men, including her own boyfriend, and it made me uncomfortable. Kim just kept telling me that she thought I was jealous. I stopped talking to Kim for a few days, and when I calmed down I told her that it felt like she was stomping me out every time I tried to confide in her about how I felt. Kim admitted that it wasn't right for her to jump to that conclusion and to stick to it, she apologized to me and it was over with. \n\nMy final straw was one night where Kim invited her out with us and she spent the whole night luring guys into our circle, making them think they had a shot with her, and then publicly rejecting them in front of all of us. I felt like I was the only one seeing the little game she was playing, where her end goal was to make all of the other girls in the group feel less than and to publicly embarrass any of the guys who thought they had a shot at her. As we were walking home, she just kept repeating things like \"I can't believe he really said I was the hottest girl out of the group\" or \"I can't believe that guy just came up and offered me a shot in front of all of you like that, he said he was only giving them to the hot girls.\" By then I was done and left the group early. I was fuming, drunk, and I didn't want to be around her for another second. I remember leaving the group crying, but trying my hardest not to make a scene. I felt really torn down by the whole thing, and I felt like I was isolated in my opinions about Jess.. which made me feel like I was delusional. The next morning I woke up to texts from everyone in the group checking in on me and assuring me that boxed wine will do that to a girl and that they hoped I felt better in the morning. I got a text from everyone but Kim, the one I am by far the closest to out of the group. This hurt and I decided to put some distance between us. \n\nAbout a ",

      "description": "I'll keep it short. It's just been playing on my mind and I would like an outsiders point of view and maybe some guidance..\n\nMe and hubby opened our own salon that we both worked. I had our 1st baby last year and cut back working to only 3 days a week. He works the other 4. \n\nA month ago his sister decided she wants to train and has started coming in every day. That's fine we have trainees and apprentices all the time some work out and some don't. I personally don't like SIL she is just someone I don't get along with. Recently she has been telling SO what I have said in the shop. Things that are \"banter\" with my clients and jokes for example my dad gave me a mini bus to use and one said \"you should do taxis\" and I said \"no, nobody pays me petrol money as it is\" this was said light hearted and a joke but she made out to SO that I was bitching about how she never offers money for lifts places. That was just one of many where what I have said has been twisted to make me look bad as if I'm bullying her and no exaggeration every day I work I get an earache when I come home over something I haven't thought twice about saying and it's just made me uncomfortable in my own salon. \n\nMy opinion is I built this business and if she were anybody else I either wouldn't have hired her in the first place or would have fired her 2 weeks ago. So I've gone on strike and I am refusing to go to work while she is there. She refuses to not come in on my days and SO feels trapped in a corner and feels like he cannot fire his sister but won't let me fire her either....\n\nAM I The Asshole for going on strike and possibly forcing his hand?",

      "description": "My mum and Dad divorced when I was 2 and I've grown up with my mum and not alot of contact with my dad - his choice as he moved to a different country. Theres always been a bit of tension over the financial aspect of things, when they split he didn't have alot of money and so child maintenance was pretty low, my mum struggled financially to support us, she'd had a career in the army but as a single mother of two small children had to give that up and so most of my childhood she was working low paid jobs whilst studying to get a better one. Meanwhile my dad became incredibly wealthy when i was around 7 and this year became a millionaire. His child maintenance never increased and as he was in a different country there's not much my mum could do about that. When i started college he started to support me a bit more as well as inviting us out to see him etc and so I decided to just let it all go and focus on myself rather than being jealous of things I didn't have which I have mostly been successful with and I have a good relationship with him now. \n\nHowever, my dad loves to brag about how much money he has and how successful he is. Which is fair enough he works hard. But in the past six months I've had a baby, had a massive decrease in pay due to maternity and my husband has just managed to find work after being out for six months. We're in massive debt and finding life very difficult. My dad's aware of this and the last time we saw him( a few weeks ago) still sat across the table from us knowing about our trouble bragging about how wealthy he is. I absolutely don't want any money from him, (he's unbearable to owe money to anyway) but I also don't want to sit across a table from him whilst he goes on about all the money he's making, his new car that is equivalent to five years of my entire salary and the two houses he's just bought. Last time I barely managed to contain myself. \n\nI feel like with a new baby and lots of stress I just don't have the patience to sit there and listen to it without starting an argument and I don't want to ruin my relationship with him when in a few months we're likely to be better off and I'll feel so much better so I'd rather avoid the whole meal. However, my sister (from his second marriage) thinks I should go because he doesn't get to see my daughter alot because he lives abroad and I'll be an asshole if i dont give him this opportunity. Will i be the asshole if i avoid this meal? ",

      "description": "So, today is my day off (my only one for the week due to how my work schedule works) and my 10 month old daughter decided she wanted to stay up late, which is probably because of her cold. Because I usually work nights I didn't mind staying up with her.\n\nNot a big deal, but today is my day off and I was expecting her to go to bed at her usual time. So I drank a little and it caught up with me. Another issue was that my daughter didn't want to be out down and I really didn't want to bring her into the bathroom with me. So, I went to my room and asked my wife to hold her for a second.\n\nShe was not happy. In part, I think, because me being home is her day off too (in a sense) and another part because she was tired herself.\n\nShe still took the baby and I did my business, taking a bit longer to make a bottle with some Benadryl for the kid. Again, not happy about the delay and just took the bottle away from me and wouldn't let me take our daughter back to the bedroom.\n\nWas I an asshole?",

      "description": "Hello everyone!\n\nHere's my story:\nI have two sons, the older is 8, the younger is 7. I used to be a single mom for years. I found a great nanny 5 years ago, who helped me out a great deal ever since. She looked after them on weekends, picked them up from school, took care of them during holidays etc.\nWe became somewhat friends over the years, and she insisted taking the kids all the time. \nI tried to stay within reasonable limits and pay her as agreed, even though she never wanted to accept my money. Obviously, I insisted.\n\nI usually had this feeling that she is overly friendly with me because I'm a stable source of income, but I hushed these feelings away as she truly handled the kids well and they loved going there.\n\nFastforward a couple of years. I'm about to get married now to a great guy who has been living with us for two years. He works from home so bringing the kids to the nanny once a week was more for keeping our routine and not pressuring my fiancée into watching my kids. We are planning kid no. 3 and thought it would be handy to keep the nanny for the future as well.\n\nThe problem started yesterday. We came back from a 5 day trip with my SO and picked the boys up from her place. I asked them how everything went and they (mostly the little one) told me that they don't want to go anymore because the nanny's husband gets upset often and he is scary. They said that he hits them and his own kids when they don't behave well in the car, and later precised that he never actually hit them, just threatened them. I should also mention that my kids have rich imagination and they do indeed tell white lies.\nI figured it's best to go to the nanny with the kids to clear things out, knowing that she is veeeeery easily offended. I warned the kids to only tell the truth and to express their feelings to her, so it doesn't come from me.\nIn the end, she raised her voice and got really upset with my little one, saying that her husband is upset sometimes but he would never hurt anyone (I believe her), and that my youngest plays the baby to manipulate me. I understood that the whole thing was overreacted, but since the little one cried histerically today and yesterday as well, and he made me promise that he would not have to return to her place, I asked for her advice.\nI told her that I believe her, but I cannot ignore my son's emotions and I would feel like a terrible motjer if I forced him to stay with her. I asked if she has any advice for me. \nAt this stage she pulled her pokerface and told me that she was deeply disappointed that I side my 7 year-old instead of a grown woman and she made up her mind not to have anything to do with me or my children ever again.\nI apologized but stood my ground and left. I made the kids say thank you and had them realize how much she has done for them/us over the years. She didn't bat an eye.\n\nAny advice/opinion would be greatly appreciated ",

I do not know the couple getting married, but I am good friends with the guy who got invited. On his invitation, it says that guests are encouraged to bring their 'partners/dates'. Neither of us really have any female friends other than my girlfriend, so he decided to ask her to be his date. And to my discomfort, she agreed.\n\nNow I trust my girlfriend, and I do believe my friends intentions are pure, but I still feel uncomfortable that she would agree to be another man's date to a wedding. In particular, I'm uncomfortable with the fact that the wedding is in another town, and they would be sharing a hotel room.\n\nI asked him if he would consider asking someone else, but he doesn't seem to understand why I am uncomfortable with him taking her as his date, and he said he would be happy to take someone else if my girlfriend did not want to go.\n\nMy girlfriend does not seem to understand why I am uncomfortable either. She LOVES weddings and is very excited to go, and she doesn't see anything wrong with being his guest. This has led to us getting in a few arguments/fights, with her saying that it's just me being jealous and paranoid and that I don't trust her. And us fighting over me not wanting her to go only seems to be pushing her more towards wanting to go.\n\nSo I am starting to wonder whether I am really just being paranoid about the situation, since both of them can't see anything wrong with it. Am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend agreed to be my friends date to a wedding in another town where they would be sharing a hotel room. I am uncomfortable with this and my girlfriend thinks I am just being jealous.",

      "description": "Long story short, I don't like her or her husband anymore. They're lazy and always back out of things but always expect you to do stuff with them in return. \n\nI've extended my hand and suggestions to them many a time only for them to go with \"We're tired\" or \"Nahh\" but they always say \"You should x with us\" or \"Hey, maybe play x, it's a cool game and we're playing it, you should pay money and play the same game we play\" but ask them the same in return and it's always no.\n\nI don't consider that good companionship, not for me anyway. And the wife is a self-admitted control freak that I want nothing to do with.\n\nHer husband and I are cool, we talk about surface level things and that's exactly how I prefer them to be. Why? Because he also gives advice that I never ask for, it's so patronizing like \"Come here little baby sit on my lap and lemme tell you about big adult stuff\". \n\nAlso, the wife always finds out about whatever I'm talking to him about and again, comes to my DMs with pouty emotes and advice that I never asked for, and I'm appalled that she takes it upon herself to take the role of advice-giver for stuff I never talked to her about. Husband does the same thing, so \n\nSo I'm considering telling my boyfriend \"Hey, please please do me a favor and don't mention any of *my* personal business to them. Not about jobs, not about any developments in my life, nothing. If they ask, 'She's fine!' and leave it at that. You can talk about *our* business but as far as anything going on with me, leave it out.\"\n\nI'm sorry if I sound like an asshole already, but goodness gracious I get angrier the more I think about them knowing anything about me. It's highly irritating having a random message like \"Oh, hey, sorry to hear about xyz even though you never discussed it with me.\"\n\nI just like my privacy, especially from people that I do not care to associate with anymore.\n\ntl;dr: the couple is annoyingly condescending and I don't want them to know any of my personal business anymore.",

      "description": "Saturday I went to see Aquaman with my SO again as she was having a tough time and just needed to relax and destress for a bit. She jumps out of her funk after I ask her if we want to go see aquaman again and she's super excited to go.\n\nWe get to the theater which you get to choose your seats when you buy tickets, and I choose seats and I know are where she likes to sit. Walk in and there's two kids in our seats, and when I mean kids, I mean like maybe a 7 and a 9 yr old. No parents nearby.\n\nPolitely I ask if they are in the wrong seats and they just stare up at me and the one meekly says 9... okay, I ask them where their parent are and they both shrug. I look at their tickets which are out and their just one off from where they should be, I start explaining to them where they should be sitting and their parents arrive behind me and are clearly upset I'm talking to their kids.\n\nI try to explain, quietly to these parents their kids are in my seat and they counter back that they understand but they want to sit as a family. I understand, and compromise that I'll take their seats in the middle (which they have started setting up in) and the wife goes: No I have a neck issue I can't sit on the outside.\n\nI'm upset but my SO tugs on my jacket so I don't make a scene and I say fine, I scowl at the woman while saying it trying to show I'm upset with her. Movie starts and and I look around the theater and there's quite a few spots with 4 seats in a row, they could have chose at least three other places to sit, I'm fuming but my SO is enjoying the movie as are the other goers so I keep quiet. The kids sitting next to me are getting on my nerves though, they don't stop talking, moving, or playing with the recliner buttons all movie.\n\nWhatever, movie ends I get up to leave and the parents audibly talk to their kids \"See there's still nice people in the world that will accommodate you if you ask nicely.\"\n\nNOPE! NOT HAVING IT!\n\nInstantly flip on my heels, \"Yes, I try to help out parents who clearly don't know how to set good examples.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, are you saying I'm a bad mother.\"\n\n\"No, just a bad person.\"\n\n\"You can't talk to my wife that way.\"\n\n\"I can and did, I'd say more but I don't want to upset your kids, have a nice evening though, hope to never see you again.\" SO tugs at my sleeve so I just start walking away.\n\nThey yell at me from behind about how they're going to get employees and get me banned and how people need to accomadate families in family friendly films and blah blah blah. I keep walking and leave the theater.\n\nThe dad tries yelling at me across the parking lot, I look at my SO who gives me the look of \"Please don't\" so I just get in the car and drive away.",

      "description": "I hang out at a bar with a group of friends constantly. A couple months ago, I learned that one friend, we’ll call her Jessica, slept with another friend, we’ll call him Eric. Jessica likes Eric but Eric doesn’t want to be with Jessica. Eric has made this clear to Jessica. \n\nJessica and I had a heart-to-heart one night and she told me that she wanted to be with Eric but he didn’t feel the same way. I consoled her and tried to be a good friend. \n\nAbout a month after this talk, Eric and I are drinking at the bar and end up at his house. Things happen, we’re adults. \n\nThe next morning, I’m sick with guilt. I didn’t want Jessica to think that I’d betrayed her friendship or intentionally done something to hurt her. The below texts ensued.\n\nMe: Hey. I know this is out of the blue but I have something to tell you that I would rather you hear from me and not someone else. I was out drinking last night and I made a mistake. I hope you understand how much I cherish having you in my life and I don't want this to ruin the friendship that we have. I'm so sorry and I don't want this to come between us but I'll understand if it does and I'm taking full responsibility for my actions. Eric and I went back to his place after the bar last night and it got physical. I know that you have a history with him and feelings for him and I shouldn't have let anything happen. I'm not sure of what else to say but I hope you can forgive me. \n\nJessica: I dont know what to say.\n\nMe: You don't have to say anything. I debated whether or not to tell you but I felt like it was the right thing to do. I didn't want it coming back around to you through someone else like I was intentionally trying to hide it from you and I never intended to hurt you. I'm just sorry, and I know that might not mean much but I hope at some point we can be okay again. \n\n\nEric has already told me that Jessica has told our other friends and she’s really upset. I tried to be honest and upfront. I’m not sure what else I can do at this point. None of our other friends have said anything to me and I’m afraid to show up at the bar and be ostracized. ",

She’s upset because I did agree to four kids. The other day I told her I’m done having kids after she talked about birth control, and it got kind of heated. \n\nShe said I went back on my word, and that we agreed to have four kids.

      "description": "Okay so this is my first post so I hope I get it right. \n\nSome things I want to clarify first. Me and my then girlfriend (ex) had been together for about a year and a half at this point. I know this happened almost a year ago but I need to know for certain because it’s killing my mind. \n\nOkay so now the story, basically I promised her that I would take her out for a nice meal on a set date, so we talked it through and booked it about 2 months in advance. It was at a posh place and would’ve cost me my months wages but it would of spoiled her and made her happy so I could get around that. I’d bought nice clothes and she’d got a nice dress and all was going well.\n\nUp until the night before where, extremely tragically, one of my brothers closest friends died in a traffic collision. I didn’t know about this news until about 12ish the following day, about an hour before I was to pick her up. When I heard the news I immediately phoned her and told her I had to cancel and I explained the situation to her and saying that “I want to be here for him as much as I can incase he needs anything”. Expecting to hear a “yeah sure that’s fine I hope he’s okay”, I waited. Only to be on the receiving end of a less than pleased “K” before the call ended. \n\nAbout an hour later texts from her started coming through saying “you’ve ruined my day” “you never take me anywhere you always make up excuses” “you don’t love me, you never have”  “I should just fucking die cos you wouldn’t care” and the like from her. As well as “you’re the worst boyfriend” “ you’re so heartless” “how could you do such a thing to her” and others from her friends and family. I’m talking about mum, brother, sister, her whole friendship group. All calling me an asshole for it. \n\nI’m usually not swayed by general angry comments, I’m rather stubborn so I can mostly brush it off but this really hit me hard and made me question whether I did the right thing or whether I was the asshole here. \n\nPlease help, idk just need an answer to put the whole thing I rest in my mind as nearly a year later I’m still not over it. Many thanks :)",

      "description": "Note that this happened in Colorado -- Recently I moved into a new place, a 2 bedroom apartment with a person already occupying the other room. I moved my coffee table and entertainment center + TV into the living room but had no couch as I sold my old one while looking for a bigger one. So I did not use the TV when I moved in and have not used it for the 2 weeks I've been here. The main living area and kitchen are mostly occupied by things owned other guy. He doesn't clean up after he cooks so there are dirty plates and pots everywhere and he set up his yoga equipment in the living area and it covers around 85% of the space. He pushed my coffee table and TV off to the side to do this.\n\nI mentioned to him that I wanted to buy and bring a couch in to round out the look of the place a few times after moving in, but today he told me he wants to set up his pot growing racks &amp; equipment in the living room. I should have said no right away, but instead I asked him if that was gonna allow enough room for a couch, a table and the TV. He said he doesn't want a couch and would not appreciate me blasting movies while he was trying to sleep, which is weird because at this point he knows I work 6-7 days a week on the graveyard shift. So when he's asleep I'm gone, and when I get home I go to sleep and wake up while he's at work.\n\nAm I an asshole for not wanting this guy to grow his pot in our living room and being a little taken aback that he doesn't want a proper place to sit down and lounge around a bit? Am I just to retreat into my room and be as non-disruptive as possible? I'm 30 and have lived alone for most of my life, so I'm unsure how to handle this roommate?",

      "description": "I love my wife. She is a wonderful mother and great partner. But lately she has been convinced she has undiagnosed ADHD. She has been going to counseling for a few months now to resolve some personal past issues. When she brought ADHD to her Dr. and the counselor they both told her they don't see it, but she could go to X specific Dr. For a formal diagnosis. \nI feel like I've been more than reasonable with all of this, and I'm even okay with her going to X Dr. But I feel like she is using this possibility as an excuse for some really bad habits she has developed other the years and as a cover for some deep-seated emotional scarring from her child hood. She asked me today I think she has ADHD, and thankfully I skirted the question with a child emergency. But I can feel it coming again. So AITA?",

      "description": "There’s lots of backstory to this, obviously, but I’m trying to keep it short.\n\nMy mum left my dad a little over a year ago completely out of the blue. At some point she started an affair with a married man that went on for a couple of months. She drank too much (considering she has to take some pretty heavy medication for an unrelated issue) and started doing (soft) drugs. The guy broke up with her twice. She responded by attempting suicide both times. I cleaned up after her (both literally and figuratively) each time. The first time she did it, my father helped me take care of her; the second time I did it all on my own. I washed her bloody clothes (she didn’t want me to throw them away), wiped her kitchen floor, made sure she was transferred to a hospital close to home, settled everything with the police (she committed a few minor crimes during the second attempt) and so on. When she was admitted to the psych ward, I took an unpaid week off of work so I could make sure she had everything she needed — I paid for all her stuff myself, with money I don’t have (she told me she’d pay me back once she got out, but she never did.) I was the only one who visited her (almost every day) because the rest of the family „felt too uncomfortable“ to go see her.\n\nEventually, she asked my dad to come talk to her. She suddenly wanted to come home, to fix their marriage. At this point he had been in a serious relationship with another woman for months, and he told her No in the nicest way possible. The next day, during my visit, I told her she needed to let go. I also told her that I’d been operating way past my breaking point for weeks and I couldn’t take any more of this. She said, „I know.“\n\nFast forward to the weekend: It’s the first time she’s allowed to leave the clinic. I’m living with my dad while I’m writing my bachelor’s thesis and I’m home alone. She still has our house key and uses it to let herself in. She starts yelling at me immediately — how could I be so cruel to her, how could I allow my father to have his girlfriend over and so on. I try to calm her down but she’s having none of it. She walks into the kitchen, takes the biggest knife out of the drawer and uses it to slash a painting on the wall. Next she gets a hammer and starts smashing things — dishes, picture frames, family heirlooms. All the while I’m begging her to stop and she just plainly does not care. I finally threaten to call the police. She throws her keys at me, says, „Have a nice life“ and leaves.\n\nIt’s been three months and I haven’t talked to her since that day. I don’t *want* to talk to her. According to my older brother, who still sees her once in a while (apparently she’s moved in the meantime but she explicitly told him not to tell me where she lives now), she doesn’t think she did anything wrong. My grandma called to tell me that my mum is lonely and devastated and I should just „grow up, show some empathy and go talk to her,“ but I just *can’t* do the whole „Let’s just pretend nothing ever happened and/or manipulate you into feeling guilty for some reason“ thing that my mother always does. I’m all out of energy and on top of everything that’s happening I’m also trying to finish my university degree *right now.*\n\nFor the first couple of weeks I was very(!) sure that I was justified in setting boundaries, but my family doesn’t think so. I’ve been called irrational for expressing that I was scared when she took the knife, cruel for insisting that she „humiliates herself further“ by apologising for her actions, selfish for putting my own mental health before hers, heartless for insisting that she needs some serious psychological help before I can even *think* about reconciling with her. I stood my ground through all of this and now no one talks to me anymore. Not a single person is taking my side. Even my brother was just like „Well I guess that’s your decision.“ I’ve been explicitly told not to expect any help if I’m ever in trouble and I’ve been uninvited from every family celebration, including Christmas.\n\nI feel so fucking lonely and I’m starting to wonder if they’re right and it’s my fault and I should just give in. I know she’s had a tough life and it's not really her fault that she’s mentally unstable. I know she needs help (but I think I have neither the energy nor the psychological expertise required to give her that help). I'm scared she's going to hurt herself again because of me. I switch back and forth between feeling furious about the way she’s been treating me and cold, selfish and ungrateful for thinking about it like that. Did I overreact because I’m so stressed out about everything? My family pretty obviously thinks I’m the asshole. Am I?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: No one's going to read this, probably, but I just wanted to apologise. I got kind of overwhelmed with the response I got and stopped replying to people. I wasn't expecting the unanimous NTA judgement at all. A few of you suggested I should check out /r/raisedbynarcissists, which I did. I've also read a book or two on NPD and BPD and I've been recognising our family dynamics in a lot of those texts. This all feels very strange. Everything that was supposed to be normal suddenly fits into this pattern of a fundamentally dysfunctional family. I'm still trying to sort through my feelings about all of this. \n\nMeanwhile, my mother insists that she never said a bunch of things and we misunderstood the things she did say. I've contacted neither her nor anyone on her side of the family. Thank you all for taking the time to write a response to my post. I truly appreciate it, even though I never replied to most of your comments and PMs. \n\nAlso, I'm one of the people who get really annoyed with those posts on this sub where the OP is clearly NTA and just looking for validation, so, uh. Sorry. I learnt a few things about how being in the middle of a situation can apparently really fuck up your perspective of things.",

      "description": "So I posted a very brief video clip on Instagram of an old comedy reel bit (I won't post here because I'm not trying to dupe people into views or anything, but it's still up). The bit was a dipshit businessman meeting a Japanese counterpart and he can't stop saying vaguely offensive things (\"I'm so solly\" and Pearl Harbor references). As soon as he hears it come out of his mouth, he backtracks, apologizes and just sort of wallows in his own ineptitude. The gag is the idiot at work who never learns his lesson. Not exactly high concept comedy, but also nothing that hasn't happened on the Office ten times before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my cousin completely ETHERS me, talking about how could someone who's gone to \"comedy school\" think it was a good idea to post it, it's racist, did I ever think of our Japanese relatives, it's disgusting, it's an abomination, etc. etc. I haven't responded and probably won't, but my stance is that just because something is racial, it's not necessarily racist. With me, it's all about who or what is the punchline.  I was doing a fictional character and the punchline is his lack of self-awareness and inability to change himself. It's not like I was just up there rattling off Chinese knock-knock jokes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. Is my cousin overreacting? Am I actually racist? Is anything racial off limits for white comedians? Even if out-of-touch white people are the joke? ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I are planning to get engaged within this year. He (26) m is finishing graduate school a semester before I (25) f and will be moving to a bigger city where I will be joining him. We’ve discussed getting a place together and I’ve always underscored how important that it is we are engaged before we move in together.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I currently live across the country from my family and when we eventually move we will still be on the opposite coast. My parents have only visited me once in my time here and my mom has made it clear that she hates the city I will be moving too and doesn’t want to visit.   \n\nMy boyfriend and I equally want to get engaged and married— we are on the same page with this. I’ve also shared with him how important engagement is before we live together operating under the assumption my parents would be okay with this situation.   \n\nHowever, when I was home for the holidays my mom made it clear that engagement doesn’t equal marriage. This came as a surprise to me, albeit we haven’t discussed this much before so I was apparently making incorrect assumptions. I brought up the fact that my boyfriend and I may have a quick ceremony within the year, before we plan our big destination wedding, as we are not totally sure when in the next two years he will have enough time off work to make this wedding a reality. She then proceeded to say two different things...   \n\nFirst, she gave a throwaway “Well, it’s your life and you can do what makes you happy... and I’m sure you won’t tell me what you decide.” *insert guilt trip*  \n\nSecond, the following week, she said again how engagements are not marriages and living together without being married is “risky” because you don’t have a legal commitment, but, “do what I want.”  \n\nI come from a traditional religious family and my parents know nothing about my sex life as they believe everyone should wait till marriage. Tbh this is more of my mother’s issue than my dad as he tends to stay out of such personal matters.   \n\nI’ve thought a lot about this and it stresses me out a ton because I love my mom and I don’t want this to be a wedge in our relationship. I haven’t had the heart to talk to my bf about my mother’s comments as he is not religious and I think he thinks a lot of this is silly— not in a disrespectful way, but more ‘I have no personal experience with this sort of situation way.’   \n\nI haven’t taken many hard stances with religion when it comes to my mother. The possible exception being that my bf is agnostic and I have always been clear about not wanting to date super religious people. I identify as religious, myself, but more as a cultural and personal experience, and I think some of my mom’s attitude are outdated. (This is my own take, and I don’t judge anyone who is more or less religious than I. Everyone’s faith is their own.)   \n\nWIBTA for not disclosing to my parents where I’m living after my boyfriend and I move in together? ",

      "description": "My husband and I have just moved to Singapore and started living with my grandparents (it’s his parents’ place but his mom’s parents live there too). My grandfather-in-law has Parkinson‘s and it has gotten extremely bad the last few months when his medication is no longer as effective as it was before. For some reason, he managed to get his driver’s license renewed last year. \n\nHis driving was already bad 2 years ago when I married into the family and let him drive me since I didn’t know how bad his condition was. He nearly hit the gates while driving out and kept stopping way too late at every stop, usually ending up with half the car sticking past the line. He couldn’t even park straight, and the best he could do after more than 20 min of trying was to park the car at a 45° angle. \n\nWe’ve told him he can’t drive anymore and he claims he doesn’t, but we know he’s lying (car parked in a different spot, new dents on the car, etc.). A few months ago, he hit a stationary motorcyclist just because his reaction time is too slow, but the guy declined to press charges or call the police because he felt bad for the old man.\n\nHe’s really going to kill someone soon, but my in-laws’ stance is that it’s just a few more months until he has to retake his driving test, so we should just wait for him to fail that and that’ll put an end to his driving. However, that’s what they said last year, and somehow, he managed to pass the test. I really have no idea how that was possible since everyone in the family agreed he has not been fit to drive for years. \n\nMy mom-in-law insists he promised he won’t drive again anymore, but he’s been saying that for months and yet he keeps secretly driving. She’s getting really upset with my husband &amp; I for being “disrespectful” when we get upset about his lying and insists we need to be more understanding of how hard it is for “a man to lose his freedom”. \n\nI really want to report him to the police to get his license revoked, and maybe even get them to investigate the person who keeps letting him pass his driving tests, but even my husband thinks this would be too much of an asshole move.

      "description": "As context I am 19 years old M, my younger brother is 16 years old. He is in high school and I am in university. We both live at home with our strict black parents. We both live in Canada where the age to drink/smoke weed is 19. Some of this info may be unnecessary, but I am not really sure what kind of context you guys need to make your judgement.   \n\nMy parents are leaving for a week on vacation and leaving me and my brother at home alone. He wants to have his friends over and smoke/drink while they are gone.\n\nI don't want him to do this for multiple reasons. Firstly I don't want him to do this as him and his friends are all minors and I am the only adult there so if somehow the cops show up (I know unlikely) I will most likely get in a lot of trouble. Secondly I don't like the idea of lying to my parents as they are trusting me to make sure this kind of stuff does not happen. My parents and I have a pretty good relationship and I know if I let him do this and they found out they would never trust me. Lastly I don't want any of his friends to break stuff in our house or the neighbours asking my parents why people are coming over and have to worry about making up some lie to cover up (I guess this is the same as not wanting to lie).\n\nHe is saying that them coming over has no effect on me (which is kind of true) and that I am being a party pooper. I don't mind if he smokes/drinks at his friends but I don't feel comfortable with him doing this at our house.\n\nI choose not to smoke/drink (if that is relevent) but I don't care if others do. My main problem is with it happening at our house. Regardless I will get final say as to whether this happens or not, as if I tell him not to have them over he won't, but he might keep his plans to himself in the future (which is fine I guess).\n\nSo am AITA with a stick up his ass or are my reasons for wanting my brother to not have his friends over reasonable.",

      "description": "The title makes me seem like an asshole, but hear me out. If it turns out that I am an asshole, then I will accept my judgement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my parents are divorced (they have been as long as I can remember) and my mom raised me, my younger sister, and older brother mostly on her own. For a while (and to this day) my sister and I would visit my father on the weekends (my older brother didn't come since he and my dad weren't biologically related like me and my sister, and other reasons). He lived about two hours away from us, so he would pick us up and take us to his house. We'd stay there for the weekend and he'd drop us back at our house on Sunday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was in 2nd or 3rd grade my dad retired from the military. This didn't really change much, because we still only saw him on weekends, but I feel this should be mentioned. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I started 5th grade my mom, brother, sister and I moved in with my dad. This wasn't much of an issue for my dad, since the majority of the time he was never home (because of his job). When he was home (usually a weekend, but sometimes during the week) my mother would disappear and return a little before my father left for work (I don't remember what my brother would do, but I don't remember him being at the house when my dad was). So, basically I still only saw my dad on the weekend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring December my brother moved to Washington (long story) and nothing changed much other than my dad would care for us (my sister and I) during the week more often. This stays the same for most of sixth grade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, you may or may not be asking this question \"What about the summer and/or other breaks\". I spend summers in Washington with my grandma and other family, winter breaks are spent mostly with my mom (with my dad with us for a little less than a week). I spent spring breaks in NY with my dad and his side of the family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm gonna explain a little more about what we do when we're with my dad. He never really tried to bond with us. He would just take us to a movie or something and buy us stuff. I'm grateful that I have a father that cares for us, I just haven't built that relationship that a father and son should have. Most of the time it ends up being more brother-sister bonding than father-son bonding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never tried to forced myself to bond with him because: \n\n1) Before now I didn't realize how damaging it was to our relationship. \n\n2) I never felt I needed to because I barely see him anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I started this school year my mother moved with her boyfriend, two hours from where my dad lives. And where our mom goes, my sister and I must follow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently my father started noticing that I don't have a good relationship with him. He would text me and I wouldn't respond (Which I will admit is asshole-ish of me, but I've gotten better) and whenever we'd see him in person I don't talk to him or ask for advice.  Whenever we see him he always lectures me about how I'm ungrateful, and how I don't listen to him. My mother told me that I made him cry by not responding to his texts, so after that I tried to put more effort into responding to his texts. One weekend he told me that I don't treat him the same way I treat my mother, which is true since I spend much more of my time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI try really hard to treat him like a son should treat his father, but he makes it a bit difficult. I don't really like talking to people, and most of the time I just want to be alone. Even when I'm home, I spend most of my time in my room and only come out to eat or use the restroom. When he tries to bond with me when I'm in \"Leave me alone\" mode, it really annoys me (The same goes for my mother). Most of the time it's hard for me to even see him as my dad. I still love him, but I just have a hard time connecting with him like I should. Sometimes I feel like it's my fault because my sister has a great relationship with him, unlike me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother and sister make me feel like I'm the asshole here. So, am I the asshole? Is my dad the asshole? Are we both assholes?",

      "description": "Gonna be a very long post, sorry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Friend tries to help me psychologically, I don't think I need help. Told her I'm not her fucking research object and she should leave me the fuck alone unless she stops. Got called an asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst off some important information about myself. I'm male 25, never had a relationship, probably never will. I have issues (mental). Not going to say what exactly, but it should be enough to know that 1) you don't notice unless you know me very well and 2) it doesn't make me mentally unstable or dangerous (neither to others nor to myself) wor anything like that (the opposite if anything). Besides that I'm fairly successful at uni (and financially), I have friends that I see regularly and I'm quite healthy (physically)w\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, there is a girl from my uni who knows a bit more about me, since we've been in the same class (now course) since highschool (started there at 16 y.o.). As secondary subject she took psychology (will be mildly important later). She knows how I am and why I am like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently she's started to ask me to go out more (join her at pub/café/club, etc.). I don't mind going out from time to time, but it got so frequent that it started to become annoying (I often like to spend my evenings at home doing whatever shit I feel like doing, from programming to reading). Especially at bars and pubs she started pointing at women and asking me if I think they are hot and once even somehow brough back a girl from the dance floor (we had rented a couch) and then proceeded to be very pushy about getting me to come down and dance as well. I don't know why she (my friend) would do that, she knows I don't want hookups or dates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has led to me telling her I'm not interested in going out like that, and that if she wants to do something she'd better leave me alone with bullshit like that. She then told me that my attitude was unhealthy and that I could get over it if I just tried. Well... perhaps I could. The question is why would I? I'm doing perfectly fine right now and I get the added benefit of not having to go through any drama. It was probably a subconscious protection mechanism that made me who I am today, so I don't feel like destroying that protection and become vulnerable and miserable. I know it's cowardly, but I just don't see the benefit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, again, she knows why I'm like that, so she should know better than to try to change me. This is also where I might have been an asshole: I told her that I'm not her fucking psychology project test subject and that she should never ever try to get me somewhere again if she has any hidden motives. If I wanted help, I'd get it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was probably a bit mean. There is a reason why I've been friends with her for so long. She's kind and fun to be around, and I don't think she had any ill intentions. AITA?",

So, AITA for wanting my gf to make a little bit of time for me? We haven’t been able to be with just each other in a month and I just wanna spend time with my girl. ",

      "description": "Long one, so strap in, and thank you for your patience. \n\nI met ‘John’ through a mutual friend. He hosted a tabletop group that was looking for new players. I joined, and clicked really well with the group, one of them being the mutual friend. Since they were looking for more people, I invited 2 of my best friends, and my brother, all of whom were experienced players too. \n\nA couple months into the 1.5ish years we all played together, my brother and I started having table issues, mainly due to differing approaches to role playing in a group (the actual problem isn’t important, but the conflict itself is). A few other people in our 7 total people had issues with each other too, and John asked everyone individually what the problems are and what can be changed, with the express intent of getting everybody good with each other and getting back into the game properly. After collecting our answers, he instead called the game off completely.\n\nHe left everyone off with “while we all can’t get along in the same game, I still want to game with everyone in separate groups”. He told me directly that he would let me know when the next game was happening, and wanted to get together to paint some miniatures. A few months go by, and I hear nothing. \n\nAs I’m locked in radio silence with John, our mutual friend tells me that they’ve had a couple paint nights and started a new game since then. The reason I was given was that they “didn’t want to offend me or my brother by inviting one over the other”. Both of us aren’t bothered by that at all. He kept finding excuses not to ever have me around, but I still got invited to his and his wife’s bday parties, and his New Years party. \n\nFast forward a few more months, and my best friend want to get the group back together and record our sessions. We all agree, with the first order of business being to have a sit down lunch, talk about the game, and air out any issues we have. All of us players got our stressors out, and even my brother and I came to a mutual understanding of the mindset we would have with our characters. John did not contribute anything other than how we can streamline our gaming experience. \n\nWe leave happy, and get together for a character creation session the next week. We get their, and John is much more frazzled. He was edgy, and at one point, got into it with my brother over a rule. I broke that argument up, and it mainly involved getting my brother to drop the subject, cause he kept re-instigating the issue. \n\nIn the email chain after this, I was debating a home brew race with John, and he blew up, citing “people who can’t be mature” and saying “I expected more growth out of certain people”. \n\nI ended up emailing him directly, and jumped his shit about not being able to tell me directly if he has a problem with me. I called him out about trying to ghost me with gaming, and told him that if he doesn’t want to keep the friendship, or if he just doesn’t want me gaming with him, he needs to be upfront instead of telling everyone different reasons about why we “keep missing each other”. I also told him he doesn’t get to talk about maturity and growth when he throws a fit whenever someone disagrees with him. \n\nHe assured me that I wasn’t the problem, and my brother was, and that he always liked me more than my brother. He did admit that he still felt tension between my brother and I, and it was “bringing out the worst in” me.  He also doubled down that he was looking forward to gaming with me again, and he hopes everything works out. \n\nI talked to my best friend (the one who set up the new game) and told him everything that was said, and he informed me that his conversation with John prior to this game was that John preferred my brother over me, and all kinds of other shit that was the exact opposite of what I was told. We talked to my brother, who had gotten another story that contradicts ours. \n\nI let it sit for a week, and found out yesterday that John has proceeded to continue game prep without me, and my best friend was under the impression that John informed me of this decision. He had not. \n\nAt this point, I know that I am an asshole for HOW I emailed him. I could have talked to him much calmer from the outset. I think he is so afraid of conflict that he just tells people what they want to hear.  When I talked to my wife, she suggested that even bringing it up at all was in bad taste. Honestly, I’ve deleted his number and email, and have taken the stance that I don’t want to deal with someone who can’t be upfront with me. I’ve told him before that I wouldn’t be offended by him not wanting to hang out or game with me. My only offense taken is that he can’t just tell me. \n\nSo, finally, how do you all feel. \n\nAm I the asshole for emailing him to set things straight? Or only in how I did it?\n\nAnd am I an asshole for just dropping the friendship all together, and chalking it up to “shit happens”?\n\nThank you so much for your patience in reading this. ",

I would offer to drive her to planned parenthood or anything. I don't want to lose both of my best friends to teen pregnancy but I don't know if it's in my place to say something. On one hand I trust her completely and am good friends with him and on the other hand that's seems like a problem for Boyfriend and Girlfriend to have together.

I asked her if she wanted to break things off and she said \"yes, please.\"\n\nI was really bummed out, liked her a lot. Tried to always make her feel safe &amp; comfortable, showed a lot of affection by non-physical means. I went no contact on her to get over it ASAP, and during this time I moved on to a point where she doesn't interest me anymore, at all.\n\nCouple months later she wrote me and told me \"she was waiting,\" I was confused and asked her \"for what?\" She said I became really important and she feels lonely and I was the first person she could open up to and be vulnerable to. Said she needs me, cries a lot thinking about me.  She asked me to go back to old ways and at least be her friend again, be vulnerable/open with her again.\n\nThe thing is... I just... don't care about her anymore at all. I think it's part of my coping mechanism. Also, she lives in another city now and I've never been the type to chat a lot.

      "description": "For context, I know how it feels to be overweight. I used to be 65 pounds above what I should have been, and I lost that through maintaining my diet and exercising. I know how unhealthy being obese is, and how hard it is to stop.\n\n My friend has complete access to a good diet (his parents buy plenty of healthy food for themselves) and he literally lives 200 feet from a gym he has access to, but still doesn't do anything. I'm concerned because he is over 240 pounds and is only 5 feet 10 inches, which is an obese BMI. His diet mostly consists of fast food that his parents buy specifically for him, and he doesn't want to start working out or eating right. Keep in mind, last year he only weighed 180 pounds and was still 5 foot 10.\n\nI recently moved away, so I can't motivate him or try to help him physically, which is why I bring up his weight so much. I got him to go to the gym with me once, but he just stopped after 1 session (he did half a mile of walking, which I was proud of because he tried). The worst part is that he is completely ignorant of all of the health problems, and justifies his health by saying that he \"doesn't look overweight\".\n\nI want to be able to get through to him, so I keep bringing up his weight problem and how he can help it. I'm not suggesting drastic change; i tell him to drink diet soda instead of regular, or to eat fast food 1 less day a week. Now all of our conversations are a minefield in which he takes offense to any mention of weight, food, or exercise.\n\nAm I the asshole for trying to help him avoid this lifestyle, or am I being too pushy?

My ex had sent a text asking if her friend from home could spend the weekend at the house in our group chat. Now her friend has never liked me but I figured for one weekend I could spend it up in my room playing RDR2 so I said sure! So far so good right? \n\nWell my other girl roommate (GR) was leaving town for the weekend and asked me to watch her dog. Not a problem, I love her dog! Well then I get a text from my ex asking if her friend could bring her two dogs with her and wanted to know how both my dog and GR’s dog would react to two strange dogs in the back yard. Well at this point I had a slight problem with it. Both dogs were rescued found on the street and tend to not like other dogs. Even getting them together at first was a little touch and go but after a couple months they are inseparable. I told my ex that it might not be a good idea for her friend to bring her two dogs because both dogs that live in the house don’t get along with other dogs. Well the shit hit the fan and she got PISSED! Started yelling and throwing dishes at me saying I was ruining her life. She proceeded to say her friend wasn’t going to be able to come unless she was able to bring her dogs and I said “well I guess your friend won’t be able to come this weekend then darlin”. Well I just over heard her on the phone telling her friend I said she couldn’t come and I was being a complete ass about it all and being unreasonable. So Reddit, am I the asshole? ",

But I have an active social life and enough money to go out/save etc.\n\nToday he was sad because he only has $30 left for the month- but he spent $20 on weed yesterday. I sat him down and told him that he needs to think about how much he's spending on weed, that it isn't a necessity, that he's using it to escape from his problems, that he seems addicted. Now he's angry at me for 'making him feel inferior', saying that he is 'an addict who doesn't even have any money'.\n\nAm I being too controlling here? I mean it's his life in the end. In the end it is a bit selfish as it would be easier for me if he could afford to do more things. And I do smoke (probably too much) myself. But I would like him to be happy.\n\nMaybe I didn't handle it in a sensitive way. AITA?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "This is a long one, apologies. \n\nI haven't spoken to my housemate (let's call him L) in a week. \n\nA background story: We're both second years in university and have lived together (along with 2 other girls - both 19 - and another guy - 20) for the entire 2 years we've been at uni together.\n\nNow L has always been pretty inconsiderate as a housemate, he doesn't clean up after himself AT ALL, dirty plates and cutlery of his will be on the kitchen side for 2+ weeks before he eventually either washes it himself, or someone else gives in and they'll wash it, he makes messes over the hobs and sides whilst he cooks and won't clean it up, he frequently will just leave his rubbish on the side and someone else will have to put it in the bin. I'm not going to act like the rest of us don't all do these things sometimes, of course we do, we're students and 4/5 of us also work part-time so of course between uni work and our jobs somethings are going to slack sometimes, but he just never does anything. (L used to work weekends at a national park but they don't need him over the winter, so he hasn't worked since the beginning of November and won't work again until March - he also spent all his overdraft going travelling over the summer and spent most of his student loan on take out food and weed)\n\nLast year we lived in a flat (same 5 of us, plus a 3rd year - 21M - and another guy in our year) and, aside from making a few flat meals - think maybe 10 in a year - L treated the rest of us like maids, this was particularly the case for me (B), our housemate M, and our housemate R. The kitchen would get absolutely horrific before it would be cleaned, with the vast majority of this mess coming from L, and L helped with this maybe twice. Once I wasn't even in the flat for a weekend, I had gone to visit my bestfriend at her uni over 150 miles away for three days and when I returned R and M (with very little help from L) were cleaning the kitchen, so of course the first thing I did was begin to help. A separate time it took R and I (M was at work) 3.5 hours to fully deep clean the kitchen with absolutely no help from L (he was locked in his room the entire time, came in twice for food and completely ignored us cleaning).\n\nOver Christmas last year all of us went home for a little bit, and before leaving we all made sure the kitchen was clean and our own things were clean because we didn't want to come back to the kitchen being horrible and mouldy food. L was the last to leave and first to come back, in total he only went home for maybe 4 days, whilst the rest of us were home for a week or two. So aside from L, I was the first to return to the flat and since I live over 200 miles from the university I attend, my mum was the one who picked me up and drove me there again. So my mum and I walk into the flat, and the first door leads to the kitchen, so after putting my bags in my room we both went in the kitchen to make some drinks, boy was that a mistake. The entire kitchen was disgusting, the floors were sticky and covered with crumbs and small pieces of food, the bins were full and overflowing with rubbish all on the floor (not in bin bags, just on the floor) there were dirty plates on the side and a glass casserole dish that had dried up pasta bake inside that was growing mould, the sinks were both full of plates and one also was full of water, neither of us could work out how long the water had been there considering it was grey, opaque, and had mould growing on it. My mum and I were both disgusted and spent hours cleaning the kitchen before we could go and get a food shop for me. This entire time L stayed locked in his room and didn't answer the door or even make a sound if either of us knocked/called through the door. I know for a fact he was in there though because 6 or so hours later he came out. When I went home for two weeks over Easter, my mum and I returned to almost the exact same situation where L hadn't gone home, except this time it was in 25°C heat in a kitchen that had an entire wall that was windows, so the entire kitchen smelt like hot rotting garbage.\n\nSo after all of this, when we moved into a house at the beginning of second year, we made some rules which included each housemate having a particular job (singular if it was a big thing, plural if they were smaller jobs) and Ls only job was to be cleaning the bathroom. We share one bathroom between 5 of us, so obviously this is a job that needs to be done once a week to once a fortnight (if it's not too bad and L has some assignments), and this cleaning of the bathroom involves mopping/sweeping the floors, cleaning the sink, the side, the toilet, emptying the bin, and cleaning the bath/shower. We have been living in this house since August and L has cleaned the bathroom approximately 4 times. If any of us ask, he will brush it off and say he'll do it later, snap at us to fuck off, or completely ignore us. He still makes a load of mess in the kitchen, and won't wash his plates and things up, he also smokes cigs and weed in his room which in turn makes the hallway stink and then gets arsey if M and I complain about it because we don't like the smell of either (neither of us have any problem with him smoking, so long as he does it outside).\n\nSo, after all that, let's get to the main crux of the story (again, apologies for the length, I'm just fuming and am ranting). Our house is a student house, and therefore comes with all the \"quirks\" a student house comes with, including walls highly susceptible to mould/condensation, some questionably working appliances, even more questionable landlords/renting agencies, absolutely no insulation, and a speciality of the area we go to university in, this happens in private houses and everything too, a minor slug infestation. We've salted and everything and haven't had a slug issue since September, don't worry. But yeah, our heating isn't the best, and until yesterday the lounge radiator wasn't working which meant with no insulation the lounge was an unliveable temperature, with the rest of the house not being much warmer. We don't have a tumble dryer, only clothes airers and since our house is cold most of the time our clothes take forever to dry.\n\nNow M and L did a load of laundry each, and then both hung it up on two airers in our bathroom, and left it there to dry. A day or so later, I also did a load of laundry (without realising theirs was on the airers), I was considerate about this and wanted their clothes to dry and so I left my wet laundry in a basket in the bathroom to be hung up. A week later, their clothes were finally dry, except since mine had been wet and not hung out for a week they smelt damp and horrible, so I took M and Ls clothes off the airers and up to their rooms, before rewashing my clothes and hanging them out. I used both airers doing this, which I realise is a bit annoying, but I had waited 3 weeks by this point to do a load of laundry because everytime I said I was going to do one, someone else needed one more (think dirty work clothes and no clean ones, etc.) and besides both of these airers actually belong to me anyway. Less than two full days later, L took all of my clothes off the airers in front of M. M asked him whether they were dry, knowing they hadn't been there very long and he said \"yes\" as well as telling me they were dry, so he took them up to my room in a bag and left them there.\n\nSince I had 2 large assignments due in and a test that week, I left my clothes in the bag in my room for 4 or 5 days, until I had the time to be able to put them away, because I was trusting that L was honest when he said they were dry. That finally brings us to last Thursday, where I had the time to put my clothes away and began to do so, only to find out that the 3 pieces of clothing on top were the only dry clothes in the entire bag. All the rest of the clothes were still completely soaked through and, of course, smelt terrible because of how long they had been sat there. \n\nI messaged the house groupchat giving L a piece of my mind and telling him how inconsiderate and how big of a dick he was for taking my clothes off the airer when I had left his and Ms on there for over a week and had already had to rewash this load of clothes because of that, and now had to rewash the load again. I'm furious at L for being so inconsiderate and rude and lying to both M and I about my clothes being dry. He read every message and ignored them all, didn't apologise over message or face to face, and avoided me from last Thursday until this Wednesday. \n\nWhen he saw me on Wednesday he said hi and acted like nothing had happened. I ignored him. M also was ignoring him Wednesday - Wednesday for a different reason, however spoke to him yesterday and then told me that when her and R (my boyfriend) had brought up my laundry L had said \"oh thats why she's ignoring me\" and then acted like he hadn't done anything wrong, so M doesn't think I'll get an apology. \n\nI'm furious because that is the final incident that shows just how little respect he has for me as a person, and despite the fact that he is disgusting this entire time I have been considering him a friend. He's treated me like a maid (worse than that to be honest, at least they get paid) for a year and a half, and has continuously shown the absolute lack of respect he has for all of us, but particularly M and I, and this is the final straw for me. Whilst not talking to him he had left all of his dirty plates and things on the side for 10+ days again, so I had finally had enough and put all of them back in his cupboard whilst still dirty. He found out the other day, took everything out and left it on the side for 2 days again before washing it, then asked M and R who put it in there and R told him it was me. L then started bitching that it had onl",

      "description": "I love my sister a lot, but she has a very annoying habit of getting extremely offended by jokes and memes. There was a kid who posted on his meme Instagram account some really weird meme that had a swastika in it. My sister got really pissed off, reported the meme to Insta, and even confronted the kid about the meme. I told her that she was overreacting, and we had a whole heated debate over who was right. She does this for any joke that has remotely anti-feminist, racist or mental disability themes.\n\nIn this day and age, offensive memes have become the norm, and honestly I find a lot of them to be pretty funny. I support her for being a feminist and justice warrior, but when she attacks anyone who tells an offensive joke, I feel like she is fighting the wrong battles by attacking these joke tellers instead of the real villains. \n\nFurthermore, she is entering high school next year, and I don’t want her to get a reputation as a stuck up, easily offended SJW, or have people going out of their way to try to offend her. According to her, she already has this reputation at her school. \n\nAITA for telling my sister to stop confronting people whose jokes she finds offensive?",
